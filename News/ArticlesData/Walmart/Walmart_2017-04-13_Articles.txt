(Source: WISN/CNN/Humane Animal Welfare Society) WAUKESHA, WI (WISN/CNN) - An elderly man was fired from his job as a Walmart greeter for the improper handling of a turkey which walked into the store. “It starts and it goes back, and then it walks out,” Bob Tallinger said of the turkey. Tallinger explains the moment a wild turkey walked right past him at the Waukesha Walmart. In his eight years as a greeter at the store, he'd never seen anything like it. Then he was fired. "I say what for?  ‘Well you should have helped get that turkey out of here,"’ he says he was told. The 88-year-old man was told he should have alerted a manager about the turkey in the store.  Tallinger's wife defended her husband. “He was hired to be a greeter and that's what he did. He never saw a book of rules that said if a wild turkey comes in here, you better run and get management,” his wife Janet said.  Local Walmart staff didn’t want to talk about the firing. Janet Tallinger says her husband's termination is unfair. "Granted, he's gotten older and granted he's lost a little memory, but nevertheless, that hasn't prevented him from being an excellent greeter,” she said. She says her husband is the most popular person at the Walmart and loved working as a greeter. What he'll miss most?  "People. There's a lot of people I know," he said.  Copyright 2017 WISN via CNN.

Walmart India is gearing up to roll out more stores from the first quarter of the next financial year, says its president and chief executive officer, Krish Iyer. On the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme, Iyer shared his views with a select group of journalists, including Sudipto Dey of Business Standard, on the global retail major's various India initiatives. Edited excerpts: When you joined in 2014, Walmart's India project was going through some turbulence. How have the past three years been in terms of what you set out to achieve? Walmart India became a 100 per cent subsidiary of Walmart Stores International from January 2014. The past three years were good. Our focus was on building a strategy for our cash-and-carry business, creating growth plans for the next few years, and setting the agenda for the right way of doing business. There was a lot of focus on compliance and (having) robust processes within the business. Overall, we have built the foundation for a pipeline of stores for future growth. We have done well in all these measures. We are ready to roll out more stores on the ground from early next year. We have 21 stores, and are on track to have 50 by 2021. As we speak, we have 16 stores in the pipeline, at various stages of development. Are you looking at presence in any state other than where you are present? Our major focus has been on states where we are already present. So, the new stores will be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. We are currently not looking at new states but have been studying Karnataka with a lot of interest. A deeper penetration in existing states makes better business sense. How much of what is sold in India is being sourced from within the country? Local sourcing makes a lot of sense from economics point of view. Imports are expensive. Safely, 97 per cent of what we sell in our stores is locally procured. Locally produced goods have a lot of demand with our customers, namely the kirana stores. Has Walmart India taken any call on whether it wants to enter the food retail space (which was opened up for 100 per cent FDI last year)? It (100 per cent FDI) is a good initiative towards helping farmers double their income. It will reduce food wastage and help in development of cold storage backend. We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time will look at that sector. How ready is Walmart India for GST from July 1? As soon as the rates are announced, we would be 100 per cent ready. The preparation is in progress. It is also important to help our partners in the whole process. Many of our partners are small and medium enterprises and regional suppliers. Helping and educating them is also an important part of the agenda. What is the idea behind Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme? Are there plans to increase the number of woman suppliers in the supply chain? The focus of the women entrepreneurship programme has been on depth and not scale. We have taken 32 women-owned businesses as part of the nine-month programme that initially started as a pilot. Strategically, it works well for Walmart India to have a pipeline of women suppliers in the ecosystem. When women become entrepreneurs, their social status in the country also goes up. We currently have around 50 women suppliers in our ecosystem - around nine from this group are getting on board. We started in 2015 with the target of doubling the sourcing (from women suppliers) from the India market. We will launch another programme this year to take this forward. One of the researches done by Walmart in the United States a couple of years ago showed that products from women-owned business were perceived to be of higher quality by the customers. We launched a woman-owned business logo and put it on these products and the shelf. We found customers had greater liking for these products. From that point of view, supporting women-owned business is a strategic initiative and makes good business sense. As part of increasing gender diversity in India, we have been able to increase women participation at the store level to 16 per cent across all our stores. Our target is to have 25 per cent women store managers over the next five years. © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Mrs. Funnybones makes a case for Google Pixel Advertising Going to market, the Nadia Chauhan way...

He recently noted to investors that the retail giant in six major business units posted steeper rollbacks in February and March. Hood said in grocery, which accounts for 56% of U.S. sales, price rollbacks averaged between 25%-26% in the past two months. In January the average rollback was 24%. Hood said the rollbacks are much deeper in other categories. For example, household essentials had price rollbacks of 43% in March compared to 39% in February. In food, BMO found average price reductions of 18%. He said baby and beauty categories were also seeing increased promotional activity in March, compared to the prior two months. With shelves stocked for Easter, Hood said Walmart U.S. has also aggressively priced seasonal products such as baskets, candy and other Easter items. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon has made it clear the retailer will win on price and will continue to pressure suppliers for their absolute lowest cost. Still Walmart U.S. is routinely higher on produce and dairy than low cost grocery Aldi. And in other markets Kroger, Publix and H-E-B are tough competitors for Walmart U.S. grocery. Hood said the data trend on deeper price reductions has raised concerns for the first quarter same-store-sales forecast of 1.5%, which is slightly above consensus at 1.3% He said it looks as if Walmart U.S. could be closer to the low end or even below its own guidance of 1%. BMO Capital expects Wal-Mart shares to underperform the market with a $63 price target. The firm reiterated that rating on April 7. PRICE INVESTMENTS Other investor groups are also watching the grocery price war between Walmart U.S. and Kroger. Barclays conducted its own grocery pricing research between Walmart U.S. and Kroger that has been escalating for several months in certain markets. Recent price checks between the two grocers in Nashville, Tenn., found Walmart’s groceries were about 4% less expensive than the same products sold at Kroger. The pricing survey checked a basket of 78 items sold in each store and Barclays found Walmart offered lower prices on 74% if the items checked. One area where Kroger won out over Walmart was in “fresh” which includes, dairy and vegetables. Barclays said Kroger was 3.3% cheaper in the “fresh” category mostly because of promotional items. Without the promotion, Walmart was 15% less expensive, according to Barclays. In non perishables and frozen items Walmart prices were 5.6% less expensive than Kroger’s on average in this survey. Barclays analysts said Kroger is likely to feel the brunt of a price war and despite being a solid grocery operator keeping up with Walmart’s price investments may be difficult to overcome. Barclays is “overweight” on its recommendation of Wal-Mart Stores projecting a target share price of $82. In the highly competitive Florida market, Raymond James & Associates recently conducted a pricing comparison between Walmart U.S., Target, Publix as well as Amazon Prime Now in the Tampa Bay area. When looking at the branded baskets of goods Raymond James found Target moving closer to Walmart’s prices. For instance branded basket savings were 5.1% cheaper at Walmart than Target in March, compared to 5.6% in February. The branded basket savings gap between Walmart and Publix increased by 0.3% in March to 20.8%. This study found Walmart to have consistent savings on branded items when compared against Target and Publix. When comparing against Amazon Prime Now the analysts found Walmart to be $18.63 cheaper than Amazon on a branded basket of 35 items. The study found Amazon to be cheaper on six items and priced the same as Walmart on four other products. Kelloggs Frosted Flakes were 65 cents cheaper with Amazon, and a 12-pack of Coca Cola was 68 cents cheaper. However the vast majority of items from Tide laundry detergent to Tyson Frozen Chicken Nuggets were cheaper at Walmart. Raymond James is bullish on Wal-Mart shares giving the company a “strong buy” rating with a target price range of $72 to $82. GROWTH OPPORTUNITY While analysts are aware of margin compression among competitive food retailers, Moody’s said the sector should see decent growth opportunity this year. Moody’s analyst Mickey Chadha expects U.S. supermarket sector operating profits to grow as much as 8% this year as deflationary pressures abate. Last year operating profits in the segment dropped 5%, Chadha said that won’t be the case in 2017 as growth begins to accelerate in the back half of this year. Moody’s now expects food at-home prices to rise about 1% in 2017, relieving some of the pressure on supermarkets’ top-line. Despite competition from online grocery, Chadha said the overall food retail market is expected to grow an average of 2%-3% annually. Online food purchases accounted for just 1% of U.S. food retail last year. Chadha expects to see further consolidation in the supermarket industry as regional chains expand their geographic reach and unprofitable stores are divested or shuttered. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) closed Thursday (April 13) at $73.42, down 29 cents. Over the past 52 weeks the share price has ranged between $62.72 and $75.19.

Order online, pickup at Walmart for like $2 off. Image: scott olson/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe2017-04-12 04:01:00 UTC In the fight for online shoppers, Walmart has one thing Amazon doesn't: stores. Lots of em. The retail giant is taking advantage of its one upper hand with a new way to get discounts when you shop online. For 10,000 of the most popular items sold only on Walmart.com, you'll get a discount if you ship them to a local Walmart store instead of to your own address.  "This is consistent with Walmart's long heritage," said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce and the founder of Walmart's acquisition Jet.com.  The discounts — a few dollars on online-only items so far including car seats, toys, and TVs — will be available starting April 19. Eventually, Walmart plans to roll out discounts for in-store pickup to 1 million products.  The pickup discount on a car seat on Walmart.com. Image: walmart When Walmart in August acquired Lore's Jet.com — which was basically the only real U.S. competitor to Amazon — the big box store signaled its intention to take on the tech giant. Walmart introduced free two-day shipping in January on purchases of $35 and up. That move put the company on equal footing with Amazon for customers who don't have Prime memberships.  The "last mile" of delivery — to a customer's exact address — is usually the most expensive part for mega-retailers like Walmart. Avoiding that final cost will allow Walmart to lower its own costs and provide the discounts for pickup.  "We do believe this is unique to Walmart — the ability to have 4,700 points of pickup," Lore said.  Amazon doesn't have actual stores (besides a bookstore and grocery store or two), but it does have Amazon Lockers, where you can ship your order to a predetermined Amazon location instead of your own address.

Associated Press Crime April 13, 2017 6:22 PM Ten years ago, he set off a bomb in an NC Walmart. Here’s how they caught him. By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story It took 10 years – and a lone fingerprint on a Walmart shopping cart – to catch convicted bomber Larry Bowlsby. Now he’s got 10 years to serve. On Thursday, a federal judge in Asheville sent the 49-year-old Missouri man to prison for setting off a pipe bomb in 2007. His target: the Walmart store in tiny Sylva, a picturesque mountain town west of Asheville. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the bomb was placed strategically by the propane cylinders in the camping supplies section of the store. Five people were injured, and the store was damaged. A surveillance video showed a man, accompanied by a teenage girl and boy entering the store. The man took the bomb out of the girl’s backpack, put it in his shopping cart, then parked the cart near the camping stoves. After the bomb went off, the threesome left the store, joined by a woman in a Mercury Marquis, and drove away, court documents say. Prosecutors say the bomber in the video was Bowlsby – they just didn’t know his name yet. He was joined by his son and his stepdaughter, while his wife waited in the car. Investigators did get one early break: They came across a fingerprint on the shopping cart, documents say. But when they ran it through the national crime database, they didn’t get a match. Not yet anyway. Fast forward a year: A Colorado state trooper pulls over a blue Mercury. There’s a man, a woman and two teenagers inside, documents say. There are also four tennis balls that have been turned into bombs with black powder, tape and fuses. A suspect, Larry Dean Bowlsby, is arrested and later pleads guilty to the related charges, documents say. More importantly for our story, officers also took his fingerprints. Eight years later and 1,500 miles east, North Carolina investigators are still gummed up by the unsolved Sylva bombing case. That is, until they happen to run the old print they lifted from the shopping cart. This time they get a match. Bowlsby pleaded guilty in October. Investigators also learned that Bowlsby and his family displayed what might be described as a criminal brand loyalty to the Walmart chain. Between 2009 and 2014, he or his children were arrested or detained for shoplifting incidents in the discount stores in Oregon, South Dakota, Nevada and Wyoming.

 How Walmart and Target can top Amazon on drone delivery Stephanie Pandolph, Jonathan Camhi and Peter Newman Apr. 13, 2017, 5:14 PM 1,486 facebook linkedin twitter email print Among big retailers, Amazon has pushed the potential of drone delivery the hardest. But, according to BI Intelligence’s exclusive analysis of data from The Weather Company, the e-commerce giant isn’t the best positioned to take advantage of drones’ promise. Instead, its brick-and-mortar rivals, Walmart and Target, may be poised to reap the biggest gains. That’s important because drone delivery is a key part of Amazon’s strategy to extend its massive lead in e-commerce. Fast and free shipping are the top services that attract US consumers to shop online more frequently, and drones could help Amazon slash delivery costs to less than $1 a package by eliminating fuel and labor costs, according to a 2015 analysis by ARK Investment Management. It could also bring same-day (or faster) delivery to more customers.  BI Intelligence Walmart and Target are nowhere near Amazon when it comes to e-commerce. In fact, while both have posted respectable growth, there’s little indication they are gaining ground: Amazon's total online sales last year topped $96 billion. Target reported $3.1 billion in online sales last year, only about 4% of its overall sales.  Walmart doesn’t report total online sales anymore, but they totaled $13.7 billion in 2015, accounting for just 3% of revenue, according to Internet Retailer estimates. This has translated to sluggish overall growth for both retailers. Walmart’s total revenue grew just 0.8% during its last fiscal year ending January 2017, and Target’s grew 0.9% from 2015 to 2016. Meanwhile, Amazon’s retail revenue increased nearly 25% last year. BI Intelligence Anything that could help widen (or shrink) that gap has huge potential ramifications for retail. Fortunately for Walmart and Target, the key to cashing in on the disruptive potential of drones and checking Amazon’s advantage in cutting-edge technology is something they have: lots and lots of stores. These legacy retailers’ extensive networks of stores put them in a better position than Amazon to go all in on drone delivery, according to data from The Weather Company that covers more than 3 million Walmart and Target visitors.  BI Intelligence That’s because a drone’s effective range is pretty small. And a big share of Walmart and Target customers live close to one of their stores — especially compared to the percentage of Americans who live within such range of Amazon’s fulfillment centers. That’s crucial to drone delivery’s prospects for success.  About 49% of Weather Company app users who visited a US Walmart location during Q1 2017 live within six miles of a Walmart store, a deliverable range for a drone. And 15.1% of purchases at Walmart are under $10, according to Perfect Price. Most of these purchases are likely light enough to deliver by drone. Meanwhile, 47% of Weather Company app users who visited a US Target location during Q1 2017 live within a deliverable range, and 14.6% of purchases at Target are similarly under $10. Amazon reports that 44% of Americans live within 20 miles of one of its fulfillment centers — but that’s too far for today’s drones. In fact, the drones Amazon is testing in the UK only have a range of 15 miles round-trip. So Amazon will need to either build more fulfillment centers, or come up with another strategy, in order to fully embrace drone delivery. BI Intelligence To be sure, store-launched drone deliveries could prove a powerful tool in helping Walmart and Target boost online sales and close the gap with Amazon. But significant challenges remain — for example, stores will likely have to be redesigned to accommodate drones and new staff hired to manage them. As part of its UK testing, Amazon had to overhaul one of its own fulfillment centers by building an automated track to transport drones through the facility so employees could load them up with packages for delivery. What’s more, the retail chains will have to figure out how to track and manage inventory in new ways to account for drone deliveries. Many retailers already have issues with inventory management when implementing in-store fulfillment options for e-commerce purchases, which often deplete stocks when retailers need to take items off shelves to fulfill online orders. There are plenty of unanswered questions about drone delivery. How much will it cost to implement? Will consumers embrace it? And the big one — what about regulation? But if these can be resolved, it could be an opportunity for Walmart and Target to radically boost online revenue. Because of their massive store networks, they might even beat Amazon to the punch and keep their online rival from soaring out of sight.

Business MPR News Staff · Apr 13, 2017 Listen Intelligence Squared debate: 'Long Live Walmart' Apr 12, 2017 50min 31sec Customers outside Walmart. Sam Harper | MPR News Walmart is the country's largest private-sector employer. Which has made it a target of both praise and criticism. Does the big-box retailer push out small businesses and use cheap foreign labor? Or does it provide lots of American jobs and sell affordable goods to consumers? Experts took on these questions in an Intelligence Squared debate using the motion: 'Long live Walmart.' For the motion: John Tierney, Contributing Editor at the City Journal and Richard K. Vedder, an economist and author of "The Wal-Mart Revolution." Against the motion: Amy Traub, Associate Director of Policy and Research at Demos and Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor at UC Santa Barbara and author of "The Retail Revolution." Opening statement: For the motion In a New York Times column, John Tierney challenged readers to name an organization who has done more than Walmart to help the world's poor. "I still haven't heard a plausible candidate," he said. By selling its products at low prices, Walmart saves a typical American family approximately $2,500 a year, Tierney said. Walmart is also a pipeline for redistributing wealth to poorer countries, providing factory jobs for those living in poverty around the world. "Now, since 1990 when Walmart became the largest retailer in America, the global rate of poverty has been cut by two-thirds," Tierney said. The reason people don't like Walmart boils down to snobbery, its size making it a target for lawyers and its tendency to challenge special interests, he said. Local stores don't like Walmart because they don't want to match prices, and unions are challenged by the competition it presents — Walmart employees make comparable wages to these workers but don't have to pay dues. "So, don't believe all the propaganda you've heard against Walmart and don't assume that all its critics have pure motives," he said. Opening statement: Against the motion "Walmart's business model is pretty simple," said Amy Traub. "The company pays its workers poverty wages. It offers few benefits and it manipulates workers' hours and understaffs its stores." That model is expanding the gap between the extremely wealthy and everyone else in America. Walmart's workers bear the brunt of these low wages, but it also has an affect on tax payers, Traub said, because these workers don't make enough to support themselves they often have to rely on government programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Other big retailers, like Costco, have proven that it is possible to pay your workers livable wages and still provide competitive prices, she added. Economies thrive when people have money to spend on the basics. Walmart's business model will not be sustainable in the future, and isn't worthy of one, Traub said. "If you agree that there's a better, more equitable way to operate a business in this country, you should vote no, against the proposition." To listen to the debate, click the audio player above.

Analyst Ravi Shanker at Morgan Stanley said Wal-Mart's move marks "a seminal event" in the evolution of last-mile parcel delivery for e-commerce. "This announcement shows that [Wal-Mart] has realized that omnichannel logistics is significantly cheaper than individual parcel delivery and that moves of this nature will allow brick-and-mortar stores to see if customers prefer price or convenience," Shanker wrote in a note to clients. Given UPS's and FedEx's exposure to non-Amazon.com Inc. e-commerce businesses, he believes a shift to click-and-collect model could have a large impact on package delivery companies. Shanker rates UPS underweight, saying the company faces more risk than FedEx, which he rates equal weight. UPS's stock, which shed 1.4% Wednesday after Wal-Mart's announcement, slipped 0.1% on Thursday toward a 10-month closing low. FedEx shares tumbled 3.5% Wednesday and fell another 0.5% on Thursday. UPS shares have lost 9.1% year to date, while FedEx's stock has lost 0.5% and the S&P 500 has gained 4.4%. Continue Reading Below Copyright © 2017 MarketWatch, Inc.

Here is commentary on what the new initiative means for Walmart in terms of last-mile delivery as well as its competitors.   “Last-mile delivery makes up 28% of the costs of delivery alone. Walmart knows this all too well and is turning to buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS) to reduce this costly expense with its new Pickup Discount program. Not only is the company reducing the hit to its profits by minimizing its delivery costs, but Walmart is further setting themselves apart from Amazon by connecting its purchase data across all channels and utilizing its physical stores to its advantage as local distribution centers – something Amazon is not in a position to do.    Furthermore, Walmart is driving the online shopper into the physical store, where they are well positioned to drive incremental sales. The DynamicAction Retail Index shows an increase of 138% in orders using express shipping so far in 2017 compared to 2016 – meaning that more than ever, consumers are willing to pay to get their packages now.     Walmart’s Pickup Discount program allows consumers to get their package when they want it and to save money. This is a win-win for the consumer and a strategic advantage for Walmart as they begin to sync their Jet.com acquisition to calculate these savings for customers and distance themselves from Amazon by better leveraging their unique physical store footprint.”  - Sarah Engel, chief marketing officer, DynamicAction     “Through this move Wal-Mart is answering consumers’ call of convenience when it comes to their fulfillment options as well as building their customers’ loyalty by rewarding them with select discounts if they choose to buy online and ship to a local store. It’s a win-win for Wal-Mart as they continue to provide an array of fulfillment options yet utilize BOPIS to drive in-store traffic and make their physical store the hub for their entire retail operation.    It also offers consumers a new way to receive online-only items previously only available through ship-to-home fulfillment. A recent Kibo study asked 3,000 consumers what they look for in terms of fulfillment and their answers were highly correlated with overall convenience for the consumer. For example, survey respondents answered that saving on shipping costs overtook getting the product at the time the consumer wants as the #1 reason for using BOPIS. However convenience and saving time are still top reasons.    Additionally, nearly half of consumers said they will remain loyal to a retailer if buy online, BOPIS is available and 66% said providing multiple fulfillment options such as BOPIS, would drive them to complete their purchase. At the end of the day it is about convenience for the consumer and Wal-Mart is doing its part to amp up its strategy to adhere to this need.”  - Tushar Patel, chief marketing officer, Kibo Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented No credit card, no debit card?

Take, for example, the type of data that credit card companies have at their disposal. Access to Visa's database would essentially provide a real time window on the entire economy. This raises interesting questions about how, when and if certain data should be used. Visa makes billions and billions from its core business, and while it could doubtless make more money from its data, it's probably not worth the risk. Tammer Kamel, founder and CEO of Quandl, a technology company that provides a plethora of data sets to financial institutions, said Visa is rightly paranoid about the sort of headlines that imprudent monetization of transaction data could generate. "Imagine a headline saying: 'Visa selling your information to greedy hedge funds on Wall Street'. They know there is money to be made by extracting insights from the data, but the risk/return profile is scary. Sure they can maybe make an extra $50 million, $100 million or even half-a-billion dollars, but that's still small compared to their core revenue and going through that process puts their reputation at risk. This is something these guys are wrestling with right now." Quandl has more than 100,000 users, including lots of data scientists from banks and hedge funds, and over the years Kamel has gathered plenty of insight into the data business. He also pointed out that card providers and payment processors are paid a lot of money by major retail outfits like Walmart. If card providers were to turn around and start letting the outside world infer how sales were going at Walmart that would be a huge betrayal. "Wall Street would love to see all the credit card transactions that are happening at Walmart and work out how Walmart is doing. But if Visa ever released that, Walmart would be livid," he said. Quandl provides well-structured data, the sort analysts like, via its application program interface, so it's available decoupled from other software or hardware such as Bloomberg terminals. This means users can easily run their own machine learning analytics on it. Quandl's data sets feature everything from alcohol consumption per capita in Albania to building control permissions across the U.S. "We have a big data set that is essentially all the building permit data in the U.S., broken down by regions and cities and counties, and the sort of building permits people are applying for — is it residential, is it commercial, are they putting in elevators, are they putting in pools. "A nice, big, hairy data set, and if you analyze it you can learn all kinds of interesting things about what's happening in the economy right now, because of course construction is a very important part of the economy." Financial institutions are constantly searching for new alternative data sources; once the rest of the market gets hold of something exotic that works, it quickly gets priced in and will no longer generate alpha. One extremely nascent, big and potentially very hairy flow of data could be captured from the Internet of Things (IoT), which promises billions of extra devices connected to the internet by 2020, endlessly "talking" to each other. Regarding IoT data, Kamel said he is "super-intrigued" and watchful, but again he cited ownership issues. For example, in the Midwest many farms have smart tractors or sensors in the ground feeding back data about the quality of their soil. "The sensors send data to a server, and that server does some analysis and goes back to the farmer and says, you need to use this kind of fertilizer in these areas and at these quantities to improve your soil quality and meet your yields. "The point is, these companies are getting this data from all over the Midwest and implicitly they know the quality of all the fields that are growing corn this year. This means they have a good sense of what the corn yield will be like this year — which of course Wall Street investors would love to know. "It's a beautiful IoT data set, but extracting the value is a challenge because who owns that data? Technically it's the farmers' private information." Tammer Kamel, CEO, Quandl Photo: IBT UK In a situation like this the data sourcing party would need to negotiate bureaucratic challenges, such as how to compensate all the farmers. "I think with IoT data, while it seems so exciting and definitely has all this potential, there are challenges with actually bringing it to market." Kamel explained there are some clever ways to address issues of ownership and privacy. One of the data sets Quandl sources comes from email, based on a partnership it has with a technology company. "That essentially gives us access to 3 million people's emails. The company gives away its inbox management software, and in return people opt-in to allow this company to essentially read their emails. Now that might sound a bit evil at first, but what this company does is very responsible: It anonymizes and aggregates everything." Users of this data don't care about anyone person's email; only how many of these 3 million people are shopping at eBay or Best Buy or Amazon; how much are they spending and what are they buying? "You pull that kind of information out and you can actually draw really interesting conclusions about consumer spending patterns and indeed about how Amazon is doing, right now," said Kamel. In respect of individuals' privacy, this anonymized processing is a much less invasive use of email data than the type of analytics performed by Google. It reads all your emails to figure out who you are and what you like, so that you can be personally followed around the internet and shown adverts.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The bubble burst and this talk dissipated. Sure, Amazon and other online retailers put a dent in offline retailer’s sales, but it was limited to certain categories. Certainly, pet food and consumer staples would always be the domain of bricks-and-mortar stores. Now, nearly 20 years later, the move from offline to online commerce is quickly escalating. A few weeks ago, Target announced lackluster sales. I’m not surprised. I’m a Target fan. For many years, my wife and I would venture over to Target every couple weeks when we ran out of paper towels and soap. We’d enter the store for these low-margin “hardlines” but end up spending lots of money on high-margin “softlines” like t-shirts. We rarely visit Target anymore, and ecommerce has a lot do with it. Amazon Prime lets us order most of the items we used to buy at Target and get them within a day or two with no shipping charge. Amazon Pantry makes it easy to get things like soap. And if we need it today? Amazon now has same day shipping, or we can use Amazon Prime Now to get items delivered within an hour. Now Wal-Mart is making this easy, too, with free two-day shipping on orders over $35. Why drive to Target to pick up toilet paper and paper towels when you can get them delivered in a couple days for the same price? There’s also a shift happening offline that is hurting stores like Wal-Mart and Target: Grocery stores are learning to adapt to a changing reality. Our local grocery store HEB is now offering most of the sundry items that Target offers for less money. We used to drive to Target for paper towels because grocery stores treated them as a convenience item and charged and arm and a leg. Now they are less expensive for key items. Grocery stores are under attack at the same time but are doing a good job fighting back. They are under attack by Amazon Pantry and various food-in-a-box services like BlueApron and Freshly. Our local Randalls grocery store offers cardboard box recycling. It’s a bit ironic when I drop off packaging from these food services in their recycling bin. But HEB is adapting. They now offer lots of pre-packaged meals. Services like Freshly, which deliver prepared meals similar to Snap Kitchen, don’t stand much of a chance next to our grocery store’s offerings. The grocery store has cheaper prepared meals without all of the shipping waste. Don’t have time to pick them up at the grocery store? Instacart will do it for you. Or open up Uber Restaurants to get Snap Kitchen delivered. Having a hub in the local area is key to the future of online retail as customers expect goods now. Two days used to be considered fast. Now that seems like an eternity. The next decade will be filled with the carnage of certain types of bricks-and-mortar stores. What we expected 20 years ago is now becoming reality. Of course, this can mean good things for domain names. As goes internet growth, so goes the need for more domain names. Except when I order goods on my Amazon Echo.

My local grocery store now offers online ordering and free delivery, saving our family time and money in the process. It doesn’t take a .com to innovate, but it does take innovation to thrive. Reply Ammar Kubba says April 13, 2017 at 10:58 am Great insights, Andrew… I just heard from one of my investment advisers that Amazon was looking at Whole Foods. Makes perfect sense, especially given the “local presence” push by the largest online retailers. I can foresee a time when online-only retailers “partner” with local shops to fulfill orders. Reply Josh says April 13, 2017 at 11:06 am I agree Andrew, online grocery is back in a big way. However I always felt that there are a lot of items people like to select themselves from certain departments, like meat, fish etc. So while I believe it will take a huge bit out of brick and mortar I also feel some segments will survive in store. Also speaking of Amazon, I read about a year ago Amazon was testing drive through grocery stores. Because after all sometimes you need to pick up stuff on the way home not when you get home. Reply Salamander Joe says April 13, 2017 at 11:34 am Yeah, I was off by 20 years also. I thought it would have happened by at least 2002 if not sooner. I was way off. Reply Wes Martin says April 13, 2017 at 12:13 pm The Supermarket concept itself was a satisfaction of the same concerns which now threaten their own livelihoods. Supermarkets consolidated the local butcher, baker, milkman and more and more over time and the local store owners cried out before shutting down. Now this “convenience” they once offered can not beat the swiftness and agility of the online retailer. Perhaps one day even the e-tailor will be outdone by a new form of convenience down the line but the entire reason Amazon even exists is because a vacuum of potential thast went unaddressed for years. The offline retailers didn’t move into this empty space and fight hard enough to invest in this market opportunity so Amazon came in and scooped up all the free money. Offline retailers that didn’t carve out an online presence will go the same way as the Neanderthal or the Dodo, eclipsed by the light of progress and something we evolved past and grew out of. Reply has2hands says April 13, 2017 at 12:47 pm I always tell my wife we are reading Amazon books; watching Amazon content; listening to Amazon music and using Amazon for our main items and sundry items. Why? Because they make it so easy and convenient ….and at good price points. I even have 30 lbs of dog food delivered right to my front door. Reply bladel says April 13, 2017 at 2:11 pm Reminds me of this recent article: The Great Retail Apocalypse of 2017: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/retail-meltdown-of-2017/522384/ The per-capita square footage for retail space in the US, compared to other countries, is astonishing. Reply M. Menius says April 13, 2017 at 5:00 pm Interesting. We have been watching this unfold, i.e. the recent increase in online ordering and grocery delivery. Whole Foods was the first here in Greensboro, NC to offer grocery delivery within 2-3 hours, but within the past week Harris Teeter began offering same day delivery. This is a game changer. I expect huge numbers of people will begin ordering from home and save themselves the trip to the grocery store. Reply John says April 13, 2017 at 6:16 pm Seriously… You really want to trust some strangers to choose produce for you? Things like apples, potatoes, bananas, etc. Even packages of beef and steak. Is it just me? Reply Andrew Allemann says April 13, 2017 at 8:05 pm Since you rate your picker they have an incentive to only pick the best produce. Reply John says April 13, 2017 at 9:06 pm Thanks. Never knew that. I hope they all have that. Reply M. Menius says April 14, 2017 at 1:47 am “You really want to trust some strangers to choose produce for you?” Haha, I think I’d be willing. Hopefully they would not pick any rotten bananas. 🙂 Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Archives Archives Select Month April 2017  (33) March 2017  (68) February 2017  (60) January 2017  (59) December 2016  (54) November 2016  (58) October 2016  (57) September 2016  (65) August 2016  (67) July 2016  (56) June 2016  (66) May 2016  (74) April 2016  (74) March 2016  (78) February 2016  (78) January 2016  (63) December 2015  (72) November 2015  (71) October 2015  (81) September 2015  (80) August 2015  (72) July 2015  (70) June 2015  (79) May 2015  (69) April 2015  (76) March 2015  (75) February 2015  (73) January 2015  (65) December 2014  (68) November 2014  (72) October 2014  (82) September 2014  (78) August 2014  (72) July 2014  (80) June 2014  (83) May 2014  (73) April 2014  (78) March 2014  (85) February 2014  (92) January 2014  (96) December 2013  (71) November 2013  (77) October 2013  (96) September 2013  (81) August 2013  (104) July 2013  (101) June 2013  (82) May 2013  (92) April 2013  (92) March 2013  (74) February 2013  (74) January 2013  (73) December 2012  (56) November 2012  (69) October 2012  (75) September 2012  (65) August 2012  (68) July 2012  (73) June 2012  (105) May 2012  (102) April 2012  (83) March 2012  (83) February 2012  (79) January 2012  (111) December 2011  (80) November 2011  (84) October 2011  (82) September 2011  (92) August 2011  (91) July 2011  (91) June 2011  (110) May 2011  (94) April 2011  (80) March 2011  (94) February 2011  (93) January 2011  (80) December 2010  (87) November 2010  (74) October 2010  (70) September 2010  (107) August 2010  (97) July 2010  (83) June 2010  (101) May 2010  (100) April 2010  (109) March 2010  (111) February 2010  (110) January 2010  (99) December 2009  (75) November 2009  (94) October 2009  (102) September 2009  (85) August 2009  (94) July 2009  (88) June 2009  (92) May 2009  (92) April 2009  (100) March 2009  (114) February 2009  (90) January 2009  (78) December 2008  (58) November 2008  (73) October 2008  (77) September 2008  (76) August 2008  (58) July 2008  (66) June 2008  (53) May 2008  (48) April 2008  (39) March 2008  (43) February 2008  (37) January 2008  (34) December 2007  (24) November 2007  (31) October 2007  (32) September 2007  (25) August 2007  (29) July 2007  (28) June 2007  (28) May 2007  (32) April 2007  (25) March 2007  (25) February 2007  (26) January 2007  (37) December 2006  (38) November 2006  (34) October 2006  (38) September 2006  (26) August 2006  (29) July 2006  (27) June 2006  (28) May 2006  (36) April 2006  (35) March 2006  (39) February 2006  (36) January 2006  (40) December 2005  (53) November 2005  (46) October 2005  (53) September 2005  (36) August 2005  (29) July 2005  (22) June 2005  (28) May 2005  (30) April 2005  (41) March 2005  (47) Top Stories 01.

Walmart buyers are looking to make deals of varying sizes, from supplying products to a handful of local stores to supplying hundreds or thousands of stores, Sam's Club locations and Walmart.com. Businesses across the country have products featured in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com as a result of presentations of their products. One of these businesses is Illinois-based Bullibone Products, a small business that creates long-lasting nylon dog chews available in-store and on Walmart.com. "By investing in products that support American jobs, we are able to bring new products to our shelves that our customers want and new jobs to our communities," said Cindi Marsiglio, Walmart's vice president of U.S. Manufacturing.

 Walmart discounts click-and-collect BI Intelligence Apr. 13, 2017, 10:42 AM 498 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart's e-commerce sales soared in its latest quarter Logistics providers shift focus to small retailers RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart is offering discounts on eligible online purchases picked up in-store, according to Business Insider. The promotion will begin next week covering 10,000 items, and will be extended to 1 million products by the end of June. The discounts are aimed at reducing the cost of last-mile delivery, which will rise as Walmart increases its e-commerce efforts. Walmart is looking to encourage shoppers to opt for the discounts over the convenience of home delivery. The last mile of delivery — the final leg of delivering a package to a customer's doorstep — is the most expensive part of delivering goods because it involves shipping a large number of low volume orders to numerous locations. As Walmart pushes its e-commerce initiatives, it will face steep increases in shipping costs, and eliminating last-mile expenses is one way to create considerable savings. This move is an about-face from the retail giant's latest effort to compete with Amazon on shipping. Walmart recently reduced its free shipping threshold to $35, offering free two-day shipping on orders over that amount. This policy replaced its subscription service, ShippingPass, with the hope of undercutting Amazon's Prime subscription. However, this may have threatened skyrocketing, and possibly unsustainable, shipping costs for the company. Walmart now appears to be pulling back from this strategy by encouraging shoppers to bypass delivery altogether. Moreover, the company could be planning to pass on some of its savings from lower shipping costs to shoppers in the form of additional discounts, staying true to its core offering — low prices. Walmart might also be able to boost to in-store purchases through more click-and-collect orders. DSW reports that 15-20% of customers picking up an online order in-store end up buying an additional item. Walmart could encourage such purchases by moving convenience items — such as toothpaste or grab-and-go food items — to where customers pick up their orders. Click and collect — a fulfillment option that lets shoppers place an online order and pick it up at a store — is thriving in the UK. Over half of UK shoppers report having used this method in the past year, according to a survey from JDA & Centiro conducted in April 2016. However, the US is far behind on the click and collect trend, with just 27% of consumers using the service. This is largely due to slower growth in mobile commerce, and specifically, the hesitancy shoppers feel about using mobile retail apps. Retailers in the US can look to the growth drivers in the UK to help drive up their own click and collect sales. Most notably, mobile commerce and adoption by grocery chains are driving shoppers in the UK to use click and collect. Nancee Halpin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on click and collect that breaks down the growth factors behind click and collect in the UK. It also discusses the retailers successfully implementing the fulfillment method, examines the of impact consumer behavior, and outlines some key steps that US retailers can take to replicate the UK's performance. Here are some key takeaways from the report: The UK's click and collect market is expected to grow 78% by 2020, to £8.2 billion ($10.6 billion). Meanwhile, it is expected to reach £5.3 billion ($6.8 billion) by the end of 2016. Click and collect is benefiting from consumer adoption of mobile commerce in the UK. Mobile is a fundamental driver because it affords consumers more flexibility in the purchasing process. As a result, many UK consumers are purchasing goods on their mobile phones, and then picking them up on the way home from work, the gym, appointments, etc.  The service is particularly popular among grocery chains, with many of the UK's largest supermarkets offering click and collect. Since trips to the grocery store are made frequently and regularly, click and collect is a perfect fit for shoppers who want to avoid recurring issues like long checkout lines and crowded stores. To grow click and collect in the US, retailers need to invest in their mobile presence and dedicate in-store resources to click and collect shoppers. Merchants should do more than just recreate the desktop browser experience on a mobile app — this includes employing tools like mobile loyalty programs, digital coupons, and social media integration.

Suppliers IBD STAFF 4/13/2017 Reprints Loading the player... The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tested key support levels amid geopolitical tensions and concerns about President Trump's agenda. United Airlines (UAL) suffered a PR fiasco, and Apple (AAPL) buzz roiled iPhone suppliers. Tesla (TSLA) became the most valuable U.S. automaker, briefly. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) headlined big bank earnings, while Wal-Mart (WMT) is making physical stores an asset in its online battle against Amazon (AMZN). Stocks Undercut 50-Day The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Wednesday. Investors worried about tensions with Syria, North Korea and Russia, while President Trump said tax cuts will have to wait on health reform. Steel, mining and other infrastructure-related stocks kept falling. Many chips fell on Apple uncertainty, while fiber-optic stocks rebounded Thursday on blowout preliminary earnings figures from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell after reporting earnings. Wal-Mart stepped up its battle with Amazon, with both retail stocks in buy zones. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slide, hitting its lowest level since November. United Airlines Tries To Repair Brand United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz apologized multiple times after a video of Chicago police dragging an elderly Asian man off an overbooked flight sparked outcry on social media. Weibo users in China questioned if the incident was racially motivated and called for a boycott of the airline. In an earlier a memo to employees, Munoz blamed the passenger for being "disruptive and belligerent" and said that United had "followed established procedures." In March, the carrier came under fire for turning away two teenagers for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket. United Airlines shares fell 2.55% for the week, not much more than the airline stock group. RELATED: United CEO Apologizes After Racism Claims Sparked China Backlash Delta Upbeat On Q2, Defends Overbookings Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported mixed first-quarter results but forecast positive Q2 unit revenue, an important efficiency metric Wall Street has long wished would improve. As airlines confront higher fuel and labor costs, Delta said that it expected "the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure" to have occurred during Q1. The carrier said the roughly 4,000 flight cancellations that resulted from thunderstorms around Atlanta would cost it $125 million in Q2 pretax income, but it said it was not understaffed. In light of the forcible removal of a passenger from a packed United Airlines flight, Delta said extra regulation wasn't needed and that it handled overbookings better than rivals. Delta shares rose 4% intraday Wednesday but reversed to close slightly lower, and continued to slide Thursday, closing at their lowest levels since Nov. 9. RELATED: Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong Apple Chips Unsettled Apple's internal chip development efforts grabbed the spotlight, raising investor worries that some iPhone suppliers could be phased out after a report said the Dow-industrials tech giant will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. The Dialog report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors that Apple could replace its graphics chips in iPhones. A Pacific Crest analyst said Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency or audio chips for iPhones. Shares in Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sold off. In a countersuit, Qualcomm (QCOM) claimed Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips. Qualcomm also alleged that Apple lied to regulators to spur investigations of the wireless chipmaker. Apple on Jan. 20 filed a lawsuit vs. Qualcomm over its technology licensing practices. RELATED: Apple In-Sourcing Hit List To Spare Cirrus, Skyworks: Analyst Apple iPhone Chip Report Hits Dialog, Rattles Supply Chain Qualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7 Wal-Mart Offers Pickup Discount Dow component Wal-Mart will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence the discount giant is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com. Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart began offering free two-day shipping with $35 minimum orders and also set up curbside pickup for online grocery orders. Whole Foods (WFM) spiked 10% on Monday after Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake, hinting that it wants the natural-foods grocery giant to pursue a sale. Amazon reportedly had mulled buying Whole Foods last year, Bloomberg reported. RELATED: Wal-Mart Will Pay You To Pick Up Your Online Orders; Your Move, Amazon This Stock Is Up On News That Amazon Even Thought About Buying It Whole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers JPMorgan, Citigroup Earnings Top JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both reported first-quarter earnings well above analyst estimates, with revenue also better than expected. Wells Fargo modestly topped Q1 EPS views but fell short on revenue. JPMorgan and Citigroup reversed from early gains to fall about 1%. Wells Fargo tumbled 3.3% to its worst levels since November. In addition to its mixed results, Wells was hurt by news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is selling 9 million shares to keep its Wells stake below 10%. Bank stocks have been under pressure as Treasury yields have fallen and flattened. RELATED: JPMorgan, Citigroup Beat Q1 Views; Wells Fargo Revenue Misses Oil Prices Rally U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.8% for the week to $53.18 a barrel, helped by a seven-day winning streak through Tuesday. OPEC reported lower production in March and signs grew that the cartel and some nonmembers would extend production cuts past midyear. OPEC's production fell by 153,000 barrels per day in March, according to secondary sources in the cartel's monthly oil market report. Saudi Arabia said its production fell to 9.9 million barrels per day, but secondary sources said its output actually rose. The International Energy Agency said global crude supplies are nearly balanced due to the OPEC-led cuts. The Energy Information Administration said weekly U.S. oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell, but U.S. production hit a 20-month high. Looking ahead, the EIA expects gasoline to average $2.46 per gallon during the peak summer driving season vs. $2.23  last year. The EIA lowered its 2017 and 2018 outlook on crude prices and raised its forecast on U.S. output.

As Tesla gains moderated, however, GM regained its status. Tesla overtook Ford (F) on April 3. Meanwhile, a group of institutional investors want more independent directors on Tesla's board to avoid "groupthink" members that sign off on all of CEO Elon Musk's plans. Musk, Tesla's top shareholder, suggested that investors who aren't happy should buy Ford instead.

The death of brick-and-mortars might be true for some, but don't tell these two. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Apr 13, 2017 at 9:33AM "Brick and mortar retailers are dying." Tell me if you've heard that one over the past five years. As e-commerce grows stronger each year, investors are shunning traditional retailers in droves. Right? The image many of us have when thinking of big-box retailers. Image source: Getty Images But don't tell that to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), the two stocks facing off in today's battle. Combined, they collected over $25 billion in free cash flow in 2016 and had sales topping a half-trillion dollars. Between the two, which is the better buy today? That's impossible to answer without a fully functioning crystal ball, but we'll do our best to dig deeper by approaching the question from three different angles. Sustainable competitive advantages There is absolutely nothing more important to investigate than a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as a "moat." If I could go back in time and talk to my beginning-investor-self, I would make this simple point abundantly clear. That's because a moat represents the special something that separates a company from its competition. Over a long enough time frame, it is what separates the winners from the losers, what keeps customers coming back again and again, and what keeps the competition at bay for years. Wal-Mart's key advantage has always been its scale. No one did a better job at focusing on small, rural communities, buying things in bulk, and lowering overhead costs better than the Walton family. That led to market-thumping returns for decades. But that moat has been mightily disrupted by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With e-commerce taking more and more of the retail pie every year, the very thing that made Wal-Mart great -- its physical presence throughout the United States and the world -- has become its Achilles' heel. Customers value convenience above all else, and if packages can be delivered right to their front door, then that's what they'll go with. Lowe's has been able to avoid the Amazon bug by nature of its business. It simply isn't practical to deliver most home-furnishing and construction purchases right to your door. In addition, these purchases are usually so large and long-lasting that customers like to see, touch, and try out the things they're buying before handing over their credit card. Perhaps the best proxy for these trends is each store's comps -- or how much comparable-store sales increased in any given year. Comps: A 5-Year History Create column charts Data source: Company annual reports I simply think that Lowe's wins this battle because its business is more difficult to disrupt with e-commerce than Wal-Mart's. The company's solid position as the No. 2 home-furnishing store in America, the power of its brand, and its scale all offer a wider moat -- in my opinion -- than Wal-Mart has. Winner: Lowe's. Financial fortitude Most investors, especially those who put their faith behind big-box brand names, like seeing cash returned to them. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, as dividends are a key reason to invest in such names. But investors should also want their companies to hold on to a hefty stash of cash. That's because every company, no matter what, is going to face difficult economic times. Companies that approach such times with a healthy balance sheet have options: Buy back stock, make splashy acquisitions, or -- most importantly -- outspend rivals to gain market share. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite scenario -- forced to narrow their focus to meet the demands of their debtors. Here's how Wal-Mart and Lowe's stack up in terms of financial fortitude, remembering that Wal-Mart is valued at over three times the size of Lowe's. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Wal-Mart $6.9 billion $42 billion $13.6 billion $20.9 billion Lowe's $1.0 billion $14.4 billion $3.1 billion $4.5 billion Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Lowe's is by no means a slouch in this respect, but even after adjusting for the relative size of these companies, Wal-Mart comes out ahead. It has more cash, income, and free cash flow than Lowe's. This decision is very easy. Winner: Wal-Mart. Valuation Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Wal-Mart 17 11 3.8 2.8% 32% Lowe's 21 16 1.2 1.7% 25% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. This is a much more difficult one to parse. Both companies offer very healthy dividends, but Wal-Mart's is noticeably bigger. Wal-Mart also appears to be cheaper on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But growth rates are much higher at Lowe's. In fact, according to the PEG ratio, Lowe's trades at an astounding 65% discount to Wal-Mart. That's why I'm calling this one a draw. Winner: Tie The winner is... So there you have it: It's a tie. If investors are more comforted by a strong balance sheet and very impressive cash flows, then Wal-Mart is the way to go. If, however, you want to know that a company is less susceptible to disruption in the form of e-commerce, I think Lowe's is a better bet. I always use a company's moat as a tiebreaker if the companies end in a draw, so my vote here would be with Lowe's, but I can't deny the strength of Wal-Mart's cash flow.  Brian Stoffel owns shares of Amazon.

The move is part of the retailer’s efforts to better compete with online leader Amazon. Initially, the discount will be available on about 10,000 items. But the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer says it will then expand the price cuts to more than one million items by the end of June. Among some of the offers starting April 19: An infant car seat that was priced at $148.05 will have an additional discount of $7.40. A Lego Great Vehicles Ferry priced at $23.99 will have an additional pickup discount of $2.55. Wal-Mart is able offer the discounts by delivering the products directly to its 4,700 stores, saving on costs by avoiding shipping to individual shoppers’ homes. The offer builds on Wal-Mart’s move in late January that replaced a pilot program offering free shipping but that came with an annual fee of $49, with one with a lower free-shipping threshold, faster delivery and no membership fee. The retailer said it will reduce free shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items including essentials like diapers and pet food as well as hot toys and electronics. Wal-Mart’s average time has been three to five days. Also, at the time, it reduced the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. These moves are being spearheaded by Walmart.com’s CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when Wal-Mart bought Jet.com, which he founded last year. It’s also another illustration of how Wal-Mart is trying to figure out a way to compete with Amazon and its dominant Prime plan. Amazon’s membership program costs $99 a year, but includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say that Amazon Prime members buy frequently and spend more money. “We’re creating price transparency to empower customers to shop smarter and choose what’s best for them,” Lore wrote in a company blog post. He noted now they can either pick up an item and save even more money, or get two-day shipping for free without paying for a membership. He noted that he believes that the business is gaining momentum. Wal-Mart’s online sales increased 29 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, up from 20.6 percent in the previous period. That marked the third straight quarter of gains.     Tags: shipping, items, offer, amazon, mart, online, Other stories from today: Speed demons: Cars, SUVs get more pep in their step Aspen Skiing venture acquiring California’s Mammoth Resorts Buffett’s firm selling some of its Wells Fargo shares     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Have you completed your tax forms for 2016?

Walmart India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of US retail giant Walmart Stores. Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said the government’s decision to permit 100 per cent FDI in food retail is a good step and it would also help reduce wastage. “I think this 100 per cent FDI in food retail is an extremely good step and it’s a very noble objective in terms of being able to double farmers’ income and reduce food wastage,” Iyer said at a select media briefing here. When asked whether the company is planning to enter the sector, he said: “We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time, we will look at that sector”. Walmart India operates in the wholesale segment, at present, and has 21 cash and carry stores across nine states. It plans to increase the number of stores to 50 stores by 2021. “We are building a pipeline of stores and we already have about 16 stores in the pipeline,” Iyer said, adding they are at various stages of implementation in terms of licensing and construction. He was speaking on the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development (WEDP) programme, under which it trains women entrepreneurs in professional and soft skills to help build robust business. With a view to benefit farmers and reduce wastage of fruit and vegetables, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Budget for 2016-17 allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment through FIPB route in marketing of food products produced and manufactured in India. With regard to its Best Price wholesale stores, Iyer said: “Our major focus has been in the states where we are already present and therefore new stores will also be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra”. On being asked about foray into new states, he said India as a whole is an attractive market but it is important to keep focus wherever we are present because creating a deeper presence and deeper penetration makes a better business sense.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Print Email Los Angeles Times By Los Angeles Times The Oregonian on April 13, 2017 at 5:00 AM, updated April 13, 2017 at 5:02 AM comments Dissenters were quick to react when ModCloth, an online seller of trendy women's clothes and accessories, was acquired by retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last month. "You have disappointed us all," one reader commented under a blog post by ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger announcing the sale -- the notion being that ModCloth would lose its cache as part of a discount mass merchant. "I'm done shopping with you," wrote another. But Gregg Koger noted that Wal-Mart would give ModCloth "the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow." ModCloth is one example of how Wal-Mart is belatedly but aggressively expanding its e-commerce business to keep pace with the seismic shift in consumer shopping from bricks-and-mortar stores to the internet. With nearly half-a-trillion dollars in annual sales and 4,700 U.S. stores, Wal-Mart has been buying online retailers, slashing shipping rates and rolling out new ways for in-store customers to do more of their shopping at Walmart.com and its other websites. While traditional U.S. in-store retailing is growing less than 2 percent a year, forcing many retailers to close stores, e-commerce is growing 16 percent annually, the research firm EMarketer Inc. reports. E-commerce sales this year will hit $462 billion and soar to $789 billion by 2021, the firm estimates. Wal-Mart's effort to tap that online growth often is portrayed as a direct attack on Amazon.com Inc., the online-retailing behemoth. Wal-Mart prefers to frame its strategy as capturing more of the e-commerce market by blending its in-store, online and mobile-app offerings so that customers can easily move from one to the other to make purchases. If it snatches business from Amazon in the process, all the better. One of Wal-Mart's key acquisitions was Jet.com Inc., which also sells a wide variety of consumer products and groceries. Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com last year and then named Jet.com Chairman Marc Lore to head its entire U.S. e-commerce operation. "It was a radical signal to everyone that the biggest retailer in the world was willing to put $3.3 billion into the (online) market," said Adrien Nussenbaum, chief executive of Mirakl, a developer of software products for retailers and other firms. Under Lore and Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart has taken several other steps to bolster its e-commerce sales, including: Acquiring Shoebuy.com, an online footwear retailer, and Moosejaw.com, an online seller of outdoor apparel and gear. Those retailers and ModCloth continue operating as separate websites. Launching free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more at Walmart.com, Jet.com and many of its other sites. Boosting the stock on its virtual shelves. At the start of 2016, Walmart.com had 8 million items for sale; today it has more than 35 million items. Launching a program that allows in-store customers to go online or check their phone app to see a list of items they have bought, then reorder those items online. Rolling out a groceries program whereby customers order items online and then have the groceries loaded into their vehicle at a Wal-Mart store. Forming a division called Store No. 8 that's intended to hatch new online retail approaches and businesses. Wal-Mart said in October that it was going to slow the pace of new store openings this year, in good part to shift investments to its e-commerce business. "We're being pretty active," Lore said during a recent tech gathering, called Code Commerce, in Las Vegas. "We're behind. We need to catch up. There are some big things we have in the works," said Lore, who spent two years with Amazon after it bought his previous online venture, the parent of Diapers.com and other sites. Wal-Mart is the second-largest online mass merchandiser behind Amazon, but it's a distant second. Amazon's product sales totaled $94.7 billion last year while Wal-Mart's tallied $14.4 billion, according to EMarketer. Amazon, with $136 billion in total sales last year, has other assets and services as well, namely a variety of video, entertainment and other services available through its Prime membership. Prime also provides free shipping on Amazon purchases, and analysts estimate about 65 million Amazon customers subscribe to Prime for $99 a year. (Amazon doesn't disclose the number except to say it has "tens of millions" of subscribers.) Stephen Beck, founder of the management consulting firm Cg42, said Prime gives Amazon customers more incentive to shop at the site. Prime customers spend an average of $270 a year above what they were spending at Amazon before subscribing, he said. "One of the things Amazon does really well is to highlight the value of the Prime subscription," Beck said. "Wal-Mart is a retailer and proudly so, but Amazon is more than that." Amazon spokeswoman Sally Fouts would not comment about Wal-Mart's specific online ventures, but she said, "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon, and it's never changed our approach. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about -- low prices, vast selection and fast delivery." Amazon's efforts extend to a grocery delivery service in certain areas called Amazon Fresh. It's also begun testing its own grocery pickup service in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. Although Wal-Mart is well behind Amazon in e-commerce, Wal-Mart has the scale and resources to make a much bigger splash in online shopping. The Bentonville, Ark., company, which also owns the Sam's Club chain, posted total sales of $482 billion in its fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. The company says its 4,700 U.S. stores are located within 5 miles of 70 percent of the U.S. population, and it has an enormous distribution network in place. More than 140 million people shop at its stores and Walmart.com in the U.S. every week. Wal-Mart doesn't break out dollar sales for its U.S. e-commerce group. But the company began reporting year-over-year percentage changes in the group's sales with the fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31, and in that quarter sales jumped 29 percent from a year earlier. The gain included results from Jet.com, which Wal-Mart bought last September. In the groceries sector, "the (online) battle for supremacy is still undecided" so it makes sense for Wal-Mart to be aggressive because it's "an area where Amazon has not dominated," EMarketer analyst Yoram Wurmser said. Even if Wal-Mart never catches Amazon overall, "I think they can live very well alongside Amazon because they have so many stores, access to so many products and great logistics" for moving goods to consumers while keeping prices low, Nussenbaum said. When asked about competing with Amazon's Prime membership, Lore told the conference that "we're offering two-day free delivery (with a $35 minimum) on 2 million products. We think that's a really compelling-value proposition, given the prices we're offering, and we feel like we're well-positioned to target that mass customer." Wal-Mart is eyeing the broader goal of making it easy for customers to shift from shopping in its stores to shopping online or with their smartphones. "We believe the future of commerce is a blend of stores, online and mobile seamlessly coming together, allowing customers to shop how, when and where they want," Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said. -- Los Angeles Times Video of the Day Nominate your company for a Top Workplaces award Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Walmart India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of US retail giant Walmart Stores. Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said the government's decision to permit 100 per cent FDI in food retail is a good step and it would also help reduce wastage. "I think this 100 per cent FDI in food retail is an extremely good step and it's a very noble objective in terms of being able to double farmers' income and reduce food wastage," Iyer said at a select media briefing here. When asked whether the company is planning to enter the sector, he said: "We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time, we will look at that sector". Walmart India operates in the wholesale segment, at present, and has 21 cash and carry stores across nine states. It plans to increase the number of stores to 50 stores by 2021. "We are building a pipeline of stores and we already have about 16 stores in the pipeline," Iyer said, adding they are at various stages of implementation in terms of licensing and construction. He was speaking on the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development (WEDP) programme, under which it trains women entrepreneurs in professional and soft skills to help build robust business. With a view to benefit farmers and reduce wastage of fruit and vegetables, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Budget for 2016-17 allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment through FIPB route in marketing of food products produced and manufactured in India. With regard to its Best Price wholesale stores, Iyer said: "Our major focus has been in the states where we are already present and therefore new stores will also be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra". On being asked about foray into new states, he said India as a whole is an attractive market but it is important to keep focus wherever we are present because creating a deeper presence and deeper penetration makes a better business sense.

Walmart India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of US retail giant Walmart Stores. Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said the government's decision to permit 100 percent FDI in food retail is a good step and it would also help reduce wastage. "I think this 100 percent FDI in food retail is an extremely good step and it's a very noble objective in terms of being able to double farmers' income and reduce food wastage," Iyer said at a select media briefing here. When asked whether the company is planning to enter the sector, he said: "We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time, we will look at that sector". Walmart India operates in the wholesale segment, at present, and has 21 cash and carry stores across nine states. It plans to increase the number of stores to 50 stores by 2021. "We are building a pipeline of stores and we already have about 16 stores in the pipeline," Iyer said, adding they are at various stages of implementation in terms of licensing and construction. He was speaking on the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development (WEDP) programme, under which it trains women entrepreneurs in professional and soft skills to help build robust business. With a view to benefit farmers and reduce wastage of fruit and vegetables, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Budget for 2016-17 allowed 100 percent foreign direct investment through FIPB route in marketing of food products produced and manufactured in India. With regard to its Best Price wholesale stores, Iyer said: "Our major focus has been in the states where we are already present and therefore new stores will also be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra". On being asked about foray into new states, he said India as a whole is an attractive market but it is important to keep focus wherever we are present because creating a deeper presence and deeper penetration makes a better business sense.

All our digital financial transactions are collected, our telephone calls (if not their content,) are collected, so are our driving patterns, and so much more. How this affects our lives is possibly something we are now alert to, until we get the call from our bank querying ‘unusual purchases’ of large quantities of make-up and running shoes. What is startling about this book, though, is the rigour and sophistication with which retailers are gathering data on our private and public lives. It would be absurd to suggest that this gathering of data and turning it into information is evil: we want our credit card company to know when our credit is being used in ways that are unlike us, or the driving pattern of our car does not match our driving style. Similarly, it is useful to know of specials that would interest us, or that products we have been using which are being replaced by something better. The second chapter of this thoroughly researched book covers the evolution of retail. Little has changed in the principles of successful retailing, though much has changed in how these principles are applied. The salesman who travelled through the village or between farms had to comply with the same basic principles as does the modern retailer. You must know your customer, buy your wares well, sell your wares well, and maintain your customer base while growing it. The travelling salesman had to know the villagers’ interest in the products he had to offer: he had to buy these goods at prices that would allow him to cover their cost and make a profit. He had to know his customers well enough to be sure of who to offer credit to, and who not. He had to maintain his wares so that they were attractive, and present them to customers so that they would be desirable. Without external rating systems, he either had to insist on immediate payment or, to be able to extend credit, make an assessment of the buyer’s financial strength. With the advancement of the retail system and the growth of retailers, stores began to develop their own credit systems, offered only to financially strong families. Wares were able to be advertised in newspapers and pamphlets, and their quality began to be assured through brands. More goods were available on display, giving the shoppers a better view of what they were being sold. As towns and cities grew, so could retailers. Competition became keener and the elements of retail needed to be addressed differently. The purchasing power of retailers lay in quantity and attracting, knowing and keeping customers became more difficult. Era of the voucher In the absence of the sophisticated technologies we have today, various ingenious methods were employed to keep track of what was sold and to whom. One of the most enduring methods was the voucher. There was the discount incentive to buy the goods, and a method of knowing if the discount offer changed behaviour. Vouchers offered a way of knowing at which outlet the goods were being bought, and so on. It was a time-consuming process and a clumsy one, but one of the best on offer. Technological advances made the basic idea of vouchers much more cost-effective and powerful. In the forefront of the sophistication of retailing was Walmart. It was Walmart that embraced technology in its quest for ever-increasing efficiencies, with an eagerness never seen before. Launched in 1962 by Sam Walton, the chain grew systematically from its first store in Rogers, Arkansas. One of the reason for Walmart’s success was its obsessive focus on cost-control throughout its supply chain, which resulted in Walmart growing to a point where few other retailers could buy in larger volumes and at lower prices. Through its size, Walmart could cease buying from wholesalers, and buy only from manufacturers. Their computer systems at the time were reputed to be larger than the Pentagon’s. Their use of barcoded boxes of goods, not only goods themselves, made for ever-greater efficiencies and control of their processes. Today, pervasive technological advances can enable stores to identify loyal customers. The value of these customers is deemed to be high, because the store doesn’t need to attract them, only retain them. Power of the cellphone Perhaps the most powerful piece of technology available to the retailer since the advent of the super-powerful computer is the ubiquitous cellphone. This always-on, always at-hand device, offers benefits so necessary for the growth of retail stores today. When each store had only a few customers it was the duty of store serving staff to know their customers, what they liked, and how valuable they could be. Today, that would be impossible in a supermarket or clothing chain. On entering a clothing store your cellphone can identify you, your picture can be sent to a store manager who can then greet you by name, and guide you to the new range you have looked at carefully on your home computer. If you commented on how good a friend looked in that new-cut suit on Facebook, you could be guided to one on the rack. Similarly, having purchased locally made pasta on each of your last visits, you could receive a discount voucher to try the imported Italian version.  As technology advances, ever more opportunities to entice, reward, and promote are available to retailers to get a greater share of your spend. Do shelves have eyes, staring at you? Of course. Does everything you interact with in the internet-of-things have this capability too? Of course. The value of this book lies in its comprehensive and insightful overview of the evolution of retailing, and its intriguing exposé of the sophistication and use of advanced technologies today. And yes, you will be surprised at how everything is looking at you.Readability:   Light ---+- Serious Insights:        High -+--- Low Practical:        High ---+- Low   * Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of the recently-released Executive Update.

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals Walmart to Offer Extra Savings to Shoppers Who Pick up Online Orders Karla Bowsher April 13, 2017 Photo by Tupungato / Shutterstock.com Walmart to Offer Extra Savings to Shoppers Who Pick up Online Orders 0 Walmart has created another way for you to save money. Called a “pickup discount,” it’s an additional price break on certain items that are sold only online, Walmart announced Wednesday. To get the discount, order eligible items online and opt to have them shipped to a Walmart store rather than your home. You then pick up the items at the store. This news comes a few months after Walmart started offering free two-day shipping for online purchases, with no membership fee necessary anymore, and lowered the minimum purchase amount required to qualify for free shipping from $50 to $35. Walmart’s new pickup discounts will be available starting April 19 for about 10,000 items. By the end of June, they will be available for more than 1 million of “the most popular items,” according to the announcement. Product descriptions for items that are eligible for the discount will be marked with the words “Pickup Discount” on Walmart’s website. Here are a few examples of what you can expect to save: Britax B-SAFE 35 Infant Car Seat, Slate Strie: $148.05 online price – $7.40 pickup discount = $140.65 final price LEGO City Great Vehicles Ferry, 60119: $23.99 – $2.55 = $21.44 Coleman 150-quart Heritage XP Marine Cooler: $111.49 – $4.46 = $107.03 VIZIO SmartCast M-Series 70″ Class 4K Ultra HDTV (M70-D3): $1,698 – $50 = $1,648 Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart’s U.S. eCommerce division, explains in the announcement that Walmart is able to offer additional discounts to customers willing to pick up eligible online orders in stores because it saves Walmart last-mile delivery costs. Those costs represent the bulk of the costs of shipping products directly to customers’ homes. Lore continues: “This means, quite simply, it costs less for us to ship to stores. So, our customers should share in those savings.” Another advantage of this program is that, because you are shopping online, you can also save money — on top of the pickup discount — by using a cash-back portal like Ebates.

By Matthew Boyle Bloomberg News  April 13, 2017 LONDON — Walmart will offer discounts on more than a million online-only items that customers then pick up at stores, part of an effort by the world’s largest retailer to challenge Amazon.com Inc. Taking another page from the Jet.com business it bought last year, Walmart will first cut prices on about 10,000 Web-only items such as Britax car seats and Lego toys, according to a statement. The program, which starts on April 19, will expand to more than a million so-called “long tail” items by the end of June, the company said. Advertisement The effort builds on Jet’s Smart Card business model, which provides discounts to customers who package items together or forgo returns. “We are beginning to take the ethos behind Jet’s Smart Cart and marrying it with Wal-Mart’s operational efficiency,” Marc Lore, head of Walmart’s e-commerce business, said in the statement. “Quite simply, it costs less for us to ship to stores. So, our customers should share in those savings.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The move is Lore’s latest step to check Amazon’s growing online dominance and shows how he’s keen to meld Jet’s innovations with Walmart’s 4,700-store network. Earlier this year, Walmart scrapped a free-shipping program that competed with Amazon’s Prime membership and replaced it with free two-day deliveries for orders of at least $35. Amazon will control half of the US e-commerce market by 2021, according to analysts at Needham & Co. They estimate that the online giant currently commands 34 percent, compared with Walmart’s less than 5 percent. “Walmart is trying to move quickly and is stepping up its game,” Robin Sherk, an e-commerce analyst at Kantar Retail, said by phone. “The idea of passing cost savings onto the shopper is something that could be quite disruptive.” The discounts vary by item and reflect the savings to Walmart for shipping the orders to its stores on one of its 6,700 trucks, rather than to a customer’s house. The $148.05 Britax B-Safe 35 infant car seat is reduced by 5 percent to $140.65, while the Lego City Great Vehicles Ferry is discounted 11 percent to $21.44. Other products in the program are Coleman coolers and Vizio televisions. Lore called the program a “game-changer” and said the level of discounts could be adjusted going forward. Advertisement “Part of the reason why we are launching 10,000 products to start and growing it over time is that we want to perfect that discount,” he said. Walmart’s Web investments — which also include acquisitions of sites Moosejaw and ModCloth, a new network of e-commerce distribution centers, and an expansion of online grocery — have prompted belt-tightening elsewhere. The company has reduced jobs at both its West Coast technology hub and at its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Chief financial officer Brett Biggs said at an investor conference last month that the company needs to “rejuvenate” the famed low-cost culture that patriarch Sam Walton instilled. The term “long-tail” refers to the seemingly endless assortment of products that online retailers can offer, compared with the shelf-space constraints that force physical retailers to focus on a more limited assortment of top-selling items.

The move by the discount giant will amp up the rivalry with Amazon. “It costs us less to ship to our stores,” said Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart.com. “So, our customers should share in those savings.” But some industry analysts questioned whether shoppers will bite. “Most people buy online because of the convenience,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. “Now you are talking about going into a Walmart Supercenter which is not known for its convenience. Are consumers really willing to drive to the store to save a couple of dollars?” On some items the discount could be worth the trip. A 70-inch Vizio SmartCast TV will see a $50 price cut, for example. But that Coleman Marine Cooler will be only $4.46 cheaper. The new discount only applies to products available online. Walmart, run by Chief Executive Doug McMillon, is hoping shoppers pad their online bundle with a few items they see while they are in the store, say industry experts. More than 50 percent of online shoppers who pick up their purchases in stores buy something else while in the store, said Charle Dimov, director of marketing for OrderDynamics, a retail technology vendor.

The home owner said he had left his eight-year-old son home alone while he went out to buy milk and juice. The boy said 4-5 males wearing ski masks entered the home after he accidentally left the door unlocked after taking out his dogs. He said two suspects had guns and they asked him where the "weed and money" was. It was determined the suspects, who were not located, stole four video game consoles, two iPads, a set of headphones, the boy's cell phone and a safe containing $5,000. The man later said he was at a casino earlier and won $5,000. He said he then lent a friend $300 and that man had called him to pay him back so he left the house to meet him at a gas station. The robbery took place during that time. There were no suspects identified. Obstructing official business, Warrensville Center Road: Officers responded to a report of a hit-skip accident April 1 and were told the suspect was a woman wearing a Walmart vest. They identified the owner of the vehicle as a 26-year-old Cleveland woman, but when they contacted her she denied involvement and said she never owned the type of vehicle that had caused the accident. Officers were then able to identify the driver of the vehicle as a Walmart employee and they went to her Cleveland home and found the vehicle in the driveway. The woman, 22, said she drove away from the accident because she did not have a driver's license and didn't want to get into trouble. They learned her boyfriend had bought the vehicle from the father of the other woman's child, but the title had not been transferred. Officers contacted the other woman once again and told her she was being charged with obstructing official business. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland woman, 36, was arrested at Walmart April 3 for the suspected theft of $202.55. Loss prevention workers said she used a price tag not attached to any other items to scan the items in her cart. The price tag she used was for the amount of ten cents. Fraud, South Green Road: A resident reported April 3 he was contacted by a supposed Microsoft employee, who asked to access his computer to secure his online security. The man allowed the person to take access and later gave him his credit card information, expecting to be billed by Microsoft. In turn, a $1,000 purchase to Michael Kors Online was made to his account. The fraudulent purchase was found to be for a gift card. The resident did not have any pertinent information pertaining to the caller. Property damage, Maplegrove Road: A woman and her boyfriend reported March 30 someone threw a large rock through the rear window of their vehicle at their home. The man said he saw a woman, whom they both know, throw the rock and also destroy the vehicle's temporary tag. He said she left the area with another woman and they both live in Cleveland Heights. He said they were all once friends but had a falling out. Officers tried unsuccessfully to contact the suspects. There were no independent witnesses to the incident. Property damage, Homestead Road: Several pieces of playground equipment were found vandalized April 2 at Adrian Elementary School. A permanent marker was used to write obscene phrases and draw pictures of male genitals. School staff said it would be cleaned off before the next school day. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Bedford Heights man, 19, ran from Walmart April 1 after trying to steal a lug wrench. He was located inside Domino's Pizza on the same road and arrested for theft and obstruction of official business. He said he stole the wrench because he needed to fix a flat tire so he could go see his six-month-old son. He had thrown the wrench on a resident's garage roof while being pursued by officers. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee had her iPhone stolen from the store March 31. It was tracked to a man and woman who were walking north into Cleveland Heights. They admitted to taking the phone from the store and the woman was also found in possession of several items that were later found to have been stolen from the store. The Michigan woman, 30, and Cleveland Heights man, 30, were cited for theft. Animal bites, Lucille Avenue: A woman reported March 28 her two dogs were attacked by two dogs from a resident's home. The resident's children were able to get their dogs off of her dogs, but not before one of her dogs were bitten. She did not want to press charges. Officers spoke to the owner of the dogs about the incident and informed her that her dogs would be deemed dangerous. Found property, Quilliams Road: A BB gun was located in the roadway by an officer at the intersection of Covington Road April 2. It was unknown how it got there. Property damage, Emerson Road: The owner of neighboring homes said April 3 a tenant saw a boy throwing sticks and rocks onto the roof of one of the garages. Officers observed the sticks and rocks on the roof and found an area where the garage siding had been cracked. They spoke to a resident of South Green Road, who said her four sons were not responsible for the damage. She was told to make sure they stayed off the properties or they could be charged with criminal trespass. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A deputy, working off duty security at Walmart, reported April 3 a man left the store with stolen merchandise in his book bag. The man handed his book bag to the deputy and told him he did not want to fight. Several packages of steaks, valued at $92.87, were found inside the book bag. The Bedford man, 47, was cited for theft. See more South Euclid news at Cleveland.com/south-euclid. If you would like to discuss the police blotter, please visit our crime and courts comments page.

GMR8 Birthday Club Police: Man distributed narcotics from motel 2017-04-14T01:59:30Z Posted by Allison Munn, Anchor - Reporter BioEmail Connect Biography amunn@kait8.com Follow @allisoncmunn Michael "Brad" Johnson (Source: Craighaed County Sheriff's Department) JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) - A Jonesboro man was arrested for allegedly distributing narcotics from an area motel. Agents from the 2nd Judicial District Drug Task Force received information that Michael "Brad" Johnson was distributing narcotics from the Scottish Inn motel, 3116 Mead Dr., in Jonesboro. Surveillance at the hotel showed Johnson walk back and forth between two hotel rooms with a man and woman before walking out to a maroon car in the parking lot. There, the three popped the hood of the car and started digging around in the engine compartment. When an agent approached the car and identified himself, Johnson "quickly grabbed a plastic Walmart sack, stuck his left hand inside his left pocket and concealed something into the Walmart sack." A probable cause affidavit states Johnson then tried to shove the bag into the engine. "I quickly gained control of Johnson and detained him for further investigation," court documents state. Inside the Walmart sack, the agent found approximately 3.6 grams of meth divided into 4 baggies. "Just under the plastic Walmart bag I observed a black sock stuffed down in the engine that had a large bulge in the bottom of the sock," the affidavit said. Inside the sock was another 13.8 grams of meth, a used meth pipe, a set of digital scales, and several individual plastic bags. Johnson was charged with possession of meth or cocaine with purpose to deliver, a Class A felony. He could face 6 to 30 years in prison and up to $15,000 fine if convicted. He also faces a Class D felony for possession of drug paraphernalia. His bond was set at $3,500. He's back in court May 30. Copyright 2017 KAIT. All rights reserved.

'No matter where you are, Daddy, no matter what you've done we just want you to come home. We miss you so much,' Cummin's daughter, Erica Osborne said on ABC. She added: 'We're here for you, no matter what anytime, any place, anywhere.' The Tennessee teacher allegedly abducted Elizabeth Thomas on March 13, and the two, thought to be in a sexual relationship, were last spotted two days later. Their last confirmed sighting was at a Walmart in Oklahoma after they had both dyed their hair. Authorities have not yet been able to locate them despite a nationwide manhunt. Pharmacy staff across the country are now being asked to keep an eye out for Cummins, who is believed to be running out of his blood pressure medication.  Scroll down for video  Tad Cummin's daughter, Erica Osborne (above) urged her father to come home and said: 'We're here for you, no matter what anytime, any place, anywhere' His wife Jill Cummins revealed Tad had left her a note before his disappearance, but a district attorney said it was a 'diversion'. Pictured right, the teacher's other daughter Ashlee Conner The 50-year-old's wife Jill Cummins revealed her husband had left her a note before his disappearance, but she declined to disclose the message, citing the ongoing investigation. But Brent Cooper, the district attorney for Maury County, Tennessee, told WREG: 'It’s obvious that it was a diversion, just a way to try and buy some extra time and give us a false lead of what direction they might be going.' The note did not mention Thomas.  Jill Cummins, who has since filed for divorce, said: 'He was my everything, he was my best friend for 31 years. 'It was, to me, the perfect marriage. We had everything we ever wanted, two beautiful kids, beautiful grandkids, and I really truly believed that he loved me,' she said. Cummins (right) allegedly abducted Elizabeth Thomas (left) on March 13, and the two, thought to be in a sexual relationship, were last spotted two days later Cummins' other daughter Ashlee Conner, wanted to remind her father of Romans 8:28, a Bible verse she learned from him.  'There's one thing that he's reminded us for our entire life. And that's Romans 8:28, and that's, 'God uses all things for the glory of those that love the Lord and are called according to his purposes' and that means even this,' Conner said.  Thomas' father previously said Cummins misled his daughter to believe the health sciences teacher was a former intelligence officer living the high life. 'He convinced her that he had been a secret agent and ... that he had all kinds of money,' Anthony Thomas told HLN. 'It was clear that he had really put a lot of notions into her head.'  Her sister, meanwhile, fought back tears when she revealed Cummins had begun showing up unannounced at her sister's work shortly before the pair disappeared together, with his last visit just two days before the girl's abduction. 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' explained Sarah Thomas. 'She thought it was the only way. She felt uncomfortable.'  Authorities believe Thomas may have gone willingly with Cummins, who they say has been grooming her for sex for some time.  This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished. She appears to be holding a bundle of clothes With the two now on the run for a month, authorities say Cummins should be due for a refill on medication to control his blood pressure. Cooper toldABC News that pharmacists should be mindful of customers who look like Cummins or Thomas and alert authorities.  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert for Elizabeth when she first disappeared.  Cummins is wanted by authorities on charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor.  On March 12, the day before they vanished, Cummins was spotted buying women's dark brown hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart. He also appeared to have bought men's toiletries. Days earlier, he took out a $4,500 loan and was also seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day of their disappearance. Surveillance footage from a Walmart in Oklahoma two days after they vanished is the last confirmed sighting of the pair Cummins was spotted buying women's dark brown hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart the day before they vanished.

The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 5) was passed by the House of Representative in January and could be voted on by the Senate in May.  The 11 firms - Campbell Soup Company, Cargill, Coca-Cola, CVS Health, Domino’s Pizza, General Mills, PepsiCo, Target, Walgreens, Walmart and Yum! Brands - belong to the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers or the Business Roundtable, which have endorsed the bill. Campbell Soup Company response Of Campbell Soup Company, Cargill, Coca-Cola, General Mills, PepsiCo and Walmart who we contacted, only Campbell Soup Company responded in time for deadline. “While we haven’t taken a specific position on HR 5, we have long supported regulatory improvements that reduce duplication and inefficiency while maintaining the highest standards of safety, quality, transparency and accountability,” said the firm. “We will monitor this legislation carefully if and when it is considered by the US Senate.” Supporters say it aims to eliminate red tape and regulations to lift unnecessary burdens and to promote jobs, innovation and economic growth. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Environmental Working Group, Food & Water Watch and Food Policy Action sent a letter to the companies pushing them to reject what has been dubbed the “Filthy Food Act.” “Manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants generally take food safety seriously, which is why they should not stand by while their trade associations try to dismantle the food safety system,” said Michael F. Jacobson, CSPI president.  The coalition said the legislation would require agencies such as the US Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration to seek the least costly approach to food safety problems. Consumer group pressure It would create an ‘unprecedented regulatory gauntlet’ through which no food safety rule or guidance could pass, they said in the letter. “The “Filthy Food Act” would arbitrarily cut science out of the regulatory process, replacing public input and expert analysis with never-ending reviews and layers upon layers of wasteful Congressional and judicial red tape. These changes would paralyze the federal response to emerging public health and safety threats, including threats to food safety.” Adoption of food safety rules has often followed outbreaks that exposed system problems, said the coalition. “For example, the year after the 1993 Jack in the Box outbreak, the USDA declared E. coli O157:H7 to be an adulterant, effectively banning the sale of meat contaminated with the pathogen. According to CDC estimates, the rate of E. coli illnesses has fallen by nearly 50% since this rule went into effect. “Regulatory policy must be able to address emerging threats, such as disease-resistant “superbugs” and risks arising out of new production methods.” A previous letter from the six and six other groups was sent to Ron Johnson, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and governmental affairs chair, and ranking member Claire McCaskill.

The stolen vehicle had been traced to Davernier Capon Parker’s home on Shorecrest Drive in Columbia, Kershaw County sheriff Jim Matthews said in a news release. As Richland County deputies waited for a search warrant, Parker allegedly drove away in the stolen car to the Walmart where he worked. A search of his home turned up a gun described by the carjacking victim and the victim’s cell phone, Matthews said. The carjacking occurred around 1:13 a.m. Thursday in the parking lot of Harbor Freight in Lugoff. The victim told authorities he was carjacked at gunpoint by four people.   Parker and a 16-year-old unnamed female juvenile were charged with carjacking. Parker also was charged with possession of a weapon during commission of a violent crime. Parker was being held at the Kershaw County Detention Center Thursday night. The juvenile was turned over to the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice although she will be tried as an adult, Matthews said. The two other suspects in the carjacking have been identified and are being sought, Matthews said.

The retail giant will not disclose how many jobs could be in question, but in January Wal-Mart confirmed 1,000 corporate jobs across the business would be eliminated. Wal-Mart said it was wrong to assume the majority of the cuts were in Bentonville, but that is where the vast majority of the corporate support jobs are located. Talk Business & Politics reported last week that around 300 additional jobs were being eliminated in the company’s Information Systems Division (ISD). Sam’s Club and the International division are also again having layoffs, though Wal-Mart will not say how many jobs are being cut. The retailer did refute rumors of 1,840 jobs being purged as well as 400 more jobs from the ISD being shuttered this week. “I can confirm about two dozen jobs were eliminated in the International Division this week,” said Randy Hargrove, Wal-Mart corporate spokesman, adding that rumors of hundreds more cuts aren’t true. REGIONAL IMPACT He said as Wal-Mart continues to look carefully at the business there will be jobs eliminated and positions added. He gave no details or specifics. When asked about local employment numbers, Hargrove also said the company won’t break those out any longer, but will refer to total company employment in the U.S., internationally and combined. Talk Business & Politics research indicates that Wal-Mart has shuttered close to 1,000 jobs in Northwest Arkansas this calendar year. Those jobs came from several departments such as replenishment, Human Resources, Sam’s Club, technology and international positions in Bentonville. Hargrove said just because a job is eliminated doesn’t mean the displaced worker will leave employment with the retailer. He said there are always jobs open and displaced workers can apply for those positions. He did not say how many did apply, nor how many open positions the company has. Cameron Smith, CEO of Cameron Smith & Associates, an executive search firm focused primarily on retail vendor companies, said his office continues to receive dozens of emails and calls from displaced Wal-Mart employees. He said his office is again in triage mode trying to help those displaced. The next two weeks are also packed with layoff interviews. Other technology companies in the region report interest in hiring some of the displaced tech talent, and Smith’s team is working to help those with transferable skills. Michael Harvey, interim CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Council, said Wal-Mart has to do what’s necessary to remain a vibrant company in a sector that’s in the midst of transformation. He said the lost jobs will be felt in the region, but there is some insulation as a number of smaller enterprises continue to grow, with some of those being service providers to Wal-Mart. Greg Hamilton, senior economist for the Institute of Economic Advancement at University of Arkansas Little Rock, modeled the impact of the 1,000 lost corporate jobs in Northwest Arkansas. Hamilton confirmed Thursday (April 13) the loss of 1,000 corporate jobs could create an economic loss of $47 million annually and also result in the loss of 390 non-Wal-Mart jobs. He said that loss also factors in the displaced workers leave the region, which is not likely the case for everyone. He said a silver-lining could be found by smaller service-related companies such as CaseStack or Rockfish now finding the talent they need to expand. “That’s precisely how urban economies are born,” Hamilton said. When looking at the retail job growth in Benton County, Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Advancement, said Benton County experienced strong growth in retail jobs in recent years. Between 2007 and 2015 retail jobs in the county grew by 35%, compared with 8% in Washington County and 5% statewide. He said statewide retail jobs had been one of the strongest sectors of growth. Between 2010 and February 2017 retail jobs increased 15% across the state. He said that growth has since flatlined. RISING EXPENSES Over the past 10 years Wal-Mart Stores’ its Selling, General and Administrative costs (primarily overhead expenses and labor-related costs) rose 59.4%, growing from $63.892 billion in 2007 to $101.853 billion at the end fiscal 2017 which ended Jan. 31. However, net sales revenue grew from $344.759 billion in 2007 to $481.317 billion in 2017, a gain of 39.6%. Expenses which include salaries and employee overhead costs have certainly risen faster than sales. “We need more speed and less bureaucracy” to better serve shoppers to save them money and time, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon noted in a January memo to employees. In that same memo, McMillon said in an effort “to stay lean and fast” some positions within the company were being eliminated, but some positions would be created. In 2007, Wal-Mart reported 1.36 million employees in the U.S. and 550,000 employed internationally for a total payroll of 1.91 million people. In 2017, Wal-Mart said it employs nearly 1.5 million in its U.S. division and 800,000 abroad for a total of 2.3 million people. Over the decade Wal-Mart has grown its total employment by 390,000 people, or 20.4%. Hargrove confirmed Wal-Mart has eliminated about 18,000 jobs since early last year. He said many of the affected employees have been reassigned with other jobs in the company. For instance, about 6,000 of the 7,000 back-office jobs eliminated in September 2016 were reassigned. Likewise, he said more than 50% of the 10,000 jobs lost with store closures in February 2016 were also retained. Earlier this year Wal-Mart announced plans to hire 10,000 to staff its new store expansion (55 stores) this fiscal year. While Wal-Mart has slowed its new store expansion, it plans to remodel 550 stores this year. Wal-Mart has also increased its spending on boosting wages, enhanced training academies, online fulfillment capacity and enhanced technology capabilities to the tune of more than $4 billion in the past two years. The moves were largely applauded by Wall Street even at the expense of earnings through next year. The business restructuring is likely to continue as the retail sector grapples with omni-channel demands. Harvey say it’s important that Wal-Mart invest for tomorrow and thankfully the company has the financial wherewithal to do so. He said as many retail brands struggle with this transformation, Wal-Mart is retooling itself for the long-run which is a positive for Northwest Arkansas, even if that means the retailer employs fewer people in the region.

On the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme, Iyer shared his views with a select group of journalists, including Sudipto Dey of Business Standard, on the global retail major’s various India initiatives. Edited excerpts: When you joined in 2014, Walmart’s India project was going through some turbulence. How have the past three years been in terms of what you set out to achieve? Walmart India became a 100 per cent subsidiary of Walmart Stores International from January 2014. The past three years were good. Our focus was on building a strategy for our cash-and-carry business, creating growth plans for the next few years, and setting the agenda for the right way of doing business. There was a lot of focus on compliance and (having) robust processes within the business. Overall, we have built the foundation for a pipeline of stores for future growth. We have done well in all these measures. We are ready to roll out more stores on the ground from early next year. We have 21 stores, and are on track to have 50 by 2021. As we speak, we have 16 stores in the pipeline, at various stages of development.  Are you looking at presence in any state other than where you are present? Our major focus has been on states where we are already present. So, the new stores will be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. We are currently not looking at new states but have been studying Karnataka with a lot of interest. A deeper penetration in existing states makes better business sense.   How much of what is sold in India is being sourced from within the country? Local sourcing makes a lot of sense from economics point of view. Imports are expensive. Safely, 97 per cent of what we sell in our stores is locally procured. Locally produced goods have a lot of demand with our customers, namely the kirana stores.  Has Walmart India taken any call on whether it wants to enter the food retail space (which was opened up for 100 per cent FDI last year)? It (100 per cent FDI) is a good initiative towards helping farmers double their income. It will reduce food wastage and help in development of cold storage backend. We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time will look at that sector. How ready is Walmart India for GST from July 1?  As soon as the rates are announced, we would be 100 per cent ready. The preparation is in progress. It is also important to help our partners in the whole process. Many of our partners are small and medium enterprises and regional suppliers. Helping and educating them is also an important part of the agenda.  What is the idea behind Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme? Are there plans to increase the number of woman suppliers in the supply chain? The focus of the women entrepreneurship programme has been on depth and not scale. We have taken 32 women-owned businesses as part of the nine-month programme that initially started as a pilot. Strategically, it works well for Walmart India to have a pipeline of women suppliers in the ecosystem. When women become entrepreneurs, their social status in the country also goes up. We currently have around 50 women suppliers in our ecosystem – around nine from this group are getting on board.  We started in 2015 with the target of doubling the sourcing (from women suppliers) from the India market. We will launch another programme this year to take this forward.  One of the researches done by Walmart in the United States a couple of years ago showed that products from women-owned business were perceived to be of higher quality by the customers. We launched a woman-owned business logo and put it on these products and the shelf. We found customers had greater liking for these products. From that point of view, supporting women-owned business is a strategic initiative and makes good business sense. As part of increasing gender diversity in India, we have been able to increase women participation at the store level to 16 per cent across all our stores. Our target is to have 25 per cent women store managers over the next five years.

How ready is Walmart India for GST from July 1?  As soon as the rates are announced, we would be 100 per cent ready. The preparation is in progress. It is also important to help our partners in the whole process. Many of our partners are small and medium enterprises and regional suppliers. Helping and educating them is also an important part of the agenda.  What is the idea behind Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme? Are there plans to increase the number of woman suppliers in the supply chain? The focus of the women entrepreneurship programme has been on depth and not scale. We have taken 32 women-owned businesses as part of the nine-month programme that initially started as a pilot. Strategically, it works well for Walmart India to have a pipeline of women suppliers in the ecosystem. When women become entrepreneurs, their social status in the country also goes up. We currently have around 50 women suppliers in our ecosystem – around nine from this group are getting on board.  We started in 2015 with the target of doubling the sourcing (from women suppliers) from the India market. We will launch another programme this year to take this forward.  One of the researches done by Walmart in the United States a couple of years ago showed that products from women-owned business were perceived to be of higher quality by the customers. We launched a woman-owned business logo and put it on these products and the shelf. We found customers had greater liking for these products. From that point of view, supporting women-owned business is a strategic initiative and makes good business sense. As part of increasing gender diversity in India, we have been able to increase women participation at the store level to 16 per cent across all our stores. Our target is to have 25 per cent women store managers over the next five years.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday First they wanted free. Now they want fast. As shoppers turn to the convenience of cyberstores, they crave shipping that can keep up with their demands. "For consumers, it's one of the top things they're looking for, and it's a decision maker between buying at one site versus another," says Aaron Cheris, a partner in the San Francisco office of Bain and Co., a management consulting firm. Most Popular 3 Bob’s Stores, 1 Eastern Mountain to close Company buys LI firm, will move most jobs out Judge OKs Dowling sale; firm to make it K-12 school LI fireworks entrepreneur, musician dies at 61 LI firm struggles to find enough qualified hires Free shipping is expected, says Luke Knowles, founder of Free Shipping Day, a one-day, annual online-shopping event in December. On Dec. 16, 2016, more than 1,000 retailers offered free shipping and delivery by Christmas Eve. Retailers have answered the call for free and swift delivery in different ways. Under Amazon's subscription model, members pay a fee to get free shipping. Wal-Mart and Best Buy provide free and fast shipping if you meet their conditions. Should you still pay for a subscription? It depends. Before you decide, consider how often you order and what you'll get beyond shipping. Here's what you should think about. LOW MINIMUMS If your orders meet minimum-purchase thresholds, you can get speedy and free delivery without a subscription from some retailers. advertisement | advertise on newsday Wal-Mart announced free two-day shipping on eligible orders of $35 and above on more than 2 million items in categories from food to electronics while eliminating its membership program in early 2017. Best Buy offers free two-day shipping on thousands of items for orders of $35 and up. Apple boasts free two-day shipping on most in-stock products. "The first battle was (over) free," says Cheris, of Bain and Co. Now, consumers have their eyes set on two-day delivery. "One of the problems with the old, 'I'll get it to you in three to five days' is, well, which is it? Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? The nice thing about two is it's not only faster, but it's more specific." FEATURES Even if free two-day shipping becomes standard, don't dismiss subscriptions. Consumers should consider other features, Cheris says. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff For instance, a membership at shopping service ShopRunner unlocks free two-day shipping on eligible items at hundreds of participating retailers. After a 30-day free trial, the fee is $79 a year or $8.95 a month. Amazon Prime is perhaps the best known of all programs. After a 30-day free trial, members pay $99 a year or $10.99 a month to get free two-day shipping on more than 50 million items, plus free same-day and two-hour delivery on household goods, groceries and other items in select cities. Shoppers also get extras such as video and music streaming. "The reason people join is for the free, fast shipping, but the reason they stay is because a lot of them get attached to other stuff, whether it's Prime Now or Prime Pantry or Prime Instant Video," Cheris says. See if you can share your membership and split the price. At Amazon, two adults can form an Amazon Household to share select benefits of Prime, like free shipping and photo storage. A membership to online marketplace Google Express can be shared with one person in your household at no additional cost. After a three-month free trial, the program costs $95 a year or $10 a month for free same-day delivery on eligible orders. advertisement | advertise on newsday PRICE When shopping without a membership, ensure that a retailer with free shipping isn't charging more for its products than what you would save on shipping. For example, a pair of Nike running shoes recently sold for $48.75 at J.C. Penney with $8.95 shipping, for a total of $57.70 before tax. The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It's a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands. advertisement | advertise on newsday If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. "It depends on how frequently you shop the category," McLean says. "I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you're buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that's a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories." MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. "Shoppers are winning here," says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder. Get the Biz Briefing newsletter! The latest LI business news in your inbox daily.

He can afford it: He’s raised more than $8.3 million and spent the bulk of it on advertisements introducing himself, vowing he’ll stand up to Donald Trump and countering attack ads” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution]. Recall that Thompson couldn’t get the Democrats to give him $20K for a mailer. DNC Deckchair Perez: “We need a 50-state strategy plus the territories, and that’s what we talked about down in Atlanta last week.” Really? When does it start? GA-06: “Georgia’s 6th congressional district, which covers much of Atlanta’s northern suburbs, including parts of Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton counties, is exactly the type of district Democrats will be eyeing as they seek to take back the lower chamber: An affluent district in a Sunbelt suburb that has backed Republicans for decades but where Trump significantly underperformed Mitt Romney in November” [Heavy]. In other words, Clinton’s post-Convention pivot to appeal to suburban Republicans all over again. (Here, the Times reinforces this message.) GA-06: “The district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. It is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well-educated immigrants from India and other parts of Asia” [Reuters]. As above. GA-06: “Jon Ossoff, a Democrat running in a suburban Atlanta district that once elected Newt Gingrich and which has voted only for Republicans for Congress since 1978, has captured liberal Californians’ political imaginations — and their checkbooks. He’s raked in $8.2 million in the past three months, almost all from outside of Georgia, thanks to a strong anti-Trump message. And he’s reported more individual contributions from the Bay Area than from his entire home state” [San Jose Mercury-News]. I’m surprised I haven’t seen the words “California carpetbaggers” in the Republican advertising… GA-06: “On the economy, Ossoff says he will create ‘forward-looking, fiscally responsible economic policy that maximizes opportunity for entrepreneurs, workers, and investors'” [Cosmopolitan]. Neoliberal bafflegab. I’m shocked. GA-06: “There’s certainly some irony in the fact that this supposed beacon of the Trump resistance is actually running as a pragmatic centrist, stressing that ‘cutting wasteful spending is not a partisan issue’ and ‘both parties in Washington waste too much of your money'” [The New Republic]. Irony? What irony? UPDATE KS-04: “Democrats Say They Sometimes Need To Ignore Elections In Order To Win” [HuffPo]. The headline is accurate: “‘You do not get to the single digits in a district like this if you’re a nationalized Democrat,’ said Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the [DCCC]. ‘End of story. That’s just the way it is. There are just certain races where it is not helpful to be attached to the national D.C. Democrats. It is the calculation you make in even the most competitive swing district.'” First, Meredith needs to talk to Tom about that 50-state strategy. Second, the DCCC can’t even manage to launder $20K for a mailer? WTF? UPDATE “Daily Kos Is Back” [HuffPo]. Markos offers a similar rationalization to Kelly’s: “Editorially, we refused to take sides when it really would’ve been easier to do so. Too many organizations on our side took the easy way out and worked to build their memberships by tapping into the Sanders movement.” Statesman-like. If we have any Kos readers in the commentariat, I’d be interested to see what they have to say about that, but I think it’s time to link once more to this truly classic post: “In The Vaults Where The Dry Powder Is Stored.” “Why Americans Vote ‘Against Their Interest’: Partisanship” [New York Times]. ” Party affiliation has become an all-encompassing identity that outweighs the details of specific policies… Economic status, it turns out, is not so important in partisanship. “Class in American politics, rich vs. poor, is just not a very good predictor of party identification,” Ms. Lee said. For both rich and poor Americans, other identities take precedence.” And that’s just how the Times likes it! “Katie, Remember Us When” [Credit Slips]. “Katie is leaving Credit Slips is to focus her efforts on her recently announced candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California’s 45th Congressional District.” More on Porter, who’s running as a Democrat. UPDATE “Meet The Democratic Socialist Running For City Council In Brooklyn” [Gothamist]. On the Green Party ticket. “DSA, the largest socialist organization in the country, has gained national momentum with its anti-capitalist platform since Donald Trump won the presidential election and, as organizers put it, ‘used racism to divide working people.'” UPDATE This (very long) thread where people tweet on “How I became a leftist” is intriguing: Quote [or reply to] this tweet w/ what brought u towards a radical leftist critique of the system. And where were u politically before that? — TayGo (@taygogo) April 12, 2017 Stats Watch Jobless Claims, week of April 8, 2016: “Initial jobless claims continue to surprise to the downside” [Econoday]. And: “This marks 108 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970″[Econintersect]. And: “below the consensus forecast” [Calculated Risk]. Consumer Sentiment (Preliminary), April 2017: “[S]howing new strength” [Econoday]. “Strength is centered in the current assessment… This offers a positive indication for April consumer spending. Expectations are also higher… signal confidence in the jobs outlook… The report notes that divergence in its sample between Republicans and Democrats has fully narrowed on the current assessment but remains unusually wide on expectations where Republicans see strength and Democrats weakness… The 17-year high on the current conditions index, at a time when consumer spending is weak and GDP soft, is a reminder that high confidence readings have yet to translate to economic strength.” And: “The partisan expectations do not appear to have had an impact on current spending” [Economic Calendar]. Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, week of April 9, 2017: “[B]ack at its best levels in March” [Econoday]. “Strength in confidence readings ultimately points to strength in the jobs outlook.” Or it’s another survey that turns out not to be reflected in real data. Producer Price Index (Final Demand), March 2017: “[M]ore subdued than expected” [Econoday]. “The lack of pressure in services points to a general lack of price traction consistent with sluggish demand. Today’s report may lower expectations for tomorrow’s consumer price report.” And: “Mostly the data shows Producer Price data was treading water. In general, it is goods that remains on an inflation surge trend whilst services inflation has been generally unchanged over the last year. This month’s inflation data is better than expectations” [Econintersect]. Shipping: “North European shippers of heavylift and out-of-gauge cargo to the Middle East and Asia are being told by container lines there is no hope of shipment before June” [The Loadstar]. Time for the AN-225s! That is, the AN-225; only one has been built…. Shipping: “Surging trade at U.S. ports isn’t translating into a stronger trucking market, with some of the industry’s biggest fleets warning of smaller-than-expected first-quarter profits” [Wall Street Journal]. “Excess capacity has plagued the trucking industry, making it difficult for fleets to raise the rates they charge retailers, manufacturers and other shippers even when freight volumes rise.” Supply Chain: “Amazon.com Inc. has joined a truck-driver on-boarding portal that will allow it to recruit thousands of owner-operators to haul for Amazon’s last-mile delivery services” [DC Velocity]. Hope the working conditions are better than warehousing. Or Uber. Retail: “Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is betting its physical stores will give it a leg up on Amazon.com Inc. as the two retail giants battle for online sales. Wal-Mart will start offering discounts on some online orders if customers agree to pick them up in stores” [Wall Street Journal]. Retail: “Burger King is launching a TV ad that triggers Google Home devices, and it has a potentially disastrous flaw” [Business Insider]. “The 15-second ad triggers Google devices with the command, ‘Ok Google, what is the Whopper burger?’ The ad’s command got our Google Home speaker — sent to us by Burger King — to recite the definition of a Whopper burger from its Wikipedia page…. Here’s where we encountered the major flaw with Burger King’s ad. Someone had edited the Whopper’s Wikipedia page to say that the burger is made of a ‘medium-sized child,’ instead of beef patty, and that it contains the toxic chemical Cyanide.” https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-12/curious-case-of-the-billion-dollar-lithium-mine-sold-for-a-song?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social Commodities: “Curious Case of Billion-Dollar Lithium Mine Sold for a Song” [Bloomberg]. The Bezzle: “Wells Fargo, Banned From Bond Work, Wins California Deal Anyway” [Bloomberg] The Bezzle: “Top federal Wells Fargo inspector removed” [CNN]. Honey for the Bears: “The retail apocalypse is having a terrifying impact on one corner of Wall Street” [Business Insider]. “Nobody is predicting anything [as dire as the Crash] today, but CMBSs, which Morgan Stanley says account for nearly 10% of the $3.6 trillion commercial real-estate mortgage market, work similarly. They pool debt payments from several malls or other commercial properties and then splice them so that investors can buy the segment and take on the kind of risk they want.” Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 28 Fear (previous close: 28, Fear) [CNN]. One week ago: 43 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Apr 13 at 12:09pm. Our Famously Free Press “A new survey from BuzzFeed News and Ipsos Public Affairs also found that 54% of American adults trust news they see on Facebook ‘only a little’ or ‘not at all’ [Buzzfeed]. The article includes these charts. The first, on which posts are “news”: And the second, on “why don’t you trust the news you see on Facebook”? All in all, what I see in the charts is that Americans are reasonably discerning “consumers” of “news,” which does rather contradict the moral panic over “fake news.” Indeed, given that Americans tend to regard branded (“traditional”) news as the most trustworthy, it would seem that any problems with Facebook mis- or disinforming the public should begin with the news brands, and not with obscure sites or this week’s macédoine of offshore hackage, as indeed we see with the United story, where major venues can’t even agree on a basic timeline for a single, discrete incident. Health Care “There’s a growing movement of surgery centers and specialists that list their prices and don’t take insurance” [Business Insider]. “[M]ore than 60 percent of the [medical debt] complaints made one of the following contentions: that the debt wasn’t owed in the first place, that it had already been paid or had been discharged in bankruptcy, or that it wasn’t verified as debt the consumer actually owed” [New York Times]. Water “Jerry Brown’s administration blocks public review of Oroville Dam records” [Sacramento Bee]. “Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration is using federal security regulations written to thwart terrorism to deny public access to records that experts say could guide repairs to the Oroville Dam and provide insight into what led to the near catastrophic failure of its emergency spillway. The administration also is blocking public review of records that would show how Brown’s office handled the February crisis at Oroville Dam that led to the two-day evacuation of nearly 200,000 Northern Californians.” Well, well, well…. “Oroville Dam spillway: Here’s where things stand now” [KCRA]. A status report. Dam geeks? “What is the volume of water in lakes on Earth? Using a mathematical analysis, researcher David Seekell, at Umeå University, and his American collaborators now suggest that the mean depth of lakes is 30 per cent lower than previously estimated. Shallower lakes implies less fresh water and has consequences for our understanding of climate change and the carbon cycle” [Phys.org]. “After more than 20 years of mapping the need for a deep-water storage reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee, the Florida Senate voted 36-3 Wednesday for an ambitious proposal that will set in motion the $1.5 billion project” [Miami Herald]. “Oklahoma’s drinking water is at risk from fracking, new report finds” [Think Progress]. Gaia “TransCanada shuts down Keystone after oil seeps to surface” [National Observer]. “‘My understanding is that it was a passerby that observed it and called the company,’ said Nelson, chairman of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. If confirmed, this would mean that the company’s leak detection system failed to identify the incident.” Class Warfare “Why Socialists Should Believe in Human Nature” [Jacobin]. “The slogan is not, ‘Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains. Unless, in some cultures, people like being in chains, in which case, we demand that those people be allowed to keep their chains.'” “BlackRock CEO Fink Says Trump Listens to Business Leaders” [Wall Street Journal]. “‘He is embracing business,’ said Mr. Fink, a longtime Democrat, at a dinner Wednesday hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. ‘I do strongly believe he is listening.'” Trump is an oligarch. Of course he’s listening to business! “KY justice secretary responds to frustrations from medical examiners” [WKYT]. “[Justice and Public Safety Secretary John Tilley] said much of the problem is the ripple effects from a tidal wave of overdose deaths. ‘Our medical examiners are inundated with heroin overdose deaths. The frustrations are high and the resources are low,’ Tilley said.” “A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university’s president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure” {Business Insider]. Administrators…. News of the Wired “Five inmates from the Marion Correctional Institution (MCI) built two computers from spare parts, hid them in the ceiling of a training room closet, and used them to hack into the prison’s network” [Bleeping Computer]. Impressive. Shows initiative. “We’re finding that aesthetic images can induce staggering changes to the body, including radical reductions in the observer’s stress levels” [The Conversation]. The story hook is fractals, and fractals are cool, but the effect of aesthetics is my takeaway. “The impact of nature’s aesthetics is surprisingly powerful. In the 1980s, architects found that patients recovered more quickly from surgery when given hospital rooms with windows looking out on nature. Other studies since then have demonstrated that just looking at pictures of natural scenes can change the way a person’s autonomic nervous system responds to stress.” Important! * * * Readers, feel free to contact me with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, and (c) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00400 This entry was posted in Water Cooler on April 13, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

It’s the same shit they’ve been using since the 1940’s. High explosive. What’s new, according to the guys selling them, is that they built a bigger one. More HE. That’s it. Why didn’t they build a bigger one sooner? Because it’s impractical. What if Raytheon comes out tomorrow with the Grandmother of all bombs- 50,000 lbs of HE in a shipping container. “OMG- it’s unholy!’ Yup, and just a “barrel bomb”. This is a defense contractor ad campaign. The one “new” bit to the Moab is what they case it in- Hardened steel. But again, this goes back to the WW2 days. They used gun barrels at that time. The hardened steel helps the bomb dig deeper before exploding. It’s still not very good at digging. And, again, nothing new. Reply ↓ bob April 14, 2017 at 12:23 am I just looked it up again. The Moab is not hardened. It’s just more HE in one bomb than is practical. Why is it impractical? You also have a have a big, heavy, slow target carry it. I’m still waiting for someone to propose a great grandmother of all bombs GGMOAB, a railcar with 100 tons of HE. It’s impractical in the sense that it needs a railroad to be built before it can be delivered. Next up- GGGMOAB- 150 tons of HE on a barge. A bargain at 50 million. Just add a river, and it’s there….

In 1944. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_bomb The worst bit is this- ” Like the Tallboy, because of the low rate of production and consequent high value of each bomb, aircrews were told to land with their unused bombs on board rather than jettison them into the sea if a sortie was aborted.[8]” Not only did they make the pilots TAKE OFF with that damn thing, if they survived that, they might have to try to land with it? Fiscal responsibility. Another own goal opportunity. Every time I see the “outrage”, I see another defense contractor getting paid.

Not good for any tech infrastructure. One of those “own goal” prone weapons. Yea, yea…the US has shielded everything. You wanna be the person to test that theory, from 30,000 feet?

It’s a thermobaric bomb with a destruction radius of nearly 1,000 feet and a blast yield of nearly 44 tons of TNT. Plenty of errors for a short article. For one, the US “MOAB” named version is supposed be like 20 tons of TNT so daddy is twice as big. Altho the Rooskie one supposedly weighs less. But Western Intel doubts the Russian specs. Either one is plain old chemical explosives, but the Russian one claims to make a bigger bang because they mixed in some new ingredients that burn twice as hot. The idea with these things is that the super hot burning in the warhead makes a heat driven shockwave that is intense and can cause damage for miles, because it is detonated before hitting the ground. Comparing them with a barrel bomb is rather silly. They weigh 20,000 pounds, and no one builds them in thier back yard.

No one ever thought to make one that big before because you can’t attach that kind of weight to most planes, and have them fly. This is just an ad campaign for 1940 x 2.2. Nothing new, only the idea that you can do something with one bomb that 2 can’t do. Reply ↓ JTMcPhee April 13, 2017 at 10:35 pm Oooh, MOAB like Evil Barrel Bombs! How about a little digging into what “barrel bombs” actually are: a couple of hundred pounds of explosives and rag-tag shrapnel, with a fuse lit from a cigar in the cargo area of a Russian-designed “Hip” helicopter and pushed out by a nervous Syrian enlisted man, at heights above 7,000 feet since US -supplied MANPADS missiles make the kind of low-altitude “precision bombing” done earlier in the conflict decidedly unhealthy for the bombardier. Here’s a substantive explanation, http://brown-moses.blogspot.com/2013/12/syrias-barrel-bomb-technology-relative.html, for anyone wanting to get past the “scare quote” level of understanding what these ad-hoc do-it-yourself munitions actually are. Put that up against the MOAB, a weapon just waiting (like so many other Great American Battlespace Innovations) for a place to use it, to “prove the concept,” and prime the production line and move the product out the distribution chain… It’s all, in the end, about body counts anyway. And for tonight’s laugher from the idiots making war on the landscape in Notagain?istan, here it is: “As ISIS-K’s losses have mounted, they are using IEDs, bunkers, and tunnels to thicken their defense,” Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said in the statement. “This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K.” Say again, General: What is the mission? Reply ↓ bob April 14, 2017 at 12:02 am “How about a little digging into what “barrel bombs” actually are: a couple of hundred pounds of explosives and rag-tag shrapnel,” How is that different that the MOAB? Because the US mil pays more. A moab is just HE plus metal, plus a giant profit for defense contracting middle men. A barrel bomb is HE plus metal. Is the problem here -the “morality” – that the barrel forgot to pay a kickback? Does the morality increase its yield? Or is it the selling that rids the bomb of any semblance of reality? Reply ↓ bob April 13, 2017 at 9:42 pm “With a one-mile blast radius” Bullshit. Who ever said that is either selling them, or part of the fake news problem. It may have been big, but not that big. Reply ↓ JTMcPhee April 13, 2017 at 10:39 pm Hey, for those wanting to try their hand at simulating a MOAB detonation over a personally disliked area (Pentagon, south end of Manhattan, [unnamed state capitol]), this article and the links therein will give you the thrill a mission planner gets at his Battlespace Manager station, as he or she lays out the scenarios… http://www.businessinsider.com/effect-of-moab-bomb-on-new-york-city-2017-4 And “blast radius” simulation does not include the effects on the bodies of people within the weapon’s range — anyone that’s ever been near a reasonable-sized detonation and survived, knows that the internal organs like lungs take a pretty bad pounding, often resulting in bleeding and, you know, death. Half a mile, one mile, big difference, right? Reply ↓ bob April 13, 2017 at 11:52 pm Neither of those- one mile, half a mile, for a “kill radius”, let alone a blast radius. Much less. It has a “yield” of 22,000 pounds of TNT. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_Blast_bomb It’s 11 tons of HE. Fat Man, of WW2 fame- 21,000 tons of HE equivalent, and a 1-2 mile “blast radius” So, 21,000 tons of HE to get a blast 1-2 miles wide. How far does 11 tons get you toward that 1-2 miles? 11 / 22,000 less than .0001 percent of the size of Fat Man’s yield DOES NOT EQUAL a one mile blast radius. Not even half a mile. Back when the military was about actually blowing shit up, instead of trying to sell shit, they found they could do a whole lot more damage with (10) 2,000 lb bombs. which equals 10 tons of HE, a little less than a MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS!!!! Most WW2 bombers took off with more HE on them. Are they as evil as a MOAB? Does splitting up the HE make it less evil? Yes? Then what about “cluster bombs”? What about the act of making 20,000 lbs of HE fit into more or less “bombs” makes it more or less evil? I can’t follow the math here. Is there an equation? Outrage advertising for the defense contractors. Selling WW2 “TNT” for a 12000% markup- because it pisses idiots off! Less effective use. More bang. Sounds like a winner, get marketing on it!

While the U.S. had never used it before, the military had dropped more than 12,000 bombs on Afghanistan in President Barack Obama’s second term. In 2016, it dropped 1,337 bombs on the country.” “Nicholson told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February that several thousand more troops are needed to break the “stalemate” in their fight against the Taliban. There are currently 8,400 U.S. troops in the country, conducting counterterrorism operations against insurgents and training and advising Afghanistan’s military. Another 6,400 troops from other NATO countries also are in Afghanistan. Last year, Obama announced that he would keep that number until the end of his term instead of dropping it to previously planned troop levels of 5,500 by early 2017.” ____________ So after 16 years, the US Military has fought to a “stalemate” with the Taliban, says Gen.

In which case walking past and seeing the ‘spruced-up’ environment is unlikely to be a psychic balm, because the person walking was probably forced out years ago, so that she now visits her old haunts only to practice the Bitter, the Hollow and the Mirthless laugh (all rise for Samuel Beckett) in that order. None of which invalidates the work of those fine gardeners mentioned by jrs and ulysses and also active just around the corner here, where they are precisely the enemies and potential victims of the real estate developer/city council alliance against human and built ‘eyesores’, i.e. the relatively poor majority and the objects they/we rely on.

Particular thanks then, diptherio, for describing it so well as subjective need (and no less real for that) rather than in terms of “nature is good for you/cities bad” (or the insufferable flipside, the virtues of the ‘vibrant’, ‘creative’ asset-backed city so beloved of Richard Florida, Demos and countless European metro-area mayors). Having witnessed — and occasionally, as a privileged invited guest, been drawn into — others’ intense attachment to certain non-urban places, I really do suspect that your gut response and mine have more in common than not, just with the terms reversed. And definitely more in common with one another than either has with the sort of status-calculation (BIG house = ‘achievement’), aesthetic atrophy, top-down class hatred and straight-out racism that gave us upscale exurbs. (The return of the exurbanites to colonize the cities and kick out the poor is another story, already a long one now.) The mini-McMansion/pool and two garages/gated community idyll seems to presume that what the luck owner sees out the window simply doesn’t matter, because all meaningful life (outside the thrill of career competition) happens inside the nuclear-family bunker (and its outpost, the apartment-size car). Whereas — perhaps — the need for mountains/trees/rocks/sea out the window and the need for street noise pouring through it at 4am both have something to do with a sensitivity to human and inanimate surroundings. Maybe those of us devoted to wilderness and those bound to cities share a lack of gated self-satisfaction, so that we require our immediate surroundings to be alive and seething with finely detailed meaning. Witnessing my brother and members of his adopted Ngati Porou whanau ‘read’ the subtlest natural encryptions of the forests of Te Ika a Maui (formerly NZ ‘North Island), I have repeatedly been struck by the similarity to the way my elective whanau/Genossen/innen here in London ‘read’ our never-silent, never-‘vibrant’ streets.

Reply ↓ Toshiro_Mifune April 13, 2017 at 2:33 pm GA-06 – The district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. It is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well-educated immigrants from India and other parts of Asia So they’ve gone out of their way to find a district that fits their ideal in order to prove their message is correct. Reply ↓ Deadl E Cheese April 13, 2017 at 3:30 pm It’ll be hilarious when these fainting-couch frauds lose this district by a larger amount than when the underfunded Berniecrat lost Kansas. Liberals have at this point completely bought into the self-serving lie that most of the top 5-30% are in their tank, they just need to be a little woker. They simply can’t bear the thought that overal support for reactionary politics are correlated with wealth, because that would render their appeal and thus political ethos a top-to-bottom lie. Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 13, 2017 at 5:01 pm Do we know for sure Ossoff can’t get to 50+1% in this round? I think it’s very important he lose. The idea that the Ds might be able to swing the House seems unlikely, but it will clearly be better if they can’t swing it at all. We need to flush those rats out if at all possible; all other paths forward are much slower or risk even more violence. Today’s news is just so comprehensively depressing.

Reply ↓ Carolinian April 13, 2017 at 4:07 pm I once lived in Ga 6 and Newtie was my congressman. While I haven’t been following the race I’d be very surprised if the Dem wins, particularly now that Trump has taken up the mantle of Obomber. The district has both a major defense plant and an active air base. F-18s would do touch and gos and fly over your house at, like, 200ft. While the area has been changing since I moved away and has more suburban sprawl Georgia in general has become more Republican since the Jimmy Carter era. Reply ↓ Vatch April 13, 2017 at 4:15 pm The Democrat Ossoff has a good chance of finishing in first place in the primary, since the Republicans are so fractured. But this won’t elect him to Congress unless he wins more than 50% of the vote. A likely outcome is first place for Ossoff with 35% to 45% of the vote, followed in succession by several Republicans, who will probably get more total votes than the five Democratic candidates get. In the runoff, it will be Ossoff versus the Republican, and the Republican will almost certainly be the winner. Millions of dollars will have been wasted by the Democrats, and a small fraction of that money would have gained them a victory in Kansas. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 13, 2017 at 4:39 pm If memory serves Gingrich moved to District 6 from a different district precisely because it was considered such a safe Republican district. Back in the 90s it was the great Dem dream to get rid of Gingrich by defeating him in District 6 but they never did. Reply ↓ Big River Bandido April 13, 2017 at 5:20 pm I am certain that you are correct about how the race will shake out. The idea that the same kind of neoliberal nonsense that failed for the last 39 years will somehow, this time, manage to win is straight out of Dante. Except that in the Democrats’ case this is not insanity but “strategy”. As for “millions of dollars will have been wasted by the Democrats”: this is nothing compared to the billion dollars Hillary Clinton tossed in the shitcan last year. Besides, the word “wasted” is opinion and its truth depends on who you ask. Yes, the Democrats have been a sinkhole of liberal dollars for 3 decades. But those aren’t “wasted” dollars — they have suckled a huge astroturf industry and an army of professional grifters for a generation. Those people, at least, will have secure jobs — no matter how many more elections and opportunities the Democrats lose. Reply ↓ Craig April 13, 2017 at 4:34 pm Seems we have a natural experiment on which of the approaches might work.

Reply ↓ Darius April 13, 2017 at 5:41 pm The DCCC wouldn’t be pouring millions into GA06 unless Ossoff was a Hillary Obama type Dem. Democrats won’t win if they keep to a strategy of appealing to people with advanced degrees plus minorities plus LGBTQ. They don’t get enough turnout because identity politics doesn’t motivate people who are struggling economically.

But if people call, the callers will have personal experience with the non-responsiveness of these organizations. I called the DNC and the DCCC yesterday, and nobody answered the phones. I had to navigate their intentionally obscure voice mail system before I could leave a message. And now I can tell people exactly what happened.

It would be cause for concern if they were uniformly bad, but that seems unlikely. His department was solidly behind him, and colleagues are capable of noticing inadequacy too. I think it likely the one vote against him on the tenure committee was the provost, who has probably joined with the president in what appears remarkably like a plan to milk faculty for seven years of work and then replace them with cheaper models.

Reply ↓ Art Eclectic April 13, 2017 at 3:26 pm My observation has been that party division is more accurately predicted on a a person’s view of human nature. 1) Believes humans are basically good and need only gentle guidance to do the right thing. 2) Believes humans are basically lawless and need a firm hand to keep them in line. Whichever side of that line you fall on tends to dictate party preference. Personally, I think humans are mix. Or more accurately, the mix is gender related. Men need a much firmer hand than women, so they’ve invented for themselves religion, government, and the military mostly to keep other men in line. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 13, 2017 at 4:08 pm 1) Believes humans are basically good and need only gentle guidance to do the right thing. Does that guidance come from basically good humans (who need guidance) themselves? Or does it come from something external to humans? 2) Believes humans are basically lawless and need a firm hand to keep them in line. What or who will provide the firm hand to keep these basically lawless humans in line? From outside, again? I think about these and I don’t know. Do we know? Do we need someone or something outside for answers? Do we seek answers from trees, cats, dragons, etc? Reply ↓ clinical wasteman April 13, 2017 at 6:21 pm And I think I detect a trio of Begged Question alarms ringing louder and louder somewhere. i.e. 1. “Lawful” = “Good”?! 2. “Guidance” has less in common with an invasive “firm hand” than the two share with each other?! 3. “Good”, “bad” and “lawful” are all personal qualities of the person so described, not something to do with effects on other people? Goodness and gentleness are not just unlawful but positively forbidden in many jurisdictions (except in the form of “charity”, i.e. toss a coin to your victim’s caseworker after delivering the last kick). And vice-versa. The opposite of gentleness has far more to do with institutional policy than individual nastiness, and “lawfulness” is its trump (pardon) card. If anyone is ever going to change all that, sign me up for the long march of the Lawless, not the blameless petitioning of the Good.

Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 13, 2017 at 5:30 pm I’m leery of getting into a gender based fight here at the moment, but I completely disagree. I do not believe men innately need a “firmer hand” than women. I don’t think there is a trace of evidence you can show to demonstrate this. Social and cultural conditioning starts very early to prod humans into two sharply delineated genders far beyond what operational differences would exist absent all that conditioning. Then all the institutional structures that force people down various cattle chutes on the basis of these artificial gender differences also impact their experiences and thus their beliefs. Much of this current conditioning and these structures are designed to facilitate patriarchal capitalism; it isn’t natural by any definition, and it brutalizes most men as well as most women to deliver its bounty to the tiny group at the top. Some men are authoritarian followers. So are some women. Some men are greedy bullies. So are some women. The men I personally know well need no firm hand. Like a lot of women who have rebelled against our conditioning, I have personally suffered more often from women trying to police my behavior — although I have, as related previously here, suffered my share of sexually-based oppression and punishment. Reply ↓ craazyman April 13, 2017 at 6:06 pm what happened when they tried to police your behavior? did you flip them the bird? that’s what I’d do. I had a senior colleague once who gave me a hard time — an ex-Navy guy but I actually knew him pretty well. I won’t tell the whole story but i wanted to come and work for him not for a jerk I was workign for. He told me I needed to prove myself! I had over and over and over — to his benefit! I told him what a bunch of fkkng nonsense that was and I cursed him out to his face right in his office. He was fairly shocked. But he did what I wanted within a month and he hired me into his department! LOL No lie. he did! He never gave me any attitude once after that at all either. Not once. And he was a crusty guy who the office sheep feared like he was some kind of macho dude, which he really wasnt. See that’s the good thing about guys is you can tell them to go eff themselves & flip them the bird and they can get over it. Or most can. I’m not sure if women would get over something like that. It’s not something I’d say to most women, but if one was my boss and she was trying to boss me around I sure as hell would. No lie. that must be why the reptilians flipped the bird at Neil Armstrong when he landed on the moon — they were upset with something NASA did evidently. It’s a well known fact that doesn’t require me to defend it — from a veracity standpoint. It wasn’t personal withh Neil, no doubt. And I bet we could work it out with the reptilians if everybody chilled and thought about what was true. Reply ↓ Yves Smith April 13, 2017 at 5:40 pm I agree 100% with Marina. Conditioning of girls to be quiet and well behaved is intense and starts early. By contrast, a very successful guy I know commented on the age at which it became clear to him that he’d be cut slack (he instigated a rebellion in class, the teacher knew he did it but he was not punished because he was a good student). He said based on his talks with other successful men, they’d all had similar realizations pretty early on. By contrast, I misbehaved in school a few times at a much younger age than when his incident occurred and was clearly a bright kid and not mean or destructive, just a bit willful. Yet I was expelled once and beaten with a belt another time. I can pretty much guarantee nothing like that would have happened to a male, it would have been laughed off as “boys will be boys”.

As in, it just didn’t work. I went to a boys’ boarding school in the late 50’s. One friend was running a contest with a girlfriend to break all the rules. She had about twice as many – so I’d say you have a case about the general culture, at least in the past. Reply ↓ UserFriendly April 13, 2017 at 9:45 pm Well at least in my experience it was certainly not the authority figures that were doing that conditioning. I very intentionally give off a vibe of ‘don’t talk to me’ especially when I was in school. I also happened to wear nothing but black, had a ton of piercings, and dyed my hair every color of the rainbow. None of that was because I had any problems talking to people, I just had no interest in talking to the kind of people that were bothered by something as stupid as my choice in clothing. Some of my best friends made the exact opposite fashion choices but came over and said wow I love your hair or something like that. Anyways, as a masculine gay guy who really didn’t feel the need to make my personal life public many people weren’t sure about my sexuality and I always told my friends that if someone wanted to know they could ask me and I’d tell them but otherwise it was none of their business… That let me float between my straight female friends and straight male friends as not threatening. From what I saw, almost all social conditioning came from mass media being one upped. You had this impression that guys in highschool were all getting laid all the time and so of course plenty of guys lied and said they were, and then it just became self fulfilling. In reality, most of them thought it was hollow and didn’t really want to do it, but the one upmanship and the need to fit in… Girls on the other hand were usually taught to feel insecure about some body feature, and that they needed to not be seen as a slut so they needed to find one guy to date for as long as possible, because they like sex too but they knew all the other girls would tear her to shreds if she admitted that she liked banging a different guy every weekend. Where as a guy might just as well not have to worry about putting himself out there to be judged by girls every weekend but he would usually have at least one friend who would give him shit if he dated the same girl too long and kept encouraging him to play the field. Some much of it came straight out of insecurity of what their peer group would think of them. But I never saw authority figures go ‘boys will be boys,’ if anything I saw female teachers give male students crap for trying to get away with stuff like that. Which is why I guess being a gay guy is the best of both worlds in that respect. It has never taken me more than 3 hours to find a hookup if I am so inclined and I don’t get judged for doing so. But considering my life is a cluster**** I haven’t been bothering with that much lately. Reply ↓ Fiery Hunt April 13, 2017 at 9:59 pm Nice, UserFriendly.

Am reminded of The Offspring’s lyric… “We all just want to re-arrange.” Fix You Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 14, 2017 at 12:10 am Social conditioning begins at birth — if not before. The instant a woman knows which sex she is carrying, she and the world around her treat her and the fetus differently depending on which one it is. There are lots and lots of studies to back this up. Women will eat more protein for a boy fetus — or their families/partners will make them. Girls are more likely to be aborted or left to die in the woods. There are differences in how and how often they are picked up and touched from the moment of their birth. Reactions to crying, sleeping and climbing are all gendered, by EVERYBODY the baby comes in contact with — parents, relatives, caregivers, strangers in the store. So babies are being conditioned with both positive and negative reinforcement as soon as they breath oxygen. It’s not that only girls get punished for being rambunctious. It’s HOW they get punished — not just what the teacher does, but how the other students react to it, how the parents react it. Boys also suffer when they don’t sufficiently fit acceptable gender behavior. I wasn’t saying — and I don’t think Yves was saying — that only girls get punished for acting up. It’s the nuances that matter. We all swim in an endless, all-encompassing river of gender conditioning 24/7, which is designed to divide all of us against our own natures, to make us more malleable to the system that enriches the few.

Reply ↓ Huey Long April 13, 2017 at 3:46 pm Chuck Spinney’s take on the Trumpster’s 59 tomahawk tweet: The Malleable Bi-Partisan Utility of Poison Gas If there was a centerpiece to Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign for President of the United States, it was her struggle to convince the American people that Donald Trump was congenitally incapable of reacting rationally when surprised by a dangerous international crisis. She struggled futilely to contrast her experience and gravitas to Trump’s reckless impulsiveness. In a rational world, the recent Trumpian brain fart of firing 59 cruise missiles (worth about $90 million) at a nearly empty — and forewarned — Syrian airfield should be a candidate case study to test Clinton’s psychological theory. But it won’t be. Mr. Trump merely did what Ms. Clinton called on him to do (see this video) a few hours prior to the attack. Moreover, the political response to Trump’s attack has been one of widespread bipartisan support, with particular enthusiasm among senior Democrats [e.g, see 1, 2 3] Read the rest Reply ↓ Carolinian April 13, 2017 at 8:38 pm Thanx for the link.

BTW – Has anybody been following the movement for the March For Science on April 22? I find it interesting where I am (Traverse City, MI) that while there was an outpouring to march for the pink pussy hats earlier this year, there is no verve for a public support of science. I guess that is the difference between identity politics and supporting a reality that organizes our understanding of the Cosmos. I will be marching at another location. But I also wonder: how is it that politicians who decide otherwise from the scientific consensus really don’t want to own their decision? The default stance is science denial rather than a clear exposition of their reasoning. Reply ↓ Huey Long April 13, 2017 at 5:22 pm RE: March for Science I think the March for Science’s dearth of public support as compared to the pink pussy hats has more to do with the pussy hats having Mighty Wurlitzer backing than with actual public support for science.

Wilgus April 13, 2017 at 9:06 pm Don’t quite catch your drift and wonder if you have been paying attention to the anti-science thrust of the republicans and understand that science, as a discipline, are the techniques along with free inquiry and communication that allow us to answer questions about the physical universe. It’s applications are technology. I’ve done basic research a long time ago in molecular genetics and experimental pathology and did work in the corporate world applying statistical design of experiments to demonstrate the quality and reproducibility of processes. Yes, even though my area was not considered a profit center, it allowed a highly regulated corporation to make money. However my first and last thought was “am I comfortable putting this in my veins or those of my family.” Some product managers tried to avoid me since I could point out, after sampling a production run of material they wanted to import, just how the manufacturer was spoofing the process rather than building in quality. I march to decry the science denial rampant in my country that equates ignorant opinion with my knowledge. I march because I expect that even if they do not like the findings of science, politicians must recognize those findings and own their decisions that act contrary to the scientific consensus. And, just pointing out that scientific consensus is not easily reached without an insane level of confidence, because no scientist ever made a name for themselves by doing me-too research.

Meanwhile, the Fed has hiked the Fed Funds rate — the overnight rate which it controls — twice since then, to about 0.90%. When short-term rates rise toward longer-term rates, this is called a flattening of the yield curve. Generally it signifies lower growth expectations.

Crews were at the former home of the ex-boyfriend of Kelsie Schelling in the 5100 block of Manor Ridge Drive. Police said investigators were following leads and excavating areas of the backyard where Donthe Lucas, who previously was named as a person of interest, previously lived. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the Pueblo Parks and Recreation Department were assisting police. Donthe Lucas and Kelsie Schelling Schelling was last seen at the Wal-Mart store in the 4000 block of West Northern Avenue in Pueblo on Feb. 4, 2013. She texted a photo of her eight-week ultrasound to Lucas, then made the two-hour trip from Denver to Pueblo to meet Lucas at his request. She arrived at the Wal-Mart just after 11 p.m., and nearly an hour later, texted that she was "tired of waiting," reports ABC News. Lucas asked her to meet on a street near his grandmother's house; a half hour later, she wrote: "Where are you ... I've been here for over an hour just waiting." She was never heard from again. Lucas later withdrew $400 from an ATM using Schelling's card. He was also seen driving her vehicle to the Wal-Mart parking lot. On Feb. 7, someone wearing a hoodie was seen driving off in the car from the Wal-Mart parking lot. It was later found at St. Mary Corwin Hospital. Police previously questioned Lucas but have said they did not have enough evidence that he was involved in Schelling's disappearance.

Now they want fast. As shoppers turn to the convenience of cyberstores, they crave shipping that can keep up with their demands. “For consumers, it’s one of the top things they’re looking for, and it’s a decision maker between buying at one site versus another,” says Aaron Cheris, a partner in the San Francisco office of Bain and Co., a management consulting firm. Free shipping is expected, says Luke Knowles, founder of Free Shipping Day, a one-day, annual online-shopping event in December. On Dec. 16, 2016, more than 1,000 retailers offered free shipping and delivery by Christmas Eve. Retailers have answered the call for free and swift delivery in different ways. Under Amazon’s subscription model, members pay a fee to get free shipping. Wal-Mart and Best Buy provide free and fast shipping if you meet their conditions. Should you still pay for a subscription? It depends. Before you decide, consider how often you order and what you’ll get beyond shipping. Here’s what you should think about. LOW MINIMUMS If your orders meet minimum-purchase thresholds, you can get speedy and free delivery without a subscription from some retailers. Wal-Mart announced free two-day shipping on eligible orders of $35 and above on more than 2 million items in categories from food to electronics while eliminating its membership program in early 2017. Best Buy offers free two-day shipping on thousands of items for orders of $35 and up. Apple boasts free two-day shipping on most in-stock products. “The first battle was (over) free,” says Cheris, of Bain and Co. Now, consumers have their eyes set on two-day delivery. “One of the problems with the old, ‘I’ll get it to you in three to five days’ is, well, which is it? Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? The nice thing about two is it’s not only faster, but it’s more specific.” FEATURES Even if free two-day shipping becomes standard, don’t dismiss subscriptions. Consumers should consider other features, Cheris says. For instance, a membership at shopping service ShopRunner unlocks free two-day shipping on eligible items at hundreds of participating retailers. After a 30-day free trial, the fee is $79 a year or $8.95 a month. Amazon Prime is perhaps the best known of all programs. After a 30-day free trial, members pay $99 a year or $10.99 a month to get free two-day shipping on more than 50 million items, plus free same-day and two-hour delivery on household goods, groceries and other items in select cities. Shoppers also get extras such as video and music streaming. “The reason people join is for the free, fast shipping, but the reason they stay is because a lot of them get attached to other stuff, whether it’s Prime Now or Prime Pantry or Prime Instant Video,” Cheris says. See if you can share your membership and split the price. At Amazon, two adults can form an Amazon Household to share select benefits of Prime, like free shipping and photo storage. A membership to online marketplace Google Express can be shared with one person in your household at no additional cost. After a three-month free trial, the program costs $95 a year or $10 a month for free same-day delivery on eligible orders. PRICE When shopping without a membership, ensure that a retailer with free shipping isn’t charging more for its products than what you would save on shipping. For example, a pair of Nike running shoes recently sold for $48.75 at J.C. Penney with $8.95 shipping, for a total of $57.70 before tax. The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It’s a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands. If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. “It depends on how frequently you shop the category,” McLean says. “I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you’re buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that’s a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories.” MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. “Shoppers are winning here,” says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

The cameras capture everything Ceaser Emanuel, the CEO and owner of Black Ink, has to do to guarantee the success of the Harlem, New York, shop. From building a brand and managing a business to leading his family and love affairs, and stopping fists from flying, Emanuel juggles it all. According to Emanuel, a misconception people have about the shop is that it was easy to open and build. “A lot of people don’t understand the struggle of this whole Black Ink thing. It didn’t just start with me; it was a whole bunch of us,” he said. “I pushed it, but people need to understand that it’s hard to come out of your comfort zone.” The first shop opened on 113th Street, near one of the most notorious projects in Harlem. Emanuel hoped to shine a light in a neighborhood people didn’t want to be in. Through growing the Black Ink brand on 113th, the shop made it cool for people to visit that area in Harlem. Furthermore, his success forced people to recognize that Black youth can become successful in a number of ways. After moving the shop to 125th Street, one of the most robust business areas in the city, Emmanuel began focusing on franchise opportunities. “When you see a Red Lobster and a Bed Bath and Beyond next to you, you realize you are a franchise now. That’s why I’m expanding the way I am. After I opened Atlanta, I’m now focusing on Orlando, then Houston. My goal is to hit 10 shops,” he said. “I want to show kids in the ‘hood that you don’t have to dribble a basketball or go in the studio and rap. Look at me, I’m a tattoo artist, and I’m getting it.” While the shop has done a lot of positive things for Emanuel, the crew, and the community, the negative isn’t that far behind. Fame has changed a lot of things for the young CEO, from his everyday life to his personal relationships. “Having a relationship in the public is one of the most difficult things … it’s hard,” he said. When a public figure is in a relationship, according to Emanuel, attacks can come from anywhere. There are misleading photographs from paparazzi and untruthful tabloid stories. The young mogul explains that even his cousin was once mistaken for his girlfriend. “Nothing is the same anymore; everything is different. I can’t even go to a Walmart because someone might write about me being in Walmart. But why can’t I go to Walmart? They have lots of cheap things and I could use the things in there,” he said. The paparazzi and gossip online aren’t the only issues. One of the things America watched develop on the hit series was the romance between Emanuel and Cristana “Dutchess” Lattimore, a Black Ink tattoo artist and CEO of the Pretty N Ink tattoo shop. The two went from friends to lovers, to ultimately being engaged, but things have not remained that way between them. “There will be no wedding between me and Ms. Lattimore. We will not have anything, ever,” he says, adding, “We don’t even talk anymore. We walk past each other and don’t say anything to one another. When they say there’s a thin line between love and hate, it really is a very thin line.” Emanuel explains that his relationship with Dutchess has dwindled as a result of her use of social media to “take shots” at the Black Ink executive. He denied any and all allegations of getting anyone pregnant outside of his former engagement, despite Dutchess’ accusations. But that drama is in his rear view now, Emmanuel has moved on and is currently dating again. “It’s been a while since I’ve been this happy,” he said. “I’m just having fun and riding the wave. I’ll see where things go.” Recently, Emanuel revealed that he’d been dating Karlie Redd, another reality television star from VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop Atlanta,” for a little over a month now. With so much going, it’s hard to imagine that Emanuel has time for anything else; however, he focuses on finding ways to get away from all of the drama and spend time with his daughter. “I first started doing tattoos almost 10 years ago. At that time my daughter was conceived, and I was running the streets. I couldn’t let my daughter suffer the consequences of my actions, so I set up in a different career,” he said. “Everything I do is for her.” Altogether, Emanuel continues to manage Black Ink and all of its related responsibilities. He keeps the business growing and continues to create a vast amount of opportunities for people in his community, and now communities nationwide. With the expansion of the Black Ink brand, he hopes to create a legacy he can leave behind that will make both him and his daughter proud. While he faces challenges in his love life and professional life, he makes it a point to count his blessings and continue to push his brand in a way that makes an impact on the culture. Ceaser takes 4 with W. Neil What separates you from others in your field? What is unique to the experience that you create? The fact that I’m a real businessman and not just an artist is what I believe separates me from others in my field. I have seen a lot of artists come and go, but I feel like I’m on a great path crossing urban into commercial. We’ve brought value to an industry that thought we weren’t valuable at all. Please define your personal brand. I’d say “Black Ink Crew” was revolutionary for the urban community. Personally, though, a lot of people don’t know that I’m actually a dope artist. I haven’t been able to portray a lot of that on the show, but hopefully, in season six you’ll get to see a lot more of my creative side. Are there any adjustments you’ve made in your day-to-day life since becoming a reality TV star? My whole life was adjusted after becoming a reality star. Now I have to live in a different light, being from Harlem we already live a flashy lifestyle, but it’s enhanced [by] being on TV. All in all, it’s a blessing. Name two of your top role models; one from your industry and one from outside of it. Within my industry, I would say, Mya Bailey, because he was the first tattoo artist I looked up to. He set the tone for the next generation. He documented the history of the Black tattoo artist. He opened my eyes to different things. Outside of the industry, I would say 50 Cent because he doesn’t take s— from anybody and that’s how you have to be in the entertainment industry. He is self-made and self-taught.

On Dec. 16, 2016, more than 1,000 retailers offered free shipping and delivery by Christmas Eve. Retailers have answered the call for free and swift delivery in different ways. Under Amazon's subscription model, members pay a fee to get free shipping. Wal-Mart and Best Buy provide free and fast shipping if you meet their conditions. Should you still pay for a subscription? It depends. Before you decide, consider how often you order and what you'll get beyond shipping. Here's what you should think about. LOW MINIMUMS If your orders meet minimum-purchase thresholds, you can get speedy and free delivery without a subscription from some retailers. Wal-Mart announced free two-day shipping on eligible orders of $35 and above on more than 2 million items in categories from food to electronics while eliminating its membership program in early 2017. Best Buy offers free two-day shipping on thousands of items for orders of $35 and up. Apple boasts free two-day shipping on most in-stock products. "The first battle was (over) free," says Cheris, of Bain and Co. Now, consumers have their eyes set on two-day delivery. "One of the problems with the old, 'I'll get it to you in three to five days' is, well, which is it? Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? The nice thing about two is it's not only faster, but it's more specific." FEATURES Even if free two-day shipping becomes standard, don't dismiss subscriptions. Consumers should consider other features, Cheris says. For instance, a membership at shopping service ShopRunner unlocks free two-day shipping on eligible items at hundreds of participating retailers. After a 30-day free trial, the fee is $79 a year or $8.95 a month. Amazon Prime is perhaps the best known of all programs. After a 30-day free trial, members pay $99 a year or $10.99 a month to get free two-day shipping on more than 50 million items, plus free same-day and two-hour delivery on household goods, groceries and other items in select cities. Shoppers also get extras such as video and music streaming. "The reason people join is for the free, fast shipping, but the reason they stay is because a lot of them get attached to other stuff, whether it's Prime Now or Prime Pantry or Prime Instant Video," Cheris says. See if you can share your membership and split the price. At Amazon, two adults can form an Amazon Household to share select benefits of Prime, like free shipping and photo storage. A membership to online marketplace Google Express can be shared with one person in your household at no additional cost. After a three-month free trial, the program costs $95 a year or $10 a month for free same-day delivery on eligible orders. PRICE When shopping without a membership, ensure that a retailer with free shipping isn't charging more for its products than what you would save on shipping. For example, a pair of Nike running shoes recently sold for $48.75 at J.C. Penney with $8.95 shipping, for a total of $57.70 before tax. The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It's a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands.

If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. "It depends on how frequently you shop the category," McLean says. "I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you're buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that's a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories." MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. "Shoppers are winning here," says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder. --------- This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

The Indian arm of the US-based Walmart Stores today held a graduation event here, wherein 32 women entrepreneurs graduated from its Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme (WEDP) that aims to enhance their skills, capability and sustainability. At the graduation event, Walmart announced the project's continuation into the second year. "If you look at the gender diversity or gender equality, India is not at a very good place. The WEF data is there... We are 87th as far as gender equality is concerned," Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer told reporters at a select media briefing here. It had taken the 32 women on-board last year, after launching the development programme for women-owned businesses in the segments such as food, handicrafts and seasonal decor, among others. Emphasising on the need to promote women entrepreneurs in India, Iyer said: "It is the responsibility of public sector as well as private sector to provide the level playing field to women and provide equal opportunity and that's what we are tring to do". As far as economic equality is concerned, we are 136 out of 144 countries, Iyer noted. The company works with non-profit organisation WEConnect International and Vrutti, a centre for sustainable livelihood, to implement the training programme. The criteria for selecting women entrepreneurs are that the business should be 51 per cent owned and controlled by one or more women, have a minimum turnover of Rs 10 lakh and should be in existence for three years. Noting that women entrepreneurs contribute to the social development of the country, Iyer said: "I don't call it just the women's economic empowerment, I would say it an economic and social empowerment, because when women become entrepreneurs, the social status in the country also goes up. The company has about 50 women suppliers and nine have been on-boarded with recently concluded programme, out of the with 32 who have been trained.

The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It’s a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands. If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. “It depends on how frequently you shop the category,” McLean says. “I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you’re buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that’s a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories.” MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. “Shoppers are winning here,” says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder. ——— This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

The Indian arm of the US-based Walmart Stores today held a graduation event here, wherein 32 women entrepreneurs graduated from its Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme (WEDP) that aims to enhance their skills, capability and sustainability. At the graduation event, Walmart announced the project's continuation into the second year. "If you look at the gender diversity or gender equality, India is not at a very good place. The WEF data is there... we are 87th as far as gender equality is concerned," Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer told reporters at a select media briefing here. It had taken the 32 women on-board last year, after launching the development programme for women-owned businesses in the segments such as food, handicrafts and seasonal decor, among others. Emphasising on the need to promote women entrepreneurs in India, Iyer said: "It is the responsibility of public sector as well as private sector to provide the level playing field to women and provide equal opportunity and that's what we are tring to do". As far as economic equality is concerned, we are 136 out of 144 countries, Iyer noted. The company works with non-profit organisation WEConnect International and Vrutti, a centre for sustainable livelihood, to implement the training programme. The criteria for selecting women entrepreneurs are that the business should be 51 per cent owned and controlled by one or more women, have a minimum turnover of Rs 10 lakh and should be in existence for three years. Noting that women entrepreneurs contribute to the social development of the country, Iyer said: "I don't call it just the women's economic empowerment, I would say it an economic and social empowerment, because when women become entrepreneurs, the social status in the country also goes up. The company has about 50 women suppliers and nine have been on-boarded with recently concluded programme, out of the with 32 who have been trained. It identifies women-owned businesses as future Walmart India suppliers as the products fits the assortment apart from meeting all the other parameters to becoming a suppliers.

(WDRB) -- The former owner of Pet Haven Cemetery is in new trouble. Patricia Karsner is now behind bars in the Hardin County Detention Center, charged with theft by unlawful taking under $500. Her attorney, Jeff Sexton, says she's accused of shoplifting from a local Walmart. The police report says witnesses observed Karsner concealing merchandise in a clear plastic tote and, when confronted, she left the parking lot. Sexton says she was found a half-mile away from Walmart. Police say they searched her vehicle and located a clear box containing items totaling over $66. Sexton says she denies she was shoplifting. Her bond is set at 10-thousand dollars full cash for the theft charge. Sexton says she was also convicted of custodial interference on Wednesday in her Hardin County trial that lasted two days this week. Karsner filed a federal lawsuit against against the Radcliff Police Department after police said on body cam video they broke her arm in Sept. 2015. She was in the middle of a custody battle with the father of her children. Sexton says he intends to appeal the conviction. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 16th at 10am. Sexton says the jury recommended the minimum of one year behind bars. Karsner made headlines for the poor condition of her Shepherdsville cemetery. She sold it after asking people to dig up their pets' graves.

Often centuries old but full of freshness, markets are usually packed with dozens of vendors and worth visiting even if you have no intention of cooking anything yourself on your vacation. 1. La Boqueria: Barcelona, Spain Believed to have originated in the 13th century as a pig market, the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria has grown into one of the finest outdoor markets in the world. It's home to fishmongers, butchers, cheesemongers, greengrocers and dozens of small charcuterie shops specializing in Spanish hams and cured meats. With an entrance off busy La Rambla, La Boqueria is a popular spot to stop for lunch. The counters of any of the tiny gourmet restaurants provide fresh seafood and Mediterranean specialties.

Tsukiji Fish Market: Tokyo, Japan Tokyo's Tsukiji Market is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world, selling more than 400 types of seafood, from inexpensive seaweed to sea urchin and caviar costing hundreds of dollars. The market has the distinction of supplying restaurants all over the world with fresh fish. It's also one of Tokyo's biggest tourist attractions, where visitors gather in the pre-dawn hours to gawp at the frenetic auction of dozens of enormous tuna. The outer market, located in a maze of tiny streets packed with retail shops, allows visitors the chance to purchase seafood and other food supplies and enjoy an early morning sashimi meal. 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Tokyo, Japan; +81 3 3542 1111; www.tsukiji-market.or.jp 3. Union Square Farmer's Market: New York City, United States In the 1970s, New York City's Union Square was a seedy, crime-ridden area of Manhattan until a small farmers' market took root and revitalized the area. The market has grown into one of the world's best, with more than 140 regional farmers, fishmongers, bakers and butchers catering to more than 60,000 shoppers on peak days. The greenmarket showcases more than just fresh-picked produce, though. Celebrity chefs often use the space for cooking demonstrations, there are school tours that teach local kids about seasonality and healthy eating and education programs, including one that helps New Yorkers learn about composting.

Or Tor Kor Market: Bangkok, Thailand Located next to Bangkok's busy Chatuchak weekend market, Or Tor Kor Market is as packed with perfect produce as its neighbor is with souvenirs and tchotchkes. Or Tor Kor displays exotic fruits and vegetables that are unique to Thailand, as well as imported specialties from around Asia. The market is immaculate and brightly lit, allowing shoppers to easily cruise for seafood, sweets and cooked foods. Tourists will enjoy Or Tor Kor's wide selection of prepared curry pastes and spices to take back home, and a food court filled with Thai specialties.

St. Lawrence Market: Toronto, Canada Toronto's St. Lawrence Market lays on one of Canada's finest shopping experiences. It's the place that Toronto locavores shop for Ontario-grown-and-made products, including the freshest produce, homemade pies, freshly baked bread and elk, venison and other locally sourced game. On Saturdays, local farmers sell seasonal organic produce at the North Market, a tradition that began in 1803 and continues today, presenting a wide selection of not just fruit and vegetables but locally produced cheeses, grains and meats. Embracing more than 120 vendors, St. Lawrence's South Market also sells imported items such as tropical fruits and avocados that are not easily grown in Ontario's chilly climate. 92-95 Front Street East, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; +1 416 392 7120, www.stlawrencemarket.com CNNGo: World's 10 most loved cities 6. Borough Market: London, England The oldest fruit and vegetable market in London is also one of the world's finest. Located in the Southwark neighborhood, Borough Market has been operating here since 1755 -- but the area has been known for its fresh market since the 13th century. Specializing in locally grown produce and fruits, hand-made cheeses and fresh breads, the wholesale market is the supplier of choice for many of London's best restaurants. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday the market is open to the public, who, in addition to doing their weekly grocery shopping, can sample the many snacks and gourmet foodstuffs on offer. 8 Southwark St., London, England; +44 (0) 20 7407 1002, www.boroughmarket.org.uk 7-million-mile family shares travel secrets 7. Kreta Ayer Wet Market: Singapore Combining the bounty of Asia's wet markets with immaculate hygiene standards, Kreta Ayer Wet Market in Singapore's Chinatown is something to behold. The market stocks a fantastic variety of fresh Asian vegetables, from bok choi to choi sum, as well as exotic ingredients such as live frogs and turtles, preserved eggs, Chinese herbal remedies and a plethora of tofu products. Named after the ox carts that were used to deliver water to the area, the market is capped by a hawker center upstairs where exhausted shoppers can sit down with a bowl of noodle soup or other local specialties. Chinatown, Kreta Ayer Road and Keong Siak Road, Singapore 8. Lancaster Central Market: Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States The United States' oldest, continuously operated farmer's market stands in the heart of Amish country in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The historic market has been in operation since the 1730s, and was granted permanent status by King George II in 1742. It remains popular today, and tourists flock here to purchase hand-crafted products and foods made by the local Amish community. While the Pennsylvania Dutch wares might be the biggest draw for out-of-towners, locals appreciate the wide variety of imported goods sold alongside local produce, fresh flowers, just-caught seafood and hearty baked breads. 23 North Market St., Lancaster, Penn., United States; +1 717 735 6890, www.centralmarketlancaster.com 9. Marché Provencal: Antibes, France Located in Antibes' historic old town, the Marché Provencal is brimming with gourmet ingredients from the Provence region of France. Visitors can learn the art of French cooking with the plethora of local specialties, including foie gras, honey, fresh lavender, wines and cheeses, fruit preserves and fragrant spices. In the afternoons local artisans display their works, from ceramics to wood carvings to paintings. Shoppers can also sit down to a coffee at one of the charming surrounding cafés or head across the street to the absinthe bar. Cours Masséna, Antibes, France 10. Kowloon City Wet Market: Hong Kong In a metropolis known for the quality and quantity of its wet markets, Hong Kong's Kowloon City wet market stands out. Both tourists and locals flock to this foodie destination for the highest-quality ingredients, including fresh imported meats hanging from steel hooks, live fish thrashing about and piles of perfect greens. The neighborhood is also home to many specialty food stores, including those in "Little Thailand" offering all sorts of Thai goods.

Michael Joseph DePatty, 35, of Bad Axe, stood mute and declared that he wanted to represent himself. District Court Judge David Herrington previously appointed attorney Andrew Lockard to represent DePatty. Lockard stood next to DePatty in court serving as his stand-by counsel. DePatty faces up to life in prison for the charge of hydrocodone delivery, the most serious charge. He also was charged with three counts of resisting and obstructing a police officer due to his behavior during his arrest. He also is being charged as a habitual offender-fourth due to his extensive criminal background and multiple charges from previous arrests, which increases the maximum time he is facing. Circuit Court Judge Gerald M. Prill asked DePatty if he truly knew what it meant to fully represent himself. “You know the saying about one who represents himself?” Prill asked. “Yes, sir,” DePatty responded. “He has a fool for a client. … I’m facing life. If you’re going to give me life, I’m going to stand by myself,” DePatty announced. Prill warned DePatty that Lockard could be called to step in if DePatty shows he is not able to provide adequate counsel for himself. DePatty also addressed the issue of requesting his written transcripts of his testimony for his probable cause hearing and preliminary examination not being submitted to him in a timely manner from district court. Prill said that a written motion must be submitted to the court, and the request will be held under advisement until the motion has been filed. DePatty later mentioned another motion regarding entrapment being involved in the case. Entrapment is a defense to criminal charges, which is based off of interaction between police officers and the defendant prior to, or during, the alleged crime that was committed. Huron County Prosecutor Timothy J. Rutkowski told the Huron County View that in his eight years in the position, he has seen one case that used entrapment as a defense, and the attempt was unsuccessful. The argument of entrapment was thrown out by Judge M. Richard Knoblock, who served as the circuit judge at the time. Prill acknowledged the motion DePatty mentioned, and once again advised him to put the motions and laws that he was citing in writing and submit them to the court for it to be taken into consideration when all motions are heard. DePatty is scheduled to appear in court next for a final pre-trial on June 5. The trial is scheduled for June 13 and is expected to last one day. If a jury convicts DePatty, he could be facing a maximum sentence of up to life in prison. DePatty remains lodged at the Huron County Jail with bond set by Prill for $250,000 cash.

The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

The move is part of the retailer’s efforts to better compete with online leader Amazon. Initially, the discount will be available on about 10,000 items. But the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer says it will then expand the price cuts to more than 1 million items by the end of June. Among some offers starting April 19: An infant car seat that was priced at $148.05 will have an additional discount of $7.40. A Lego Great Vehicles Ferry priced at $23.99 will have an additional pickup discount of $2.55. Wal-Mart is able offer the discounts by delivering the products directly to its 4,700 stores, saving on costs by avoiding shipping to individual shoppers’ homes. The offer builds on Wal-Mart’s move in late January that replaced a pilot program offering free shipping but that came with an annual fee of $49, with one that has a lower free-shipping threshold, faster delivery, and no membership fee. The retailer said it will reduce free shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items. Wal-Mart’s average time has been three to five days. Also, at the time, it reduced the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. These moves are being spearheaded by Walmart.com’s CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when Wal-Mart bought Jet.com, which he founded last year. It’s another illustration of how Wal-Mart is trying to figure out a way to compete with Amazon and its dominant Prime plan. Amazon’s membership program costs $99 a year, but includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. “We’re creating price transparency to empower customers to shop smarter and choose what’s best for them,” Mr. Lore wrote in a company blog post. Wal-Mart’s online sales rose 29 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, up from 20.6 percent in the previous period.  Related Items Wal-Mart Stores Inc , online shopping Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

Trooper 1st Class Jesse Lewis of GSP Post 7 in Toccoa said he activated his blue lights and siren to pull over a 2005 Suzuki GSXR 1000 motorcycle with no tag on Ga. 15 (U.S. 441) near Boggs Mountain Road at 5:09 p.m. Boggs Mountain Road is located near the Rabun County Arena, Rabun County Recreation Department and Rabun County schools. The motorcyclist, identified by Lewis as 45-year-old Eric Anthony Moss of Cleveland, “got up to over 100 mph before he reached the Clayton city limits,” Lewis said. Lewis said the motorcyclist was driving extremely recklessly, passing cars on the shoulder, running red lights and weaving in and out of traffic at a high rate of speed. The motorcycle ran the red light on Ga. 15 at Walmart in Clayton and “was within feet of an SUV that was coming the opposite direction,” Lewis said. Because of speed and traffic, Clayton police officers cleared the intersections on Ga. 15. “He ran all the red lights through Clayton,” Lewis said. Even though he was pursuing the fleeing driver with his emergency equipment activated, Lewis said he had to slow down and exercise due regard at each intersection where the light was red. That allowed the motorcycle to extend its lead on the trooper. “Dillard Police became the primary pursuing unit at Rabun Gap,” Lewis said. When the motorcyclist attempted to turn right onto Ga. 246 toward Sky Valley, he struck a curve and the motorcycle overturned. Moss suffered what Lewis called minor road rash injuries, but refused treatment. No patrol cars made contact with the fleeing motorcycle, Lewis said. Lewis charged Moss with 12 charges, including: felony fleeing, reckless driving, aggressive driving, driving with a suspended license, failure to obey a traffic control device, no proof of insurance on a motorcycle, failure to signal when changing lanes, failure to change address on identification card, failure to maintain lane, driving through a gore, passing on the shoulder of the road, and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. “Mountain City and Dillard took separate charges,” Lewis said. Municipal charges against Moss include: fleeing or attempting to elude police officer, speeding in excess of maximum limits, weaving over roadway, driving on wrong side of road, reckless driving, driving while license withdrawn, fleeing or attempting to elude police officer, reckless driving, too fast for conditions, improper use of central turn lane, passing in a no-passing zone, and driving while license withdrawn. Lewis said there was moderate traffic, especially in Clayton and Mountain City, at the time of the pursuit. The chase started at 5:09 p.m. and Moss was taken into custody at 5:18. “[Moss] was endangering a lot of lives the way he was driving,” Lewis said. “Nine minutes through 13 miles of Rabun County.” Moss was booked in at the Rabun County Detention Center.

I’m just wondering. If you auditioned out here in Rabbit Valley, you had some stiff competition. I mean, after all, our army of seasoned bunnies with chain-saw teeth, able to destroy lawns faster than Cal American Water, don’t dress for work. Not like you do, carrying a basket with pink satin ribbons or wearing a vest embroidered with petunias. At least, I haven’t ever seen one like that gnawing on my marigolds. Seems you outdid yourself in the audition. What do you do in the off-season? Mascot perhaps? Walmart greeter? In anticipation of your arrival, Mr. Fixit (the husband) and I have already downed a few thousand jelly beans and dozens of those crunchy chocolate eggs. What does it feel like, Mr. Bunny, to know that your customers are getting a little round around the edges, soon to be anchored like the USS Bismarck into our easy chairs? We certainly won’t be hopping down any old bunny trail. Turns out, even the frequently pregnant daughter who lives on carrot juice and chardonnay, has also polished off a few dozen bags of peanut butter eggs. Your holiday confections show no mercy. Mr. Bunny, here’s my concern: This is a tough time for us humans, and your pre-Easter temptations are not helping. I mean nobody agrees on anything anymore, and Mr. Fixit thinks kale should be landfill. I thought you rabbits were about carrots? Adding insult to injury, it’s baseball season, which means a steady diet of soft pretzels at Fiore field, followed by hot dogs at Dover-Hendrix, and don’t forget the chili dog with jalapeños after a trek to Oxnard-El Rio. Due to my three rotten grandkids, now all in the game, I’ve become a Little League ballfield cuisine aficionado. And I’ve got the beef-jerky skin to prove it. If you wanna know which field never runs out of Cheetos, you’re in the right place. “We understand plump,” Mr. Fixit announces as he’s dicing his havarti to go with pretzel chips and olives as pregame warmup for the madness of March. “We?” I ask as I sneak the last piece of banana walnut bread out of the fridge and devour it before he busts me, trying to scoop the last bits of goo out of my receding gums before I say anything. I guess he’s noticed I’m beginning to resemble Miss Piggy. Seems the 20 pounds I lost found me again. And again. “I guess you’re getting ready for the Easter Bunny,” I tell my roommate as I spy a new bag of Easter egg peanut M&M’s, purchased by Mr. Fixit. “Yes,” he admits, “but I get that one confused with the Playboy Bunny.” “Oh really?” “Yes,” he continues. “It always happens this time of year. Must be those little white tails.” Mr. Bunny, here’s my concern: This is a tough time for us humans, and your pre-Easter temptations are not helping. So, Mr. Bunny, or is it Ms.? Anyway, Madame Easter Bunny, thanks to you, my goofy husband and your Easter treats, I can only muse about when I used to remotely resemble the Playboy version of your species. Next year, only carrots and kale. Please. But can you make them taste like those crunchy little chocolate eggs? Thanks.

Nintendo will stop making its NES Classic Edition console, a retro gaming device introduced in November that reprised older games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. The video game giant said Thursday that the device "wasn't intended to be an ongoing, long-term product" despite being a hit with consumers, according to videogame publication IGN. Nintendo's decision to stop producing the console, which cost $60, is a puzzling decision, considering that it's been an unexpected hit for the company. Demand for the NES: Classic was so high that a number of retailers like Walmart had trouble keeping enough in stock despite competition from more expensive consoles with more advanced technology like Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft's msft Xbox One.

Although the console was essentially a sleeker version of the original NES gaming console, released in 1983, it was built to accommodate modern televisions and came bundled with 30 video games from the 1980s. It's possible that Nintendo stopped producing the NES: Classic because it doesn't the want the console to cannibalize sales from the company's higher-priced and more cutting-edge Nintendo Switch, released in March. Nintendo is hoping that the Switch becomes a blockbuster hit, considering the company's previous console, the Wii U, was a dud. The Nintendo Switch costs $300 and can be connected to televisions or it can function like a mobile gaming console.

As the cat said when she got her tail caught in the lawnmower, “It won’t be long now.” The construction of the new sidewalk on the north end of Main Street is almost finished. Both sides of the street [auth] to accommodate the large hoards of people walking and riding their wheelchairs to the mall and to Wal-Mart. Isn’t that great? My understanding is the state is paying for this as it’s a state highway. Maybe the fed’s kicking some help. They both have plenty of money to spread around. The federal deficit is at almost $20 trillion and the state is trying to come up with a budget to cover their deficit. Then, a large segment of this sidewalk will have to be broken up and redone when new businesses open up on the open land, driveways to their parking area. A great use of our unlimited resources.

Hurdle: No Smartwatch Until Fall (FIT) View All Posts Struggling organic foods grocer Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) received a big lift in late Monday trading on a report that activist investor Jana Partners LLC has dug in for battle with a roughly 9% stake and a few ideas on how to squeeze out more shareholder value. The news sent WFM stock up by more than 10% in quick order. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Whole Foods shares have been roughly halved from their 2013 peak amid increasing competition in the natural-foods space from entrenched competitors including Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and even Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). Jana Partners, amid disclosing its stake, says it wants the grocery chain to explore everything from operational improvements to a potential sale. Per the Wall Street Journal: “Jana, Whole Foods’ second-largest shareholder, is planning to press the chain to improve its technology and operations to better compete with larger rivals, shake up its board and find out how much a potential bidder might be willing to pay, according to people familiar with the matter.” Jana also said that it has already picked a group of potential board nominees, according to the WSJ. Whole Foods’ growth has slowed to a crawl of late, with 2016 revenues of $15.7 billion up just 2% year-over-year, with no help from comparable-store sales, which actually declined 2.5%. Worse, profitability is slowing down, with net income sliding from $579 million two years ago to $536 million in 2015, and $507 million in 2016. A report in March by Barclays described traffic declines at Whole Foods as “staggering,” not just thanks to competition from the aforementioned giants, but also smaller organic-focused rivals such as Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM) and Trader Joe’s. Barclays analyst Karen Short said “a 3% traffic decline might not seem like much, but this equates to 14 million customers.” She also showed that Kroger is likely a direct beneficiary of Whole Foods’ issues. “Our conclusion: assuming ~$30-$50 average basket sizes, we estimate ~9M-14M annual transactions left WFM in the last 6 quarters and KR, which has meaningful overlap with WFM, is likely a direct beneficiary of WFM’s share losses as evidenced by: 1) KR at $16 billion in natural and organic sales (vs WFM LTM of $15.8 billion), and 2) RS Metrics data (satellite imagery data) included herein showing both overlap with KR within various trade areas as well as traffic shifts since February 2016.” In the near-term, WFM stock very well could shed at least a little of today’s quickly gotten gains. Whole Foods shares have jumped into overbought territory at the same time that WFM’s price is approaching previous price resistance around the $35 level, last reached in June 2016. That said, Monday’s move did end up cracking all of its major moving averages, and could spark additional bullish signals if its shorter-term MAs begin to cross over their longer-term counterparts. As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since 15-year-old Thomas and her ex-teacher Cummins disappeared March 13, TBI has received 1,481 tips, said public information officer Susan Niland. Of those tips, TBI has closed 1,100 leads and continues investigating nearly 400, Niland said. Amber Alerts remain active in Alabama and Tennessee. So far, the only tip that's provided substantiated information is security footage from an Oklahoma City Wal-Mart that showed Thomas and 50-year-old Cummins inside the store on March 15. The footage wasn't shared with TBI, however, until more than two weeks later. Amber Alert video: Elizabeth Thomas and Tad Cummins seen on Oklahoma Wal-Mart video Earlier this week, the Maury County, Tennessee District Attorney asked that pharmacies be on the lookout for Cummins, who likely is running out of blood pressure medication. DA Brett Cooper also revealed information about a letter that Cummins left behind before the disappearances. Cooper told WKRN News Cummins left the note to mislead to investigators. Cummins is wanted in Tennessee for kidnapping and having sexual contact with Thomas, who was his student at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County. Authorities have said Cummins groomed and lured Thomas before kidnapping her. Thomas' father, Anthony, filed a court petition last week for potential witnesses to be interviewed in depositions. Anthony Thomas said in the court filing that Cummins threatened and stalked Elizabeth after Cummins was suspended from his teaching job. Cummins was suspended by the school system after he was caught with Thomas in his classroom in early February. Thomas and the teacher weren't supposed to be in contact because they reportedly had been caught kissing in the classroom Jan. 23. After Cummins was suspended, Elizabeth "began feeling guilty," the father claims. And, Cummins "played upon this guilt." Cummins wasn't officially fired by the school until the day after he and Thomas disappeared. Read more about how the school system responded to the incidents here. Authorities have said Cummins likely is holding Thomas in a secluded or off-the-grid area to keep both out of the public's eye. In addition to pharmacies, authorities are encouraging the public to share information about the Amber Alert with anyone they know south of the U.S. border. While investigators don't have any information placing Thomas and Cummins in Mexico, they say it's possible the two have made it that far. Mexican police have been notified about the case. The public is asked to be on the lookout, particularly in rural or secluded areas. Investigators are asking people to be vigilant in parking garages and lots, parks, campgrounds and other off-the-grid places. Prior to the Oklahoma sighting, the last information about Thomas and Cummins' whereabouts is from the day they disappeared. Thomas was seen the morning of March 13 when a friend dropped her off at Shoney's restaurant in Columbia, Tennessee. Cummins was placed in Decatur, Alabama that afternoon by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Cummins is wanted in Tennessee for kidnapping and having sexual contact with Thomas. The video and images from Oklahoma showed their appearances had been altered, including darkening Cummins' hair and changing Thomas' hair color to red. It's not clear whether Cummins may still be driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license place 976-ZPT. Thomas is a white female possibly with red, strawberry or blonde hair and hazel eyes. She is 5 feet and weighs about 120 pounds. Cummins, believed to be armed with multiple guns, is a white male possibly with dark hair and brown eyes. He is six feet and about 200 pounds. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Anyone who sees Cummins, Thomas or the vehicle should call 911. Best restaurant in each Alabama county ...

A Full List Of What’s Open And What’s Closed On April 14 BuzzWorthy 10 0 0 April 13, 2017 Good Friday 2017 Hours: Are Banks Open Today? A Full List Of What’s Open And What’s Closed On April 14 Nathan Francis Good Friday 2017 is here, but folks looking to run some errands before Easter might find that it’s difficult to determine what’s open and what’s closed. Are banks open on Good Friday? How about the post office? The answers are varied, as some organizations and businesses choose to close down or operate on limited hours on the Roman Catholic holiday that honors the death of Jesus, while others are open full-time. So if you’re planning to pick up some groceries before Easter or need to get some packages in the mail, here is a handy guide for what’s open and what’s closed on Good Friday 2017? What’s open on Good Friday? Good Friday is not a federal holiday, so government offices and locations like libraries will be open on April 14. Many school districts will be off, however. Those looking to do some last-minute shopping are in luck, with nearly all major retailers open normal hours on April 14. That means shoppers headed to Walmart, Target, Sears, and major grocery store chains will be open like any other day. The same is true of the United States Postal Service, so those headed to the post office on Good Friday 2017 will be able to get their packages in the mail. Both UPS and FedEx will also be open normal hours. Banks will also be open on Good Friday, with a few exceptions among smaller or community-based banks. GoBankingRates has a full list of the major banks that will be operating on normal hours for April 14. They include: Bank of America Capital One Bank Chase Bank Citizens Bank Comerica Bank Fifth Third Bank HSBC Bank Huntington Bank Huntington State Bank KeyBank M&T Bank People’s United Bank PNC Bank SunTrust Bank TD Bank Union Bank U.S. Bank Wells Fargo Those looking for a bit of retreat will be able to head to the movie theater, which will open normal hours. Most museums will also be open, with many trying to grab some traffic from children and families who have the day off from school and work (though some will actually be closed through the weekend). Holiday Weekend Hours????????: Closed Good Friday & Easter Monday • Open Saturday & Sunday, 11am-5pm "Many Rabbits" by Luke Anguhadluq pic.twitter.com/eiEw1RmQrn — Winnipeg Art Gallery (@wag_ca) April 13, 2017 What’s closed on Good Friday? While you will be able to get to almost everywhere you need on Good Friday, there will be some places closing down. There are 11 states that recognize Good Friday as a state holiday, GoBankingRates noted, meaning some municipal services are closed. The states that have listed April 14 as a holiday include Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas. Financial markets will also be closed, MarketWatch noted. “Typically, markets adhere to the U.S. government’s holiday calendar. However, Good Friday isn’t one of those holidays. In fact, it’s among the few holidays that isn’t both a Wall Street and a federal holiday. Those include Columbus Day and Veterans Day, which are federal holidays but aren’t vacation days for Wall Street investors.” The report noted that there had been a common misconception that markets closed after a terrible “Black Friday” crash, but there’s actually a more practical reason. “The more practical reason for the closing may be more obvious,” the report noted. “The holiday usually falls across the observance of Passover, which began on April 10 and is observed through the evening of April 18, and Easter Sunday. That would likely lead to anemic trading volume, even if market participants were able to make wagers on the S&P 500 index SPX, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA.” Finding a nice drink for Easter might also be difficult. As Philly.com noted, shoppers in some states including New Jersey will find liquor stores to be on limited hours. While they are not required to close early, many will be closed for the day or at least closing early.

Purple, a Utah mattress startup you’ve probably never heard of, is on track to unicorndom Posted 9 hours ago by Sarah Buhr (@sarahbuhr) 0 SHARES Next Story Neural networks made easy Advertisement You’ve likely never heard of this company if you live inside the Bay Area bubble, but Purple, a totally bootstrapped mattress startup, is using toxin-free, patented technology for a pressureless night’s sleep — and could become the first of the mattress unicorns. Nearly a thousand miles away from Silicon Valley and just west of Utah’s Great Salt Lake, in practically the middle of nowhere, is the tranquil cow town of Grantsville, population 9,617. It is there, in a warehouse the size of a combined eight Walmarts, you’ll find Purple, a direct-to-consumer mattress startup, hard at work prepping hundreds of thousands of pillows, powerbases and, of course, mattresses, for shipment. The company started a decade ago in the wheelchair business. It was making a patented cushioning technology to prevent bedsores for those sitting all day. But founders (and brothers) Tony and Terry Pearce noted a shift in the mattress space. It was headed online and, a bunch of startups like Casper, Tuft and Needle, Leesa and others were starting to pop up. So the pair decided three years ago to capitalize on the trend by using the same technology used in the wheelchair cushioning to make their own bedding. That proved to be a smart move, and the company has grown quite a bit because of it. In just the last year Purple went from a team of 30 to 600 people, built out the aforementioned 574,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Grantsville and, from what I’ve been told, sales are through the roof. Purple is currently working to fulfill orders for 27,000 of its newly launched pillows and, though the startup was hesitant to give out numbers, a source tells me it’s set to hit $150-$200 million in revenue this year. Compare that to its possibly biggest competitor, Casper, which hit $100 million in cumulative sales in 2016 and reportedly has been on track to hit $200 million by the end of this year. But, unlike Casper, which has taken in $70 million in funding so far, Purple hasn’t tapped into venture capital yet. It also owns the manufacturing process from beginning to end. Utah land and labor are both cheap, and the mattress startup can make its products at a much lower cost than Bay Area competitors. It’s a big job creator for the little town of Grantsville, too, where there aren’t a lot of opportunities for work. Purple will soon be the biggest employer there, with plans to hire another couple of thousand people, and is partnering with the local high schools and training facilities to provide locals the skills they’ll need to help out in the warehouse in the near future. Thousands of Purple’s mattresses stacked up inside the new 574,000-square-foot warehouse. Company headquarters are an hour’s drive to the south, in the town of Alpine, situated just beneath Utah’s Wasatch Front, a mountain range from Ogden to Provo that sidles up to what has been dubbed the “Silicon Slopes” due to the state’s vigorous tech growth over the last few years. Several unicorns dot the area, including Pluralsight, Domo and Accel Capital’s largest investment to date, Qualtrics, which just this week was crowned with a whopping $2.5 billion valuation. Purple’s CEO Sam Bernards believes his company is well on its way to becoming the next billion-dollar startup in the region, and, if those sales are any indication, he’s probably right. Though Purple has so far taken zero cash from investors, Bernards tells me he’s had some inbound inquiries from Silicon Valley and that it’s something he’d consider in the near future to help the company scale. Workers rolling up mattresses at Purple’s new mattress factory in Grantsville, Utah. The mattresses are priced closely to Casper’s. A king bed, for instance, costs $1,300. A Casper king sits just below that at $1,150. However, that’s at the high end for others in the space. Tuft and Needle, another mattress startup based in Phoenix, comes in at $750 for that size. But Purple is in another league, argues Bernards. For one, it’s designed to prevent bedsores, so it’s a good bet for those who spend a lot of time under the covers. Purple uses a total of 16 patents to make its mattresses soft enough to hug your body, yet firm enough to hold you up through the night. And, should there be an apocalyptic event, you can eat them. The hyperelastic mattress material is made from a food-grade polymer — no latex or other toxic ingredients. I tested the product myself on a recent visit to Utah. The best way I can describe it is laying on a super soft batch of Jello, but without the seismic wave activity. It compares in comfort to Casper (which I’ve also tried) and my Brooklyn Bedding mattress at home. Each pressure point of my body was cradled in this jelly-like webbed material underneath me, which allows longer hours of comfort and breathability, so you’re not likely to get sweaty under the covers, either. Purple also gives a 100-day money-back guarantee for those who want to try it out themselves, and says each mattress should last about 10 years, or the average time most people start looking for a new mattress. Purple’s powerbases, which allow customers to move their mattresses to the sitting or sleeping position. But it’s not without plenty of competition. Casper is the online mattress startup that had the most brand recognition with people I asked in San Francisco, and, according to Inc., there are more than 600 mattress companies in the U.S., several with brick-and-mortar locations where you can try the mattress and chat with a salesperson. However, Purple seems to be full steam ahead. It’ll have to speed up to fulfill those back orders, of course, but mix the current growth and interest, ownership of the manufacturing process, the cheaper labor market, unique branding and great sales with future plans to move into global sales, add in some VC funding to help it scale and Purple could be set to rocket past all the others. Check out the video above for an inside look at what Purple is doing for the town of Grantsville and a chat with its CEO about the mattress business. *This article is part of a larger series focusing on the Utah tech scene.

Walmart Greeter Says He Was Fired After Turkey Wandered Into Store Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Greeter Says He Was Fired After Turkey Wandered Into Store Image courtesy of (Mike Mozart) April 13, 2017 4:12 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler big box retail fired greeter retail stores turkey unfair dismissal? walmart Have you heard the one about the turkey that wandered into a Wisconsin Walmart? Oh, it’s not a joke, it really happened last month, and now the greeter for the store says he’s been fired over the incident.  WISN reports that the 88-year-old man, who worked as a Walmart greeter at the location for the past eight years, was fired for not reporting the stray bird quickly enough. The man says he was fired just days after the March 27 incident in which a wild turkey walked into the store. An official with the local Humane Animal Welfare Society came to the store and lured the turkey into a net. The animal was later released back into the wild. It’s unclear how long the bird had been in the store before the greeter alerted someone, but the man tells WISN he saw the animal walk into the store and then walk out. The man’s wife tells WISN that he never received a rule book when he began working as a greeter. A rep for Walmart’s corporate headquarters tells WISN that it appreciates “the public’s concern and take this situation seriously. While we will not comment on HR matters, we can confirm [the man] is no longer with the company.” April 13, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler big box retail fired greeter retail stores turkey unfair dismissal? walmart Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related save our grandmas Video Shows 78-Year-Old Walmart Worker Injuring Hip Trying To Check Shoplifter’s Receipt Fighting Firings Court Mulls Whether Walmart Workers’ Right To Self-Defense Trumps Store’s De-Escalation Policy sad Police Investigating Death During Walmart Shoplifting Incident anti-shoplifting Walmart’s Experiment Is Over: Greeters Are Returning For Good friendly faces Walmart Tries Moving Greeters Back To The Entrance Previous JCPenney Postpones Store Closings Because People Are Shopping There Again Next Your Kids’ School-Owned Devices Are Spying On Them, Report Finds Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

Help your family stay healthy with the budget-friendly modern digital thermometer that’s already a bestseller online and allows you to scan the doctor-recommended way. Beverly Hills, California (PRUnderground) April 13th, 2017 The MOBI Health Check DualScan Thermometer offers more features than competing thermometers – including a medication reminder and a flashlight – at a lower price. It’s the perfect way to monitor the health of adults, children and babies to make sure any fever-related health problems are caught early and treated quickly. Just as technology has moved forward in so many other areas, today’s ear and forehead thermometers from MOBI are better than ever before. When you choose the Health Check thermometer, available from Walmart.com (https://goo.gl/Cu7uVO), you’re choosing a product that has become a bestseller in its category despite only being available from the retailer for a short time. “We’re pleased that this versatile and potentially lifesaving product is a bestseller, but we’re even more excited that it’s making a real difference in the lives of families,” said MOBI CEO David Naghi. “From checking on a baby’s cold and flu symptoms to keeping watch on an elderly relative to make sure they don’t have a post-surgical infection, the Health Check thermometer can do it all.” This fever thermometer can take a patient’s temperature using the doctor-recommended in-ear method or the simpler and more comfortable forehead method. Either way, results are displayed on the large lighted readout in just one second. The flashlight feature makes it easier to check on a sick family member without turning on the lights and disturbing them. The memory function stores readings so there’s no confusion about whether a fever is rising or declining. The exclusive medication reminder helps ensure that a crucial dose of fever reducer or other medication isn’t missed. “If it sounds like we thought of everything, it’s because we put a lot of effort into creating a better product,” Naghi said. “We didn’t rush this digital thermometer to market. Instead we carefully tested and evaluated it to make sure it met the most crucial temperature-monitoring need with ease and simplicity.” Additionally, the Health Check ear and forehead thermometer can check the temperature of food, milk or bath water to make sure it’s right and check room temperature as well. For the most features and complete versatility, choose the digital thermometer that’s topping its category on Walmart.com – the ear and forehead thermometer with the most features and a careful, deliberate design that makes it easy for you to keep a check on your family’s health.

By Megan Friedman Apr 13, 2017 When you shop online, it's easy to take advantage of coupons, rebates, and constant sales. And now, if you shop on Walmart.com, you can get a discount on many items just by showing up at an actual store to pick them up. Mashable reports that Walmart is offering discounts on the 10,000 most popular products on its website. But you can only get the discount if you buy the item online and then ship them to a local store to pick it up. The deals will include items like carseats, televisions, and kids' products, and will knock a few bucks off the overall price. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Apparently, the last leg of a package's journey to your home is the most expensive when it comes to shipping. So sending the package to a Walmart cuts a major cost, and the company is passing (at least some of) that savings onto customers. They got the idea from Jet.com, a company Walmart acquired last year. The discounts start April 19, and will eventually cut the prices of one million products. But for now, some of the advertised discounts include $50 off a VIZIO HDTV, and smaller discounts like $7.40 off an infant car seat. According to Fox Business, the discount will be bigger if the item itself is bigger, since huge items cost more to ship. So if you live near a Walmart anyway, it can't hurt to save a few dollars and drive around the corner to your local store.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said former vice president Mary De Luis' claims did not become moot when she resigned last May, after the bank allegedly retaliated for her role in the case by refusing to allow a transfer to Miami from Dallas unless she accepted a demotion. The judge also said another ex-employee, former vice president Allison Gamba, had standing to pursue her claims even after Goldman left her without a job in August 2014 when it "divested itself" of her department. Torres said a judge who previously oversaw the 6-1/2-year-old lawsuit misinterpreted a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, in finding that former employees like De Luis and Gamba who sought "reinstatement" could not sue. In an email, Goldman said it was "examining the implications of the latest ruling and will continue to contest this matter vigorously." The plaintiffs accused Goldman of systematically paying women less than men, and giving them weaker performance reviews that impeded their career growth. Their lawsuit, which began in September 2010, also included allegations that Goldman maintained a "boys' club atmosphere." This included the use of sexual language, unwanted touching and subjecting women to the "double-edged sword" of being expected to socialize after work with colleagues to advance their careers, it said, but risk being labeled "party girls" if they did. The other named plaintiffs include former Goldman employees Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, who were a vice president and associate, respectively. A fifth plaintiff agreed to arbitration. Torres "brought consistency to how the Southern District of New York interprets standing," Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview, referring to the Manhattan court. "This had been a big stopping point in the case and all four plaintiffs can seek class-action status." Class-action certification could let thousands of women sue together, raising the potential for larger awards without excessive legal costs. The case is Chen-Oster et al v. Goldman Sachs & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-06950.

The Boston Globe Comment on this Tweet this Facebook President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday. Associated Press FACT CHECK Fact-checking President Trump’s speech to Congress By Calvin Woodward and Christopher S. Rugaber, Associated Press April 13, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump boasted in his speech to Congress that new money ‘‘is pouring in’’ from NATO partners, which it isn’t. He also took credit for corporate job expansion and military cost savings that actually took root under his predecessor. A look at some of his claims Tuesday night: On NATO TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, ‘‘Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.’’ THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO meeting last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. He and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Advertisement Only five of the 28 member countries are meeting the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. In fact, Germany’s foreign minister said Wednesday he is skeptical about his country’s plans to increase defense spending, saying it could raise concerns in Europe by turning Germany into ‘‘a military supremacy.’’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her country will meet its commitment to raise defense spending by the 2024 deadline. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. On immigration TRUMP: ‘‘According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.’’ Advertisement THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants ‘‘contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.’’ The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children ‘‘are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.’’ This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the ‘‘long-run fiscal impact’’ of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive ‘‘if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.’’ On military spending Get Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Enter email address: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here TRUMP: ‘‘We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price’’ of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of Trump’s actions. On new jobs Storm clouds began to form over the White House. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press Advertisement TRUMP: ‘‘Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.’’ THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. On the budget TRUMP: His budget plan will offer ‘‘one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.’’ THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. On taxes TRUMP: ‘‘We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.’’ THE FACTS:Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen. Independent analyses of his campaign’s tax proposals found that most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families. The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population would get a cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute. On infrastructure TRUMP: A White House fact sheet on the nation’s infrastructure issued with his speech describes ‘‘a desperate need for improvement’’ of public infrastructure ‘‘in poor condition.’’ It cites a report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association that over 55,000 bridges are ‘‘structurally deficient.’’ THE FACTS: Trump and many Americans love to complain about their highways and bridges, but data show that the country isn’t that bad off when compared either with its global counterparts or the recent past. The World Economic Forum ranks the U.S. seventh out of 138 countries for its transportation infrastructure, ahead of countries such as Germany, Spain, Canada, Britain and China. Countries ahead of it on the list are smaller, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. By the nation’s own measurements, bridges have improved over the past decade or so. The trade association for road builders, using government data, indeed says there are 55,710 structurally deficient bridges — those carrying more traffic than they were designed for. But that number represents a 34 percent decline since 2002. And the share of miles driven on national highways with pavement offering ‘‘good ride quality’’ rose from 50 percent in 2002 to 57 percent in 2012. On unemployment TRUMP: ‘‘Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.’’ THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone aged 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, most economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. On terrorism TRUMP: ‘‘According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.’’ THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information that has come out doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were actually born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research revealed last week. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens.

One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act has seen a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern. Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating uncertainty about the future. The health law offers subsidized private health insurance along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Together, the two arms of the program cover more than 20 million people. Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the administration to keep the expansion, and maybe even build on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of Medicaid. While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the markets for subsidized private health insurance are stressed in many states. Also affected are millions of people who buy individual policies outside the government markets, and face the same high premiums with no financial help from the health law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says ‘‘implosion’’ is too strong a term. An AP count found that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite the Trump administration’s threats to repeal the law. But a health care blogger and industry consultant, Robert Laszewski, agrees with Trump. He says too few young, healthy people have signed up to guarantee the stability of the insurance markets.

Friday April 14, 2017 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Thursday, April 13, 2017 The insecurity of inequality By Kaushik Basu Project syndicate Income disparity cannot be left to markets — it's a matter of survival NEW YORK — Global inequality today is at a level last seen in the late nineteenth century — and it is continuing to rise. With it has come a surging sense of disenfranchisement that has fuelled alienation and anger, and even bred nationalism and xenophobia. As people struggle to hold on to their shrinking share of the pie, their anxiety has created a political opening for opportunistic populists, shaking the world order in the process. The gap between rich and poor nowadays is mind-boggling. Oxfam has observed that the world’s eight richest people now own as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion. As US Senator Bernie Sanders recently pointed out, the Walton family, which owns Walmart, now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of the US population. I can offer my own jarring comparison. Using Credit Suisse’s wealth database, I found that the total wealth of the world’s three richest people exceeds that of all the people in three countries — Angola, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of Congo — which together have a population of 122 million. To be sure, great progress on reducing extreme poverty — defined as consumption of less than US$1.90 per day — has been achieved in recent decades. In 1981, 42 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. By 2013 — the last year for which we have comprehensive data — that share had dropped to below 11 percent. Piecemeal evidence suggests that extreme poverty now stands just above nine percent. That is certainly something to celebrate. But our work is far from finished. And, contrary to popular belief, that work must not be confined to the developing world. As Angus Deaton recently pointed out, extreme poverty remains a serious problem in rich countries, too. "Several million Americans — black, white, and Hispanic — now live in households with per capita income of less than US$2 per day,” he points out. Given the much higher cost of living (including shelter), he notes, such an income can pose an even greater challenge in a country like the US than it does in, say, India. This constraint is apparent in New York City, where the number of known homeless people has risen from 31,000 in 2002 to 63,000 today. (The true figure, including those who have never used shelters, is about five percent higher.) This trend has coincided with a steep rise in the price of housing: over the last decade, rents have been rising more than three times as fast as wages. Ironically, the wealthy pay less, per unit, for many goods and services. A stark example is flying. Thanks to frequent flier programmes, wealthy travelers pay less for each mile they fly. While this makes sense for airlines, which want to foster loyalty among frequent fliers, it represents yet another way in which wealth is rewarded in the marketplace. This phenomenon is also apparent in poor economies. A study of Indian villages showed that the poor face systematic price discrimination, exacerbating inequality. In fact, correcting for differences in prices paid by the rich and the poor improves the Gini coefficient (a common measure of inequality) by 12-23 percent. The better off also get a whole host of goods for free. To name one seemingly trivial example, I can’t remember when I last bought a pen. They often simply appear on my desk, unintentionally left behind by people who stopped by my office. They vanish just as often, as people inadvertently pick them up. The late Khushwant Singh, a renowned Indian journalist, once said that he attended conferences only to stock up on pens and paper. A non-trivial example is taxation. Rather than paying the most in taxes, the wealthiest people are often able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are not available to those earning less. Without having to break any rules, the wealthy receive what amount to subsidies, which would have a far larger positive impact if they were allocated to the poorest people. Beyond these concrete inequities, there are less obvious – but equally damaging – imbalances. In any situation where, legally, one’s rights are not enforced or even specified, the outcome will probably depend on custom, which is heavily skewed in favor of the rich. Wealthy citizens can not only vote; they can influence elections through donations and other means. In this sense, excessive wealth inequality can undermine democracy. Of course, in any well-run economy, a certain amount of inequality is inevitable and even needed, to create incentives and power the economy. But, nowadays, disparities of income and wealth have become so extreme and entrenched that they cross generations, with family wealth and inheritance having a far greater impact on one’s economic prospects than talent and hard work. And it works both ways: just as children from wealthy families are significantly more likely to be wealthy in adulthood, children of, say, former child labourers are more likely to work during their childhood. None of this is any individual’s fault. Many wealthy citizens have contributed to society and played by the rules. The problem is that the rules are often skewed in their favour. In other words, income inequality stems from systemic flaws. In our globalised world, inequality cannot be left to markets and local communities to solve any more than climate change can. As the consequences of rising domestic inequality feed through to geopolitics, eroding stability, the need to devise new rules, re-distribution systems, and even global agreements is no longer a matter of morals; increasingly, it is a matter of survival.

Courtesy of Mountainland Apples The packing shed at Mountainland Apples in Caldwell, Idaho. Caldwell, Idaho — The Mountainland Cooperative was originally formed in Utah to provide long-term storage, packing and marketing of fruit produced by member growers. The co-op does no direct sales; all sales are to the retail, foodservice and wholesale trade, mainly in the Intermountain area, but some of the fruit is shipped to other regions of the U.S. Brad Goodloe manages the Idaho packing house at Caldwell. “The orchards were started in Utah. We are now the third generation of our family orchard business. A packing shed was started by the co-op in Utah. As the co-op grew and some of the growers grew in size, they moved to Idaho about five years ago and started a packing shed here, rather than shipping the fruit to Utah,” Goodloe said. Mountainland Idaho works with orchards in the area, including Williamson Orchards and Gary Garret, a grower near Homedale, he said. “We also pack a lot of fruit for Caldwell Idaho Orchards. They are part of the co-op but located here in Idaho. They are part of a welfare program for the LDS Church, supplying fruit to needy people. As members of the co-op, they use us to package their fruit.” On the farming side, his cousins Sean, Jeff and Daniel Rowley grow fruit at Cherry Hill Farms. “At the beginning of harvest we do apricots, then peaches and nectarines. The apples ripen later,” he said. Different varieties of apples ripen at different times, spreading out the harvest. Their family orchards in Idaho grow Gala, Honeycrisp, Fuji and Reds. After being sorted and packed at Mountainland, the apples are shipped to Wal-Mart stores and Associated Foods. “We also sell apples to a few smaller outlets. Wal-Mart likes to promote local growers, however. We see our products in many grocery stores around here. Associated Foods distributes our products in Utah and the Northwest,” he said. Goodloe and his cousins all have children, and though they are still young, some of them are interested in the fruit business. Daniel’s children range from 1 to 10. “They enjoy coming out to the farm, especially the boys. I have all girls and they come with me whenever possible, but are mainly exposed to the packing side of things because that’s what I do,” said Goodloe. “There may eventually be a fourth generation involved with the fruit business.” Their orchards include long-term leases as well as land they own. “We look for opportunities to keep expanding. This means buying ground and finding leases. We try to get 20-year leases, to give enough time to get trees into production,” he says. Some trees today can come into full production quicker than traditional varieties, he said. “We can usually start small pickings a year after the new trees are put in, and they come into full production in about five years,” he said. “We need a good balance of young trees coming on, along with the older trees.” He said he is impressed with how well the family works together. “This is a wonderful thing, and unique. To see a business like this staying in the family and not becoming completely commercialized is great, but it’s also a challenge to try to keep the mandates from government, food regulations, safety regulations, et cetera, and still keep it as a family business,” he said. “We always have to be fluid and up-to-date with all the regulations and not become discouraged. It’s a big challenge and a huge job.” Marketplace Auctions Hay Real Estate Tractors Share and Discuss Guidelines User Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Takeoff Technologies and KNAPP Announce Exclusive Agreement KENNESAW, Ga.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today KNAPP announced a formal agreement to provide automated micro-fulfillment technology and robotics to Takeoff Technologies including an agreement to exclusively develop the immediate in-store eGrocery channel. Takeoff Technologies, led by two Harvard Business School MBAs, has already begun the process of rolling out several sites this year with retail partners – designed to transform the way the grocery industry operates – by leveraging automation to dramatically reduce operating cost and increase real estate productivity. Takeoff offers a turnkey end-to-end technology solution for eGrocery, which is based in part on the KNAPP robotic shuttle technology for the material handling automation component. The Takeoff business model provides a unique approach to the ecommerce order fulfillment of groceries – micro fulfillment centers co-located at the supermarket level for immediate grocery pickup. The modular technology takes less space, is highly responsive to meet order demand in real time and can delivery groceries quickly and inexpensively for customer pickup. According to Takeoff company cofounders Jose Vicente Aguerrevere; a Grocery veteran, founder of a Latin American disruptive grocery chain and former management consultant with Booz Allen and Hamilton, and Max Pedro; a former Vice President at Walmart International and management consultant with McKinsey, “The US grocery market represents over $700Bn, and eCommerce is only 2% of that – mainly due to inefficiencies and constraints in the way this channel is operated, therefore significantly limiting the value proposition for online customers around immediacy, assortment and price. This means there is plenty of room for growth.” “Saving time and money on people’s everyday needs” represents Takeoff’s core value proposition. From a technology perspective, Alfredo Millán, MIT Sloan MBA, a former industry consultant and Takeoff’s Chief Business Engineer highlights, “After a thorough evaluation to select a material handling automation partner, the KNAPP solutions provide us with the best performance, speed and reliability, and represent best-in-class innovation for micro-fulfillment technology.” According to Josef Mentzer, CEO of KNAPP US operations based in Atlanta, “The exclusive arrangement with Takeoff Technologies is a measure of our confidence that the Takeoff team and business model – using less space, operating at less cost than traditional grocers and pureplays, and located within local neighborhoods – is a solid value proposition. In effect, Takeoff has the right formula to optimize technology, inventory, people and space – in the grocery ecommerce market segment.” About Takeoff Technologies Takeoff Technologies is a Boston-area startup that has the vision of transforming the grocery industry with the development of micro-fulfillment-centers for immediate pickup points using grocery-sorting robots to assemble orders. But instead of forming its own supermarket chain, Takeoff is selling its end-to-end technology platform to existing retailers as a new way to reach customers as part of an efficient ecosystem.

Warning: This Bacteria Could Be Hiding in Your Salad... 12 Headboards That Are Total Bedroom Game-Changers How to Perfectly Dye Easter Eggs 101 Love Quotes We'll Never Get Sick Of StyleCaster The Super-Disturbing Thing People Found In Their Salad at Walmart Facebook Pinterest Twitter Tumblr 0 bySheKnows 5 Shares 12 hours ago Photo: Getty Images Thought grabbing a boxed salad was a safe, healthy choice when you’re on the run? Think again. In an entirely new level of horrific food recall news, two people ate some of a pre-packaged salad at Walmart that contained a dead bat. OMG. I mean, rodents, bugs, and human hairs are bad enough—but a flying animal that resides in caves and is well-known to carry the deadly rabies virus? That’s gag-worthy, not simply because it’s disgusting, but because it could kill you. The packaged salad mix, which was made by Fresh Express and issued to stores in Florida, has been recalled. The two poor unsuspecting victims ate some of the salad before discovering the bat in the box. The CDC has sent the bat to labs for rabies testing, and the two people were also tested and are reportedly in fine health so far (but are being monitored). MORE: 12 Headboards That Are Total Bedroom Game-Changers If you live in Florida and are concerned that you may have eaten or bought one of the Fresh Express pre-packaged salads, here are the deets. The recall is for Organic Marketing Spring Mix in a clear, 5-ounce container with a best-if-used-by date of April 14, 2017. You can get a full refund, but more important, won’t be exposed to any deadly diseases simply by opening the box. It’s still unclear how the hell this happened (I mean, at least when metal pieces get into chicken, you know it came from the factory or machines that helped package the food up—not that that’s especially comforting). Either way, if you’re getting the heebie-jeebies just thinking about buying prepackaged food right now, you’re not alone, and we’ll all be making our own salads for the foreseeable future.

Slideshow: SLIDESHOW: Amber Alert - Elizabeth Thomas Surveillance footage captured Elizabeth Thomas, 15, and her abductor, Tad Cummins, in Oklahoma City two days after they went missing. (Source: TBI) MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - Tennessee Bureau of Investigation used its Twitter account to remind people of the ongoing search for Elizabeth Thomas, 15, who went missing exactly one month ago. Today marks a month since she disappeared. We aren't giving up hope and will continue to do anything and everything to #BringElizabethHome. pic.twitter.com/OudUD2D7CV— TBI (@TBInvestigation) April 13, 2017 Thomas and her former teacher, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, disappeared on March 13. Surveillance footage obtained at a Walmart in Oklahoma City shows that the pair stopped there to purchase essentials two days later. That surveillance footage is the last confirmed sighting investigators have to go on.  Pharmacists around the country were told to be on the lookout for Tad Cummins after investigators learned he takes blood pressure medication. They believe he is probably due for a refill since it's been 30 days since he left.  A note left behind for Cummins' wife is believed to have been an attempt to buy time and lead investigators in the wrong direction. “It’s obvious that it was a diversion, just a way to try and buy some extra time and give us a false lead of what direction they might be going,” District Attorney Brent Cooper said. Cooper said it is possible that Cummins planned a long list of diversions, including the sighting in Oklahoma City. He found it odd that Cummins and Thomas went into the store together and made no attempts to drastically alter their appearances. Tad Cummins' cell phone ping in Decatur, Alabama, could also have been part of the plan. “That makes you wonder if that wasn’t just another diversion. You drive to Decatur, turn the phone on, throw it in the river, and then head whatever direction you’re intending to go,” Cooper said. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Thomas and/or Cummins is asked to call TBI at 1-800-TBI- FIND. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Crime 1 0 0 April 13, 2017 Elizabeth Thomas: Missing Tennessee Teenager Has Been Gone For One Month, Where Is The Investigation? Aaron Homer Elizabeth Thomas has been missing for exactly a month now, and investigators say she and her alleged abductor, 50-year-old former teacher Tad Cummins, could be anywhere by now, perhaps even out of the country. An Inappropriate Relationship Whether Cummins forcibly abducted the 15-year-old girl, or whether she left with him voluntarily, is unclear. What is known, according to The Nashville Tennesseean, is that the two had, at one time, been carrying on an inappropriate relationship. Twice they were caught having inappropriate contact; and the day after Elizabeth went missing, Cummins, formerly a Health Sciences teacher at Culleoka Unit School, was fired. Investigation Team Comments On One Month Anniversary Of Missing Teen Elizabeth Thomas https://t.co/kuSEqCugGn pic.twitter.com/NWSXXdTyKA — Faith Family America (@FaithFamilyUSA) April 13, 2017 Thomas’ father, Anthony, says that Thomas had tried to end the relationship, but that she began feeling guilty about Cummins’ troubles and that he “preyed upon her guilt.” “Moreover, evidence has surfaced that (Elizabeth) became fearful of Cummins’ reaction to his suspension and her belief that he would punish her in some way for it.” The Disappearance Thomas was last seen by her family on the morning of Monday, March 13, at about 7:45 a.m., when her sister dropped her off at a Shoney’s restaurant. Hours later, security camera footage from a Decatur, Alabama, gas station showed the pair about 80 miles away. A week later, there were captured on-camera at an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Walmart. Elizabeth’s hair had been dyed, possibly to disguise her identity. .@TBInvestigation @Jason @jack BREAKING: #AmberAlert PLZ RT Missing Tennessee student #ElizabethThomas spotted with teacher in Oklahoma City. https://t.co/MRnnLEUpuz pic.twitter.com/4Nnu96ggYm — CHARITY.com™ (@CHARITY__com) April 1, 2017 Since that time, there have been no definitive leads as to the couple’s whereabouts. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation confirms sighting of Amber Alert victim https://t.co/Kh6idLvNtv pic.twitter.com/xPcfMBJ2y7 — WVTM 13 (@WVTM13) March 31, 2017 The Investigation As of this writing, according to KFOR (Oklahoma City), more than a thousand leads and tips have poured into the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), but none have panned out. Meanwhile, family attorney Jason Whatley believes that someone back in Culleoka knows something, but isn’t talking to the police. The attorney has filed paperwork with the courts to compel witnesses to testify. “There are students who’ve given information to law enforcement that is incomplete and then when asked again, they expand. Bottom line, we want to get that information on the table so we can vet that information.” Further, according to Crime Online, investigators believe one particular witness may have valuable information, but that witness isn’t talking, either. “One witness in particular has been unwilling to assist… we have witnesses who will not speak. We have witnesses who, frankly, have not been helpful in solidifying their testimony and what it will be.” Be On The Lookout Investigators believe Cummins may have taken Thomas to a rural area, away from the prying eyes of the public. He’s believed to have prepared for his getaway by watching survival shows on TV; investigators are asking people who live in rural areas — particularly in and around campgrounds — to be particularly vigilant in keeping an eye out for the couple. Similarly, authorities say that Cummins is ill and will be running out of blood pressure medicine soon. If this happens, he is likely to turn up in a pharmacy looking for a refill, or in an emergency room looking for treatment. For these reasons, official are asking pharmacists and hospital staff to be on the lookout for the 50-year-old man, who is believed to be armed. This is a developing story. More information about the investigation into Elizabeth Thomas’ disappearance will be provided as it becomes available.

Tad Cummins allegedly abducted Elizabeth Thomas on March 13 in Tennessee. The last public sighting of the pair was two days later inside an Oklahoma City Walmart, where surveillance cameras captured images of the two shopping. Read: Teacher on the Run With 15-Year-Old Student May Be Posing as Missionary in Mexico: D.A. Despite a national hunt, authorities have not been able to locate the fired instructor and the high school student. He is due for a refill of prescription pills that regulate his high blood pressure, according to Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper. Cummins, a married father and grandfather, left a note for his wife, Jill, the morning he vanished, Cooper said. The prosecutor declined to reveal the letter’s contents, but called it a diversionary tactic designed to buy time. Jill Cummins has filed for divorce since her husband and the girl went missing. He has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. He is believed to be armed, authorities said. The teen also needs medication for severe allergies and left behind her EpiPens and antihistamine pills, her family has said. Read: Girl, 15, Allegedly Kidnapped by Teacher Shared Instagram Post: 'Every Beauty Needs Her Beast' Cummins had been suspended in February from his teaching duties after the pair was discovered in his classroom. The school district had ordered him to have no one-on-one contact with the girl after a classmate reported the two had been seen kissing on school property in January. Both denied having any inappropriate contact with the other. One day after their disappearance, he was fired by school authorities. Cummins "may have been abusing his role as a teacher to groom [the student]... in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her,” an official with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next PUEBLO, Colo. – A missing persons case involving a pregnant Denver woman who went missing four years ago in Pueblo thawed Thursday, as local and state investigators searched a Pueblo home for clues relating to her disappearance. Detectives with the Pueblo Police Department and investigators with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at a home in the 5100 block of Manor Ridge Drive at 8 a.m. Thursday to try and find anything new in the case involving Kelsie Schelling’s disappearance. The home used to be occupied by Donthe Lucas, who was Schelling’s boyfriend and the father of her unborn child and has long been considered a suspect in the case. But he has never been convicted of any charges relating to Schelling’s disappearance. Around a dozen detectives and investigators combed through the backyard of the home, placing flags and digging up portions of the yard, “looking for evidence that may help in the investigation, which is ongoing,” police said. Schelling was 21 years old and eight weeks pregnant when she vanished on Feb. 4, 2013. She had her first doctor’s visit and had seen a sonogram of her baby earlier that day. After the trip to the doctor and a shift at work, the Denver woman drove two hours south to Pueblo to visit Lucas, and has never been seen since. Lucas was found to have parked her car at an area Walmart the day after she disappeared, and an unidentified man picked it up and eventually dropped it off again at the St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center. Police recovered the vehicle Feb. 7. Schelling was never seen in surveillance video at either location. Investigators discovered through text messages that Schelling and Lucas had talked to one another once she had reached Pueblo, but the messages stopped shortly after she got there. Lucas was at one point arrested on felony identity theft and misdemeanor theft charges for allegedly using Schelling’s debit card to withdraw $400 at a bank on Feb. 5 of that year. He was named as a primary person of interest in Schelling’s disappearance, but the charges relating to his alleged use of her credit card were eventually dropped. Schelling’s mother and other family members have long believed Lucas is somehow involved in her disappearance, and have continued to plead with CBI for answers. “I think Kelsie’s case is very solvable. I think it should’ve been solved a long time before now, and we’re not giving up…there will be a resolution to this,” Schelling’s mother, Laura Saxton, told Denver7 when we covered Schelling’s case for Project Unsolved in February. CBI was brought in by Pueblo police fairly recently to assist in the case. CBI Director Michael Rankin told Denver7 in February that when his team is brought in, they re-examine and scrutinize the evidence and details collected in the case so far. “I think that the starting point [is] let’s take a look at, first of all, what happened? What do we know? What’s been done to further that investigation, and then, where can the CBI plug in to further advance the investigation and hopefully the prosecution as well,” Rankin said. Schelling’s family has long offered a reward for information leading investigators to their daughter or to an arrest and conviction of someone in her disappearance – upping the reward to $100,000 in February and organizing a Colorado Missing Persons Day event at the state Capitol on Feb. 3 Pueblo police say the investigation into the case remains ongoing and that they are looking for tips related to the case. To submit anonymous tips in the case, contact Pueblo Crime Stoppers at 542-STOP or go to their website. You can also contact the Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 303-239-4300. Saxton has also created a website dedicated to helping find her daughter. Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search The Death Of Traditional Retail Is Accelerating April 13, 2017 11:39am NYSE:XRT ShareTweet From Brad Hoppmann: Have you been to a shopping mall lately? It’s not what it used to be, that’s for sure. A lack of foot traffic, the absence of once-popular specialty stores, and poor customer service are just a few of the recent observations I made during my last visit to a once-mighty local mall. This observation isn’t just mine, however. It’s been reflected in malls throughout the country, and via the many store closures and bankruptcies in the retail industry. Then there is the price of retail stocks. Not all retailers are created equal, of course. But I will note here that the benchmark Exchange-Traded Fund, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), has recently come under a lot of selling pressure. XRT is down nearly 5% year-to-date. Now, that doesn’t seem too horrible. Not until you realize that stocks in the S&P 500 are up nearly 5% in that same time frame. So, what’s the deal? Are we about to hear the disturbing death rattle of retail? A recent cover story in Investor’s Business Daily, “Death Stalks Retail Stocks, But Hope Lives On,” took up the complex subject of retail’s future. I thought the piece was interesting, as it laid out many of the prevailing issues facing the retail industry. It also offered insight into how the sector could evolve in the years to come as it tries to survive. Most importantly, in an age where Amazon.com (AMZN) rules the retail roost, the article asked whether traditional retail stocks were “just flat-out doomed.” Look at this price chart of the online seller of everything, AMZN, vs. the world’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). You’ll see what investors have emphatically stated over the past decade. WMT has gained a little over 55% in the past 10 years. But look at AMZN … which is up more than 2,000% in that same time frame. Here’s the money quote from IBD: No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail’s wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come. When you have a mainstream publication talking about the short-selling opportunities in a sector, well, that sector is in serious trouble. Still, the retail segment is big. Some estimates put the industry at about $4 trillion. That, according to some, means companies that sell things in physical stores are still viable. Per IBD: “There’s no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,” said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. “That’s just not going to happen.” The solution to the “retail ice age,” as I’ve heard it called, could be finding new ways to use existing retail space. Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.According to analysts cited in the IBD article, retailers need to reduce their real-estate footprint, and also take a “hybrid approach” to stores that maximizes floor space while also accommodating online orders. Macy’s (M) and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy. While these so-called hybrid stores are an interesting concept, Amazon can play that game too. Indeed, the online retailer has already opened “pop up” stores in various locations. It also has its sights set on opening grocery stores. Yet for traditional retailers facing an existential crisis, the key to survival may be a combination of building out their online infrastructure while also making their stores “cool” again. That’s a tall order. But it’s one that many retailers must fill if they want to survive. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) was trading at $41.88 per share on Thursday morning, down $0.16 (-0.38%). Year-to-date, XRT has declined -4.97%, versus a 4.84% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XRT currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of B (Buy), and is ranked #33 of 45 ETFs in the Consumer-Focused ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Uncommon Wisdom Daily.

Multiple people have reported getting a call from a woman claiming to be from the Human Health Resources Division. They tell them to go to Walmart and put $250 into a transfer account and then call another number. That number is answered by someone claiming to be from the U.S. Treasury Department trying to take their money. Police warn that the scammers use regular mail, email, phone, text, and social media to take advantage of people with their scam. Police say that people should report any suspicious contact they think is a scam before they call the number. Once you call the phone number, local police may not be able to do anything because numbers switch so often and are usually taken down by the time they are identified. Police say want to get the word out so people can identity the problem before they become a victim. Category: Politics Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation releases new photo of Tad Cummins with Elizabeth Thomas at school in January, days before his alleged inappropriate contact with her. Lawyer's office for the family of Elizabeth Thomas released these photos of Elizabeth with dyed hair. She has been missing since March 13, 2017, after a friend dropped her off at a restaurant in Columbia, a city near Culleoka and about 40 miles... By AJ Willingham CNN (CNN) -- It has been a month since 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas disappeared with her former teacher, 50-year-old Tad Cummins. What started as an Amber Alert in the small town of Culleoka, Tennessee, has evolved into a nationwide manhunt, and neither Thomas nor Cummins have been found. Here's what we know about the disappearance, and the big questions that still need answering: Have either been seen since the kidnapping? Thomas and Cummins left Culleoka on March 13. Since then, there has been only one confirmed sighting of the pair. On March 15, surveillance footage captured them together at a Walmart in Oklahoma City. It looked as if both had changed their appearance: Cummins may have dyed his gray beard and hair darker, and Thomas may have dyed her hair red. Where might they be now? Authorities suspect the pair traveled to Decatur, Alabama, on their first day of flight, but other than that and the Oklahoma sighting, police have had no credible leads. Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper told CNN that Cummins takes blood pressure medication and might need a refill soon, which would obviously tip off police to their location. For now, authorities say the pair could be "anywhere," but advised people to be particularly observant around rural and remote areas like campgrounds and parks. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) spokesman Josh DeVine told CNN authorities were also looking into any connections Cummins might have had outside the continental United States. What is their relationship? Cummins was Thomas' forensics teacher when she was a freshman at Culleoka Unit School in 2016. Over time, signs point to some sort of romantic relationship developing. A student reported seeing Thomas and Cummins kissing in a classroom in 2016, a claim both of them denied. However, the teen and the teacher both stated that Cummins gave Thomas emotional support and that they were close. After the pair went missing, authorities discovered Cummins had conducted research on teen marriage, and the two exchanged romantic messages using the draft folder of Cummins' email. Cummins' wife, Jill Cummins, initially pleaded for her husband to return home with the girl, saying "This is not who you are." However, a few weeks after their disappearance, Jill Cummins filed documents for divorce, saying her husband is "guilty of inappropriate marital conduct." Did Thomas go with him willingly? Even though the pair were engaged in some sort of relationship, the TBI says there's no way Thomas is not a victim. "She may very well not know that she's a victim in all of this," DeVine said during a news conference. "So our message to her tonight, you are a victim. You're 15 years old. He's 50. We are going to do everything we can to bring you home." Thomas' family provided more evidence that their daughter had been groomed by her teacher. "He convinced her that he had been a secret agent and ... that he had all kinds of money," Anthony Thomas told HLN. "It was clear that he had really put a lot of notions into her head." Has Cummins been charged? He has. Cummins was charged with sexual contact with a minor, according to the TBI. Four days after their disappearance, Cummins was charged with aggravated kidnapping, since he may be armed. Cummins has also been added to Tennessee's "Top 10 Most Wanted" list. Here's one thing that has people worried: Tennessee's kidnapping law is strangely lenient, so if the pair are caught and it is found that Thomas went with Cummins willingly, the kidnapping charge against him may not hold water.

New York Times highlights best ways to spend 36 hours in Baltimore Lifestyle Maryland Family Baltimore wedding photographers travel U.S., collect tales from couples from every state Sharing stories of love after the wedding Liz and Ryan Bower toured the country in an RV collecting stories from nearly 100 couples for their book "Amazing Life Together." (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) Liz and Ryan Bower toured the country in an RV collecting stories from nearly 100 couples for their book "Amazing Life Together." (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) Brittany BrittoContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Fifty states, 41,983 miles and 98 interviews later, Remington couple produces book about marriage. As wedding photographers, it was Liz and Ryan Bower's job to capture the fun and excitement of every union. They saw how much emphasis was put into the day of, but while coming to terms with Liz's parents' divorce, the married couple from Remington wondered: How much emphasis was put on the marriage? "There just didn't seem to be that excitement and energy from the industry and on the internet for the marriage after, which really was what we felt was the most important," Ryan Bower said. From that insight grew a project that resulted in the couple making a cross-country odyssey and writing a just-released book, "Amazing Life Together," that collects the tales of 76 couples — at least one from every state — whose married lives ranged from two weeks to six decades together. There were the former drug dealers who became ministers, in Jonesboro, Ga. The newlyweds in Alaska. The Hawaii couple who married young and, over the past 15 years, had five children and overcome a serious illness. The recollections and revelations capture a wide variety of experiences: Photos from Liz and Ryan Bower's "Amazing Life Together" "We had to take a bus because he wasn't 16 yet," said a Montoursville, Pa., woman who has been married for more than 60 years. "When [my wife] and I came together, we would agree that we were different. We could have said, 'This is my way. This is your way.' But you can't lean into just that. ... Just because we came from knowing it one way doesn't mean it's acceptable," a Columbus, Ohio man, married nearly four decades, told them. "The biggest obstacle we have faced in our marriage is our own selves. Marriage is such a selfless thing. I have to put him first, apologize first, initiate first, love first, and serve first. As a selfish human being, that is hard. But what a JOY when we get it right from time to time," said a woman in Memphis, Tenn., who had been married just a year. The project wasn't this ambitious at the start. With the hopes of photographing and interviewing at least 20 couples to show "how amazing marriage can be," the Bowers, who will have been married for 10 years in June, launched a website in early 2014, calling for married couples with inspiring stories. Within six months, they received around 60 entries from around the world. "That kind of got us thinking that there's so many of these stories, someone should really go around to try and tell these stories and show that marriage is amazing, that there's so much to learn from it," said Ryan, 33, who along with Liz, 31, hoped to provide positive and realistic examples of marriage for the many couples they photographed on their wedding days. The Loveville Post Office is one of 37 romantically named branches across the United States. The project was also an excuse to travel, Liz said, so they planned a journey around the country to collect at least one love story from every state. They put their Federal Hill house up for rent, bought a new Winnebago View and set off in January 2015. Fifty states, 41,983 miles, and 98 interviews later, they returned with more than enough material to self-publish "Amazing Life Together." The trip, funded with the help of more than $12,000 raised on crowd-funding website Indiegogo, was eye-opening, Liz said. They camped out in Wal-Mart parking lots by night and discovered the vastness and diversity of the United States while interviewing and photographing couples by day, flying back to Maryland in between to shoot weddings. (Amid all that, they also opened mobile wood-fired pizza kitchen Well Crafted Pizza.) They were invited to couples' homes, communities and anniversary dinners, and though they scheduled many of the interviews beforehand, they met and spoke with couples at random. "Every single couple is very unique. They share their own intimate stories, and it's not often that we get to sit down with couples and hear those intimate stories and really dig deep into what has shaped their relationship," Liz said.

"We were pregnant with twins at the time. We kind of had a stressful summer, with going through all of the treatments and moving into the house at the same time," said Christy. "To talk about marriage and share our story, the more you reminisce about stuff, it helps you remember the good stuff and also the hard stuff you've been through. We actually really liked it. They left and we were like, 'Aw, that was really fun.'" The Tylers, who have been married for nearly eight years, now have two healthy twin boys. Allison Barnhill and husband, Tom, said despite being friends with the Bowers for nearly a decade, their interview was one of the first times they shared some of the hardships they experienced in their marriage with friends: A business failed, and their son Logan, now 12, was diagnosed with autism around the age of 2. Today Tom has a successful business advising company and Logan has made strides, thanks to early intervention. The couple, who live in Annapolis, launched a foundation to promote autism awareness and promote early intervention services.

They were pretty much the first people we told outside of our little circle, and then you know, it's going to be in a book," Allison Barnhill said with a laugh. Highlighting the couples' challenges was an essential part of the book, Liz said. "It's not all roses and sunshine. Some of these couples have gone through excruciating things," she said. "Just being able to recognize that you have an example of a love story that you can look to where they made it through and they fought for it is inspiring. ... Sometimes you need those reminders that you're normal." And with every couple, often came tidbits of advice that the Bowers hope will be useful to newlyweds and other couples in the future. Suggestions ranged from simple (always kiss before going to bed) to the more obscure (showering together was one couple's suggestion for bonding — and for conserving water). Baltimore's love landmarks: Spots with a history of romance -- and heartbreak John-John Williams IV A special table in Little Italy that has been the spot for more than 400 proposals in the past 15 years.

A thriving corridor that was once the scene of countless dates and special occasions for the city's African-American community. And a rooftop terrace fit for a Ravens star to pop the big question.... (John-John Williams IV) Couples also stressed the importance of individual growth, being aware of personal strengths and weaknesses and having one's own interests and hobbies, Liz said. "In a marriage, you're always trying to take care of the other person, but in reality, you should be the best for yourself," she said. The resounding consensus was that "having an amazing marriage does not mean having a perfect marriage," but that spending life with one's best friend was one of the biggest payoffs, Ryan said. "It was always coming back to friendship." Christy Tyler said she's looking forward to seeing the final product, which she feels will reflect a different chapter in her life. She already has trouble remembering some of the details, she said. "I think having it in print for us to look back on and for our boys to look back on will be really awesome," she said, adding that reading about the older couples who have been married for decades will be motivating. "It's inspiring to think we can make it to that point if we keep chugging it along." bbritto@baltsun.com twitter.com/brittanybritto Tips from couples Wisdom from the book's authors and the featured couples: Communicate intention and expectations. One couple featured in "Amazing Life Together" talked about how different expectations of a trip to Target led to an argument. The husband thought the trip was for one item, while the wife wanted to go shop for other things. "They were talking about the simplicity of openly communicating and sharing with each other, not only in the day-to-day, but that also stems into big life issues and topics as well," author Liz Bower said. Listen to your partner. Author Ryan Bower said he learned through the many interviews that listening to a spouse's problem first is more important than trying to fix it. "If there is a problem, my immediate reaction shouldn't be to fix it," he said. "It's not that the spouse wants you to fix it. They just want to be loved and listened to." Always operate as a team. "As soon as you start thinking, 'How can we solve this together?' you've won half the battle," said subject Tom Barnhill. "Whenever you face adversity, you're never alone if you attack [your problem] together. You can overcome anything together."

What started as an Amber Alert in the small town of Culleoka, Tennessee, has evolved into a nationwide manhunt, and neither Thomas nor Cummins have been found. Here's what we know about the disappearance, and the big questions that still need answering: Have either been seen since the kidnapping? Thomas and Cummins left Culleoka on March 13. Since then, there has been only one confirmed sighting of the pair. On March 15, surveillance footage captured them together at a Walmart in Oklahoma City. It looked as if both had changed their appearance: Cummins may have dyed his gray beard and hair darker, and Thomas may have dyed her hair red.

This is the first of several residential and office towers that will be built on the 100-acre property owned by Goldhar and SmartReit, which are better known for building big box store suburban plazas anchored by Wal-Mart stores. April 13, 2017 next play/pause pre Vaughan Citizen By Adam Martin-Robbins The condo wars are heating up in Vaughan. Related Stories More condo towers to rise in... Developers, it appears, are vying to see who can build the tallest residential tower in the city’s emerging downtown core, a.k.a. the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (VMC). Steve Gupta, chair and CEO of Gupta Group, threw down the gauntlet in January revealing plans for two 50-plus-storey towers, dubbed lcona Condominiums, on Hwy. 7 at the Hilton Garden Hotel site. His proposed 51- and 53-storey buildings, topped with all-season “sky lounges,” far outstripped anything proposed at the time. But on Tuesday, Mitch Goldhar, SmartReit and CentreCourt Developments unveiled plans for a 55-storey tower, dubbed Transit City, in the area known as SmartCentres Place, currently home to big box retailers and the KPMG office tower. “Now it’s time, as part of the development of the vision of this new city downtown, to incorporate some residential (development), to incorporate the thing that will give it a soul, a soul being the people that will live here, that will soon call this place their home,” Goldhar said during a news conference Wednesday. Gupta predicted this would happen, when he first revealed his lofty plans. “One builds something and the other one tries to beat it, that’s how development goes,” he said. “It’s really great for the area.” At this juncture, it’s uncertain just how high developers will be able to go. John Mackenzie, Vaughan’s deputy city manager of planning and growth management, said a lot depends on what NavCanada allows given the area’s proximity to Pearson International Airport. SmartCentres Place has plenty of room for more soaring towers. The 100-acre master-planned community — bounded by Hwy. 400, Jane Street, Portage Parkway and Hwy. 7 — is one of the biggest mixed commercial-residential projects in Canada. Transit City, projected to open in 2020, is the just first of several residential developments planned for the area, which will also include three-storey townhomes. It will have 553 units and a lobby that boasts a 1,500-square-foot buca bar, providing refreshments morning through evening, and a 4,500-square-foot buca restaurant. There are many other amenities nearby including a nine-acre park running east-west through SmartCentres Place. In fact, that’s where the planning for this new community started, Goldhar said. “After you consider it, you realize the thing that makes great city centres great are not actually the buildings, it’s the open spaces,” he said. Transit City also stands next door to a 220,000-square-foot office tower, anchored by professional services firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Canada, featuring a 100,000-square-foot YMCA recreation centre, plus a public library. And it’s directly adjacent to an inter-regional bus terminal, with a pedestrian connection to the Viva Bus Rapid Transit along Hwy. 7 and the Spadina subway through an underground pathway. Of course, it’s the pending arrival of the subway, scheduled to open by Dec. 31, that is driving the area’s rapid redevelopment. “In a sense, the table has been set for an extraordinary urban lifestyle, that is transit connected, in this location,” said Donald Schmitt of Diamond Schmitt Architects, which designed Transit City.

By Zoe Drewett / Published 13th April 2017 To make matters worse for the man, his brutal dose of instant karma was all caught on camera. Former UFC and Bellator fighter Tom DeBlass, a decorated grappling ace who last competed in MMA in 2013 recently posted the shocking clip to his Facebook page. The former UFC fighter – who holds a career record of 9-2 – described the scene outside a Walmart where DeBlass is based in Miami, US. “This guy was trying to fight a guy and I broke it up,” he said. “He then took off his shirt and got aggressive with me. Some may think he picked the worst guy to pick a fight with.” FACEBOOK ATTACK: MMA fighter Tom DeBlass confronted by drunk man In the clip, the drunk bloke confronts the multiple-time jiu-jitsu champion aggressively jumping towards him and swearing. “You wanna go, let’s go,” the man shouts before storming up to the fighter and waving a camera in his face. "I got you on GoPro,” the man shouts. But in response, instead of unleashing hell on the angry man, undercover fighter DeBlass swaps a killer knockout for a calming chat. He manages to calm the intoxicated man down without any sort of MMA attack necessary. “Hurting him was my last resort,” the former UFC man said on Facebook. FACEBOOK CALM: DeBlass manages to calm down his aggressive attacker Graphic content: Are these the UFC's BLOODIEST brawls? Thursday, 6th April 2017 The Ultimate Fighting Championship has often been labelled a cruel blood sport by campaigners and, looking at these pictures, it's not hard to see why 1 / 14 Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Brendan O'Reilly spits out blood during his lightweight fight with Zhang Lipeng in Macau in 2014 “As a jiu-jitsu professor my job is always to try and talk someone down, I'm so thankful I didn't have to hurt him. “I only got close to him once I knew I could control his hands. He had too much to drink.” The clip has had more than 356,000 views with fans flooding in with messages of appreciation to DeBlass. “Well handled. Martial arts gives you choices, great job,” one viewer commented. Another said: “Mad respect, gentle giant always try and talk – it’s the best solution.” Related articles Boxer faces Muay Thai fighter in brutal backyard brawl with seriously dramatic ending Joe Rogan the voice of reason as Weidman/Mousasi UFC 210 knee controversy rages on Teeth-shattering brutality of LAWLESS first-ever UFC will horrify you Comments UFC More Conor McGregor nearly sparked backstage brawl at UFC 205 CONOR MCGREGOR isn't afraid to take on any man.

Schwarzman, a long-time Trump friend, is talking with the president several times each week, according to insiders who spoke with Politico.  The inside-the-beltway newspaper reported that the Blackstone Group hedge fund billionaire was instrumental in convincing Trump not to roll back an Obama-era 'Dreamers' program that protects children of illegal immigrants from deportation. And Schwarzman was recently at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort club in Florida. He spoke with the president about how to reorganize White House personnel. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO and co-founder of Blackstone, is increasingly becomg a Trump-whisperer as he speaks with the president several times a week Trump held a meeting on Tuesday with CEOs from General Motors, PepsiCo, General Electric, IBM, Wal-Mart; Schwarzman sat at his left hand Trump's informal kitchen cabinet is increasingly chock full of CEOs, a development that is in keeping with his familiarity with New York's elites but sometimes rubs his lower-middle-class base the wrong way.  The West Wing is undergoing a Game of Thrones-type power struggle, with son-in-law Jared Kushner arguing for more centrist positions. That trend would favor business titans in the president's personal circle of influence, many of whom are Democrats. He was elected on the strength of a populist uprising from 'America First' conservatives and disaffected nationalists in the U.S. heartland. Their chief advocate in the White House has been strategist Steve Bannon, whose power is said to be on the wane as Kushner's star rises.

All of them hail from New York City billionaire circles. Cohn is a life-long Democrat.  Mnuchin, another hedge fund manager, chose Hillary Clinton fundraiser Craig Phillips to helm the Treasury's fresh look at economic regulations. 'The president is a business person, so he's very comfortable being around business people and he learns best by talking to people and observing things,' Schwarzman told Politico on Tuesday. 'He likes being with business people who have run businesses that are bigger than his. It's just a highly supportive environment, whether it's Gary Cohn or Jared, certainly Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross and Dina Powell, these are all people who’ve had very similar experiences.'

(WISN) - The 88-year-old Walmart greeter who was working the doors the day a wild turkey wound up inside the store says he was shocked to learn a few days later that he'd been fired because of the incident. Bob Tallinger said he was told that he should have alerted a manager when he first encountered the bird. "It starts and it goes back around and then it walks out," Tallinger, of Waukesha, said of the March 27 incident. A Humane Animal Welfare Society official was called in and ultimately was able to capture the bird by luring it into a net. In his eight years as a greeter at the store, Tallinger said he'd never seen anything like it. His wife, Janet Tallinger, said her husband's termination is unfair. "He was hired to be a greeter and that's what he did," she said. "He never saw a book of rules that said if a wild turkey comes in here you better run and get management. Granted he's gotten older and granted he's lost a little memory but nevertheless that hasn't prevented him from being an excellent greeter." Janet Tallinger said her husband is the most popular person at the Waukesha Walmart and loved working as a greeter. He said the job was the highlight of his days. "The people, there's a lot of people I know," said Bob Tallinger. Reached for comment, Walmart's corporate headquarters issued a statement: "We appreciate the public's concern and take this situation seriously. While we will not comment on HR matters, we can confirm Mr. Tallinger is no longer with the company."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Lopez Negrete Communications Wins A Sixth Advertising Research Foundation David Ogilvy Award HOUSTON, April 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Lopez Negrete Communications, Inc., the nation's largest independent Hispanic owned and operated full-service advertising agency, won the Advertising Research Foundation's (ARF) 2017 Silver David Ogilvy Award in the New Audiences category for its "Hispanic 'Wonder Every Day'" campaign, created for client Walmart. The ARF David Ogilvy Award New Audiences category recognizes work that demonstrates how insights that go beyond traditional targeting and demographics impacted a business and/or inspired great creative. In this case the "Hispanic 'Wonder Every Day'" campaign exceeded in both. "Success marketing to diverse audiences in today's environment requires a true and deep grasp of the insights that drive not just opinion, but behavior. While the mainstream has become increasingly diverse, the individual segments, of which Hispanic is the leading one, are seeking those cues and communications elements that make the work resonate above the rest. It is this competency that makes me so proud of this team – going above and beyond time and again to deliver on our clients' strategic goals by applying consumer insights to creative product that brings measurable results," said Alex López Negrete, president and CEO of Lopez Negrete Communications. The winning campaign covered four holiday-season milestones founded upon rich Hispanic insights: Thanksgiving – "The Origin" In the TV spot, mom reflects on the Thanksgiving story and sees the connection with Hispanic families who left everything behind in search of progress and a better life. Additionally, online videos gave moms new Thanksgiving recipes that were better suited for Hispanic tastes. Black Friday –  "Tons of Gifts" Eugenio Derbez, a famous Latino comedian, was used to convey the message of Walmart having crazy good deals in a humorous and unforgettable way. Holiday Gifting – "Ride in the Moment" The focus was on what the consumer wants the most – the gift beyond the gift – and creating special moments to spend more quality time together. The viewer was engaged by building intrigue that culminated in a delightful father-and-son connection that tugged at Hispanic heartstrings. Holiday Meals –  "Cooking the Moment" Replicating the family's exact traditional Christmas Eve (Nochebuena) meal is how mom keeps reliving her magical childhood Christmas memories. This is the sixth ARF David Ogilvy Award Lopez Negrete Communications has earned. ABOUT LOPEZ NEGRETE COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

District Attorney Brent Cooper said late Tuesday that Cummins left a note for his wife on the day of his disappearance. Brent Cooper did not reveal to the media details about the content of the note but said it was aimed at misleading the investigation of the missing teenager and help buy Cummins some time. Cooper also said the 50-year-old teacher is on medication to control his blood pressure and would most likely visit pharmacies for a refill, local media WKRN.com reported. Authorities have asked pharmacy employees to be on the lookout for Cummins and Elizabeth. Cummins and Thomas were last spotted at a Wal-Mart store in Oklahoma City on March 15. Related: 11 Facts To Know About Tennessee Teen's Kidnapping "The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing," authorities said in a release at the time. Elizabeth has been missing since Mar. 13 prompting Tennessee law enforcement authorities to issue an Amber Alert for the teen. Suspicion over the relationship between Cummins and Elizabeth were raised after an unidentified student reported seeing the two kissing in his classroom. "She is 15, a child. He is 50, a grown man. She's a high school freshman. He's a former teacher. This is, and was, not a romance," Tennessee Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwynn told reporters. "This was manipulation solely to benefit Tad Cummins. This is not a fairy tale. This is a case of kidnapping." Last week, Elizabeth's father filed a lawsuit requesting the deposition of anyone who might have information about his daughter and his alleged abductor.

Takeoff Technologies and KNAPP Announce Exclusive Agreement Boston eGrocer Takeoff Technologies in the forefront of Micro-Fulfillment Solutions Loading media player...

TakeOff Technologies - Breaking Free from Grocery Shopping! Windows Media Video Quicktime MPEG-4 Video Small Preview Thumbnail April 13, 2017 03:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time KENNESAW, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today KNAPP announced a formal agreement to provide automated micro-fulfillment technology and robotics to Takeoff Technologies including an agreement to exclusively develop the immediate in-store eGrocery channel. Takeoff Technologies, led by two Harvard Business School MBAs, has already begun the process of rolling out several sites this year with retail partners – designed to transform the way the grocery industry operates - by leveraging automation to dramatically reduce operating cost and increase real estate productivity. Takeoff offers a turnkey end-to-end technology solution for eGrocery, which is based in part on the KNAPP robotic shuttle technology for the material handling automation component. The Takeoff business model provides a unique approach to the ecommerce order fulfillment of groceries – micro fulfillment centers co-located at the supermarket level for immediate grocery pickup. The modular technology takes less space, is highly responsive to meet order demand in real time and can delivery groceries quickly and inexpensively for customer pickup. According to Takeoff company cofounders Jose Vicente Aguerrevere; a Grocery veteran, founder of a Latin American disruptive grocery chain and former management consultant with Booz Allen and Hamilton, and Max Pedro; a former Vice President at Walmart International and management consultant with McKinsey, “The US grocery market represents over $700Bn, and eCommerce is only 2% of that – mainly due to inefficiencies and constraints in the way this channel is operated, therefore significantly limiting the value proposition for online customers around immediacy, assortment and price. This means there is plenty of room for growth.” “Saving time and money on people’s everyday needs” represents Takeoff’s core value proposition. From a technology perspective, Alfredo Millán, MIT Sloan MBA, a former industry consultant and Takeoff’s Chief Business Engineer highlights, “After a thorough evaluation to select a material handling automation partner, the KNAPP solutions provide us with the best performance, speed and reliability, and represent best-in-class innovation for micro-fulfillment technology.” According to Josef Mentzer, CEO of KNAPP US operations based in Atlanta, “The exclusive arrangement with Takeoff Technologies is a measure of our confidence that the Takeoff team and business model – using less space, operating at less cost than traditional grocers and pureplays, and located within local neighborhoods – is a solid value proposition. In effect, Takeoff has the right formula to optimize technology, inventory, people and space – in the grocery ecommerce market segment.” About Takeoff Technologies Takeoff Technologies is a Boston-area startup that has the vision of transforming the grocery industry with the development of micro-fulfillment-centers for immediate pickup points using grocery-sorting robots to assemble orders. But instead of forming its own supermarket chain, Takeoff is selling its end-to-end technology platform to existing retailers as a new way to reach customers as part of an efficient ecosystem.

In fact, the increase in these cyberattacks is breaking the trust between consumers and those who hold their sensitive information, according to a survey from Pew Research Institute. Aaron Frank and Alex Cramer were two of those cardholders who experienced firsthand what it's like to be victims of one of these data breaches. The pair were trying to buy sandwiches in Berlin when their cards were declined once again. Their cards had been declined throughout the day, but the lunch tab signaled the moment they realized their cards had been compromised. Upon their return home, Frank and Cramer realized they were among about 40 million customers whose information – including credit and debit card numbers – was stolen from Target in December 2013. In response, the pair decided to come up with a solution. They founded Final, a startup that, among other companies, is looking for new ways of protecting payments and putting customers in control of their credit cards' safety. “The ecosystem of payments is undergoing a lot of different change,” Kaiser said. There is still a disconnect between cybersecurity for sensitive data available to customers and what is available to corporations, said Ruoting Sun, product marketing manager with Duo, a multi-factor authentication company that works in corporate data security. Companies like Final, Ondot and BillGuard are working to bridge that gap.  Final After the incident in Europe, in which Aaron Frank and Alex Cramer say they had a “really poor customer experience,” the two dove into the credit card business. Final combined the pair’s firsthand experience with data breaches and their technology backgrounds. What it is: Final is a Visa credit card that allows users to protect their credit card information by creating linked “virtual cards” for online transactions. How it works: The virtual cards have their own unique card number for every online store or subscription service customers buy, but are tied to the same line of credit as the physical card. This means the cardholder’s credit score won’t take a hit. These virtual cards are generated through Final’s app for mobile phones. “Why in today’s day and age – when these breaches are happening more and more frequently and you can build technology that allows people to use a unique number for every transaction or for every merchant – [do we] use the same static, toxic data everywhere?” Cramer said. Ondot While the creators of Final took credit cards into their own hands, Rachna Ahlawat and her co-founder, Bharghavan Vaduvur, at Ondot created a platform that banks and card issuers can offer their customers on their existing cards. What it is: A platform available for banks to integrate into their apps that allows customers to control multiple facets of their credit cards. How it works: Customers can tie their card to the GPS on their phone, allowing only purchases made in that immediate area to be processed, preventing fraud and false alarms by the bank. Cards can temporarily be turned on and off in the event of a card going missing, and consumers can disable certain types of transactions or merchants. Customers also can easily dispute charges from the app. “Just the fact that in any way your identity or your credentials were compromised, or your card was misused, is a huge sort of blow to your personal security,” Ahlawat said. “Consumers these days know best.” BillGuard With a running ticker on their website of how much money they have saved from fraud, BillGuard tries to combine social media with credit card cybersecurity. What it is: BillGuard is an app that lets users identify suspicious charges on their credit cards and alert others. (Customers looking for it in the app store will find it under Prosper Daily, the company that bought the startup in 2015.) How it works: Customers can view all their accounts and balances on the BillGuard app. The app allows users to flag a suspicious or fraudulent charge they have spotted on their credit cards – it won’t identify these charges for them. The app then alerts other customers in the area that have shopped at the same retailer as the fraudulent charge, so customers are essentially alerting those within their proximity. As with Ondot, users can dispute purchases within the app. BillGuard and Prosper Daily did not return requests for comment.  In the digital age, Final, OnDot and BillGuard are providing nearly-instant capabilities that allow consumers to monitor and control their credit card transactions on their smartphones. By putting the safety of credit card data back into the hands of the customer, these startups are hoping to create a more secure environment. Consumers may not trust enties with their sensitive information, but who better to put trust in than themselves.  See related: Voice assistants begin to answer credit questions, Digital wallets: Merchants to pave the way for consumer acceptance Published: April 13, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Join the discussion We encourage an active and insightful conversation among our users.

(WDRB) -- A Tennessee prosecutor wants pharmacy employees to be on the lookout for the teacher who disappeared last month with a student. Police say 50-year-old Tad Cummins takes medicine to control his blood pressure and will probably need a refill soon. Cummins and 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas were reported missing on March 13. The only confirmed sighting of the pair was two days later at a Walmart in Oklahoma City.  Authorities have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. The teacher's wife of 31 years has filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself in and bring the girl home safely. "Tad, this is not you," she said. "This is not who you are. Please do the right thing and turn yourself in to the police. And bring Beth back home." Police say Cummins took out a loan for $4,500 a few weeks before the kidnapping.

Case in point: President Donald Trump warned House Republicans Tuesday if they can’t pass health care legislation after seven years of promises it could be a “bloodbath” in the 2018 midterm election, according to one member present in the meeting. But is this actually true? Will Republicans face dramatically reduced turnout from their base if they fail to repeal it? I’m not so sure. It’s important to remember that base conservative anger at the ACA is an entirely manufactured phenomenon, without even an objective correlative or specific dogwhistle in play. Most conservative betes noires work on the base because they relate to some very specific anger or prejudiced fear: their kids will be rejected from college because affirmative action gave their spot to a minority; they have to pay their cell phone bill but some poor minority will get a free “Obamaphone”; some Syrian person with a dangerous-sounding Muslim name will come in as a refugee and blow up their local WalMart; etc. These are the ugliest, least informed motivations in politics. They are deplorable. But they at least have grounding in fear of an actual consequence that will affect their lives. The Affordable Care Act is different. Yes, there is the generalized fear that their insurance premiums will rise so that “others” can get less expensive healthcare. But the conservative base inclined to believe this either 1) is already on Medicaid or ACA plans, or 2) has enough life experience with healthcare to be aware of how much premiums were rising before the ACA passed. True, in 2010 conservatives swept to office by lying to Medicare recipients that they would be subject to death panels and that they their Medicare money would be given to “unworthy” poor people. But it’s 2017 now, and those lies have subsided through experience. Meanwhile, the promised “death spiral” of Obamacare is also a myth: the exchanges seem to be in fairly decent shape overall, and the insurance market isn’t going to implode on its own. So will conservatives really stay home in November if the ACA stays in place? Or will a polarized electorate mostly forget about the whole thing if Republican politicians give them some other shiny object to fret about? I’m inclined to suggest the latter. The only real electoral danger to Republicans from a failure to repeal the ACA will come from opportunistic conservative primary challengers who will promise to repeal the ACA where their own legislators failed. But even that is a largely illusory threat, because most Republicans in the House did vote to repeal the ACA, and the Freedom Caucus members who refused are essentially immune to challenges from their right. At this point the best move for Republicans is to do nothing. The polarization of the electorate, combined with the lack of clear cultural consequences for conservative white nationalists from a failure to repeal the ACA, suggests that the GOP won’t really pay a price for failing to deliver on their campaign promises.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Good Morning: We visited a kibbutz in Israel Thursday Apr 13, 2017 at 5:31 AM Ann Young Correspondent While in Israel, I enjoyed the time we spent learning about living in a kibbutz, or communal settlement. It was something I had read about in the 1970s when lots of college kids were leaving the states to live in Israel. I guess I didn’t realize that kibbutzim were still functioning and had expanded in what they do. At the beginning they were all based on an agriculture foundation but we learned that today most also have a factory on the grounds. The one we stopped at had a plastic factory that sent pieces to both Wal-Mart and Target around the world. The kibbutz that we visited started in 1948 and at that time had 274 members. It was swamp land until 1955. They basically grew corn, wheat, carrots, pomegranates, avocados and radishes to sell to the stores and other farmers. Today they grow the same products and have added 100,000 chicks that are delivered to them every two months to raise. Until 33 years ago, children were raised in a children's home and only visited their parents for three hours a day from 4 to 7 p.m. That was family time and parents were expected to devote that portion of the day to the children. Today 600 people live at this kibbutz and it is one of the largest that remain. Only the 200 members have voting privileges. Every year they add 10 families and those families are interviewed and voted on. You are expected to have enough money to purchase or build a house. No drugs are allowed and there is no crime in the kibbutz. The surrounding area has 500 more group communities. This area is surrounded by 17 burns or mounds and all members of the kibbutz have phones that text. They use text files in an emergency instead of sirens. In an emergency, they all go to the bomb shelter 25 feet underground that is equipped with water, electricity and internet service. That is where they spent their days during the six-day war in 1967. Lebanon is only 30 miles away and Syria is closer so they feel they need protection. A doctor visits three times a week and a dentist comes once a week. Our kibbutz guide explained that the cows belong to the members but the milk is divided equally. She said the numerous John Deere tractors we saw were one of the most important pieces of machinery they owned. Children are not members and when they leave they are expected to go on to college; 89 percent have graduated college over the years. We saw lots of kids on bikes with phones in hand. We were lucky enough to have lunch served to us in the dining hall but were expected to clean our own plates and take them to the kitchen. The lunch consisted of free range chicken and meatloaf plus numerous salads and fresh vegetables. The dining hall is used every day for lunch for everyone but some families don’t eat breakfast and dinner there. The lunch was very good and tasty. It was interesting to see the different workers come in after they had finished their morning work. I was amazed how the whole working of this huge area is managed with everyone taking turns doing certain chores without discourse or fighting. It was an educational visit.

We like this definition. QuikTrip overtakes Kwik Trip, and Costco surpasses BJ’s in annual study Louisville, Colo. (PRWEB) April 13, 2017 QuikTrip and Costco are consumers’ favorite places to fill their gas tanks, according to a new study by Market Force Information® (Market Force). More than 11,000 consumers participated in the annual study, which ranks gas stations in two categories – traditional gas stations and convenience stores, and grocery stores and big-box retailers with gas pumps. The study also reveals trends in food, technology and customer loyalty. Despite the fact that price is the main driver for selecting a place to fuel, Market Force found that most motorists continue to fill up at conventional gas stations vs. warehouse clubs or grocery store pumps, even though the latter tend to offer a lower price per gallon, particularly when combined with loyalty rewards. For their most recent trip to the pump, 71% of drivers visited a gas station compared to 29% who visited a grocer, warehouse club or big-box retailer. Other key influencers in choosing a fueling stop are good lighting, fuel quality and payment options. [See Graph 1.] QuikTrip is No. 1 Among Gas Stations and C-Stores Of the gas station and convenience store brands studied, QuikTrip ranks as America’s favorite, overtaking similarly named Kwik Trip, which fell four spots to fifth place. Cumberland Farms – which didn’t earn enough votes in 2016 to make the list – ranked second, while Sheetz moved up this year to rank third and Wawa dropped one place to fourth. Casey’s General Stores and Marathon Oil each gained eight percentage points this year, and Phillips 66 is again the highest-ranking national gas station brand. [See Graph 2.] Oklahoma-based QuikTrip (QT) operates hundreds of convenience stores in the Midwest, South and Southeast. It’s known for its robust training process and loyal employees, as well as clean facilities, plenty of on-site lighting and an array of fresh food items. Murphy Wins on Price, QuikTrip on Fuel Quality Market Force also evaluated how well fuel brands deliver on a spectrum of attributes. Murphy was the price-leader for the second consecutive year, placing ahead of Cumberland Farms and Wawa. Kwik Trip tied with QuikTrip for cashier service and received high marks for appearance. QuikTrip dominated many of the other categories, ranking first in key areas such as fuel quality, merchandise selection, pump speed, ease of getting in and out, appearance of fueling area and availability of cleaning supplies. [See Graphs 3 & 4.] “We’re seeing huge spreads in many of these categories, and several are areas that could be better managed by the individual locations,” said Cheryl Flink, chief strategy officer for Market Force. “For instance, having a crisp, well-maintained site and making sure the fueling area has squeegees makes a difference to attracting and keeping customers in this very competitive space. Price matters—but so does image.” Convenience Stores Feed Demand for Fresh Food By offering everything from fresh salads to made-to-order sandwiches, convenience stores are luring hungry motorists and giving quick-service restaurants a run for their money. Market Force found that 21% of respondents bought a fresh food item during their last visit to a convenience store, and 86% were satisfied with the quality. Kwik Trip and Wawa led in fresh food purchases, although QuikTrip’s customers were most satisfied with their food quality. [See Graph 5.] Even though fresh foods are growing in popularity, most people are still buying the basics when they visit a gas station or convenience store. Of the 30% of customers who purchased an additional item, most picked up non-alcoholic drinks, snacks and coffee. Phillips 66 and Kwik Trip had the most retail purchases of the brands studied. What else are customers taking advantage of when they visit a gas station or convenience store? During their most recent visit, 14% used the restroom, 5% put air in their tires and just 3% took advantage of the car wash. Costco Reinstated as Fueling Favorite Among Grocers, Big-Box Retailers In the grocery and big-box category, Costco overtook the No. 1 spot from BJ’s Wholesale Club (an honor Costco gave up in 2016 after placing first in 2015) with a sizeable lead. Sam’s Club ranked second, BJ’s and Kroger tied for third, Walmart was fourth and Safeway snagged fifth place. [See Graph 6.] Costco Has Best Prices, But Hard to Enter/Exit When Market Force looked at the attributes that drive customer satisfaction, Costco led in most of them, although it tied for last with Safeway for ease of getting in and out, and was dead last for cleaning supply availability. Sam’s Club and Walmart tied for ease of getting in and out, and Sam’s Club ranked second to Costco for fuel quality, price, pump speed and appearance. The grocery chains had the lowest marks for payment authorization speed, likely due to the extra time required to process loyalty cards at the pump. [See Graph 7.] Only 16% said they made an additional retail purchase when they last filled up at a grocer or big-box store, and, of those, most purchased from BJ’s. Motorists Tapping Into Apps to Find Cheap Gas Gas and convenience store mobile app usage continues to rise steadily, with 13% saying they’ve used one, up from 10% in 2016. GasBuddy, which uses crowdsourcing to find the cheapest gas prices in an area, is by far the most popular app (cited by 58%). However, retailers’ branded apps are gaining steam, with 41% of customers reporting they’ve used one. [See Graph 8.] The most popular app features, in order, include the ability to compare fuel prices, locate gas stations and manage loyalty programs. Plastic is King in Gas/Convenience Mobile payments are becoming more widely used in some sectors, but gas and convenience isn’t one of them. Less than 1% of customers used a mobile payment form for their most recent fuel or retail purchase at a gas station or convenience store. A fairly low one in 10 reported using cash, while 77% used either a credit or debit card. Methodology For the rankings, Market Force asked participants to rate their satisfaction with their most recent fueling experience, and their likelihood to refer the brand to others on a 1-5 scale. The results were averaged to attain a Composite Loyalty Index score. Only chains that received at least 100 votes and represented at least 2% of votes were included in the study. Demographics The survey was conducted online in February 2017 across the United States. The pool of 11,338 respondents represented a cross-section of the four U.S. census regions. Fifty-two percent reported household incomes of more than $50,000 a year. Respondents’ ages ranged from 18 to over 65. Approximately 72% were women and 27% were men.

By Andrea Arscott, Senior Columnist You’re super horny right now. You think, “Why did I bring this guy that looks like an underwear model up to my bedroom? I knew I wouldn’t be able to control myself, and any condom I find in the back of my nightstand drawer probably expired last year.” Then he whispers into your ear, “Do you have a condom?” You respond, “I sure as hell hope so.” Reaching into the naughty section of your drawer, you find one. Knowing that it’s old, you surrender to your desires, refusing to check if it’s expired and/or damaged, and start ripping into it with your teeth. Unfortunately, you’re not the smart one in this equation. The supermodel looking down at you says, “Wait, slow down! Geez, turn the light on, and let’s make sure this bad boy’s ready to roll.” Trembling, you stutter, “Oh, okay. Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.” But you know it’s a horrible idea. He checks the date and says, “Sorry, tonight’s not your lucky night. This expired in 2012.” Your face turns red, and you let out a sigh and mutter, “Damn it!” He asks if you want to watch a movie, and you scurry off for popcorn, chocolate, and an extra-large glass of wine. The next day you go shopping for condoms at the closest Walmart. You sneak into the forbidden aisle keeping one eye on the merchandise, while the other looks out for people you might know walking by. There are so many types and brands of condoms: extra-large, flavoured, sensitive, thin, glow-in-the dark, fire and ice, Durex or Trojan, lubricated or non-lubricated, latex or polyurethane, and the list goes on. Sweat drips down your face and you make a dash—empty-handed—for the McDonald’s, conveniently located inside the store. You buy a cheeseburger meal with a sundae and chow down while you Google on your phone “how to choose the right condoms.” An article titled, “Pick the Perfect Condom for Your Penis” at MensHealth.com comes up (pardon the pun), and you read on. The article explains why size, shape, and texture matter. Although you find the information helpful, you choke on a French fry while reading the part about a trick that the CEO of LuckyBloke.com recommends to determine what size of condom fits a penis best. According to the author, the CEO—Melissa White—suggests that men, “Grab the cardboard tube of an empty toilet paper roll and slide it over a full hard-on. If there’s extra room, your best bet is a smaller condom. Just enough room means you’re at a medium, and if the cardboard tube is too tight for you, opt for a large.” As you lick the ice cream from your spoon, you think back to your recent sexual encounter and decide he’s probably got an average-size penis, so you settle on “medium.” In the language of condoms, this translates to “regular.” Most condoms are sold in this size, which also fit smaller-sized men. However, Durex sells a size smaller and labels it “snug.” Other sizes for most brands include “large,” and “XL.” For more information look for size charts at CondomMonologues.com. It’s important to get the right size because you don’t want the condom to fall off inside your partner if it’s too big, or bust open because it’s too tight. In either situation, you risk pregnancy and contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV. Feeling rather bloated, but more confident, you head back to the sexual health aisle. You purchase what you need; regular, latex, lubricated condoms because you also read that lubrication prevents breakage, while latex and polyurethane protect against STIs and HIV.

Amidst all the distractions, we applaud sustainability corporate leaders working hard to keep their ships on course and “future proof” their businesses by showing how sustainability leadership drives resilience, efficiency and growth. At Futerra, we use a Theory of Change to structure our approach to the many complexities of sustainability. Through our work with companies on their sustainability strategies, we’ve had the privilege of identifying characteristics that distinguish resilient and adaptive strategies from short-term patches. We hope that you can use these to help guide your own evolution or, at the very least, show you some tested roadmaps so you don’t have to spend yet more hours on benchmarking or the business case. 1. Imagining a better future begins with a clear vision and aspirational goals Companies that have a vision for the future are far more likely to progress toward their goals. Despite the seeming risk of not being able to live up to a commitment, big-hairy-audacious-goals are the best way to push forward progress on things companies know they need to do. Unilever’s classic ambition to “decouple growth from environmental impacts,” Wal-Mart’s aspirational goal to “move towards 100% renewable energy” and Nike’s goal to “double the business with half the impact” are all great examples. Yet, companies often shy away from aspirational goals because the path to reach them may be opaque or uncertain, requiring solutions that don’t yet exist. But as Europe’s largest do-it-yourself home furnishing store Kingfisher exemplified with its Net Positive strategy, its okay to set the ambition, then begin with short term targets that get updated over time as you make progress and work out what the path ahead can look like. For example, with timber, they articulated a vision of global net reforestation, aspired to “create more forest than the company uses,” and committed to a five year target of 100% responsibly sourced timber and paper. Unilever, which set out its Sustainable Living Plan in 2010, refined its targets after five years with a new ambition to become “carbon positive” by 2030, among other commitments. And last year Walmart set out its first time-bound commitments for progress against the aspirational goals it established in 2005. Walmart set an aspirational goal in 2005 to operate with 100 percent renewable energy and it was only last year that they set a time-bound target of aiming to power half their operations from renewable sources by 2025. Unilever has met many of its targets but not all of them. But stakeholders clearly appreciate the commitment and transparency, ranking it as the corporate leader on sustainability for the last 6 years in a row. Tip: Be bold when imagining your vision and don’t be afraid to set aspirational goals! 2. Built-in sustainability leads to higher profits It’s no longer just about reduced risks. More and more companies have turned sustainability into huge business opportunities as profiled in rich detail by our North America CEO Freya Williams in “Green Giants.” Among her first class of green giants – brands that have turned sustainability into billion dollar businesses – are well known companies with large, complex and messy operations – such as Nike, Unilever and Chipotle. We often note the financial success of these brands. Nike’s flyknit technology is now used in 28 of its top performing models while also massively reducing waste. Unilever’s “sustainable living” brands like Dove, Ben and Jerry’s, and Comfort are contributing to half of the company’s overall growth because consumers are demanding responsible business and brands. Meanwhile, as of 2014, Chipotle outperformed McDonald’s and KFC owner Yum! Brands by 30 percent. For other companies like Tesla and GE, their entire business model centers around innovations in technology, materials and process design to deliver products with improved economic and environmental outcomes. Either way, as we now compile a list of the “next billion” companies, it’s clear that the confluence of purpose and sustainability has a critical role in developing appealing products and profitable businesses. Tip: Position sustainability with leadership and colleagues across the business as a way to stay on the front foot with your consumers. 3. Taking back ownership of product lifecycles In addition to focusing upstream where supplier impacts are often quite large – and often the first point for impact for companies with large and complex supply chains – more and more companies are now looking downstream by focusing on the full lifecycle of their products. And they are doing it with a view to capturing value along the full product lifecycle – not just reducing impacts. Building on early efforts by companies like Interface and Xerox to take back their own products as a way of maximizing value without using new materials unnecessarily (e.g. by swapping out carpet tiles and refurbishing machines and parts), consumer goods companies across the board are quickly identifying new circular business models. In particular, electronics and apparel companies like Patagonia, The North Face, Dell and many others have ramped up product take-back products initiatives, which have a big impact on reducing waste to landfill, increasing reuse and recycling.  They are identifying more and more opportunities to save money such as by reusing parts and materials, and make money by capturing resale and rental markets. Tip: Don’t leave money on the table! Capture missed profit opportunities and reduce waste by finding opportunities to resell, reuse, or refurbish. 4. Giving consumers a role in making change People want to be, and want their brands to be a force for good.  So companies are connecting with consumers by providing them with opportunities to take action. Apparel companies like H&M are inviting consumers to bring their used items back into the store for recycling. Others are inviting consumers to contribute to a cause by donating profits (or a portion of them) towards a specific cause, like Patagonia’s 100 Percent for the Planet campaign, or Macy’s Shop for a Cause.  Companies are also inviting consumers to take action, like Heinz’s Selfie for Good campaign to fight hunger. Engaging consumers recognizes that they have a role in imagining a better future for all of us. Tip: Make your consumer the hero in making change. Everyone loves being a protagonist. 5. Aligning with the SDGs to achieve focus With the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals having honed the world’s focus by providing a roadmap and a timeline – “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all by 2030,” many more companies are aligning their strategies with them than we saw with the Millennium Development Goals. With 169 targets to pick from, companies are focusing their efforts on both core impact areas as well many of the less obvious areas of business impact. According to initiatives tracked by the Business for 2030 portal, which tracks data from 47 global organizations, SDG No. 3 — ensure healthy lives – is the most popular choice with health-focused companies like Merck and non-health focused companies like Levi Strauss investing together in eradicating HIV/Aids. SDG No. 7 — ensure energy for all — follows that closely with many companies joining hands to make a strong push toward renewables. In third place for now is SDG No. 8 — promote economic growth and decent work: a clear area for businesses regardless of size or location can have influence by providing good jobs. Then there are offshoot initiatives focused on specific SDGs that continue to start up as we settle into 2017, such as Alliance 8.7 focused on eradicating forced and child labor and Champion 12.3 focused on reducing food waste. Tip: Take a moment to identify how you your sustainable development efforts align with the SDGs.  You may be able to achieve a greater impact – and recognition – by focusing your efforts on these goals first. 6. Partnering with competitors to tackle industry-wide challenges Challenges such as poverty, climate change and human rights remain bigger and more complex than any single company could take on alone. Shared recognition of this has encouraged companies to increasingly turn their strategic sights toward industry-wide collaborations. Participation in long running collaborative initiatives like the CEO Water Mandate, Human Rights Working Group and Consumer Goods Forum have continued to grow and are giving way to an ever increasing number of initiatives such as RE100 addressing renewable energy, Fashion for Good driving improvements in fashion and a host of others issue building inclusive economies, gender parity. Tip: If you are struggling with something in your business or supply chain, chances are other companies are too, so why not look around for pre-competitive opportunities to collaborate. 7. Setting environmental targets focused on outcomes Companies are getting serious about measuring their environmental impacts, starting with carbon and pushing the boundaries from there. Science-based targets have taken hold with over 200 companies now committed to set greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions reductions targets based on scientific estimates of what’s needed. Despite a political shift in the U.S. on climate change, many companies are continuing to plow ahead to power more of their operations with renewable energy sources. Google announced a full shift to renewable energy in 2017. One thousand companies and investors — including Levi’s, Hewlett Packard and Mars — have taken an activist stance, signing on to the Low Carbon USA initiative urging the U.S. to re-affirm its commitment to implementing the Paris climate agreement. But this has not stopped at GHGs. MARS, for instance, is extending the concept of setting targets based on what is needed rather than what is feasible to land and water, part of a broader strategy to focus on the impacts of their business. Tip: Look for areas where you can challenge your company to go beyond the incremental improvements that seem easy  to achieve and consider adopting one of the methodologies that help companies calculate backwards from what is needed. 8. Addressing inequality in the supply chain Many companies are tackling growing labor shortages and dwindling small farmer communities by exploring fundamentally different business models that would give workers and farmers a bigger portion of the final product value. These are hard conversations – both for public and for private companies.  Some companies like Barry Callebaut are beginning to set measurable targets here. But as consumers grow more aware and therefore, less tolerant of inequality, companies are increasingly investing in the work required to map, understand and then engage with their supply chains. Tip: Question the status quo.  There may be ways to adapt business models to enable the lowest earning stakeholders (farmers and employees) a more equitable share of profits. In a year underlined by a sense of uncertainty, there has never been a more crucial time to start mapping your sustainability strategy – one that can withstand political and economic headwinds, is measurable, intentional and can help your business grow resiliently.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said former vice president Mary De Luis’ claims did not become moot when she resigned last May, after the bank allegedly retaliated for her role in the case by refusing to allow a transfer to Miami from Dallas unless she accepted a demotion. The judge also said another ex-employee, former vice president Allison Gamba, had standing to pursue her claims even after Goldman left her without a job in August 2014 when it “divested itself” of her department. Torres said a judge who previously oversaw the 6-1/2-year-old lawsuit misinterpreted a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, in finding that former employees like De Luis and Gamba who sought “reinstatement” could not sue. In an email, Goldman said it was “examining the implications of the latest ruling and will continue to contest this matter vigorously.” The plaintiffs accused Goldman of systematically paying women less than men, and giving them weaker performance reviews that impeded their career growth. Their lawsuit, which began in September 2010, also included allegations that Goldman maintained a “boys’ club atmosphere.” This included the use of sexual language, unwanted touching and subjecting women to the “double-edged sword” of being expected to socialize after work with colleagues to advance their careers, it said, but risk being labeled “party girls” if they did. The other named plaintiffs include former Goldman employees Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, who were a vice president and associate, respectively. A fifth plaintiff agreed to arbitration. Torres “brought consistency to how the Southern District of New York interprets standing,” Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview, referring to the Manhattan court. “This had been a big stopping point in the case and all four plaintiffs can seek class-action status.” Class-action certification could let thousands of women sue together, raising the potential for larger awards without excessive legal costs. The case is Chen-Oster et al v. Goldman Sachs & Co. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-06950. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, editing by G.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Shurtz, Delon on April 13, 2017. Delon Shurtz Lethbridge Herald dshurtz@lethbridgeherald.com A 27-year-old mother of three young children was only facing a shoplifting charge until she decided to brandish a knife at a store security officer last month. Tia Ronel Bareshinbone was caught stealing from the northside Walmart in March, but while being arrested, she struggled with the loss prevention officer and was taken to the ground. When she got back up she was holding a knife and brandished it threateningly at the officer. “It was a knee-jerk reaction,” Lethbridge lawyer Tracy Hembroff explained this week in provincial court, where Bareshinbone pleaded guilty to one count of assault with a weapon. Hembroff told court her client doesn’t have a drug problem, but had started drinking after her sister died not long ago. “She has fallen off the wagon.” Hembroff also said Bareshinbone has been a victim of severe domestic violence over the years, for which her partner served jail time for assaulting her. Crown prosecutor Vaughan Hartigan said Bareshinbone likely didn’t pull the knife in an attempt to escape from the security officer, but she was angry over the scuffle with him. Hartigan also suggested that even though the woman didn’t intend to harm the officer, she accidently could have. “They (store security officers) are somewhat vulnerable individuals,” Hartigan said. Bareshinbone was sentenced to nine months in jail, but given credit for the equivalent of 60 days she already spent in custody, leaving seven months on her sentence. She will be on probation for nine months, during which she is prohibited from going to the northside Walmart store, and she is not to have any contact with the security officer. Bareshinbone is also prohibited from possessing certain firearms and weapons for 10 years, and others for life, and she must submit a sample of her DNA for the National DNA Databank.

RuPaul’s Drag Race Enlivens the Stage RuPaul’s Newest Lineup Brings Trans Cabaret to Wide Audience Thursday, April 13, 2017 By Maggie Yates Article Tools Print friendly E-mail story Tip Us Off Comments (0) Share Article Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+1 del.icio.us. Digg! Yahoo! Buzz Diigo google newsvine reddit technorati Yahoo! Myspace RuPaul’s Drag Race, now in its ninth season, premiered recently with a new bevy of gender-bending beauties competing for the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar. Drag Race is equally edgy and effervescent, and consistently awes and entertains, even after almost a decade of the now-familiar format. Once a flagship on Logo TV, a network geared specifically toward a young, gay demographic, this festive juggernaut, helmed by legendary drag performer and TV personality RuPaul, has breached the mainstream current and is now produced by VH1. Season 9 competitors include Peppermint (the sassy yet classy N.Y.C. club performer), Valentina (the Latina, neo-beatnik fashionista), Eureka O’Hara (the Southern-fried, Wal-Mart queen named after a vacuum cleaner), Charlie Hides (the ambiguously European celebrity impersonator), Sasha Velour (the high-concept performance artist), Alexis Michelle (the theatrically trained Broadway hopeful), Shea Couleé (self-described as a “champagne lifestyle on a lemonade budget”), Trinity Taylor (the plastic-surgery, pageant girl), Aja (the Brooklyn up-and-comer), Jaymes Mansfield (the ditzy bobble-head doll with, for some reason, puppets), Nina Bo’nina Brown (the paper-and-clay cosplay queen), Farrah Moan (the slinky Vegas showgirl), and Kimora Blac (the vamp-tramp Vegas “showgirl”). The excitement of first impressions as each of the queens makes their Drag Race debut is overshadowed by the entry of an ethereal diamond duchess in fetish boots and a bejeweled body suit: mega-pop star (and female drag artist) Lady Gaga. Gaga, aka Stefani Germanotta, is a woman — but drag is about subverting traditional gender lines, and with its ever-more-steady footing in pop culture, “drag” is evolving in its meaning to include artistic alter-egos along the entirety of the gender spectrum, from bearded lumberjack queens to I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-butter female impersonators. In recent decades, the perception of drag has evolved, as well, from underground, gay cabaret act to high art. This premiere gives the audience a taste of each queen’s drag persona with an exhibition of runway fashion: one ensemble inspired by their hometown, and one inspired by the guest judge, Gaga. In an exciting twist, a new contestant, a previous-season runner-up returning to compete, is teased in the last few seconds of the episode. RuPaul serves as host, head of the judges’ panel, and sage creative and career adviser to the competitors. With each episode, the queens are challenged to display those qualities that every great performer — especially those artists who convey the experience of a fringe subculture — needs to succeed: their charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. Amid the glamour of the runway, the impressive craftsmanship of the costuming, and the absurdist dramatics of a dozen lavish personalities competing for a title (and $100,000), Drag Race knows the importance of genuine vulnerability from the queens — and always delivers. Drag Race pushes the boundaries of drag while simultaneously making the art form more accessible and relatable, thus normalizing that subset of the transgender experience on a wider scale. RuPaul’s Drag Race airs Friday nights at 5 p.m. on VH1. Sign Up for Daily Newsletter Be succinct, constructive, and relevant to the story.

To the internet I went, unraveling the fascinating world of homemade dye. I was frankly overwhelmed with how many variations there were to making dye. How did people do this before those cheap Walmart kits were invented? Lissette Vaca / Daily Nexus I decided that, due to my skills as a novice egg-dyer, I wanted to give myself plenty of options so I could figure out which one worked best. My options were abundant regarding the materials I could use to create dye. I chose a few: orange Kool-Aid, avocado skins, red cabbage, spinach, blueberries and red onion skins. Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus Each recipe required the eggs to be hardboiled beforehand. The ingredients should be placed in a pot with four cups of water and a tablespoon of white wine vinegar brought to a boil. CAUTION: If you choose to do multiple eggs like I did, each ingredient should be boiled in its own separate water. The cooking process is what activates the color, and placing them all in the same pot is like mixing your kindergarten paints together to get that weird brown color. Once the ingredients have come to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer for approximately 15 minutes. Then, remove from heat, strain the now dyed liquid into a bowl and toss the boiled veggies or fruit and let cool. Once the mixture is cool, add an additional tablespoon of vinegar and then soak the eggs in the dye until they are at the desired color. For most of these mixtures, I had to leave the eggs in overnight to get the color rich enough. So how did each option turn out and what colors did they produce? I started with the Kool-Aid because it was the most similar to the artificial dye of my childhood. After soaking for about two hours, the eggs had a cool marbled orange color that developed yellow and pink splotches as time went on. The Kool-Aid created these strange crystalline patterns most likely because the sugar was revolting against being boiled with vinegar; nonetheless, the result was a cool, zesty mixture. Next, I tried the avocado skins because, apparently, the skins were supposed to dye my eggs a light pink color, which I was highly skeptical of. I attempted to create this mystical color, but all my efforts produced nothing but a cloudy green water and wilted avocado skins. At least I got guacamole. Due to the horrible outcome of this attempt, I was starting to get disheartened. Next up was the onion skins, and boy did that one turn my mood around! As soon as the onion skins touched the water they began to ooze color. The eggs turned a solid and successful brick red. They looked like the freshest organic brown eggs. The red cabbage was next, and it was a surprise to say the least. The cabbage turned the water a deep purple color that I eagerly dipped the eggs in, but the color took forever to set. It wasn’t until next morning that the color was a deep, robin’s egg blue that was the ultimate springtime color. The blueberries were the finale but, unfortunately, were not as spectacular as they could have been. If I had splurged and Marisa Ratchford / Daily Nexus bought more berries, I’m sure the color would have been more vibrant. My cheap ass only used half a bag of frozen berries, because those are not cheap! The color was a very pale lavender that took all night to set and had strange marks of darker and lighter spots that gave it a cool marbled appearance. Of course, now you’re thinking, “what do I do with all these eggs?” especially if you don’t have a small child to hide them for. But after you’ve Insta-ed the final product, you can use the eggs to make deviled eggs! Simply cut them in half, de-yolk the halves and place them in a bowl. Mix with mustard, mayo, salt, pepper and paprika, then refill the egg white halves and sprinkle extra paprika over the tops.

Since a substantial portion of the corporate income tax is paid by wealthy shareholders, many of us are concerned that “reform” actually means reducing the tax burden for the 1 percent – and leaving a larger burden for the rest of us. But the need for true reform is real. Although the corporate tax rate is 35 percent, companies generally pay around 23 percent. Giant loopholes save companies money, deprive the government of money, and create money for people in the tax avoidance industry. Exotic schemes to game the system are constantly in the news. Take, for example, the corporate inversion strategy, in which a U.S. company arranges to be taken over by a foreign company in order to eliminate its liability on overseas profits. These takeovers generate large fees for the accountants and lawyers who engineer the process without improving the broader economy. “Dead peasant” insurance policies, made famous by the documentarian Michael Moore, are another example. In that scheme, huge companies like Wal-Mart take out insurance policies on their front line workers, such as checkout clerks, to smooth out their profit flows and reduce their tax liability. If a worker dies, the company gets the payout, not the individual or his family. Someone undoubtedly got very rich dreaming up dead peasant policies but, again, this financial innovation does not contribute to economic growth. Private equity industry Perhaps the greatest scheme of all is the private equity industry, which loads firms with debt. Because the interest on that debt is tax deductible, private equity firms can make large profits even if they’ve done nothing to improve a company’s performance. Incidentally, many of the richest people in the country made their fortune in private equity, including folks like Mitt Romney, Pete Peterson, and many other prominent billionaires or near-billionaires. If the tax reformers are serious, and I hope they are, here’s one simple way to largely eliminate the gaming opportunities that have made these people rich. Instead of traditional taxes, the government could require corporations to turn over a portion of their stock, say 25 percent, in the form of non-voting shares. The government would benefit from any dividends or share buybacks but would have no voice in running the company. This system would eliminate almost all opportunities for gaming since a company would not be able to deny the government its share of profits unless it also withheld profits from its other shareholders. And we would not call that “tax avoidance” but outright theft. Many companies might actually embrace this system. They would save a huge amount of money on accounting and bookkeeping, and they wouldn’t have to take the tax code into consideration when they decided their accounting procedures for long-term investments. They could simply do what makes the most sense for them. (Publicly traded companies could be required to give the government non-voting shares, with private companies allowed to choose between this system or a higher tax rate.) Don’t bet on the Republicans looking in this direction – the potential losers from these reforms, after all, are probably rich people who vote Republican.

(Amanda Cowan/The Columbian) Washington State Patrol Sgt. Jason Cuthbert is reflected in the window of a car as he issues a distracted driving ticket Wednesday afternoon in east Vancouver. (Photos by Amanda Cowan/The Columbian) Officer Ed Michael, of the Battle Ground Police Department, watches for distracted drivers in southeast Vancouver on Wednesday afternoon, as part of a multi-agency effort to crack down on cellphone use behind the wheel. By Andy Matarrese, Columbian Breaking News Reporter Published: April 12, 2017, 10:01 PM A   A Officer Ed Michael surprised several drivers Wednesday afternoon, walking up as they were stopped at the intersection of Mill Plain Boulevard and Southeast 190th Avenue, near Wal-Mart. He couldn’t help but smile about it. “They’ll drive right up next to me, and not even notice that I’m right there because they’re not paying attention,” he said, after asking one driver to pull into a nearby parking lot to have a chat with another officer. Instead, they all were fiddling with their phones. Michael, from the Battle Ground Police Department, and other officers from around the county contacted 203 drivers that afternoon as part of a statewide traffic enforcement emphasis to combat distracted driving, funded through the Washington Traffic Safety Commission. Twelve drivers were ticketed. The fine for cellphone use while driving is $124. The other 191 left with warnings. That day, two plainclothes officers hung out at different ends of Mill Plain, around Southeast 194th Avenue. They’d watch for drivers talking or texting, then radio what they saw to an officer down the street, who’d flag the drivers down at an intersection. Vancouver, Battle Ground and Washougal police officers participated in Wednesday’s efforts, as well as the Washington State Patrol. “Most people are OK with it,” said Vancouver Sgt. Therese Kubala. “We’ve had a couple people who are really upset by it, but we have to educate them and say, ‘You know, this is the law.’ ” In general, she said, people seemed to appreciate the extra patrols, and understood why officers were out there. It’s difficult to consistently assess whether a crashed driver was on the phone at the time, she said, but those numbers seem to be rising. According to the state department of transportation, Washington saw more than 12,000 crashes last year connected to driver distraction, with 77 of them fatal. In 2010, distraction contributed to about 7,000 crashes, 15 of them fatal. Part of the problem, Kubala said, is people tend to live in their own bubbles of experience, as opposed to cops like her, who see all the rear-end crashes, and worse, caused by not paying attention while behind the wheel. A visit from a cop, she said, “just brings it to light: ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be messing with that phone.’ ” She said officers on Wednesday stopped one driver who was texting on an iPad tablet he had sitting in his passenger seat. Recently, a state senator told her about seeing, on the way to Olympia, a driver watching a video on a tablet resting on the steering wheel. “We’ve got people doing some really strange things with those electronic devices,” Kubala said.   Andy Matarrese Columbian Breaking News Reporter  360-735-4457  @col_cops  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

WEST CHESTER, Pa. — The Associated Press Published Wednesday, Apr. 12, 2017 10:16PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Apr. 12, 2017 10:16PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print A woman charged in the beating death of her young son has pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to testify against her former boyfriend in his upcoming capital murder trial. Jillian Tait also pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy to commit murder and child endangerment in 3-year-old Scott McMillan's November 2014 death, which prosecutors called a "horror story." Prosecutors said the plea agreement will spare the 33-year-old Tait a possible death sentence and she will be a "critical witness" in the September murder trial of 25-year-old Gary Lee Fellenbaum III. They said Tait had accepted responsibility and, while her actions may have contributed to Scott's death in Coatesville, Fellenbaum's actions caused it. "Essentially, your honour, the defendant will act as a living adult witness to what happened in that trailer," First Assistant District Attorney Michael Noone said. The couple had met working at a Wal-Mart several months earlier and moved in together in a mobile home park along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife, Tait's 6- and 3-year-old children and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. District Attorney Thomas Hogan in 2014 called the case "an American horror story," saying what started as spankings morphed into "concentrated, repeated, escalating abuse" and then over a three-day period the victim "was systematically tortured and beaten to death." "Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten and suffered other acts of violence," authorities alleged in court papers. Prosecutors also alleged the couple went car shopping, bought pizza and engaged in sexual activity as the boy lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse. Defence attorney Laurence Harmelin said Tait "is looking forward to putting the matter behind her." "She will have a lot more to say at sentencing," the attorney said. Fellenbaum's mother said in 2014 he was a good son and she didn't believe he beat the little boy to death. "I believe he's being railroaded," Paula Fellenbaum said then. "He liked kids. He never had an issue. I don't understand it at all." This content appears as provided to The Globe by the originating wire service.

Expat in mexico. Planning for retirement in Mexico. Have many questions. Hi everyone, I just joined and I thank you in advance for letting me pick your brains for info. I'm retiring from UPS in 6 years and am going to buy or build a home (not a condo) somewhere in Mexico. Right now, I'm just doing a bunch of researching to try and narrow down my possible locations to one or two. I am currently looking at the Puerto Vallarta area and pretty much everywhere from Progreso down to Chetumal. I was very excited about Lake Chapala until I learned that there are a bunch of shallow water hazards etc and not really safe for boating/waverunners etc. Beautiful, but I'd like to be able to use the lake and not just look at it. I'm hoping you guys can help me narrow my search a bit and answer a few questions. My must have's are: -beautiful view of the ocean. Doesn't have to be beachfront, just a great view -Must be within 20-30 minutes of major shopping like Walmart or Costco or similar. -Must be within 20-30 minutes of a good variety of restaurants -Must be within 45 minutes of an international airport -MUST be able to obtain hurricane/flood/wind insurance on the property -Must be in a safe area -Must be within 15 minutes of a safe, swimmable beach or bay etc. -Must be able to buy or build a very nice home on a large lot for under $600k US Ok, so here are my questions so far: -Can you recommend a good homeowner's insurance company so I can get some rough estimates on cost to insure a home in different parts of mexico? I'm trying to figure out if hurricane insurance will be cost prohibitive for me in some parts of the country so I'd like to figure this out before spending too much time looking at real estate. If I can't insure it at a reasonable price, I don't want to live there. -For those of you who live on or within a few hundred meters of the ocean, would you share with me your rough home value and what you pay annually for homeowner/s and/or hurricane isurance? Condos are different so I'm mainly interested in single family home prices. -For those of you who have built a new home in Mexico, what advice would you give someone planning to do the same? -For those of you who've had to pay to bring utilities to your lot, can you tell me roughly the length of the utility lines brought in and roughly what it cost you? -Do you feel that the building standards in Mexico are of good quality and that I could have a home built on a steep slope and have confidence that the builders are putting the proper footing and foundation in? -What planning/research do you wish you had done before moving to Mexico that you would recommend I do? Thanks again and I'm sure I'll have many more questions as time goes on. cheers, Steve   #2 (permalink)   Yesterday, 03:31 AM guittarzzan New Member   Join Date: Apr 2017 Location: Portland, Or Posts: 4 Rep Power: 0 1 likes received Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. Forgot to ask: Given my "must have" list, what cities/towns come to mind that fit that criteria? Also, I just got an online quote from IIG for a $550k house within 500 meters of the ocean. It covered hurricanes and earthquakes and costs $4,700 per year. Wow that is not cheap. Is that consistent with your experience insuring your home in Mexico?   #3 (permalink)   Yesterday, 04:04 AM eastwind Member   Join Date: Jun 2016 Location: Cancun Posts: 217 Rep Power: 0 63 likes received 29 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. Everyone here is going to tell you the same thing: rent for a year before you buy. That's going to make selling your old home and moving sooo much simpler, on top of providing insurance against making a huge mistake. Real estate in Mexico is very very hard to sell, especially high-end places. With regard to hurricane insurance, I think you're better off self-insuring. (Re-)construction costs are a lot cheaper here than the US. Just make sure you're more than 30 feet above sea level and spend that first $4700 wind-proofing your place. Put the second $4700 in the bank and leave it there.     #4 (permalink)   Yesterday, 04:34 AM guittarzzan New Member   Join Date: Apr 2017 Location: Portland, Or Posts: 4 Rep Power: 0 1 likes received Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. Thanks for the tips. I am planning on renting in the areas I'm considering for a while to get a feel for the towns and proximity to things like groceries etc. I've worked my butt off my whole life for this next big move so I won't be doing it without spending some time in the town before committing. If I go by the 30ft above sea level rule you suggested, I think that rules out pretty much everywhere on the Caribbean side unless I'm missing something. It seems like I keep coming back to liking the hills above Puerto Vallarta as having a nice combination of ocean views and safe from flooding. Not sure about landslides/mudslides on those hills, but I have more research to do. I love the idea of being on the Caribbean side, but all the wonderful ocean front lots I've looked at seem like they'd be decimated by another Wilma etc. thanks, steve   #5 (permalink)   Yesterday, 07:11 AM eastwind Member   Join Date: Jun 2016 Location: Cancun Posts: 217 Rep Power: 0 63 likes received 29 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. The 30 feet came from my understanding of the maximum storm surge seen in various cat 5 hurricanes. It's a complicated subject, dependent on the slope of the land just offshore, etc, but I think 30' is supposed to be safe. I'm no expert, and your experience might vary. I am renting a condo in Cancun, and asked my maid how high you had to be to escape the waves from wilma (she was here at the time) and she said 6th floor, which is probably 60' above sea level, so one of us is wrong, and she has experience, but that seems like an awful lot of water. I can't imagine anything in the city surviving waves that big. FWIW I'm renting on the 3rd floor and figure I'll just grab my laptop and run if a hurricane threatens. I don't know who would pay for the damage, but the most they can get from me is my security deposit. The bottom line is the building survived, and you can get a lot of paint and drywall work done for $4700 in mexico if it comes to that.   #6 (permalink)   Yesterday, 02:55 PM sparks Member   Join Date: Jun 2007 Location: Melaque, Jalisco Posts: 1,994 Rep Power: 364 460 likes received 188 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. No storm surge here on the west coast for CAT4/5 hurricane Patricia. Neighbors lost roofs because they were lamina. I had no damage. Build or buy a house that will withstand the winds. No reason to be ON the beach plus the cost will triple davcor likes this. __________________ Sparks Mexico Blog   #7 (permalink)   Yesterday, 10:11 PM davcor New Member   Join Date: Oct 2016 Location: Mexico Posts: 2 Rep Power: 0 1 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. Puerto Vallarta is in the ¨Restricted Zone¨which is 50 kilometers (30.5 miles) from the Mexican coast line. Mexico´s "Foreign Investment Law¨ allows you to own real estate by entering a ¨Fideicomiso¨ (bank trust with monthly fee and other costs). Transfer of title should be with a ¨Notary¨to record the transaction in the ¨Public Registery¨. There are a lot of details to explore before a purchase. Hope this helps.   #8 (permalink)   Yesterday, 10:17 PM RickS Member   Join Date: Aug 2009 Location: Colorado Posts: 111 Rep Power: 0 61 likes received 43 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. To address some of you "proximity to" criteria: On the Yucatan the only place with an International airport is Cancun. 45 minutes from there will get you to about Playa del Carmen. Beachfront wise, that area is pretty much developed and pricey but there would probably be 'something' available to build on. BUT, due to no elevation in the Yucatan one will have a 'nice view' beachfront only. Non-beachfront has only views of..... mangroves. Isla Majeres is close but I suspect that isn't not land left there to build on. Around the horn, Merida has an airport and all other things you desire. This is, of course, not the Carib but the Gulf of Mexico. The water is 'nice' but it is not the Caribbean. Same thought about a great view.... only beachfront. I like the beach area 'east' of Progresso but it is NOT like the Carib. Anywere west of Merida is not going to have the kind of beaches you desire. West coast: The two International airports are PV and Mazatlan. Those areas will provide you with many/most of your Proximite wants. PV 'proper' would be good but I don't know if there are any/much buildable lots there. BUT south and north probably would have some left and still be within 45 minutes of the airport (which is on the north side of town, so one could not go very far south of town due to traffic constraints). North one could get to around Bucerias and still have Walmart but the Costco is 'downtown' I don't know much about Mazatlan but maybe someone else can fill you in. The only other place that I think you might would be interested in and that has an airport is way south at Hautulco in the state of OAXACA but that is very remote and I doubt has any of the facilities you require. Acapulco would probably have some of your things but I don't think I'd build a $600k home anywhere around there!

While U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to "drain the swamp" appears to have fallen on deaf ears, Ecuador's efforts to combat tax havens continue to set world standards. According to Oxfam's report "Rigged Reform," 50 of the biggest U.S. companies including Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, Apple and Wal-Mart stashed a US$1.6 trillion in offshore tax havens. Apple was ranked the top company, as it was able to move US$200 billion offshore. Since its 2016 report on tax havens, Oxfam said that these corporations "have deepened their use of tax havens and boosted their investments in building political influence to push for even greater tax breaks than they already enjoy." While the practice of moving money offshore is legal and has become standard practice for large corporations, it still creates considerable a burden for those outside the upper echelons of wealth, particularly for developing countries. The report cited U.N. estimates that tax dodging practices by multinationals stripped US$100 billion every year from poor countries, stifling their ability to invest in schools, hospitals and vital infrastructure to help reduce poverty and underdevelopment. Developing countries are also more reliant on taxing large businesses to form their national budgets, compared to richer countries. Revenue loss to developing countries sits 30 percent higher than for OECD countries because of the moving of profits, according to the International Monetary Fund. Oxfam reported that the US$100 billion lost annually from poor countries amounts to four times what the 47 least developed countries spend on education and could provide safer water to more than 2.2 billion people. Amid the greed of profit shifting activities and on the back of last year's Panama Paper's scandal, there is an increasing awareness that the practice is immoral and unethical. Ecuador is one country where this has been most apparent. Coinciding with the first round of the country's presidential election in February, voters were asked in a referendum "Do you agree that, for those holding a popularly elected office or for public servants, there should be a prohibition on holding assets or capital, of any nature, in tax havens?" The vote passed, making Ecuador the first state in the world to ban officials in public office from having assets or capital in tax havens. According to outgoing President Rafael Correa, Ecuador's rich have stashed US$30 billion - one-third of the country's GDP - outside of Ecuador. It is estimated that cutting out offshore haven and tax dodging practices has the potential of lifting 32 million people out of poverty across Latin America. "Ecuadorean companies that generate wealth and then take it out of their own country, that may be legal, but it will always be unethical and immoral," Correa said ahead of the referendum. In contrast to Ecuador, Donald Trump's election promise to "drain the swamp" from corporate lobbying and donations and fix the "rigged tax" system seems to have all but disappeared. "Rather than 'Drain the Swamp,' proposed reforms have empowered a group of power special interests, corporate lobbyists and front groups to game the tax code in ways that will harm working families, deepen the inequality crisis," Oxfam said. "The president and leaders in Congress must rethink their reforms and build a tax system that works for everyone and not just a fortunate few," said Oxfam Senior Advisor Robbie Silverman. According to the Oxfam report, for every US$1 dollar that the 50 biggest U.S. companies spend on lobbying, they receive US$1,200 in tax breaks. It also noted that several of these companies were involved in powerful lobbying coalitions to pressure governments for more favourable tax regulations, where "gains will go disproportionately to the wealthiest 1 percent." --BERNAMA-NNN-TELESUR >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Crown Prince Naruhito States Desire To Enhance Cooperation With PERMATA Najib Wishes Happy New Year To Indian Community Crown Prince Naruhito Pays Tribute To Malaysia's Fallen Heroes Other News Headlines Kit Siang Scared Of Declaring Leadership Position - Salleh- politic Perodua Bezza Wins 'Malaysia Car Of The Year' Award- business Beach Volleyball World Tour Can Further Promote Langkawi - Azizan- sports Searching For Landmines In The Jungles Of Bauchet- features US Massive Bomb Kills 37 Daesh Militants In Afghan Province- world Most Read News Najib's Visit Proves Govt Commitment On Welfare Of Soldiers PKR Youth Leader Under Five-day Remand Over MACC Probe Crown Prince Naruhito States Desire To Enhance Cooperation With PERMATA Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2017 BERNAMA.

Food & Drink April 09, 2017 8:03 AM Packaged salads recalled from Walmart after dead bat found inside By David J. Neal dneal@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Fresh Express recalled its Organic Marketside Spring Mix from Walmart stores in the Southeastern United States Saturday because a dead bat was found in a packaged salad in Florida. As the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s recall chart notes, if there’s the possibility of bat body parts, there’s a “minimal risk of rabies contamination.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s working with the FDA and the Florida Department of Health to investigate the situation. While Fresh Express’ recall notice tiptoes around the bat issue — “Fresh Express was notified that extraneous animal matter was allegedly found in a single container of the salad” — the CDC had this to say on its website: “Two people in Florida reported eating some of the salad before the bat was found. The bat was sent to the CDC rabies lab for laboratory testing because bats in the United States sometimes have been found to have this disease. The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies.” The CDC did say the risk of rabies transmission is very low, but not zero, so the organization recommended the two eaters of the organic salad begin treatment as if they’d been exposed to rabies. Both report good health so far, according to the CDC. As for the recalled product, it comes in a five-ounce, clear container. The best-by date is April 14, 2017, with production code G089B19. Customers can toss it or return it to the Walmart of purchase. Those with questions can call the Fresh Express Consumer Response Center 800-242-5472 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. In addition to Florida, the salads went to Walmart stores in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

This time of year we get to flirt with warm fronts but early spring warmth is elusive. Then again, be careful what you wish for. As the thermometer rises so does the risk of severe thunderstorms. Amazingly, severe thunderstorms have been costlier than hurricanes here in the USA over the last decade. And 2017 is getting off to an inauspicious start: 5 separate billion dollar weather/climate disasters from January through March; the most since records began in 1980. NOAA reports 536 preliminary tornadoes in 2017, to date, the most on record so early in the season. I predict a lively severe storm season in Minnesota, especially May and June. Expect a ration of lukewarm sun today with low 60s. More showers return Friday into Saturday, even a clap of thunder, but any severe T-storms should pass off to our south - deeper in the warm, humid air. Sunday looks like the drier day of the weekend. Next week is Severe Weather Awareness Week in Minnesota. It's time to prepare.  Map credit: Preliminary tornado touchdowns in 2017, courtesy of NOAA SPC. Going...Going... True, the skiing will be good into early June from the Rockies westward to the Sierra Nevada. But snow is going fast, pockets of slush from northern Wisconsin into the U.P. of Michigan and northern New England. Map: NOAA. Relatively Quiet Spell. America sees a bit of a break in the severe thunderstorm department into the weekend, as heavy showers and T-storms lift across the Midwest into the Great Lakes Friday and Saturday. Soggy weather over the Pacific Northwest gives way to drier conditions and badly-needed sunshine over the weekend. Meteorologists can finally catch their breath. 84-hour 12 KM NAM: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Springy Spurts. No hot fronts brewing, not yet, but temperatures trend a few degrees above average the next 2 weeks, according to ECMWF. If the sun comes out Saturday (questionable) 70F is not out of the question in the Twin Cities. MSP Meteogram: WeatherBell. El Nino Threat Looms as Pacific Heats Up. Here's an excerpt from The Wall Street Journal: "An El Niño weather phenomenon will likely occur again this year as the Pacific Ocean heats up, Australia’s weather bureau said Tuesday, bringing potentially bad news for some of the world’s poorest regions. At the start of 2017, forecasters around the world were in general anticipating neutral weather conditions for this year. Now, all models that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology uses in forecasting the naturally occurring phenomenon indicate an El Niño will form this year or in early 2018. The agency noted that parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean surface are already one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than normal..." Fewer Freezing Nights. The growing season is getting longer, nationwide. Here's an excerpt from Climate Central and WXshift: "The growing season is underway in parts of the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. As the world warms, the average date of that last spring freeze is occurring earlier in the year, extending that season. While the longer growing season does have some benefits, it also raises concerns about both agriculture and health. Consistently warmer weather helps pests survive longer while also stressing crops and potentially decreasing yields. Each crop thrives in a favored temperature range, so net warming can lead to a geographical shift in areas that have been historically productive for a particular crop. Correspondingly, higher overnight temperatures tend to reduce the productivity and quality of grains and fruits, which can drive up the cost of produce at the supermarket..." Sorry, Chicago. Nashville Was the USA's Windiest City in 2016. USA TODAY has details: "The windiest city in the U.S. in 2016 was Nashville, according to a yearly analysis of weather data from CoreLogic, a research and consulting firm. The city came in first among the nation's largest 279 metro areas, CoreLogic said. The ranking takes into account both the number of strong wind events as well as the total force caused by any severe wind gusts of 60 mph or more. Nashville had 21 wind-related events in 2016 and a maximum wind speed of 72 mph. It was followed by Reno, Jackson, Miss., Cincinnati and Columbia, S.C. , as the USA's windiest cities last year, according to CoreLogic. All of the USA's highest wind speeds in 2016 were recorded during Hurricane Matthew's rampage up the East Coast, with the highest being 101 mph, which was recorded at Kennedy Space Center on Oct. 6..." World Record Wind on April 12, 1934. The record at Mt. Washington held until 1996, when an unmanned weather instrument at Barrow Island, Australia measured a wind gust to 253 mph during Typhoon Olivia. More details from The Mount Washington Observatory: "...As the day wore on, winds grew stronger and stronger. Frequent values of 220 mph were recorded between 12:00 and 1:00 pm, with occasional gusts of 229 mph. Then, at 1:21 pm on April 12, 1934, the extreme value of 231 mph out of the southeast was recorded. This would prove to be the highest natural surface wind velocity ever officially recorded by means of an anemometer, anywhere in the world. "'Will they believe it?' was our first thought. I felt then the full responsibility of that startling measurement. Was my timing correct? Was the method OK? Was the calibration curve right? Was the stopwatch accurate?..."  – Log Book entry, Sal Pagliuca. Photo credit: "The Mt. Washington Auto Road Stage Office, where the Observatory was first established, with an anemometer mounted on the roof and thermometer housing mounted on the northern exterior wall." America's Flood Insurance System is Sinking. CBS News has the details: "Here’s some bad news for the 5 million Americans who have flood insurance policies: Premiums will rise an average 6.3 percent this year, according to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). But this could be followed by even worse news when rates rise as much as 25 percent a year until the NFIP -- now $24 billion underwater and in debt -- becomes “actuarily sound.” It’s up to Congress to throw policyholders a life raft, which it has to do by Sept. 30, when the current program expires. Flooding nationwide caused by torrential downpours and tornadoes, has brought home to millions of Americans the need for flood insurance, many of whom were surprised to learn they didn’t have it. An estimated 43 percent thought it was included in their homeowners’ policies. It’s not..." File image: USGS. Tornado-Siren False Alarm Shows Radio-Hacking Risk. The Wall Street Journal has more on the recent hacking of the emergency sirens in Dallas: "...A hacker with understanding of radio technology and the right access to low-cost “software-defined radio” equipment could reproduce the Dallas siren attack elsewhere, said Chris Risley, the CEO of Bastille Networks Inc., a San Francisco company that specializes in radio-frequency security. A hacker might, for example, record the tones emitted during routine tests and then replay those tones to activate the system. “It could happen in other cities,” Mr. Risley said. Similar techniques were used as early as in the 1970s, when early hackers applied them to manipulate devices on telephone networks, security experts say..."

Photo: Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News/Associated Press. NOAA Busts Tornado Myths. AL.com has a good selection of popular myths in need of debunking; here's an excerpt: "...The idea of opening windows and doors in the event of a tornado - an effort to "equalize pressure" is a waste of time, NOAA said. "Opening the windows is absolutely useless, a waste of precious time, and can be very dangerous. Don't do it. You may be injured by flying glass trying to do it. And if the tornado hits your home, it will blast the windows open anyway." If you're in your car when you see a tornado, get under a bridge or overpass. That's a really bad idea, according to NOAA. You could get hit by flying debris or even blown out from under the bridge. You're also creating another safety hazard by leaving your car on the side of the road..."

Palm Sunday 1965: Southern Great Lakes Ravaged by One of the Worst Tornado Outbreaks on Record. U.S. Tornadoes has a very good recap of that horrific day: "On April 11, 1965, and over a time span of approximately 12 hours, one of the most infamous tornado events in United States history took place across the Southern Great Lakes region. Commonly known as the Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak (more precisely, the second Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak, following one in 1920 and preceding another in 1994), numerous fast-moving tornadoes were unleashed upon the states of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. The twisters claimed over 260 lives, injuring thousands of others and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. It was the worst tornado outbreak in Indiana’s history with nearly 140 killed in the state alone. In modern tornado history, this ranks second to the Super Outbreak of April 3-4, 1974 in terms of violent tornado count in a single North American outbreak, with 17 F4+ tornadoes..."

(NWS Indianapolis, Indiana) Most Billion Dollar Weather/Climate Disasters in Q1 on Record. Here are a few interesting nuggets from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information that provide perspective on the severity of Q1 weather and climate events in the first 3 months of 2017 across the USA: "In the first three months of 2017 there have been five weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States. These events included a flooding event, a freeze event, and three severe storm events collectively causing 37 fatalities. The number of billion-dollar events for January–March (five) is the largest number of first-quarter events in the 1980–present period of record and doubles the average number of events for January–March over the last 5 years (2.4 events). The U.S. Climate Extremes Index (USCEI) for the year-to-date was the highest value on record at more than double the average..." Today's Hurricanes Kill Way Fewer Americans, and NOAA's Satellites Are The Reason Why. Popular Science has a good overview: "...A crucial difference in modern storm forecasting is NOAAs fleet of sophisticated weather satellites. With such advanced storm-tracking systems, it might seem obvious to expect that hurricanes kill less Americans than they did decades ago, but “It’s not an easy number to estimate,” says Franklin. After all, hurricanes are still deadly, and every storm is different. But evidence does exist. In a 2007 study published in Natural Hazards Review, scientists demonstrated that improved storm forecasting prevented up to 90 percent of deaths that would have occurred should satellite-less, error-prone technology still have been used used to predict hurricanes. The researchers found that between 1970 and 2004, an average of around 20 people died from hurricanes each year. But if forecasts were as faulty as they were in the 1950s, they estimated that 200 people would have died each year, simply because significantly more people had settled into the path of destructive cyclones..." Image credit: NOAA. "Hurricane Katrina at its peak intensity. With advanced warnings, most New Orleans residents evacuated before the storm hit." Severe Thunderstorms More Costly than Hurricanes Over Last Decade. A few statistics at Chicago Tribune made me do a double-take: "...Thunderstorms — including losses from damage caused by hail, wind and tornadoes — have surpassed hurricanes as the costliest peril for the insurance industry in the U.S. over the past decade, said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist of Aon Benfield's impact forecasting division. Fewer hurricanes have been making landfall, but thunderstorm events have become increasingly damaging. "While the individual losses themselves may not be as costly as hurricanes, it's sort of death by a million paper cuts," Bowen said. "You get all of these events that add up." Every year since 2008, the insurance industry has paid out at least $10 billion for damages from thunderstorms in the U.S., according to data from Aon Benfield. The costliest year during that period was 2011, when the bill topped $29 billion. The total is already nearing $5 billion this year, up from $4.8 billion through March of last year..." Photo credit: Key West office of The National Weather Service. The Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 Laid Bare the Divide Between North and the South. A story at Smithsonian.com had some perspective I hadn't seen before: "...It was harder still for Northerners to see the news of 1927—the most destructive river flood in U.S. history—as an industrial disaster partly of their own making. After extreme weather swept from the plains states to the Ohio River valley in fall 1926, levees began bursting in the Lower Mississippi Valley in March of ’27 and kept breaking through May. In all, water covered 27,000 square miles, land in seven states where about a million people lived; 13 major crevasses occurred; roughly 637,000 people became homeless, approximately 555,000 of whom were racial or ethnic minorities; somewhere between 250 and 1,000 people died; and financially, direct property losses totaled $250 to 500 million, while indirect losses brought that figure up to $1 billion. Floodwaters did not fully drain until the end of the summer..."

(Science History Images/Alamy) Greensburg, Kansas Overcame Environmental Disaster and Embraced a Green Future. I heard the mayor of Greensburg talk about sustainability and how they've rebuilt the town to take full advantage of wind and solar power at a recent severe weather conference - it was inspiring and I left the talk more confident than ever that other towns will follow a similar path. Why? More resilience and less cost, savings that ultimately get passed on to consumers. Here's an excerpt at ThinkProgress: "...In the months and years that followed, the Kansas town emerged from the ashes as a green phoenix, thanks in part to Dixson’s efforts. Using money from insurance companies and FEMA, Greensburg built the highest concentration of LEED-certified buildings in the country. Energy-efficient structures feature natural daylighting and geothermal heating and cooling. The downtown boasts walkable roads and LED street lights. Wind turbines and solar panels provide 100 percent of the town’s electricity. Dixson said the town wanted to save money and achieve energy independence. Consume less. Generate your own electricity. Avoid the ups and downs in the price of fossil fuels. Thanks to their efforts, the people of Greensburg save hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on energy costs, a huge sum for a town of 800..." Photo credit: Greensburg, Kansas.

Details from the San  Francisco Chronicle: "Solar power met roughly half of California's electricity demand for the first time on March 11, according to new estimates from the federal Energy Information Administration. EIA estimates that almost 40 percent of electricity on the grid between 11AM and 2PM came from California's large-scale solar plants, with smaller solar installations on homes and businesses supplying the rest. When factored with other sources of clean energy in the state, renewable energy accounted for more than 55 percent of power on the grid on March 11. The abundant supply of solar in California this winter and spring has driven wholesale prices near zero or into the negative during certain hours..." (File image: Solar City). This Flower-Shaped Solar Panel Can Power Your Entire Home. The cost is about $12,000, but is there an ROI? Here's a clip from Flipboard: "Meet the Smartflower: a portable, adjustable solar power system that uses GPS-based dual axis tracking to follow the path of the sun throughout the day, similar to the way a sunflower adjusts its petals to face the sun. In the morning, the Smartflower automatically unfolds and positions its "petals" at a 90-degree angle, which shifts as the sun moves across the sky. At night, or when high winds make it unsafe to use, the flower will draw its modular panels back into a folded position, according to Curbed. By always maintaining the optimal angle to the sun, the Smartflower is able to generate 40 percent more energy than traditional solar models..." Tesla Unveils Its New "Sleek and Low-Profile" Exclusive Solar Panels Made by Panasonic. Here's a clip from Electrek: "...Like the solar roof, the move is part of Elon Musk’s plan to offer solar products with better aesthetics in order to create a distinctive brand that can be differentiated from other installers on a product basis. He said when first announcing that they were working on such solar products: “I think this is really a fundamental part of achieving differentiated product strategy. For the solar panels, that means a ‘sleek and low-profile’ look for all residential installation. Here are the new pictures. They achieved that “with integrated front skirts and no visible mounting hardware”. That’s a system developed by Zep Solar, a mounting equipment company acquired by SolarCity before it was itself acquired by Tesla..." Walmart, Advanced Microgrid Solutions to Turn Big-Box Stores Into Hybrid Electric Buildings. Greentech Media has details: "Advanced Microgrid Solutions has landed the world's largest retailer as a partner: Wal-Mart. On Tuesday, the San Francisco-based startup announced it is working with the retail giant to install behind-the-meter batteries at stores to balance on-site energy and provide megawatts of flexibility to utilities, starting with 40 megawatt-hours of projects at 27 Southern California locations. Under the terms of the deal, “AMS will design, install and operate advanced energy storage systems" at the stores for no upfront cost, while providing grid services and on-site energy savings..." Why Flying in America Keeps Getting More Miserable, Explained. Vox takes a look at how we got to this place: "...Anyone who flies regularly has experienced the endless indignities of modern air travel — the security theater, the cramped seats, the delays, the missed flights, and all the rest. Making it particularly egregious is the reality that the crucial ingredient of consumer choice seems to be missing. Most of us have at one time or another sworn to ourselves that we will “never” again fly on one airline or another, only to discover that there are very few airlines one can switch to and that they all seem dismal in their own way. The airline industry, unfortunately, suffers from some serious business model flaws — most notably very high fixed costs in the form of buying and maintaining aircraft, and the problem that a half-empty flight is almost as expensive to operate as a full one..." Circular Runways Could Revolutionize How Airplanes Takeoff and Land. Mashable has the slightly-wacky story which made more sense after watching a video at Mashable: "Circular runways are a radical redefinition of airport layout. They're designed to deal with increasing air traffic, allowing for multiple aircraft to takeoff and land simultaneously. They're the brainchild of Henk Hesselink, a researcher at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, who hopes they can become a reality by 2050..." Kelvin Helmholtz Clouds. These are "wave clouds" that form under very specific atmospheric conditions. A friend, Mike Huang, was flying above Des Moines when he snapped the photo above, resembling breaking waves at the shore. Here's an except of a good explanation at EarthSky: "...Here’s a special kind of cloud known to scientists as a Kelvin Helmholtz cloud. These clouds look like breaking ocean waves, with the rolling eddies seen at the top of the cloud layers usually evenly spaced and easily identifiable. Kelvin Helmholtz clouds are named for Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz, who studied the physics of the instability that leads to this type of cloud formation. A Kelvin Helmholtz instability forms where there’s a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids: for example, wind blowing over water. You’ll often see the characteristic wave structure in this type of cloud when two different layers of air in our atmosphere are moving at different speeds. The upper layers of air are moving at higher speeds and will often scoop the top of the cloud layer into these wave-like rolling structures..." Photo credit: Mike Huang. Moonrise.

Another Record Low Month for Sea Ice. Here's an excerpt from Climate Central: "Climate change continues its rapid reshaping of the Arctic as yet another month saw sea ice set a record-low mark. March data just released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center marks six months in a row of near-record or record-low sea ice for the region. It’s a story that’s been reported so often recently, it risks feeling almost normal. But make no mistake. There has never been a run like this in nearly 40 years of satellite data. Sea ice was missing from a 452,000-square-mile area it usually covers in March. That’s an area roughly the size of Sweden. Warm weather was yet again a major culprit in the case of the missing ice..."

Here's an excerpt of a story at AP: "...It's a big risk for us to discuss climate change because so many people can think that it's a political issue when really it isn't, particularly in the context of the fishing fleet," said R. Decker Watson, Jr., one of the show's executive producers. The waters off Alaska that provide the livelihood for the show's real-life stars warmed by a dramatic 4 degrees in one year. The cold water-loving crab is depleted in the traditional fishing areas, so some of the boats strike out for new territory that is more dangerous because of fiercer storms and is further from rescue workers if something goes wrong, he said. In fact, the new season documents one vessel lost at sea. It was not one of the crews regularly featured in the series, but all of the regulars knew who was involved, he said..." Build Better Energy Future for Montana. Here's an excerpt of an Op-Ed from a self-described millenial who just met with one of Montana's U.S. Senators about (true) energy independence at Missoulian: "...If Daines cares about jobs, he should work with state leaders to remove barriers to solar energy. Last year, job growth nationwide in the solar industry was 17 times greater than the rest of the economy, but Montana lags far behind other states, ranked 40th in installed capacity. Our leaders should be capitalizing on this growth potential and offering coal communities a pathway to the clean energy economy - not making empty promises to revive a dying industry. The Clean Power Plan would have helped local communities down this path. A bipartisan poll last year showed Montanans overwhelmingly favor more clean energy - especially millennials. My generation sees the absurdity of Daines' "all of the above" energy rhetoric that ignores the need to transition away from fossil fuels. We know not all energy sources are equal: the fossil fuels of the past create carbon pollution that makes us sick and overheats our planet. When we met, Daines said he is concerned about climate change and discusses it often with his kids. If that's true, he must see that "all of the above" is incompatible with the urgency of the climate crisis, which disproportionately impacts my generation - including Daines' children..." Shifting Climate Has North Dakota Farmers Swapping Wheat for Corn. Here's an excerpt from NPR: "...North Dakota's assistant state climatologist, Daryl Ritchison, says on average, rainfall has been two to three inches greater in the past two decades. "And of course, that's the average over that time period. There's been years where, of course, we've had literally eight or 10 inches above average," Ritchison says. That may not sound like a lot, but it's a big change from the semi-arid conditions that prevailed in the previous 60 years. Because of a warming trend, the growing season here has also increased two to three days a year in the last couple of decades, and by two weeks over the past century. Ritchison says the added warmth and moisture have helped make corn a successful crop in North Dakota..." Photo credit: "Corn is loaded onto a truck on Larry Slaubaugh's farm in Wolford, N.D. He's seen a big shift from wheat to corn in recent years." John Ydstie/NPR. Climate Change Will Make American Farmers' Lives More Difficult. A longer growing season sounds good at first blush, but dig a little deeper and you start to understand how a more volatile climate system may not be a positive development for America's agriculture economy. Here's a clip from Truthdig: "...We’re predicting warmer and wetter springs, and drier, hotter summers,” Dr Davis says. “The season fragments and we start to see an early-early season, so that March starts looking like a good target for planting in the future. In the past, March has been the bleeding edge; nobody in their right mind would have planted then. But we’ve already seen the trend for early planting. It’s going to keep trending in that direction for summer annuals.” Worldwide, scientists have repeatedly warned that climate change driven by human dependence on fossil fuels presents serious problems for farmers: many crops are vulnerable to extremes of heat, and climate change presents a hazard for harvests in Africa, Asia and Europe. America in particular could face substantial losses, and, at the most basic level, the grasses – almost all the world’s staple foods are provided by the grass family – may not be able to adapt to rapidly changing climates..."

It's all about the configuration and strength of the jet stream, according to a story at The Washington Post: "...Williams focused on an area in the North Atlantic known for heavy air traffic, particularly between Europe and North America, and limited his simulations to winter, when turbulence is known to be at its highest. He examined 21 different wind-related characteristics known to be indicators of air turbulence levels, including wind speed and changes in air flow direction. The study found an increase in turbulence across the spectrum. Light turbulence was projected to increase by an average of 59 percent, light-to-moderate by 75 percent, moderate by 94 percent, moderate-to-severe by 127 percent and severe by 149 percent, although there’s substantial uncertainty associated with the more severe categories..."

New Study Links Carbon Pollution to Extreme Weather. Here's an excerpt from Dr. John Abraham at The University of St. Thomas, writing for The Guardian: "...So, scientists really want to know what affects these undulations – both their magnitudes and their persistence. We also want to know whether these undulations will change in a warming planet. This is precisely where the new study comes in. The researchers used both weather observations and climate models to answer these questions. What they found was very interesting. Using measurements, the authors documented what conditions led to extreme weather patterns that persisted for extended durations. They found that many occur when the jet stream becomes stationary with the undulations stuck in place. They also saw that under certain situations, the jet stream undulations do not dissipate in time; they become trapped in a wave guide..." (Image: NASA GSFC) Climate Change is a National Security Issue, Says the Military. Here's an excerpt from Nevada Public Radio: "Climate change is not a partisan issue. It’s a national and global security issue. When people are forced from their homes because of drought, they end up as refugees in other areas. This puts a strain on the systems of those who take in refugees. The new people feel marginalized as the old residents feel threatened. That may lead to anger and the susceptibility to radicalization of the refugees. All because they didn't have enough rain to grow food. Retired Brigadier General Dr. Stephen Xenakis says that's one scenario that makes climate change a threat to national security. War plays a part in the displacement of refugees, as we have seen in Syria. Any disruption that leads to personal insecurity will lead to global insecurity..."

(WLUK) AA BROWN COUNTY, Wis. (WLUK) -- A number of awards were handed out Wednesday for Brown County dispatchers at their annual awards ceremony, but one in particular will be remembered for a lifetime. It involved a late-night call from a husband and his pregnant wife, a first for the dispatcher on the other line, and a welcome to the world for a baby named Julia. Although Julia is already 11 months old, her mother says she still known more for where she was born, than the name she was given. "She's still introduced as the Walmart baby," said mother, Erin Harris. That's what happens when a De Pere parking lot serves as the maternity ward. The dispatcher who helped the couple deliver their bundle of joy received an award for her efforts. "She was really calm and I think really just reassuring," said Harris. "We knew what we were doing as far as the birth was concerned, but I mean it was awkward and not scary, but a little frantic." Dispatchers train for anything, but there's a first time for everything. Dispatcher Amber Castro had just started her shift early that morning, and this was her first call. Before that, she had never been on the receiving end of very expectant parents to be. "I felt very excited because that's completely different compared to the normal calls we get up here," Castro said. There were probably two reasons why the Harris family was relatively calm themselves. Harris' husband is an officer himself in Oshkosh, and it was the couple's fourth child. One with a very unique story. "Just a happy feeling because we deal day in and day out with so many bad calls. People on their worst days, but this was an exciting thing and just getting off the phone with them, so excited, I clapped, I'm like 'oh, we had a baby,'" Castro laughed. Also Wednesday night, the Emergency Operations Center celebrated the life of communication specialist John Lampkin, who passed away last year after his fight with cancer. Specialist Lampkin's career spanned 40 years in public service. Lampkin was praised for his work, and service to the community. In all, Wednesday night, more than half a dozen awards were handed out. close Trending 1   Overnight situation in Marinette 2   Accused Tennessee AMBER Alert kidnapper Tad Cummins left note for wife 3   'I'M A GONER': El Faro's last hours as ship sails into storm 4   Brown County dispatcher honored for helping deliver 'Walmart baby' 5   Missing boy found safe in Marinette County DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLUK Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Victim's boyfriend charged in Princeton murder, arson Oshkosh K-9 officer retires First business opens in the Titletown District Steelhead Trout spawning run in Kewaunee County ShareTweet × Trending 1 Overnight situation in Marinette 2 Accused Tennessee AMBER Alert kidnapper Tad Cummins left note for wife 3 'I'M A GONER': El Faro's last hours as ship sails into storm 4 Brown County dispatcher honored for helping deliver 'Walmart baby' 5 Missing boy found safe in Marinette County 6 New Ferris wheel, project updates part of Green Bay's state of the city address 7 Victim's boyfriend charged in Princeton murder, arson 8 2017 Good Day Wisconsin Welcome to Mow-Town Contest 9 Summerfest announces more than 100 acts 10 2017 FOX 11 Weather Radio Giveaway
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 13 April 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM PewDiePie pitches Twitch show Best Club Brad Woto (of World of the Orange) and PewDiePie engaged in banter and friendly competition over the course of the two-hour broadcast. — AFP Relaxnews YouTube's most popular creative, Felix Kjellberg – better known as PewDiePie – has launched a new show on live streaming platform Twitch. Best Club is set for broadcast on Sundays, with a pilot having gone out on April 9, 2017.  Featuring PewDiePie and fellow creative Brad Smith (aka Brad Woto of World of the Orange,) the pair engaged in banter and friendly competition over the course of the two-hour broadcast, interacting with viewers through Twitch's live chat function and mulling over the future of the show. The move comes after PewDiePie and Disney-owned channel network Maker Studios parted ways in February – a series of provocative jokes had been the tipping point. More recently, YouTube tweaked access requirements to its revenue-generating Partner Program, a move designed to ensure advertisers' brand campaigns do not appear alongside offensive videos. Dozens of marques including GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson, Pepsi and Starbucks, Walmart, AT&T, Verizon, FX, General Motors, JP Morgan and Lyft, had frozen ad campaigns on the Google-owned streaming site in March. But the April update has prompted concerns among content creators, whose channels now need to surpass 10,000 lifetime views before becoming eligible for the Partner Program. "There's an adpocalypse going on... this month, most likely, a lot of creators are not gonna get paid," Kjellberg said on April 6 . For comparison, tracking site SocialBlade estimates that Kjellberg's estimated daily average income is between US$1,700 (RM7,530) and US$27,600 (RM122,280) . Kjellberg said that YouTube now had his previous day's video at US$110 (RM490). While revenue adjustments factored into Kjellberg's decision to experiment with Amazon's Twitch platform, Kjellberg's interest in livestreaming goes back further than that. He organised and hosted a December 2016 livestreamed event, raising US$1.3mil (RM5.76mil) for Charity Water through the now-disbanded Revelmode sub-brand. He also alerted viewers to his livestream plans towards the end of an April 2 video, previewing an in-progress studio setup. Netglow, one of the names he'd proposed when forming Revelmode, now becomes the name of his Twitch channel, twitch.tv/netglow. Fifty-four million subscribers make Kjellberg YouTube's most popular content creator. He started out in 2010 and amassed a giant following through his humorous take on video games and other topics. Twitch itself was built on live video game streams before expanding into other areas. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested As Samsung’s profit surges, some investors worry about peaking growth Your magnetic smartphone holder could be disrupting your reception Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit SP Setia to be largest owner of prime land in country (Update) Put the brakes on our road terrors Number of ultra-high-net-worth Malaysians growing Others Also Read Afghanistan wicketkeeper Shahzad fails doping test Rafizi lodges MACC report against Nasharudin New Stylo China showroom set to link buyers and designers advertisement Latest News Company behind bitcoin creator sold to private investors Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints GM to add 1,100 jobs in California over five years at self-driving unit Most Viewed in Tech Your magnetic smartphone holder could be disrupting your reception Mere tilt of your phone could cost you security Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Samsung Electronics says Galaxy S8 pre-orders exceeded S7 Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit Everybody hurts as Australia gets yet another mobile network Watch out for the hidden costs of free-to-play games GM to add 1,100 jobs in California over five years at self-driving unit Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(AP) — A woman charged in the beating death of her young son has pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to testify against her former boyfriend in his upcoming capital murder trial. Jillian Tait also pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy to commit murder and child endangerment in 3-year-old Scott McMillan's November 2014 death, which prosecutors called a "horror story." Prosecutors said the plea agreement will spare the 33-year-old Tait a possible death sentence and she will be a "critical witness" in the September murder trial of 25-year-old Gary Lee Fellenbaum III. They said Tait had accepted responsibility and, while her actions may have contributed to Scott's death in Coatesville, Fellenbaum's actions caused it. "Essentially, your honor, the defendant will act as a living adult witness to what happened in that trailer," First Assistant District Attorney Michael Noone said. The couple had met working at a Wal-Mart several months earlier and moved in together in a mobile home park along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife, Tait's 6- and 3-year-old children and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. District Attorney Thomas Hogan in 2014 called the case "an American horror story," saying what started as spankings morphed into "concentrated, repeated, escalating abuse" and then over a three-day period the victim "was systematically tortured and beaten to death." "Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten and suffered other acts of violence," authorities alleged in court papers. Prosecutors also alleged the couple went car shopping, bought pizza and engaged in sexual activity as the boy lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse.

Defense attorney Laurence Harmelin said Tait "is looking forward to putting the matter behind her." "She will have a lot more to say at sentencing," the attorney said. Fellenbaum's mother said in 2014 he was a good son and she didn't believe he beat the little boy to death. "I believe he's being railroaded," Paula Fellenbaum said then. "He liked kids. He never had an issue. I don't understand it at all." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

A woman charged in the beating death of her young son has pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to testify against her former boyfriend in his upcoming capital murder trial. Jillian Tait also pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy to commit murder and child endangerment in 3-year-old Scott McMillan's November 2014 death, which prosecutors called a "horror story." Prosecutors said the plea agreement will spare the 33-year-old Tait a possible death sentence and she will be a "critical witness" in the September murder trial of 25-year-old Gary Lee Fellenbaum III. They said Tait had accepted responsibility and, while her actions may have contributed to Scott's death in Coatesville, Fellenbaum's actions caused it. "Essentially, your honor, the defendant will act as a living adult witness to what happened in that trailer," First Assistant District Attorney Michael Noone said. The couple had met working at a Wal-Mart several months earlier and moved in together in a mobile home park along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife, Tait's 6- and 3-year-old children and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. District Attorney Thomas Hogan in 2014 called the case "an American horror story," saying what started as spankings morphed into "concentrated, repeated, escalating abuse" and then over a three-day period the victim "was systematically tortured and beaten to death." "Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten and suffered other acts of violence," authorities alleged in court papers. Prosecutors also alleged the couple went car shopping, bought pizza and engaged in sexual activity as the boy lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse. Defense attorney Laurence Harmelin said Tait "is looking forward to putting the matter behind her." "She will have a lot more to say at sentencing," the attorney said. Fellenbaum's mother said in 2014 he was a good son and she didn't believe he beat the little boy to death. "I believe he's being railroaded," Paula Fellenbaum said then. "He liked kids. He never had an issue. I don't understand it at all."

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | April 12, 2017 -- 23:43 GMT (16:43 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software When Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical and Ubuntu Linux leader, stepped down as CEO in favor of COO Jane Silber in 2010, no one was too worried. Silber may not have been flashy, but she knew how to keep the company moving forward. In a way, it was like Tim Cook taking over Apple after Steve Job's death. Jane Silber, Canonical CEO, will be moving to the company board while company and Ubuntu founder, Mark Shuttleworth, returns as CEO. Like Cook, Silber was a smart choice. Under her guidance, as she said in a recent PC Magazine interview, "Ubuntu has industry adoption that is both broad and deep. Companies such as Walmart, Netflix, and eBay build their infrastructure on Ubuntu. Telcos such as Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, and NTT build their next-generation telecom capabilities on Ubuntu." In addition, Ubuntu became the go-to operating system for all clouds. Even on Microsoft Azure, by last summer one in three Azure virtual machines were running Ubuntu. Moreover, Silber continued, "Companies such as Google and Intel use Ubuntu on their developer workstations. Further, Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers of gateways, networking devices, robots, and drones all use Ubuntu at scale." What Canonical could not do was make Ubuntu a major desktop player. Windows still dominates the desktop. What bothered Shuttleworth even more was that his dream of making Ubuntu a converged end-user operating system that could use the same Unity interface on smartphones, tablets, and PCs didn't come true. It was time for a change. what's hot on zdnet Windows XP: Why it won't die for years to come US border searches of phones and laptops have almost doubled A big shift towards DevOps adoption is coming ​Samsung unveils customized enterprise versions of Galaxy S8 Shuttleworth still isn't giving up on the Linux desktop. He has reason, and as Windows transforms from a true desktop operating system to Windows-as-a-Service, Linux still has another shot at the desktop. He has also decided to focus Canonical's efforts even more on the cloud and IoT. How he will be doing that is changing. While details are still sketchy, Canonical insiders tell me that Shuttleworth, for the first time in the private company's history, will look for outside funding. For that job, Shuttleworth wants to be in charge. So, Silber explained in a blog post, "We're now entering a new phase of accelerated growth at Canonical, and it's time to pass the baton to both seasoned hands and a new generation of Canonical leaders." While this look like a sudden decision from the outside, it's not. Silber said she'd "originally agreed to be CEO for five years and we've extended my tenure as CEO by a couple of years already." She also won't be leaving the job immediately. She'll remain the CEO until June 2017. She also won't be leaving Canonical. She will move to the Canonical Board of Directors. The dynamic Shuttleworth will take charge in July 2017. Before then, however, we should have a better idea on what his plans are for Canonical's next steps.

The desert may end – in one neighborhood. Pete’s Fruit Market plans to open a store next month, on North King Drive. Business is booming at Pete’s on the south side, and now the owners want to recreate the magic in Bronzeville. In order to envision what the north side store will look like, you need to travel to the south side operation. It has some cool features, such as a barker who stands at the front of the store and shouts out the daily specials. Owner Pete Tsitiridis stands by the produce aisle, giving away fresh slices of fruit. “I cut them and they sample. I give them samples of all the food that I have and they love it. I cut watermelons, cantaloupes, oranges, everything,” Tsitiridis says. Pete Tsitiridis hands out fresh fruit slices at his store on the south side Credit Marti Mikkelson In summer, Tsitiridis moves some of his business outside, so customers can enjoy a farmer’s market experience, plus they can sample Mexican cuisine from a couple food trucks. Tsitiridis is a native of Greece; he’s owned Pete’s Fruit Market for more than 20 years. It’s located just off of 16th street, in the heart of Milwaukee’s Latino neighborhood. He says he’s been looking to expand for years, and has had his eye on the new location, at the corner of King Drive and North Avenue. “I haven’t seen any operator over there that has daily fresh fruits and vegetables and the neighborhood is in need of a store like ours. The location is great, there’s a lot of traffic and a lot of people around and I think we’re going to do better than here,” Tsitiridis says. Tsitiridis says the new store will feature some of the same offerings as the one on the south side, including those delicious free samples. He plans to employ at least 50 neighborhood residents to work on King Drive, including Chris Harris. The store has already hired - and is training him. Today, Harris is wearing a store apron and learning to organize the produce. “They are cross training me to work on every area of the store so when we get to the new store, at least somebody will know what’s going on,” Harris says. Harris says he’s been through periods of unemployment in his life, and is grateful that Pete’s is coming to his neighborhood. He likes that the central location will be easy to access. “As far as transportation, a lot of people who live in the neighborhood can get back and forth, walking or on the bus, so I think it’s a nice addition,” Harris says. “It’s hard to find good stores that have fresh food, because we need it around here.” Amanda is waiting for the bus at the corner of King and North, just a few feet from the new store. She says now, she has to travel several miles to get to the nearest grocer. “The one grocery store that’s close to me is Walmart and Pick N Save and that’s too far for me because I have to take the city bus all the way over there,” Amanda says. Now the 10,000 square foot building she stands in front of many days has colorful signs in its windows reading, “Coming Soon – Pete’s Fruit Market.” Another person excited about the development is Deshea Agee, director of the Historic King Drive Business Improvement District. He calls the grocer a “game changer” for the neighborhood. “It’s a strong feeling throughout the community that, and even as I get calls from people asking, when are they opening, it will change the corner of King Drive and North Avenue, it’ll change Bronzeville, it’ll change the King Drive BID because it’s sitting in the center of our business district,” Agee says. And where there is foot traffic and shoppers – often come more retailers. In fact, Agee says developers are planning a second fresh food market for King Drive, located just a few blocks north of Pete’s.

CAP AND TRADE Californias Cap-and-Trade Program Survives Legal Challenge. Last week, Californias Cap-and-Trade Program to reduce carbon emissions was handed a victory when a state appeals court ruled that programs auction of emissions permits does not constitute an illegal tax because the program is voluntary and the emissions permits have value. http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/13/californias-cap-and-trade-program-survives-legal-challenge/ Group of US States Considers Carbon Pricing Options. A handful of US states are looking at the possibility of passing legislation aimed at slashing carbon emissions, including through the use of a carbon tax, with Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island among those considering such a move. The three states are already part of the market-based Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/group-of-us-states-considers-carbon-pricing-options AIR POLLUTION Sensing trouble, automakers prepare to bargain with EPA, CARB on emissions. For most new-car buyers, haggling is a necessary evil. Now, car companies themselves are learning just how unpleasant haggling can be, as they try to find common ground with the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board on the subject of auto emissions. http://www.washingtonpost.com/cars/sensing-trouble-automakers-prepare-to-bargain-with-epa-carb-on-emissions/2017/04/13/38da20a6-2004-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_story.html?utm_term=.1f8803c482a9 There’s fear that the EPA’s request for a court delay may lead to dirtier air. When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted a stricter smog limit in 2015, forcing states to reduce emissions, many people were disappointed. At the time, the agency reduced the ground-level ozone standard to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75-ppb standard adopted in 2008 under the George W. Bush administration. http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-epa-smog-rules-20170412-story.html Akron, Cleveland, Youngstown air pollution still is among Ohio’s worst. Three metropolitan areas in Northeast Ohio were among 72 areas in the U.S. that suffered through more than 100 days of unhealthy air pollution in 2015, according to a report released today by the Environment America Research & Policy Center. The Akron area paced Northeast Ohio with 188 days of moderate to unhealthy levels of soot particles in the air https://www.law360.com/california/articles/912897/vw-dealer-class-attys-who-asked-for-29m-in-fees-get-3m?nl_pk=b680a054-4635-45ae-aa8d-034a58a44dd9&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=california CLIMATE CHANGE Scientists seek holy grail of climate change in Oman’s hills. Deep in the jagged red mountains of Oman, geologists are drilling in search of the holy grail of reversing climate change: an efficient and cheap way to remove carbon dioxide from the air and oceans.

Finding He Wont Fight. When President Trump chose the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, his mission was clear: Carry out Mr. Trumps campaign vows to radically reduce the size and scope of the agency and take apart President Barack Obamas ambitious climate change policies. California looks to hire federal governments science expats turned off by Trumps climate rhetoric. Over 400 inquiries after CPUC president urges career environmental experts to come west More than 400 environmental scientists and experts have sought work in California following the Trump administrations clampdown on climate science, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/california-looks-to-hire-federal/content?oid=24092726 The Strange Case of the Liana Vine and Its Role in Global Warming.

A bill moving through the Oklahoma Legislature encourages public school teachers to question hot-button scientific issues like climate change and evolution. The proposed law by state Sen.

A Nevada trust fund whose money was born from an automakers cheating on emissions tests should be used to buy clean-energy school buses, a local political advocacy group said today. Chispa Nevada, a UNLV-based division of the Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters, says the Clean Buses for Healthy Nios https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/apr/12/group-wants-emissions-settlement-to-pay-for-clean/ FUELS British Columbia was once a leader in fighting climate change. Now, it’s embracing fossil fuels. British Columbia promotes itself as Super, Natural, and for many years it was praised for walking that talk. Nearly a decade ago, the province enacted North Americas first tax on carbon emissions, putting it on the cutting edge of government efforts to fight climate change. The economy grew even as emissions declined. http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-trans-mountain-pipeline-2017-story.html Carbon Emissions Factor Into Major Oil Sands Shakeup. As global companies abandon the Canadian oil sands at a time of low oil prices and huge losses, some of them are also concerned that producing one of the worlds most carbon-laden fossil fuels may be bad business in a warming world. A wave of sell-offs began last year when Murphy Oil and Norways Statoil decided to pull out of the oil sands. http://www.standard.net/Government/2017/04/13/Carbon-Emissions-Factor-Into-Major-Oil-Sands-Shakeup Shell releases sustainability report, says it spent $193 million on ‘social investments’.

Plans to build more electric vehicle charging stations in California received a boost Wednesday in the form of a $15 million grant that state officials hope will grow much larger. The initial money was approved by the states Energy Commission to create incentives for business parks, apartment complexes and individuals to install charging stations. http://www.capradio.org/93623 Ford faults VW’s charging station plan. Competing automakers are joining the chorus of opposition to Volkswagen’s plan to invest in electric vehicle charging stations following its emissions cheating. Volkswagen’s settlement with environmental regulators and drivers requires it to spend $2 billion over the next 10 years to spur sales of clean vehicles by building out the electric vehicle charging infrastructure. https://www.eenews.net/greenwire/stories/1060053068/search?keyword=california GREEN ENERGY Hydrogen fuel cell cars creep up _ slowly _ on electrics. Hydrogen fuel cell cars could one day challenge electric cars in the race for pollution-free roads but only if more stations are built to fuel them. Honda, Toyota and Hyundai have leased a few hundred fuel cell vehicles over the past three years, and expect to lease well over 1,000 this year.

Not long ago, global environmental activists looked at India with worry. The worlds fastest growing major economy and one of its fastest growing emitters of carbon was building coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip while its leaders argued that burning the carbon-spewing fossil fuel was necessary for the countrys development. http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-climate-2017-story.html Will Interior secretarys visit to Yosemite inspire him to protect our national treasures?

Most Americans believe climate change is real. A recent Yale University survey found that 70% think global warming is happening while only 13% think it isn’t. Those who understand that global warming is mainly caused by humans outnumber those who think it is mostly just a natural occurrence (55% to 30%), and that margin has been growing over time. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fund-manager-paying-attention-climate-110000283.html BLOGS As Oil and Gas Industry Goes Big in the Permian, Efforts to Tackle Emissions Will Be Telling.

We like this definition. Silicon Valley private label manufacturer Pooki's Mahi of Hawaiian Kona coffee pods adds oolong custom tea blends in sustainable pods giving private label customers more options for high quality private label products. Silicon Valley, CA (PRWEB) April 13, 2017 Silicon Valley startup Pooki’s Mahi it is introducing custom oolong tea pods for private label products customers. The single serve oolong tea collection gives customers access to luxury teas used for private label or designed as custom products used in award show gift bags or swag bags in product launch events. Minimum required for private label products or custom logo products. Pooki’s Mahi Founder/CEO Les Magsalay-Zeller explains, “Pooki’s Mahi new private label tea pods product line is a roadmap item approved to launch in 2017. Comprehensive roadmap planning is a common practice widely used by product, manufacturing and supply chain organizations in high technology corporations headquartered in Silicon Valley. Feedback from repeat customers, top online retailers and brand influencers are incorporated into portfolio planning before starting discussions on the future roadmap. Pooki’s Mahi always over achieves and beats roadmap goals set in the previous year.
