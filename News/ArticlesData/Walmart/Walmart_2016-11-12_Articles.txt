MUMBAI: The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Walmart Stores, posted a 7% rise in revenue and narrowed losses in consumer goods market that saw decade low sales growth. Walmart India posted sales of Rs 3,996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 compared to Rs 2,991 crore during twelve months ended December 2014. While sales grew 34%, the company grew 7% on annualised basis. Losses declined from Rs 232.2 crore to Rs 140.4 crore in the same period. The company opened one store after a gap of more than two years to take its store count to 21. The new store opened in Agra was also its first after becoming a fully-owned subsidiary of Walmart Stores Inc. "We are excited with this continuous progress and our contribution to the Indian economy through job creation, supporting 'Make in India' through local sourcing, supporting women entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, start-up entrepreneurs and farmers," said Krish Iyer, CEO of Walmart India, where more than 95% of goods sold are locally sourced. "Through our growing footprint in the country, we will continue to grow our business profitably while contributing to the growth & prosperity of the nation." About three years ago, Walmart agreed to buy Bharti's 50% in their wholesale business that operated Best Price Modern Wholesale stores and terminated franchise and supply agreements related to almost 200 EasyDay retail stores. With the joint venture getting dissolved, Walmart now sells goods only to traders, institutions and kiranas. The termination of supply agreement with EasyDay stores affected overall sales a year ago, when its revenue dipped 32%. Most wholesale operators are bullish on expansion - rival Metro AG, which had not been able to capitalise on its first-mover advantage, wants to double wholesale stores in the country to 50 by 2020. While latest performance isn't available, Metro Cash & Carry India incurred a loss of Rs 142 crore on a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14. Walmart too announced it would add 50 stores in the next 4-5 years in India after store expansion was put on hold until August 2015 amid an ongoing internal probe to check if its local unit had violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While organised wholesalers that sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms operate in 12 states; Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the sales. Soft drinks (12%) dominate the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year. With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance —operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base. In 2015-16, sales growth of consumer goods slowed the most in about a decade, suggesting that Indians cut spending — especially on discretionary products — due to high inflation and a sluggish economy.

Smucker stocks are all set for big moves over the next few trading days. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 13, 2016 at 12:00PM Stocks rose by a wide margin last week, despite a surprising result in the U.S. presidential election that originally sent markets plunging. By the end of the week the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had gained over 5% to reach a new record high. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) added 4% to bring its year-to-date gain to 6%. ^DJI data by YCharts. In the week ahead, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) shareholders are likely to see big moves in their investments tied to fresh earnings reports. Wal-Mart's customer traffic Wal-Mart posts its earnings results before the market opens on Thursday morning. The world's biggest retailer is outperforming the market so far this year on evidence that its sales growth rebound is gaining steam. At its last quarterly check-in, Wal-Mart beat management's forecast for comparable-store sales gains as it enjoyed its seventh consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic. That improvement, plus decent results on the e-commerce side, helped sales tick slightly higher despite an almost 3-percentage-point headwind from currency changes. Image source: Wal-Mart. Consensus estimates call for similarly weak growth this quarter, with revenue rising 1% to $119 billion. Profits should decline to $0.96 per share from $0.99 per share a year ago as the company continues to invest in improving the shopping experience through initiatives like higher employee wages and cleaner store designs. Management will be happy to take that minor profit decline so long as it produces higher shopper satisfaction heading into the all-important holiday shopping season. Cisco's profit margin Networking giant Cisco will announce earnings numbers after the market closes on Wednesday. And, with the stock up 15% so far this year, expectations are high heading into the report. Investors have good reasons to be bullish -- especially on profits. While sales haven't budged over the last 12 months, Cisco produced 21% higher earnings over that time as cost cuts flowed directly down to the bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. The company's diverse portfolio also showed its strength recently, as declines in the service provider video and NGN routing areas were completely offset by gains in other places like switching and collaboration. CEO Chuck Robbins and his team forecast that sales will tick up by 1% this quarter as non-GAAP gross margin weighs in at about 64%, or just ahead of last quarter's 63% mark. Investors can expect management to highlight the fastest-growing areas of its networking business on Wednesday in addition to its hefty cash generation. Cisco delivered nearly $9 billion to shareholders in the last fiscal year, mostly through dividends, and that figure should rise by a healthy margin in fiscal 2017 -- assuming Cisco can navigate its biggest growth challenges. Smucker's pet food sales J.M. Smucker, the company behind consumer food brands such as Jif peanut butter and Crisco vegetable oil, hopes to get back to its winning ways with results this week. The stock has pulled far back from the record high it reached just before its late-August earnings report revealed worrying growth trends. Smucker's big push into the pet food market has been a challenge so far, for example, as the segment suffered lower volume. Its coffee business also slowed down from its awesome growth pace thanks to falling costs that track the declines in coffee bean prices. As a result of those and other challenges, executives lowered their full-year sales growth target and now see revenue declining slightly for the 2017 fiscal year rather than holding steady. Investors will likely get an update on that projection this week. They'll also find out whether Smucker's still believes it will produce $1 billion of free cash flow and as much as $7.75 per share of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2017.

Photo Credit: Getty Images   The Black Friday sales event is aging, but it doesn't get old and it is far from dead. When the first signs of the Holiday season appear, reports appear that say that Black Friday is dead. It is an annual tradition to trash Black Friday before it is showing its face. The argument is that consumers can get deals all year round because of online shopping. This is just not true as demonstrated impressively this year by the Black Friday deals on 4K TVs. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Black Friday 2016 advertise 4K TV deals including a  $199.99 for a 49-inch 4K Smart TV, $249.99 for a 50-inch 4K Smart TV and $298 for a 55-inch 4K Smart TV. Last year the lowest priced 4K TV in Black Friday ads was a $399.99 55-inch Element 4K Smart TV. All bargain doorbuster TV deals below $300 have been on 1080p TVs. When this year was a 49-inch Toshiba 4K Ultra HD Smart TV on sale for under $200? Right. never. This Best Buy Black Friday doorbuster deal will be very hard to get, as well as the other two mentioned 4K TV doorbuster deals announced by Target and Walmart. These three standout Black Friday 2016 deals are though by far not the only Black Friday 4K TV deals. The deals are across the whole range of 4K TVs beginning with bargain 4K TVs, mid-range 4K TVs, HDR 4K TV and high-end OLED 4K TVs. Find deals in the list of 4K TVs advertised by Target, Walmart and Best Buy for Black Friday. There are already many HDR 4K TVs on sale now in early Black Friday sales. On Saturday, the Sam's Club 1-Day Black Friday sale sold out the advertised 4K TV deals before noon. The demand for 4K TVs is already high 10 days before Thanksgiving, when most Black Friday sales begin. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that consumers will buy 4.5 million 4K TVs during the Holiday season. Black Friday offers again big deals, but not all are easy to get and deal hunters need to put the work in. The Sam's Club sale yesterday was easy to shop, as long as shoppers either stayed up late or got up early in the morning. On Thanksgiving Day, sleeping in is not an option to score the best Black Friday deals that will be on sale online. To get the in-store only Black Friday 2016 doorbuster, deal hunters need to invest hours lining up at stores before the doors open for the Black Friday sale. Ideally they are organized in family and friends teams to be able to score all the deals they want. Deal hunting on Black Friday was never easy, but it pays off.  In past years, Walmart made it easy to purchase select doorbuster deals with the 1-Hour Guarantee promotion. This year Walmart is not offering this short cut to doorbuster deals. Walmart shoppers need to line-up early enough to score a wristband for the doorbuster deal of their choice. Best Buy has the same wristband system for its doorbuster deals including the $199.99 4K TV doorbuster. The best chance to score doorbuster deals online that are advertised as in-store only is on Amazon. The giant online retailer has in the past matched the most popular doorbuster deals of Best Buy, Target and Walmart with similar online deals.

Tucked in the back of the store, the desk was often hidden by a huge line of shoppers with carts full of stuff – especially around the holidays. For a long time, layaway was seen as a smart way to save up the money for Christmas gifts. If you didn’t have the cash to shop early, layaway let you select items when you were ready then pay for your gifts over several weeks or months. Most stores asked you to put a deposit down equivalent to a certain percentage of your basket, say 10%. That way, you had some “skin in the game” and were less likely to leave your layaway to rot. Once your layaway was stashed away in the back of the store, you would stop in to make monthly payments whenever you could. Eventually, you would pay down your bill and take your items home. And boy, those were the days. Of course, layaway still exists; it’s just a lot less prevalent and not always offered year-round. At Walmart, for example, layaway season starts in September and ends in mid-December. Other stores like Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, Toys ‘R Us, and Kmart still offer some type of layaway plan for customers at least part of the year. Why We Choose Credit Card Debt Over Layaway Still, it’s not nearly as common to hear of a family member or friend who uses layaway in 2016. Nope, today’s shoppers are more likely to charge their purchases to a credit card and worry about how they’ll pay later. Why the seismic shift in how we shop? In my opinion, it’s all about instant gratification. Where layaway forced you to save up for what you wanted and make payments all along, credit cards allow the opposite. With a credit card, you can have what you want now, and then worry about how you’ll pay. You don’t have to wait, nor do you have to save up a dime. You just walk in the store and take what you want, then pass the buck to the “future you.” Unfortunately, the “buy now, pay later” mentality has become the American way. A recent analysis from Value Penguin shows average credit card debt for households who carry a balance rang in at $16,048 while average consumer debt across all households was $5,700. Meanwhile, households with the lowest net worth (zero or negative) reported an average of $10,308 in credit card debt. These huge debts we carry aren’t the exception; they have become the norm. In 2016, it’s perfectly normal to
