Libert is the CEO of OpenMatters, a firm specializing in business model science, and Beck is the chief insights officer. Wind is a Wharton marketing professor and director of Wharton’s SEI Center for Advanced Studies in Management. They also wrote a book called The Network Imperative: How to Survive and Grow in the Age of Digital Business Models. The authors would like to thank LiquidHub for sponsoring the research that informs this series. In a February 2016 letter to shareholders, Sears Chairman Edward Lampert reflected on a sea change in the competitive environment for retailers: “2015 has proven to be the year where the impact of [digital] changes … has spread more broadly to retailers that had previously proven to be relatively immune to such shifts,” wrote the head of Sears and Kmart. “Walmart, Nordstrom, Macy’s, Staples, Whole Foods and many others have felt the impact of disruptive changes from online competition and new business models.” For the retail industry, store location has always been key. But in a mobile-first world where transactions are borderless, location can become a liability. These digital tectonic shifts affect every industry, but arguably none feel their impact more than retail. Digital natives such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba are all impacting the wellbeing of every part of the retail supply chain. The result: No company will be left unscathed — including the once indomitable Wal-Mart. So far, responses to these digital competitors has been varied. According to Lampert, they included the following: Mergers (Office Depot/Office Max/Staples, Walgreens/Rite Aid), joint ventures (CVS/Target Pharmacy), market exits (Target Canada, Tesco’s Fresh and Easy), company divestitures (Safeway, Saks), bankruptcies (RadioShack, Wet Seal, American Apparel, Sports Authority), unique leasing arrangements (Finish Line/Macy’s, Best Buy/Macy’s, Sephora/J.C. Penney) and asset spinoffs (Sears stores). Each of these strategies is an attempt to mitigate the impact of this tidal wave of digital platforms and virtual networks. However, it is increasingly clear that the digital tsunami will not be overcome with ‘physical only’ tactics. Moreover, physical and financial strategies only highlight how ‘sticking to the knitting’ is a sure road to the bottom as evidenced by continued lackluster traditional (non-e commerce) retail sales growth. According to a February 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal, comparable store sales — a key metric in retail — for the holiday quarter fell by 7% each at Sears and Gap, and dipped 4.3% at Macy’s. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores only saw a 0.6% bump and Kohl’s went up by 0.4%. As the year went on, sales continued to stagnate. In July, the seasonally adjusted U.S. retail sales came in flat from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department. Autos and e-commerce were the main bright spots, up 1.1% and 1.3% respectively. Others were up at most 0.3% or in the negative. “It is increasingly clear that the digital tsunami will not be overcome with ‘physical only’ tactics.” In his letter, Lampert described the difficulty of competing with digital disruptors. “Companies are creating new business models or adapting old ones to adjust to fundamental shifts in technology, competitive landscapes, government policies and regulations, or macro trends to serve their customers in new ways. While few people may have heard of Uber five years ago, now it’s become almost a household name. It has reportedly raised over $10 billion in capital since it commenced operations at progressively higher valuations, in some cases exceeding $50 billion in value. … In an environment where new companies like Uber can raise almost unlimited capital, what are the implications for older companies that are held to a very different standard when it comes to profitability and regulation?” It is clear from our research, as profiled in this monthly column, that capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value. In the case of Sears, focusing its capital on physical stores, which by its own admission is a losing proposition, strains resources and hampers the hiring of the best teams with the digital skills it needs. In contrast, Amazon and its web peers are growing faster, with far less physical assets (as a percentage of the total asset base), as customers shop from websites, smartphones and tablets. Sponsored Content: The result? Traditional retailers are shrinking their physical footprints. Even Wal-Mart, the largest and one of the most successful retail chains, is shuttering stores all over the world as the retailer rebalances its investments towards digital. In fact, the company’s recent purchase of Jet.com for more than $3 billion is further proof of its desire to rebalance the spending to insure their long-term success. By all measures, this large scale purchase is a clear sign that Wal-Mart now acknowledges the need for more outside help to guarantee its business model pivot, setting the stage for others to do the same. And the numbers tell all — last year, only 3% of Wal-Mart’s sales come from e-commerce ($14 billion out of $482 billion). Retailers Must Be Digital-first Technology, online shopping and cybersecurity are clearly becoming top of mind for CEOs of major retailers. “We have to embrace digital,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell at the Boston College’s Chief Executives Club luncheon. “No matter what industry we’re in, or what point of disruption we’re facing. We have to all be thinking about digital first. It’s really the innovation that’s going to drive the future.” “Capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value.” Still, Cornell said it’s important to remember that consumers are still embracing Target’s bricks-and-mortar stores. “Our guests still love the ease and convenience that comes in the digital channel but they also love to touch and feel and interact with product,” he said. “They love that sense of discovery that comes with shopping.” However, given that Amazon is gaining ground by capturing nearly 40% of online retail sales during the holiday season, according to a December 2015 story in Bloomberg News, it is not clear there are enough ‘touch and feel’ customers to keep Target healthy. To be sure, Wal-Mart Stores has long set the standard when it comes to traditional, store-centric retailing — leveraging technology to help the company squeeze every cent out of its costs in order to offer customers low every day pricing. But while the formidable capabilities of this asset-centric giant used to dominate the bricks-and-mortar world, it is clear that having all these stores may be more of a liability than an asset. Amazon, once a small player in the retail industry, found its start in 1994, and is now outpacing all retailers leaving only Wal-Mart to battle it. To avoid the fate that so many failed retailers have experienced, Wal-Mart has poured billions of dollars into a digital transformation initiative that is the largest by size and scope in the retail industry — 15 acquisitions and 3,600 new hires – according to a November 2015 story in the Journal. Then came the purchase of Jet.com, a fast-growing shopping site co-founded by one of the entrepreneurs behind Diapers.com. The newspaper said Wal-Mart is also in the process of making its new Silicon Valley development center the foundation upon which to upend the company’s historic business model. At the crux of Walmart’s digital transformation is an ambitious program to overhaul its business – Pangaea — led by Jeremy King, its CTO of Global eCommerce. The Journal said his charge was to reinvent the retailer: “Mr. King’s team has remade everything from how Wal-Mart’s website works and looks to underlying transaction software, databases and servers, and the backend data center tools to manage it all. Wal-Mart built new cloud infrastructure and data centers and wrote its own search engine in its all-out effort to develop the technological wherewithal to compete with Amazon.” King told the paper that “Pangaea replaces everything” that has been traditionally done at Wal-Mart. “My peers, they think I’m out of my mind. Most people don’t replace entire systems in one shot, especially with from-scratch development. But given how rapidly this place is changing, we didn’t have time to screw around.” “To become a successful retailer today, it starts with having the right mindset: … embrace of new business models and development of network orchestration including the digital platforms and customer co-creators who come with it.” We think he is right. The retail sector doesn’t have time to waste. Sticking to the tired, old retail bricks-and-mortar business model only hurts retailers. The opportunity before the industry is to have a hyper-focus on the customer by leveraging an unprecedented amount of data now available, build a virtual network around them, encourage them to co-create the future — in terms of data, products and services — and use that network to catch up to their now increasingly entrenched and growing digital rivals. But none of it is possible without a digital platform, which is as essential as roads and bridges were to the industrial world. It All Starts with Mental Models To become a successful retailer today, it starts with having the right mindset from which flows the following: an embrace of new business models and development of network orchestration, including the digital platforms and customer co-creators who come with it. Then comes the process of continually re-examining one’s core beliefs about retail with an eye towards adapting them to the current digital landscape. But changing mental models can be difficult especially with entrenched legacy thinking and systems. We recommend five steps to change one’s mental models in any industry: Identify some of your common habits and perspectives about how the retail sector should function, including guiding principles, time and capital allocation patterns, primary skills and capabilities, and the key metrics and outcomes that you track. Uncover the core beliefs about retailing that motivate your behaviors, and are the priorities of your firm and board. This step usually takes some ongoing reflection and added perspective from your peers. Industry best practices likely influence your thinking greatly. Invert your core beliefs about retailing and consider the implications for your firm and board. There are many possible inversions in each instance. For example, all retailers should ask themselves, ‘Is digital our first priority? How about our customer network — do we put them in front of merchandise and do we have an entire department dedicated to mobilizing them?’ Extrapolate what implications these new core beliefs, and the various ripple effects, would have for your organization and board. Observe what is happening in your industry and, more broadly, how different core beliefs might help you get ahead of digital disruption by companies like Amazon. Act on your new retail core beliefs (preferably with digital as the center) by sharing them broadly with your customers, employees, suppliers and investors. Purposely changing your business actions, particularly when it comes to time and capital allocation, is an important part of the process and helps reinforce the changes in mental models you are trying to achieve. Surviving and growing in the age of digital networks and technology platforms require new ways of thinking and acting. To prosper as a 21st century retail executive in a fast-changing world, you need to reimagine retailing completely. The first step, however, is to ask yourself if your way of thinking, your core beliefs about retailing, are still working in the networked world of platform companies. If not, invert your core beliefs, test them on your peers, and develop more modern retail beliefs that will create differentiated success today. Indeed, Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com to take on Amazon clearly showed that it didn’t have the required people, board and processes to prevail in a digital-centric world. What’s next?  Reports of lackluster retail sales do not signal doom and gloom for the future of the sector because there is good news on the digital side of the chasm. And a unifying theme binds companies in retail and other industries: digital platforms and virtual network business models are a prerequisite to success. Although that might not seem like good news to bricks-and-mortar retailers, it is actually an opportunity for executives and boards willing to change. But they need to acknowledge reality and shift gears — now. After all, they have the intangible assets to succeed in the digital era: brand awareness, customer following, experienced workforce, and deep industry knowledge. All they need are new mental and business models to ensure a bright future.

The customer always had choice. We should have always worked on improving that choice directly or in cooperation with our competition. The future of business in digital networked ecosystems is exchange models. Period. Not all the other stuff that perpetuates the silos as you are suggesting here. Leading companies in every sector should be looking internally and externally and saying where is there “informational value” and how can that information be traded with our competitors so that we all win. It can be done. It takes a 90 degree mind shift. That’s digital. Joe Willis I’m not sure online will fully replace local. I certainly cannot imagine buying a suit (or even a tie) from a web page. While I do buy hard to find stuff on Amazon, probably the only thing I buy exclusively there is music. There is something about walking out of a store with product in hand. A shopping trip to Walmart usually involves bringing home a goodly supply of groceries and other items, in the long run probably more convenient than dealing with a host of vendors and shipping costs. When I need lumber or hardware for a home project, or components for an auto service project it makes a lot more sense to hit local Home Depot or Autozone than to put the project aside until the products arrive. Claudio Pestana I think to create a new model, to face the new era of customers, it should be done for a new way of thinking, and this is not really possible with the old experienced people. Jacqueline Sosa Buying online is the last thing that appeals to me after working in front of my laptop all day. Very rarely do I buy anything online unless forced to by the very retail stores I visit because inventory in the brick & mortar has dramatically decreased. For example, buying Bose earplugs at Best Buy and they only have two colors in-stock which resulted in me buying a pair but not the feminine color that interested me. After going to the store spending my precious time, gas, and putting mileage on my car, left with the product but not the exact color that attracted me. Didn’t have the heart to leave without buying after the kind people working there spent their time helping me. See, I want people in my hometown to have JOBS. Helping the kid in town by buying at the store so that he/she has a job…a purpose in life. It doesn’t matter which store, it seems nowadays, that inventory is low. Here is what happens when they don’t carry my size, which is 0 in shorts & 5 1/2 in shoes, I leave with $1,000 in my pocket very unhappy and frustrated. Oh, and my guests that visited the stores with me eager to also drop a ton of money, left feeling the same way. If you think I am going to go home and sit in front of that freaking laptop, which I hid under the bed after my week of work was finished, you are fooling yourselves. And here is the other thing people in the retail world need to WAKE-UP to which is foreigners come to the U.S. from as far away as Argentina to SHOP!!!! They come with a ton of money and set aside weeks (not days) but weeks to SHOP because inflation is so high and the quality of products are so poor in their part of the world. Cater to the foreigners because they want to spend their money here! Europeans fly in for weekends and go straight to Bloomingdales in Manhattan to buy Joe (brand name) Jeans. Not kidding. So, you think the option of buying online is going to increase the bottom line when it’s the very thing that can hurt the bottom line because people like to shop in brick & mortar. Discount stores will always get my business if they keep good inventory because I never pay full price for anything. So happy to see this article because the brick & mortar is the way it should be and always be as shopping is like walking into a candy shop after working all day. Jeff Garner A few thoughts… “But in a mobile-first world where transactions are borderless, location can become a liability.” I believe, as Amazon is dipping it’s toes into various forms of a physical presence, the 4000+ Walmart Stores are an incredible asset. One that not only can serve those who want to or need to shop, but more importantly can provide Walmart a competitive advantage over Amazon satisfying web and mobile orders within minutes. An example there is the not so secret Project X’ a drive-up asset grocery store in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood where Amazon is looking to compete with Walmart’s Grocery Pick-up. For Amazon to provide a similar level of service, in as many areas, as Walmart could cover overnight will take Amazon years and hundreds of millions of dollars. They’re also opening 4 more book stores in cities like Portland and Chicago though there too competition is keen but it seems Amazon sees brand awareness, through a physical store, as a benefit not a liability. “It is clear from our research, as profiled in this monthly column, that capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value. In the case of Sears, focusing its capital on physical stores” Here I’m surprised your research took you there as Sears, other than some too little too late store within a store initiative, has done anything BUT invest in its stores while being led by a non-retail minded CEO. They are, in my opinion, an unfortunate outlier in retail with, what seems like, little or no desire run a retail business. Over the last 5 years they have closed and sold off assets to build their “Shop Your Way” program all while allowing their remaining stores to deteriorate with little if any investment. For many years a walk through Sears has been like attending a Wake for an old friend with empty shelves and damaged fixtures. This inattention, to what could have been an extension of the online experience and brand builder, instead pushed customers further away from Sears all together neutering their digital investments. “But while the formidable capabilities of this asset-centric giant used to dominate the bricks-and-mortar world, it is clear that having all these stores may be more of a liability than an asset.” Again, how so? Your central argument seems to be that because Amazon has grown bricks-and-mortar will fail. Sort of like “Post hoc ergo propter hoc” which I’m not as confident. The reality may be that there are some situations, for a segment of customers that prefer and feel comfortable, a total digital solution to their shopping needs. No doubt there! However the majority of customers, based upon the whole retail wallet still seem to still prefer going to the store…for now. “The first step, however, is to ask yourself if your way of thinking, your core beliefs about retailing, are still working in the networked world of platform companies.” Are they not working? During the last 20 years, from 1995 to 2014, Amazon has generated revenues of $409 billion where Walmart generated $486 billion in 2014 alone. During that same period Amazon has generated a combined net profit of $1.96 billion. Here Walmart generated $16.18 billion in 2014 alone. So, Walmart generated eight-times more net profit in 2014 than Amazon could during the last 20 years. While 2015 had some challenges for Walmart, 2016 is looking pretty good, so where exactly is this “liability”? In a rush to digital gold where have business fundamentals gone? Don’t misunderstand, I believe much of what you have said in your guidance is correct and I agree with, just perhaps not for the reasons you cite or in the ways you recommend them. Bricks-and-mortar stores, like Sears, that neglect their physical presence in search of digital parity, I feel, like Sears, will fail at both. What separates the winners in retail will be those that can leverage a TRULY transparent omni-channel, not cross-channel, business and customer experience. On-line is just “on-line” but the retailer that can create awesome shopping and service experiences, at a competitive price, across the board, will win. IMHO!

Suburbs Aurora Beacon-News Aurora News Wal-Mart to close West Plaza store in Aurora Wal-Mart to close West Plaza store in Aurora Steve Lord / The Beacon-News Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora this fall. Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora this fall. (Steve Lord / The Beacon-News) Steve LordAurora Beacon-News Privacy Policy Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora by the end of October. The company announced the closing publicly Tuesday, which is also when employees, the building landlord and city officials found out. Delia Garcia, Wal-Mart spokesman, said there were "many factors" involved in the decision to close the store at 2131 W. Galena Blvd., but one of the main ones was that the West Aurora store was a "discount center" instead of a Supercenter. "There are six Supercenters within 10 miles of the Galena location," she said. "This is a discount store, and there was not a line of groceries. Many Aurora customers have already started shopping at these Supercenters because of the one-stop shopping ability." Wal-Mart has Supercenters on the far East Side of Aurora, at Kirk and Butterfield roads, and in Montgomery, Oswego, Naperville, Batavia and Plainfield. The announcement said people can shop at the West Aurora store and pick up prescriptions there through Oct. 28. "Our pharmacy staff will be working with customers to transfer their prescriptions to another convenient location," the announcement said. "The decision to close a store is never easy and we will be working with our store associates to identify suitable transfer opportunities to other area Wal-Mart stores."

Refunds could be in order for several area shoppers who purchased items at the newly opened Carpentersville Wal-Mart between July 1 and 11, officials said. Located at Route 25 and Lake Marian Road, the big box store opened its doors June 22. Walmart charged the 9 percent sales tax rate applicable... (Erin Sauder) Garcia said closing a discount center also is a reaction to the growing number of customers who purchase goods from Wal-Mart online. "Our goal is to provide a seamless shopping experience," she said. "People can shop when they want, where they want, how they want." Another factor was that Wal-Mart does not own the property on West Galena, but leases it. That means the store will be empty after October, and city officials already have scheduled a meeting next week with West Plaza Shopping Center owners to discuss the situation. David Hulseberg, chief executive officer of Invest Aurora, the city's economic development not-for-profit corporation, said Mayor Tom Weisner requested he get a meeting together between the city and West Plaza property owners. The center is unusual in that is has several different property owners, including the owner of the Wal-Mart building. "We want to get a game plan that has all the various property owners working together," Hulseberg said. "How do we move this in the right direction." Wal-Mart launches scheduling system to improve predictability Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Wal-Mart has rolled out a new scheduling system that aims to give employees more control and predictability in their hours, but advocates who have been calling for such changes as a key step in the fight to improve low-wage workers' lives expressed concerns that it falls short.

(WSMV) MURFREESBORO, TN (WSMV) - Police are investigating a possible rape at a Walmart in Murfreesboro. A woman said she was raped early Sunday morning after leaving Walmart at 2900 S. Rutherford Blvd. Police are now investigating her claims. According to a police report, the alleged rape happened around 3:40 a.m. in the store’s parking lot. A woman said she was inside the store when a man approached her. She said when she walked out of the store, the man grabbed her arm, pulled her into his car and raped her. When she got out of the car, the alleged victim took a picture of the vehicle’s license plate and gave it to police. There are no security guards at this location, but shoppers said they would like to see that change. “You need to have more security, more police, whatever,” Wilma Miller said. “I live very close to here and I’ve never heard something like that before,” Bryner Enriquez said. The tag is registered to a gray, four-door Volkswagen. It was registered to a man in Shelbyville who police believe may be the suspect. Murfreesboro police would not answer Channel 4’s questions about the suspect or the alleged rape. They would only say it’s under investigation. Walmart has issued the following statement concerning the incident: Police alerted us to the report of what happened in our parking lot, and we immediately pulled the surveillance video for review. We’ll continue working with detectives until their investigation is completed. Copyright 2016 WSMV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

In-depth look: Judges throw out appeal, Walmart a go By Jill Barnes Nelson, Tehachapi News Aug 28, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendering of a proposed Tehachapi Super Walmart. The third time may be the charm. After three appeals concerning an environmental impact report, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno last week ruled the City of Tehachapi has adequately addressed environmental issues related to the proposed Walmart. The decision of the three-panel judge issued Aug. 24 was unanimous, and followed a hearing on the case held July 26. The judges made no comments at the time of their decision but did issue a written ruling. “It appears the city and Walmart have prevailed in the appeals court,” City Manager Greg Garrett said. “They still have 60 days to appeal after the decision became public, but it’s my understanding they would have to go to the California Supreme Court.” Garrett said Walmart already has contacted the city and plans to move forward on the 165,000-square-foot center at the southeast corner of Tucker Road and Tehachapi Boulevard. “Walmart is probably at least a year away from starting anything,” Garrett said. A group called Tehachapi First, which emerged after the city approved Walmart in 2011, challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco. Following the Aug. 24 appeals court decision, Tehachapi News tried to contact Wolfe, but received no response. However, Tehachapi First posted this statement on its Facebook page: “As most of you doubtlessly know, the appeals court in Stockton (sic) has ruled in favor of Walmart and the Tehachapi city government — though the ruling is no favor to the people of Tehachapi. We have lost this battle — but we do not know what the aftermath will be. We have kept Walmart out of Tehachapi for five years — and what cancer victim would not be thankful for a five-year lease on life? But as of yet, we don’t know if Walmart will actually build in Tehachapi.” It continues, “Five years may have been enough time for Walmart to change its mind about our valley — especially as it appears Walmart has entered its period of decline and needs its resources to engage in its absurd godzilla struggle with Amazon. If Walmart doesn’t build, our struggle has not been in vain. And if Walmart builds? Well, then, the result will not be what we wished, but better than if we had never taken up the fight at all. Better to have fought and lost than never to have fought at all.” The fight to stop Walmart had been brought before courts twice before by Tehachapi First. Along the way the city made additional revisions to its environmental reviews. The last time it went to court was in July 2015 after Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental concerns related to the project. Three main issues were brought up in this latest appeal by Tehachapi First. The court said in its report that the plaintiff contends the revised EIR’s treatment of cumulative noise impacts violated the California Environmental Quality Act on three separate grounds. The first had to do with a claim of error relating to the location on residential lots where measurements were taken to establish the baseline noise level. “We reject this contention because plaintiff has not shown that a general or specific rule of law dictates where such measurements should be taken. Thus, we conclude that the identification of the proper location presented a question of fact committed to the discretion of City in its role as the lead agency.” The second claim related to the revised EIR’s decision to evaluate roadway segments containing hotels by using the noise thresholds applicable to commercial property, rather than residential property. “The plaintiff has not established the foundation for its argument that the roadway segments should have been subject to the noise standards used for residential property.” The third claim of error related to the standards or thresholds used to determine whether cumulative noise impacts were significant and whether the project’s incremental contributions to significant cumulative noise impacts were “‘cumulatively considerable’” for purposes of CEQA. The court ruled this claim also failed. “We therefore affirm the order discharging the writ of mandate.” Garrett reported that Walmart has paid for all the court costs involved in the appeals and that the company could attempt to recoup its costs from Tehachapi First. Mayor Susan Wiggins also was happy the appeals process could be at an end. “I’m really happy to hear this,” Wiggins said by phone. “I listened to both sides and also from some 350 senior citizens who said they needed the Walmart. They said didn’t want to drive to Bakersfield anymore to get lower prices on the things they need. I’m glad this finally could be over.” For a full account of the court’s decision, go to appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=5&doc_id=2118001&doc_no=F072149 To join the lively discussion of this decision and what it could mean for the community, go to the Tehachapi News’ Facebook page.

 A study reveals a disturbing trend about Walmart locations across the US Kate Taylor Aug. 30, 2016, 3:48 PM 23,427 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images The worst Walmarts are located in low-income, minority communities. That's according to a study published in May by Contexts, a quarterly publication of the American Sociological Association. A Walmart store's location is closely related to how good or bad the store's customer service is, the study found. The study, which was recently highlighted by The Atlantic's CityLab, evaluated customer service by analyzing the Yelp reviews of 2,840 Walmart locations across the US. Stores in areas that have lower average incomes have significantly worse customer reviews than locations in higher-income ZIP codes. Additionally, locations in areas with higher proportions of black or Latino residents have worse reviews than those in areas with more white residents. The study's author, Adam Reich, an assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University, analyzed approximately 35,000 reviews of Walmart locations and found that there was a consistent correlation between a neighborhood's majority race and socioeconomic status, and a location's Yelp reviews. Reich blames the disparity on Walmart's decision to understaff stores in certain areas. In the early 2000s, Walmart implemented cost-cutting policies that reduced the number of necessary employees per store and resulted in a drop in stores' quality. This study provides evidence that a decrease in store quality was not consistent across the board, but instead affected some customers more than others. "Walmart is the largest retailer and largest employer in the world; moreover, it has consciously branded itself as a champion of and boon for disadvantaged communities," Reich wrote. "Its underinvestment in these communities is thus particularly notable." A Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider that the company found the analysis to be "flawed and without merit."  David McNew/Getty Images "Our customer traffic and overall customer satisfaction scores have been improving and we're focused on continuing to do better," Walmart spokesperson Lorenzo Lopez said in a statement to Business Insider. "Our associates play a critical role in the company's success and that's why we've invested $2.7 billion on associate education, training and wages. We're also proud to provide communities across the country, regardless of social or economic background, access to affordable goods and career opportunities to help them better provide for their families." The study may in fact have a few holes. The reliance on Yelp means that researchers can't examine reviewers' biases and outside influences. For example, a store's location in a lower-income or predominantly black or Latino neighborhood may affect how its quality is perceived by some reviewers, regardless of the store's customer service. However, this isn't the first time Walmart's apparent understaffing has been called into question. Reports of Walmart saving money by reducing staff members have also gotten the retailer into hot water with police. Earlier in August, Bloomberg reported that more than 200 violent crimes had been committed this year at Walmart locations across the US. Bloomberg reported that the rise in crime is a result of corporate policies. The cost-cutting policies resulted in a drop in quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," a Walmart representative said in an email to Business Insider earlier in August. While Walmart's cost-cutting policies have had negative — and, at times, dangerous — outcomes for customers, they have also driven profits: Bloomberg found that sales per employee in the US grew 23% in the last decade, to $236,804. Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images Reich writes that the retailer can turn a profit despite providing poor customer service because Walmart's super-low prices have helped put local competition out of business. As a result, Walmart becomes some customers' only option — no matter how poor the shopping experience is. However, Reich argues that the retailer may suffer in the long term if it doesn't make some major changes. A poor shopping experience could be increasingly damaging for the brand as online shopping grows and competitors increasingly invest in providing quality in-store experiences. "For Walmart and other retailers, providing a pleasant customer service experience seems likely to be increasingly important to corporate profitability," Reich wrote. "For its own sake, then, Walmart should hire more employees, particularly at stores in low-income communities of color, and give all Walmart employees more reasons to smile through better wages and working conditions."

They are excellent points to take if you choose not to shop at Walmart, but they are fallacies of distraction which pull us away from the true argument — does Walmart have a right, in capitalistic society, to open and operate a business? You see, the argument is not whether we like or dislike Walmart, but rather, whether we believe in a command market economy or a free market economy. A command market economy is a “socialist economic system in which production and distribution of goods and services are controlled by the government;” and a free market economy is “an economic system in which a country’s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.” Personally, I have moral issues with companies like McDonalds, Starbucks, and Carl’s Jr. even though I disagree with the causes these companies support. As a true capitalist, I would never deny them the right, in a so called “free-market” society, to operate and sell product wherever they choose to do so. My response, as a “patriotic American” (I use your terms), is to choose not to patronize those businesses. I find these businesses distasteful for some of the same moral issues that “Walmartophobes” find, but, in a society that fosters a free-market economy, it would be illogical for me to do anything against those companies, other than refuse to shop at them. My final thought about this whole Walmart issue is that Adam Smith (author of “The Wealth of Nations”) must be rolling in his grave!

By Laura Rice • Aug 30, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email Liquor sales are a $14 billion business annually but state policies that prevent Walmart from selling liquor date back to the end of Prohibition. The big-box giant argues those rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Bill Lile/Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) From Texas Standard: Walmart sells everything from guns to grapefruit. But right now, it can't sell liquor – at least not in Texas. The mega-retailer is going to court to change that, but liquor store owners are fighting the effort, alongside the state of Texas. Some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission's rules preventing Walmart from selling liquor date back to the end of Prohibition. But the big-box store corporation argues the rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination.   Listen Listening... / 5:30 Associated Press reporter Michael Graczyk says there's a big market for liquor in Texas. "The Comptroller's office says it's worth about $14 billion in sales," he says, "so we're talking big bucks in booze." Walmart stores, which number in the 600s including Sam's Club stores, already sell beer and wine, but Texas law restricts them from selling hard liquor. "They [sell liquor] in 31 other states," he says. "Texas is among the few they don't. And Texas is the only one where they're suing to try to get in." In Texas, publicly traded companies are not allowed to hold liquor licenses, Graczyk says – a policy that dates back to the 1930s. "Despite the bar on publicly traded companies... hotel corporations are allowed," he says. "Another issue is liquor licenses are limited to five per holder. But that rule is out the window if you have a blood relative [who has a license]." Licenses can be consolidated among close blood relatives, like parents and children or siblings. "That accounts for the growth of family-owned liquor chains in Texas," Graczyk says. Walmart, in their lawsuit, says these laws are discriminatory. "[Walmart executives] don't have any blood relatives who fit this template," he says, "so it's unfair to them, and ultimately to Texas consumers, because they're saying they can provide liquor, presumably, at a cheaper price." A statewide stores' association with about 2,500 members appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to join the lawsuit on the side of the state. Last session, bills introduced in the Legislature that would help Walmart earn the right to sell liquor died in committee. "Presumably, the lobbyists for the Texas Package Stores Association are pretty convincing," he says. "It was supposed to go to trial next month but the whole process got stopped when the Package Stores Association appealed the ruling... now it's up to the federal judge to set a new court trial date."

Jacob's three year-old sister Sophia and seven year-old brother Liam help guide him into the hospital. next play/pause pre Ottawa South News By Michelle Nash Baker Jacob Randell loves dinosaurs. Apparently he’s a big fan. So when four Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs met him in CHEO’s parking lot, the 12 year-old said he thought it was pretty cool. “I started to think something big was going to happen,” he said. Something big did happen. Jacob will be this year’s new CHEO’s Children’s Miracle Network Champion. A campaign sponsored by Walmart Canada, a champion has the unique opportunity to advocate for the hospital and encourage people to donate to the CHEO Foundation. Jacob said he intends to take the job seriously and although he finds it hard to pick one thing about the hospital he loves (he loves everything) he is quick to say they saved his life. “CHEO is my life. CHEO is one of the best hospitals ever. The doctors and nurses are amazing,” Jacob said. Jacob will also travel to Orlando, Florida, to be part of a Children’s Miracle Network Momentum conference at Disney World. There Jacob will have a chance to meet other champions from pediatric hospitals across North America. On hand to welcome Jacob as the new CHEO champion was last year’s champ, eight year-old Hodan Osman. Hodan had the pleasure of handing over the reigns – in this case Mickey Mouse ears – to Jacob. “I think Jacob is going to have an amazing time,” Hodan said. Like Hodan, Jacob will now represent CHEO throughout the coming year as the face of the 2017 Walmart campaign. According to Walmart, this campaign is one of the easiest to have nearly all of its 94,000 associates across Canada participate in.   After a seven-year battle with a rare brain cancer and Schwannoma, a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow on nerve endings, Jacob continues to inspire and amaze his mother, Liliane Randell. “He’s got this connection with everyone he meets,” she said. “He’s seen more than he should and has lived beyond his years, and just when you think he can’t do something – he goes and amazes you.” That is why she said he is the perfect choice to represent CHEO. The champions program honours children who have triumphed over various medical challenges. Children are selected as ambassadors and represent the 17 million children treated each year at Children’s Miracle Network member hospitals in Canada and the U.S.   | (0) Comment Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News News Ottawa looking to replicate banner film, TV successes of 2016 Snapshot News Crews prepare Rideau Canal for 47th season of skating Snapshot News Police to host meetings on service delivery changes Snapshot News Youth Experience Project launches to give Ottawa kids backstage pass to fun Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos National Research Council of Canada Trudeau says ISIL mission, Keystone came up in chat with Obama Photo Gallery The balance of nature never was Photo Gallery Passing the torch into 2017 The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Crews prepare Rideau Canal for 47th season of skating The ‘grocery girls’ are the meat in Dunrobin City grants Bayview buyer extension to finalize sale ‘They are not alone at all’ Ottawa looking to replicate banner film, TV successes of 2016 In Your Neighbourhood Today Party Planning 101: Informing neighbours in a rental building You may love to celebrate with your close friends and family during the holiday season, but that...

"We're not going to run out of these items," said Aaron Klein, store manager for Walmart's Secaucus location. In the holiday designated section of the store - which in about two weeks will be abundantly supplied with Halloween items - the shelves are stocked with back-to-school products like notebooks, crayons, themed backpacks, pens, pencils and just about any other school item you could think of.  "This coming week is our peak," Klein added. "We have to restock every day at all hours of the day." And just in case parents are running short on time, Walmart also offers in-store pickup. Customers can order items they need online at Walmart.com and depending on if the item is in stock, it will be ready for pickup within 24 hours. "We want to make the shopping experience seamless," Klein said. Customers say Walmart provides a certain convenience for their back-to-school shopping. Elizabeth, a resident of Secaucus whose children go to the Clarendon Elementary school, says she goes to Walmart for the prices. "Everything's always here. It's local, convenient and close to home." "If I can't find it here I go somewhere else," said Danielle Martinez, a resident of Secaucus shopping for her children's school supplies. "But I usually find it here."

 CommerceHub extends Walmart partnership to third-party marketplace BI Intelligence Aug. 30, 2016, 12:30 AM 1,271 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Here's why omnichannel consumers are more valuable Fabletics expands its brick-and-mortar operations Walmart acquires ShoeBuy for $70M This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. E-commerce integration and fulfillment provider CommerceHub has expanded its partnership with Walmart beyond managing its drop-ship fulfillment, reports Chain Store Age. The new agreement allows CommerceHub retail clients to seamlessly integrate with Walmart to sell goods on its third-party e-commerce site, Walmart Marketplace. CommerceHub boasts over 9,000 retail clients, including major players like Sears, Costco, and Best Buy. This partnership makes it easy for retailers like these to sell via Walmart and leverage its expansive online platform.  Walmart's e-commerce business is growing and adding new third-party retailers will likely boost it further. During Q2 2016, global online sales on Walmart's e-commerce sites grew nearly 12% YoY. CEO Doug McMillan pointed out the growth of Walmart Marketplace on the earnings call, noting that since the start of the year, it has added nearly 7 million new items available for purchase. This was likely partially driven by a partnership with marketing firm ChannelAdvisor in April to easily onboard merchants to Walmart Marketplace. Adding CommerceHub retailers will only lend more strength to Walmart Marketplace, which currently counts about 550 total merchants. However, Walmart still has a long way to go before it can catch up to other third-party sites. Most notably, Amazon has nearly 2 million third-party merchants, which offer close to 365 million products online, greatly outnumbering those on Walmart Marketplace. There is also a longer vetting process for Walmart merchants than for those on other platforms. On average, it takes six weeks for Walmart to accept a third-party vendor, compared to only one day for competitors Amazon and eBay. Should Walmart fail to keep up with competitors in the third-party marketplace arena, we expect that the company's focus would shift instead to growing sales on Jet.com, which the company acquired earlier this month for $3 billion.   To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the E-Commerce Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images As a freshman senator with his eye on the presidency, Barack Obama said he’d never shop at a Wal-Mart and held the company up as an emblem of corporate greed. Today, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is one of Obama’s most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner that’s backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly Obamacare and climate change. The pairing benefits both. Obama can point to Wal-Mart’s support to beat back Republican charges that he’s hostile to business. Wal-Mart can point to the president’s embrace to lure squeamish shoppers who, like Obama of old, have stayed away out of a belief the company hurts workers and undercuts competition. This is a key part of the company’s effort to spur continued growth. “It only makes sense for the president to be willing to strike a partnership with the nation’s largest retailer,” said Dwight Hill, a Plano, Texas-based partner with retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. “And Wal-Mart has made more strides of late to try to be more transparent about worker pay and benefits. They have certainly seen the light.” The president completed the turn from Wal-Mart antagonist to fan when he visited one of the retailer’s stores in Mountain View, California, in 2014 to praise its use of renewable energy. Obama’s visit represented a “major milestone” for the company and its public image, said Jib Ellison, whose consulting firm worked on Wal-Mart’s sustainability program. “When he got elected, his rhetoric was very anti-Wal-Mart,” said Ellison, who continues to advise Wal-Mart on environmental policies. “So it’s reaffirming." Health Care The partnership between the president and the retailer is especially strong in two areas: health care and climate change. Obama’s view of Wal-Mart shifted early in his presidency when he realized he needed business support to advance his health-care overhaul, which Republicans claimed would kill jobs and drive companies out of business. Wal-Mart was one of the first major employers to sign on to the plan. In June 2009, as debate raged in Congress, Wal-Mart publicly released a letter to Obama saying it supported requiring employers to offer health insurance to their workers, a keystone of the law. For Wal-Mart, the Affordable Care Act resolved a major gripe about the company: that it provided weak health benefits for its more than 1 million workers in the U.S. Obamacare created a system of subsidized insurance for middle-income Americans and expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to cover people earning poverty-level wages. Pressure subsided on Wal-Mart to provide coverage. When government-run insurance exchanges opened in 2014, Wal-Mart stopped offering health insurance to 30,000 part-time workers. “Obamacare is great for Wal-Mart workers; it was a huge transfer of wealth,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote a book on Wal-Mart. “The pressure is off Wal-Mart to provide better health insurance to its own employees. If you’re a single mom and work at Wal-Mart you now qualify for Medicaid.” Toluse Olorunnipa and Alex Wayne Wal-Mart and the White House have cooperated on Obama’s climate agenda, which current and former company executives described as a natural gelling of interests rather than a political calculation. Wal-Mart began pushing to cut its carbon footprint in 2005 as a way to not only help the environment, but also improve its public image, and is now the largest corporate user of solar energy. Last year, the company endorsed the global accord Obama negotiated in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. Leslie Dach, who ran Wal-Mart’s government relations and corporate affairs department from 2006 until 2013 before joining the Obama administration, published a piece in the Huffington Post shortly before leaving the company titled: “Wal-Mart Agrees With the President: The Time for Renewables Has Come.” The retailer seized upon an offhand comment by the president during a speech that week at Georgetown University, in which he said “Wal-Mart deserves a cheer” for reducing carbon pollution. Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the White House has found in Wal-Mart a willing partner as its reached out to various businesses to embrace administration’s initiatives. “We recognize that the private sector is the economic engine of our country,” Jarrett said in an interview. “It’s not enough just to have these policies on the books.” Working with the administration helps the retailer address the social and environmental issues that the company’s customers care about, said Kathleen McLaughlin, Wal-Mart’s chief sustainability officer and CEO of the Wal-Mart Foundation. “It’s so essential that we have these collaborations,” she said. Dialing McMillon When Wal-Mart announced it would raise its minimum wage for employees in early 2015, after some encouragement from the administration, Obama called Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon from Air Force One to congratulate him and told a crowd in North Carolina that “once Wal-Mart is paying people more, then you know that something is happening, right?”   The pair have also worked on veteran employment, financial security, workforce training, gun control, criminal justice issues and First Lady Michelle Obama’s healthy lifestyle campaign. As Obama was urging Congress to pass tougher restrictions on guns, Wal-Mart removed military-style rifles from its stores in August 2015, citing declining demand. For Wal-Mart, all of this is aimed at bolstering its standing with a key demographic of shoppers it must reach for continued growth -- upper-income families in traditionally liberal areas like Chicago, Los Angeles and the East Coast. “Given the fact the company isn’t growing that much, they really need to expand, in these coastal cities,” Lichtenstein said. “There has been a certain percentage of Americans that just won’t shop there for political reasons.” Key Demographic The company’s warm ties with Obama don’t seem to bother its base of customers in redder parts of the country. In Elizabeth, Colorado, a fast-growing area about 46 miles (74 kilometers) southeast of downtown Denver where just 13 percent of voters identify themselves as Democrats, some shoppers recoiled at a reporter’s mention of Obama’s name. Others said they didn’t care. Betty Erickson, 82, a retired cashier, said she cares more about whether Wal-Mart’s shelves are fully stocked and their prices stable than the company’s decision to discontinue selling rifles or other politically controversial products. “But I am glad that they are paying their workers more,” she said. Money has followed Wal-Mart’s embrace of Obama. The company increased its political spending during his presidency, with donations to Democrats no longer trailing Republicans by huge margins. Political Giving Wal-Mart’s political action committee gave $1.2 million to federal candidates during the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign spending. Democrats claimed about half that money, up from 21 percent in 2004 and only 14 percent in 2000. So far this cycle, Democrats have received about 41 percent of Wal-Mart’s $1.1 million in contributions, with Republicans getting the rest. Alice Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, gave $353,000 to Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee. The détente, however, does not include some Democrats who continue to criticize Wal-Mart -- as Obama once did -- for its labor practices and relatively low wages. The retailer is still a favorite target for attacks by party activists. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders continues to hold the company up as the epitome of inequality and has said it should “get off of welfare, pay your workers a living wage.” ‘Viciously Anti-Union’ Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, said he was upset that Obama had visited the “viciously anti-union” retailer’s Mountain View store. But he said he understood the rationale for working with the company. “It is the largest employer in America and I think it’s understandable that a president would want to work with them and coax them along,” Reich, now a public policy professor at University of California, Berkeley, said in a telephone interview.

The president in 2014 partnered with companies on initiatives including finding jobs for the long-term unemployed, improving worker training and fighting climate change. Wal-Mart was often part of those projects. Wal-Mart still has work to do before coastal liberals brave its Supercenters, said Allen Adamson, founder of BrandSimple Consulting, and it will likely have to continue to cozy up with Democrats to sway opinions. “They are starting to make some progress, but it is very hard if you are very big to change people’s perceptions,” Adamson said. “Once consumers categorize you as big, but not necessarily good, it is hard to change that perception.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Police said the gun was used in a crime spree Sunday. But, the trio of suspects didn't get away with it. The crime spree started at Home Depot on Stage Road, where three people are accused of lifting two nail guns worth $800. Then, it was off just after 6 p.m. to Walmart on Germantown Parkway.  It was there that police said Randy Johnson and Nadle Burrow were seen loading a shopping cart with more than $1,200 worth of baby clothes. Johnson tried to walk out of Walmart with the clothes, but security saw him. Police said Johnson, with Walmart staff on his trail, left the baby clothes in the shopping cart and ran across Germantown Parkway. Investigators said he jumped into an older model Maroon Lincoln with 22-inch rims. Burrows was driving the car.  Their next stop was Kroger, just down the road, where they were seen stealing more than $500 worth of meat and groceries. They put it in the trunk of the Lincoln, according to police. Police said Tony Fason was the getaway driver for that theft. Shopper Stephanie Camacho said she's angry that people would steal items that she works hard to purchase. "Very angry. We work hard, you know, and everybody should have to pay for what they need," Camacho said. When officers caught up with the trio, they found Johnson had nine warrants. Those warrants included aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking.  Police discovered a bag of crack in Fason's pocket and officers found a silver handgun under the gas cap flap in the Lincoln when they processed it. The trio faces several charges, including felony shoplifting and unlawful possession of a weapon. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

City Council President Kenny Thompson says it has come up four or five times in the last fifteen years, and that the vote continues to get closer. But now, talk around town is that not selling alcohol could make them lose one of their biggest retailers: Walmart. "We have not heard that from Walmart," said Thompson. "But we have heard that rumor. I heard that three times just yesterday. I don't think they would do that, I would hope they wouldn't do that. If they did, we couldn't operate. Almost half our revenue comes from Walmart. If they did close, we'd be in serious trouble." Thompson says the store supports the town going wet. Calls to Walmart leaders went unanswered. Meanwhile, a group, Hartselle Citizens for Economic Development, is working to get a petition to the council to get a possible wet vote on the ballot. That petition would have to be signed by 30% of the population, that's 812 registered voters. If done in time, it could put it on the ballot during a very important election. "In November, during the presidential election, which would be a great turnout, you'd get a lot better sampling of the voters," said Thompson. And once again, the longtime issue would once again be decided in voting booths. Thompson explains the council would have the complete ordinance dictating the limitations of liquor sales in place before the election.

Several others were phoned in to stores in the Anchorage area. By ELIZABETH EARL Peninsula Clarion Police in Kenai responded to a bomb threat at the Kenai Walmart on Monday morning. Employees and customers chatted and enjoyed the 75-degree, sunny weather as the Kenai Police Department swept the building after a bomb threat was phoned in. Walmart employees called the threat in to the Kenai Police Department at 10:09 a.m. as the managers were in the process of evacuating the store, said Kenai Police Chief Dave Ross. “We had officers search the building and nothing was found,” Ross said. “We’re still investigating.” Employees and customers returned to the store around 11:15 a.m. For any future leads, the Kenai Police Department will coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Anchorage, which handles bomb threats because they are federal felony offenses. Several bomb threats were also phoned in to Anchorage-area stores around the same time. Staci Feger-Pellessier, a spokesperson for the FBI in Anchorage, said there was no additional information available Monday about the threats in Anchorage. Ross said it wasn’t clear whether the calls in Anchorage and the call in Kenai were connected, though they occurred around the same time. Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson said in an email that the company would continue to work with law enforcement agencies to find those responsible. “What happened (Monday) is frustrating, and we recognize the seriousness of someone making any threat against our stores,” he said. “Our customers and associates deserve to shop and work without worrying about their safety being threatened, even when that threat turns out to be a hoax. We’re grateful local law enforcement has been responsive to these calls and has ensured the safety of everyone at our stores until the matters have been resolved.”   Reach Elizabeth Earl at elizabeth.earl@peninsulaclarion.com.

(AP) — A Wal-Mart spokeswoman says a can of pepper spray is the suspected culprit for the evacuation of an Alabama store. The store was evacuated Sunday in Millbrook, 10 miles north of Montgomery, after customers complained of irritated eyes and breathing problems. WSFA-TV reported (http://bit.ly/2bRuFw3) that authorities initially blamed a piece of rotting produce for the problems. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Leslee Wright said Monday that employees later found an empty can of pepper spray under a merchandise display and suspect that caused customers' reactions.

Singer Patti LaBelle, who last year created a nationwide sugar rush when her Sweet Potato Pie hit Walmart stores, is back again baking up retail. Walmart announced today it is releasing more desserts under the LaBelle label, including three cobblers (peach, apple and mixed berry) and an apple pecan cake. The desserts will begin arrive in Walmart stores today; all stores should be stocked by Sept. 2. In addition, there's a limited-edition sweet potato pound cake loaf that will be available in select Walmart stores in the Northeast. The cobblers have a Houston connection: they are being produced by Twin Star Bakery in Missouri City which also bakes a variety of dessert items for Walmart including oversize sandwich cookies and specialty dessert cakes. The new LaBelle items brings to eight the number of desserts from the Grammy Award-winning singer who also has scored with television food show viewers with programming on Food Network and Cooking Channel. Last fall LaBelle's sweet potato pie created a sensation at Walmart stores when they were introduced in September.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Jeremy Bowman Aug 29th 2016 2:10PM There's a retail business with 700 stores nationwide that has 22 straight quarters of positive comparable sales growth and 11 straight quarters with comps up 5% or more. It's not Kroger or Costco, but a division of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) that has been quietly crushing the competition -- the Neighborhood Market. Wal-Mart launched its first Neighborhood Market in 1998, but it began aggressively expanding the concept a few years ago, more than doubling the number of stores between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015. The pace of expansion peaked in fiscal 2015 with 235 Neighborhood Markets opened, but the company plans to open about 90 stores this year, bringing the total to around 750 stores, about as many as Costco. At an average of 42,000 square feet, Neighborhood Markets are about the size of a typical Whole Foods, and are dedicated grocery stores, unlike Wal-Mart's Supercenters, which carry a wide variety of general merchandise in addition to a full line of groceries. Wal-Mart does not break out results from its Neighborhood Market chain, but the quick accleration in expanding the format and its same-store sales growth show how promising the concept has been. For the last five years, including this one, the chain has made up a majority of the company's U.S. store openings. The chart below shows how the Neighborhood Market's comparable sales growth has outpaced Wal-Mart's overall growth. There are a number of reasons why Neighborhood Market has found success. 1. Grocery is hard to disrupt Grocery now makes up the majority of Wal-Mart's U.S. segment, and it's been its best performing one in recent years. The company has doubled down on the segment with the rapid expansion of Neighborhood Markets and by bringing its grocery pick-up service to 400 store in 60 markets, which allows customers to order online and then pick-up groceries from a kiosk in the parking lot. On the most recent earnings call, management noted the impact the pick-up service was having on overall e-commerce growth as last quarter was the first time in more than two years that e-commerce growth accelerated. Grocery is also one of the few retail categories that rivals like Amazon.com have struggled to penetrate. As department stores and other traditional retailers have fallen under pressure from the e-commerce giant's low prices and convenient service, delivering perishables to your doorstep remains difficult and expensive. Sales per square foot at Walmart U.S. averaged $435 last year, but they appear to have been higher in Wal-Mart's grocery segment than the rest of the store. Using the $435 figure would mean Wal-Mart's Neighborhod Markets generated about $11 billion in revenue last year, though the actual number is probably higher.

Urban penetration Wal-Mart began its life catering to rural customers and has long struggled to penetrate markets. The company is still without a store in New York and only recently opened its first in Washington, DC. The Neighborhood Market concept, however, has given it the ability to open up in dense cities where real estate may not be suitable for a Supercenter. Wal-Mart opened its first Neighborhood Market in Chicago in 2011, and now has five of them in that city. In Atlanta and the surrounding area, it now has 12 such stores. Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Markets can also take advantage of food deserts in such environments, neighborhoods where residents have little access to fresh food. With its economies of scale and price advantage, Wal-Mart has the ability to create a low-priced supermarket chain that is hard for competitors to match. While the pace of Neighborhood Market openings has slowed down over the last two years, I'd expect the concept to be a continuing source of growth for the retailer, especially as management has signaled a desire to expand in groceries. With comparable sales consistently in the mid-to-high single digits, that should be one reason for investors to believe in the company's future.

John Matarese 10:07 AM, Aug 29, 2016 1:54 PM, Oct 3, 2016 Share Article Previous Next $39 Yeti tumbler vs $9 Walmart version WCPO Yeti tumbler Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next The Yeti Rambler tumbler is the hottest, or should we say the coldest, thing in camping equipment these days. Walk into any Dick's Sporting Goods, Cabela's, or other camping store, and you can't miss the displays of Yeti tumblers, the hottest selling cold drink cup in history. Concrete contractor Chris Allender would love one for his job. "If it really works, it would be great," Allender said. But many folks can't fathom the price: $39, essentially 40 bucks for a 30 ounce stainless steel tumbler. "No way," one woman told us outside Dick's. "I wouldn't pay that for something, I don't care if it keeps your drink cold for a week!" Retailers Roll Out Knockoffs Retailers know the price is high for many family budgets. So they are rolling out inexpensive competitors, such as Walmart's look alike Ozark Trail tumbler, for just $9.75.   We decided to compare them. I bought 3 stainless steel tumblers: The $39 dollar Yeti, which holds  30 ounces. Walmart's $9.75 Ozark Trail look alike. also 30 ounces. A $9 SubZero, sold at Kmart, Walmart, and Amazon, but only sold in a 20 ounce size. We Test Them Out I packed each one with crushed ice, attempting to use the exact same amount of ice in each, and sealed them tight. Then, after waiting 12 hours with the cups untouched on a kitchen counter, I measured how much ice had melted. The Yeti and Ozark lost exactly the same amount of ice into water: 2 ounces. The SubZero lost one and half ounces, but since the SubZero was 30% smaller than the other two, it actually had more ice melt. So at this point, the Yeti and Ozark were tied, with SubZero slightly behind.      At 24 hours, I drained each cup again. The Yeti and Ozark lost identical amounts once again, 6 3/4 ounces. The SubZero lost 4 1/2 ounces, a slightly bigger  percentage of melting. Again, the Yeti and Ozark were tied  atop the leader board. Finally, at the two-day mark, 48 hours, all the ice had melted. except for one tiny  piece of ice remaining in Walmart's Ozark Trail cup. So in the end we're calling it a tie, between the Yeti and Walmart's Ozark Trail. Both did an excellent job. Shoppers Seek Out Copies "I think it's a fantastic idea," one Dick's shopper told us. "But if it's cheaper somewhere else, I'd go there." And a lot of people are doing just that: If you don't need the cachet of a name brand, Walmart's is 75% cheaper. One caution: Yeti has recently filed a lawsuit against Walmart, over the Ozark tumbler, and against another brand called Mammoth Coolers. It's asking Walmart to stop selling look alike tumblers. But for now they should still be available, so you don't waste your money.    ________________________ Don't Waste Your Money is a registered trademark of the EW Scripps Co.

Another child plays the recorder over top of this in a new frame and more children are shown leaving summer camp -- working to signal the back-to-school season. More children join in singing and more instruments play as well, with the Walmart commercial eventually revealing that they're all covering a classic Whitesnake hit from the 1980s, 'Here I Go Again.'

In an interview with The Jersey Journal, Mayor Michael Gonnelli said that the town has been "actively pursuing" a specific grocery store for the town, but he declined to say which one. "There is a place picked out in (the) Harmon Meadow (area)," for a grocery store, Gonnelli said. "But the problem is it's a stone's throw away from Walmart." That may be the primary issue for any potential business that would want to try their luck in establishing a location in the municipality, some say.  Secaucus was home to an Acme supermarket, but it closed in 2004 -- ironically a couple months before the Walmart opened.  The town's only other grocery store, Stop & Shop in Mill Creek Mall, closed in 2009. Since then, Walmart has been a primary stop for many residents to do their weekly shopping, along with the farmers market near Buchmuller Park. Many residents travel to Union City or Lyndhurst. John Medina, a resident of Secaucus, is a driver for the senior center and is responsible for taking seniors to buy their groceries on Saturdays. Medina drives to multiple stores in and out of Secaucus, including the Walmart, Sam's Club, and the ShopRite in North Bergen. One senior citizen that rides along, Mike - a resident of town - says he would prefer to have a local grocery store. "I have to grocery shop all over," he says. "We go all over town -- to Union City and then back here." Medina blames Walmart for scaring away anyone from opening a supermarket in town. "It was easy when we had the Stop & Shop," Medina says. "But they wouldn't have the volume of people going there because people could just say 'Oh we could get that cheaper at Walmart,' or 'we can just go to Sam's Club and get a large quantity for cheap.' "It's good for business, but this is a small town.

It’s expanding its distribution “to reach a more diverse consumer audience through varied retail distribution,” said parent firm Commemorative Brands Inc. (CBI), of Austin, Texas, in an announcement made on March 4. Jewelers, however, will remain a prime outlet for the jewelry. Since April, Keepsake gold and diamond jewelry, including bridal, has been available nationwide in more than 2,700 discount stores and Super Centers of Wal-Mart, the $218 billion Bentonville, Ark., retailer that’s one of the country’s leading mass merchandisers. The Keepsake assortment also is sold online at www.walmart.com. Wal-Mart, which had a Keepsake bridal jewelry collection in the early 1990s, is only the first of several national retailers of Keepsake, say CBI officials. In the past five years, Keepsake has focused on diamond bridal jewelry, which it distributes nationally under the “Keepsake Signature Collection” name to authorized jewelers. Managed by Keepsake licensee Frederick Goldman Inc., New York, this “independent jeweler channel has been an integral part of maintaining the brand’s aspirational tone and commitment to quality [and] will continue to be a critical component of Keepsake’s overall distribution strategy,” said CBI’s statement. Wal-Mart’s new 14k and diamond jewelry line is made by Goldman, which manufactures and markets Keepsake diamond jewelry. The new line includes bridal sets, fashion earrings and necklaces, and men’s rings. Prices range from $199 to $899. The Keepsake line will be located in every Wal-Mart fine-jewelry department. Customers receive a certificate of authenticity with each purchase, and the Keepsake trademark is engraved inside each ring. Keepsake was originally founded in 1930 by the A.H. Pond family in Syracuse, N.Y., and became well known for its fine diamond engagement rings. It was acquired in the 1970s by ArtCarved, now part of Commemorative Brands. View the discussion thread.

In-depth look: Judges throw out appeal, Walmart a go By Jill Barnes Nelson, Tehachapi News Aug 28, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendering of a proposed Tehachapi Super Walmart. The third time may be the charm. After three appeals concerning an environmental impact report, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno last week ruled the City of Tehachapi has adequately addressed environmental issues related to the proposed Walmart. The decision of the three-panel judge issued Aug. 24 was unanimous, and followed a hearing on the case held July 26. The judges made no comments at the time of their decision but did issue a written ruling. “It appears the city and Walmart have prevailed in the appeals court,” City Manager Greg Garrett said. “They still have 60 days to appeal after the decision became public, but it’s my understanding they would have to go to the California Supreme Court.” Garrett said Walmart already has contacted the city and plans to move forward on the 165,000-square-foot center at the southeast corner of Tucker Road and Tehachapi Boulevard. “Walmart is probably at least a year away from starting anything,” Garrett said. A group called Tehachapi First, which emerged after the city approved Walmart in 2011, challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco. Following the Aug. 24 appeals court decision, Tehachapi News tried to contact Wolfe, but received no response. However, Tehachapi First posted this statement on its Facebook page: “As most of you doubtlessly know, the appeals court in Stockton (sic) has ruled in favor of Walmart and the Tehachapi city government — though the ruling is no favor to the people of Tehachapi. We have lost this battle — but we do not know what the aftermath will be. We have kept Walmart out of Tehachapi for five years — and what cancer victim would not be thankful for a five-year lease on life? But as of yet, we don’t know if Walmart will actually build in Tehachapi.” It continues, “Five years may have been enough time for Walmart to change its mind about our valley — especially as it appears Walmart has entered its period of decline and needs its resources to engage in its absurd godzilla struggle with Amazon. If Walmart doesn’t build, our struggle has not been in vain. And if Walmart builds? Well, then, the result will not be what we wished, but better than if we had never taken up the fight at all. Better to have fought and lost than never to have fought at all.” The fight to stop Walmart had been brought before courts twice before by Tehachapi First. Along the way the city made additional revisions to its environmental reviews. The last time it went to court was in July 2015 after Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental concerns related to the project. Three main issues were brought up in this latest appeal by Tehachapi First. The court said in its report that the plaintiff contends the revised EIR’s treatment of cumulative noise impacts violated the California Environmental Quality Act on three separate grounds. The first had to do with a claim of error relating to the location on residential lots where measurements were taken to establish the baseline noise level. “We reject this contention because plaintiff has not shown that a general or specific rule of law dictates where such measurements should be taken. Thus, we conclude that the identification of the proper location presented a question of fact committed to the discretion of City in its role as the lead agency.” The second claim related to the revised EIR’s decision to evaluate roadway segments containing hotels by using the noise thresholds applicable to commercial property, rather than residential property. “The plaintiff has not established the foundation for its argument that the roadway segments should have been subject to the noise standards used for residential property.” The third claim of error related to the standards or thresholds used to determine whether cumulative noise impacts were significant and whether the project’s incremental contributions to significant cumulative noise impacts were “‘cumulatively considerable’” for purposes of CEQA. The court ruled this claim also failed. “We therefore affirm the order discharging the writ of mandate.” Garrett reported that Walmart has paid for all the court costs involved in the appeals and that the company could attempt to recoup its costs from Tehachapi First. Mayor Susan Wiggins also was happy the appeals process could be at an end. “I’m really happy to hear this,” Wiggins said by phone. “I listened to both sides and also from some 350 senior citizens who said they needed the Walmart. They said didn’t want to drive to Bakersfield anymore to get lower prices on the things they need. I’m glad this finally could be over.” For a full account of the court’s decision, go to appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=5&doc_id=2118001&doc_no=F072149 To join the lively discussion of this decision and what it could mean for the community, go to the Tehachapi News’ Facebook page.

Published Aug 30th, 2016 3:55 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon recently said the retailer would ramp up its price rollback strategy a quarter or two earlier than planned. In the process, the retailer also abandoned its competitor price matching policy, then used in about 800 stores. And more recently, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said price reductions will continue. “We spend a lot of time looking at the role of national brands, role of private label and overlay the everyday low price strategy into our rollback strategy,” Foran told reporters during the retailer’s media call on Aug. 18. “Price is not something that happens immediately, it’s a gradual approach.” When asked to explain the rationale behind a price rollback, Foran said if it’s done right the first thing he expects to happen is top line sales decrease. “When the price is lowered on a can of soup, sales go down because of the price investment. We also bet you will tell family and friends and then we will gradually sell more units. We are focusing on what is happening with unit sales,” he added. While the everyday low price is part of Walmart’s DNA, price rollbacks have become necessary in an increasingly discounted market. Analysts attribute this to consumers who became cost-conscious during the Great Recession and though many can afford to pay more, most consumers would rather not. Some analysts argue that price rollbacks are temporary in nature and somewhat redundant from a retailer that claims to have an everyday low price strategy – requiring bottom line pricing from suppliers in the process. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, believes price rollbacks work in a discount-minded retail landscape. “Walmart and other retailers have better data these days. As such, they are able to be more strategic about which items are discounted and which items will bounce back to regular price more easily. Walmart has an advantage in that its discounts are ‘branded’ as rollbacks, making it easy for its customers to understand and act upon. Walmart shoppers know that rollbacks are temporary which drives urgency while mitigating any expectations for long-term discounts,” Spieckerman said. DOLLAR GENERAL PRICE MOVES Walmart competitor Dollar General is also known for low prices and recently vowed to reduce prices by an average of 10% on about 450 popular items in 2,200 of its stores. Like Walmart, the price rollback strategy is geared toward competitive markets where the retailer is losing market share to one another and other discounters. Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos told analysts on Aug. 26th the price reductions would focus on consumable categories. He said the aggressive price strategy is aimed at increasing market share by growing item units and store traffic. “We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves as appropriate over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast turning categories. At the same time, we are investing to communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, email and digital media,” Vasos said. He pledged to monitor the pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves in line with competitive positioning. Dollar General management said its core customers are constantly trying to stretch their budgets as many of its loyal shoppers skew toward the lower income households, according to Nielsen data. Vasos said Dollar General has been testing price reductions for some time in a subset of stores on items that drive additional traffic into stores. He said while low prices are important, the chain must also give consumers value items needed in their households. “What we see by these items, it helps round out that basket with the non-consumables once she gets in the store and we get her to pick up the consumables, that basket rounds up pretty nicely because of our compelling non-consumable offering,” he added. Analysts have asked Dollar General about the low price competitor Walmart and its efforts to reduce prices in lieu of price matching and if the low price wars are worth the trouble. Many of the items on price rollback are lower margin consumables. Vasos said the retail landscape has become aggressive and Dollar General competes with many discounter retailers. He said Dollar General is taking a proactive step and is not following in anyone’s footsteps. He admitted there are risks to taking price reductions, but said his company has the wherewithal to do it. Foran said Walmart’s price rollbacks are designed to help its customers add to their baskets, but there is also the hope that lower prices might attract new customers to the retail chain. He said it takes time for price reductions to gain traction with customers.

We’ve been decent on the intermediate tracks so far this year, but Darlington is so unique not only in the history of the track, but in the shape and speeds you can reach there. We’ve also got a fun promotion in which we have Paige’s photo on the car through the ‘Get Your Face in the Race’ contest, so it’ll be really cool to meet her and have her ride along with us, so to speak, for 500 miles on Sunday night.” No. 44 Twisted Tea Ford Fusion Famer Richard Petty and successful business entrepreneur Andrew Murstein, is one of the most recognized brands in all of motorsports.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Aug 30th 2016 3:27PM The worst Walmarts are located in low-income, minority communities. That's according to a study published in May by Contexts, a quarterly publication of the American Sociological Association. A Walmart store's location is closely related to how good or bad the store's customer service is, the study found. SEE ALSO: Trio allegedly killed man, drove around with his body The study, which was recently highlighted by The Atlantic's City Lab, evaluated customer service by analyzing the Yelp reviews of Walmart 2,840 locations across the US. Stores in areas that have lower average incomes have significantly worse customer reviews than locations in higher-income zip codes. Additionally, locations in areas with higher proportions of Black or Latino residents have worse reviews than those in areas with more white residents. The study's author Adam Reich, an assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University, analyzed approximately 35,000 reviews of Walmart locations and found that there was a consistent correlation between both race and class and a location's Yelp reviews. Reich blames the disparity on Walmart's decision to under-staff stores in certain areas.

Any food with a long or short shelf life According to Michael Catania, consumer savings expert and co-founder of PromotionCode.org, you'll want to stay away from Walmart foods that have longer and shorter shelf lives. Foods with shorter shelf lives tend to cost more, and foods with longer shelf lives might turn stale before consumption. "Once the cereal goes stale and you throw it away, you've also thrown away the initial savings," said Catania. But, that doesn't mean you have to avoid all of Walmart's canned and packaged foods. Catania recommends buying small and medium-sized foods at Walmart — they "will net you the best result for both cost and freshness," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 2. Snacks Store-brand snacks at Walmart are cheaper than at some of its retailer competitors. But Walmart just can't beat the low cost of dollar store food. Stock up on crackers, chips, cookies and other goods for only a buck at discount stores — just make sure you check the expiration dates. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 3. Organic Fruits and Vegetables Although Walmart has upped its selection of organic foods to accommodate the health-conscious subsection of its shoppers, you're usually better off buying organic foods from stores with organic roots, like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. "Shopping at stores with organic roots makes sense when these are the items you are purchasing," said Kerry Sherin, a savings expert from Offers.com. According to Sherin, these stores tend to have better selections and lower prices on organic foods. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 4. Fresh Produce When shopping for fresh produce, you're most likely better off shopping at your go-to grocery store than at Walmart. Even you're not happy with your grocery store's offerings, try Sprouts. "I often find Sprouts has better deals on fresh produce compared to Walmart," said Kendal Perez, a savings expert with coupon and deals site CouponSherpa.com. "For example, Sprouts recently had avocados on sale for 88 cents each, compared to $1.88 each from Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 5. Brand-Name Diapers Most retailers can't beat the price of Walmart's store-brand diapers. However, if you prefer brand names, like Pampers, you'll be better off buying from Amazon where diapers tend to be just a tad bit cheaper. Plus, if you join Amazon Family, you could get 20 percent off qualifying diaper purchases. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 6. Batteries As far as batteries go, experts tend to agree you're better off buying them at warehouse stores rather than Walmart. "Batteries are always a better buy in bulk, with Costco and Sam's Club offering more batteries for less per unit," said Perez. Sherin from Offers.com agrees. "If you want to get the best deal on batteries, buy them from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club, which will have the best rate on the largest pack of batteries."

Straight Talk Wireless Straight Talk Wireless aims "to get people on America's best networks without the expense — or the commitment that comes with contracts," according to its website. However, many people report Straight Talk Wireless has poor coverage and bad customer service. "The absolute worst item to buy at Walmart is their Straight Talk Wireless service," said Benjamin K. Glaser, features editor of online deals site, DealNews.com. "Every time we write about it on DealNews, our readers flood the comments with tales of terrible customer service driving them back to their old carriers. Many also received poor coverage, but even those who were happy with their phones and connections were driven away by the customer service." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 8. Music Unless you're looking for vinyl records, skip Walmart's CDs and stick to online streaming services for your music needs. Spotify Premium only costs $9.99 a month, as does Apple Music. Even Jay Z's new streaming service, Tidal, is affordable at $9.99 or $19.99 a month. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 9. Gift Bags and Wrapping Paper Don't head to Walmart for wrapping paper or gift bags — you'll find cheaper prices (and a wider selection) elsewhere. "Walmart strives on its convenience of being able to offer up everyday items at low prices," said Sherin. "But when it comes to gift wrap and gift bags, you can find the real savings at dollar stores." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Remember: If you save money on wrapping paper, that's more money you have available to spend on gifts. 10. Gift Cards Yes, you can find a generous selection of gift cards in Walmart's checkout lines, whether you're looking for retail or restaurant certificates. Buy why buy full-price gift cards at Walmart when you can buy discounted gift cards online? "Walmart is a great stop for gifts and last-minute items," said Sherin. "However, if you have the time to plan ahead on your purchase of a gift card, look at sites like Raise and Cardpool, which offer discounted gift cards. You can find savings of 20 percent to 30 percent off what you would pay for face value at Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 11. PC Laptops Walmart sells laptops, but you'll find better, high-quality laptops somewhere. "Walmart has low prices on electronics like laptops and TVs, but the brands are also lower quality," said Perez of CouponSherpa.com. You can also find better laptop deals by doing a little comparison shopping. Glaser of DealNews.com revealed that Walmart has not had any notable laptop deals in a while. "Walmart has not had an Editors Choice laptop deal in the last two months," he said. Instead, you're likely to find better prices on laptops from Lenovo, Dell, Microsoft, eBay and Newegg. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 12. Televisions "While it can be hard to resist paying $150 for a 40-inch TV, sometimes if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is," explained Sherin. "If you are really wanting to invest in a quality TV, stick with retailers like Best Buy whose specialty is electronics." Glaser adds that you can even find better deals on high-end TVs at other competitors. "For the higher quality TVs, Dell Home and eBay consistently offer better deals," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 13. Books Online retailers give Walmart a run for its money in the books and music department. "When it comes to entertainment — be it books, music or TV shows — you're typically better off shopping Amazon," reports MarketWatch. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 14. Printer Ink Running out of printer ink is annoying. Not only does it happen at the worst time, but ink cartridge packages can cost as much as $60 at Walmart. However, you can usually find cheaper printer ink online. "Unless a store is doing a ridiculous sale, printer ink is always less expensive online," said Paul Moyer of SavingFreak.com. "You can purchase re-manufactured cartridges for as much as 50 percent off the price you would pay in Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 15. Jewelry With discounted jewelry at Walmart, you get what you pay for — low-quality pieces. "If you are buying jewelry at what would be deemed a discount store, don't expect to get the best quality items," said Sherin. Instead, she advised you try shopping at Macy's or Kay's, "who have experts that can walk you through the process of picking out a quality piece of jewelry." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 16. Wood Furniture Walmart is famous for the incredibly low prices on furniture — particularly bookshelves and television consoles. And although Walmart's furniture is great for college students or those who have a small budget, it's always best to invest in higher-quality furniture that will last longer — even if it will cost you extra, said Sherin. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 17. Bedding Walmart's bedding selection isn't always the highest quality, and you can often do better elsewhere. If you prefer quality over price, wait for sales and buy bedding from similar stores. "You can find similar pricing for much higher quality at a discount retailer like HomeGoods or Marshalls," said Andrea Woroch, a consumer and money-saving expert. "Otherwise, shop sales at department stores like Macy's and JCPenney, and look for coupons via CouponSherpa.com to find applicable deals to get high-quality bedding for less." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 18. Pet Food Before buying pet food at Walmart, compare the cost of buying in bulk from Amazon or a wholesale club. I compared Walmart prices with Sam's Club and found that the latter offered a generally better deal when purchasing in bulk. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 19. Small Kitchen Appliances Amazon and Walmart offer similar prices on some of their household appliances — but not on everything. A good rule of thumb is to buy smaller items in bulk online, and price compare anything bigger before buying it at Walmart. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 20. Large Kitchen Appliances If your dishwasher or fridge breaks down, fight the urge to run to Walmart. You might find a better deal at competing retailers. "If you are needing to replace that pesky dishwasher or looking for a new refrigerator, Walmart may not be the place to find the sweetest deal," said Sherin. "We see stores like Sears and Best Buy excel in the appliance department, often offering free installation, home delivery and removal of the old appliance." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 21. Kitchenware It doesn't matter if you're buying glasses, mugs or dinnerware — I've found that Walmart's prices can't beat the dollar stores when it comes to kitchenware. Try browsing Dollar General's selection — you'll get more items for your money. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 22. Tires Need new tires? Skip Walmart, and get your next set of wheels from Sam's Club or Costco. Costco, for example, even offers free tire balancing and rotations. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 23. Greeting Cards Rather than spend $2 or $3 per greeting card at Walmart, check out the selection of cards at Dollar General or the Family Dollar. I found cards for every occasion at Dollar General starting at $1. Woroch and Perez had the same experience. "The best deal for greeting cards and gift wrap is at the dollar store; you can't beat their prices," said Woroch. "While Walmart sells a few cards for 99 cents, most of their greeting cards are $3 to $5," added Perez. "I can buy two-for-$1 greeting cards from Dollar Tree, plus pay just $1 for gift wrap, bags, tissue, bows and more." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 24. Outdoor Items You'll find ample garden supplies, lawn care equipment and patio furniture at Walmart, and the prices aren't bad, either. Unfortunately, in my experience, the quality isn't great. You might get more use out of outdoor equipment purchased from Home Depot or Lowe's, which both have a better selection and higher-quality merchandise. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 25. Hair Supplies It doesn't make sense to spend several bucks for single hair accessories at Walmart. You can get many of the same items for $1 at dollar stores. I've found that Walmart prices tend to be higher for hair bows, headbands, combs and other hair supplies. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 26. Disposable Utensils A plastic kitchen utensil set at Walmart could run you between $10 and $15 for six or nine pieces, whereas I found individual pieces at Dollar Tree for as low as $1. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 27. Office and School Supplies Walmart's back-to-school deals might be cheaper than the deals advertised by other retailers, but if you're shopping for office or school supplies during other times of the year, I've found Walmart to be far more expensive than discount stores like the Dollar Tree. There, you'll find better deals on crayons, pens, markers, tape, glue, packing supplies and storage. Woroch recommends checking other stores' sales before heading to Walmart. "During back-to-school season, office suppliers like Office Depot and Staples run lots of sales where you can find penny deals on essentials like folders, notebooks and pencils," she said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 28. Party Supplies Walmart has an entire aisle dedicated to party supplies, but these items are more expensive than other discount retailers. According to my research, you can stock up on party supplies at the Dollar Tree for far less. Purchase invitations, balloons, party favors and decorations — all for just a buck each. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 29. Cleaning Supplies From laundry detergent to disinfecting wipes, Walmart's cleaning supplies are more expensive than the Family Dollar and Dollar General. You'll typically save between 30 cents and 50 cents by shopping at these discount retailers instead. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 30. Personal Hygiene Products If you don't mind buying generic lotion, toothpaste or deodorant, stock up on personal hygiene products at the Dollar Tree. Walmart does have a huge selection of personal hygiene products, and in many cases it offers better deals than its big-box competitors. Still, Walmart's generic brands can't match dollar store prices. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION In the early 2000s, Walmart implemented cost-cutting policies that reduced the number of necessary employees per store and resulted in a drop in store quality. This study provides evidence that a decrease in store quality was not consistent across the board, but instead impacted some customers more than others. "Walmart is the largest retailer and largest employer in the world; moreover, it has consciously branded itself as a champion of and boon for disadvantaged communities," writes Reich. "Its underinvestment in these communities is thus particularly notable." Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The study may have a few holes. The reliance on Yelp means that researchers can't examine reviewers' biases and outside influences. For example, a store's location in a lower-income or more predominantly Black or Latino neighborhood may impact how its quality is perceived by some reviewers, regardless of the store's customer service. However, this isn't the first time that Walmart's apparent understaffing has been called into question. Reports of Walmart saving money by cutting staff have also gotten the retailer in hot water with police. Earlier in August, Bloomberg reported that more than 200 violent crimes had been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US. SEE ALSO: Report: SWAT team called to Chris Brown's home Bloomberg argued that the rise in crime is a result of corporate policies. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," a Walmart representative said in an email to Business Insider earlier in August. While Walmart's cost-cutting policies have had negative — and, at times, dangerous — outcomes for customers, they have also driven profits: Bloomberg found that sales per employee in the US grew 23% in the last decade to $236,804. Currently, Reich states that the retailer can turn a profit despite providing poor customer service because Walmart's super low prices have helped put local competition out of business. As a result, Walmart becomes some customers' only option — no matter how poor the shopping experience is. However, Reich argues that the retailer may suffer in the long term if it doesn't make some major changes. A poor shopping experience could be increasingly damaging for the brand as online shopping grows and competitors increasingly invest in providing quality in-store experiences. "For Walmart and other retailers, providing a pleasant customer service experience seems likely to be increasingly important to corporate profitability," writes Reich. "For its own sake, then, Walmart should hire more employees, particularly at stores in low-income communities of color, and give all Walmart employees more reasons to smile through better wages and working conditions."

Newnan Public Information Officer Gina Snider said the robbery occurred Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. at the Wood Forest Bank, located inside the Newnan Walmart Store.  The robber gave a note to the teller, demanding money, said Snider, adding that an undetermined amount of money was taken.  The robber did not display a weapon, said Snider.  The robber is described as a black male in his late 30’s or 40’s. He was wearing a two-tone baseball style cap with a logo on the front and a dark colored T-shirt.  The man was seen leaving in a silver/gray Toyota with a sunroof, spoiler and gold rims. Anyone with information pertaining to the robbery is asked to contact the Newnan Police Department at 770-254-2355.

The leaders of the G7 nations are scheduled to meet at nearby Schloss Elmau June 7-8. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) An international trade deal being negotiated in secret is a “turbo-charged privatisation pact” that poses a threat to democratic sovereignty and “the very concept of public services”, campaigners have warned. But this is not TTIP – the international agreement it appears campaigners in the European Union have managed to scupper over similar concerns – this is TISA, a deal backed by some of the world’s biggest corporations, such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, Walt Disney, Walmart, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Few people may have heard of the Trade In Services Agreement, but campaign group Global Justice Now warns in a new report: “Defeating TTIP may amount to a pyrrhic victory if we allow TISA to pass without challenge.” Like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TISA is being negotiated in secret even though it could have a major impact on countries which sign up. While TTIP is only between the EU and US, those behind TISA have global ambitions as it involves most of the world’s major economies – with the notable exceptions of China and Russia – in a group they call the “Really Good Friends of Services”. The Department for International Trade dismissed the idea that public services were at risk from TISA, adding that the UK was committed to securing an "ambitious" deal. But according to Global Justice Now’s report, the deal could “lock in privatisation of public services”; allow “casino capitalism” by undermining financial regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 recession; threaten online privacy; damage efforts to fight climate change; and prevent developing countries from improving public services. Nick Dearden, director of group, said: “This deal is a threat to the very concept of public services. It is a turbo-charged privatisation pact, based on the idea that, rather than serving the public interest, governments must step out of the way and allow corporations to ‘get on with it’. Read more TTIP negotiations should stop, French government says   “Of particular concern, we fear TISA will include clauses that will prevent governments taking public control of strategic services, and inhibit regulation of the very banks that created the financial crash.” He suggested pro-Brexit voters should be concerned at the potential loss of sovereignty. “Many people were persuaded to leave the EU on the grounds they would be ‘taking back control’ of our economic policy,” Mr Dearden said. “But if we sign up to TISA, our ability to control our economy – to regulate, to protect public services, to fight climate change – is massively reduced. In effect, we would be handing large swathes of policy making to big business. “ The report says the widespread opposition to TTIP, a deal between only the EU and US, had not yet been repeated over TISA. “It is vital for elected representatives, campaigners and ordinary citizens to unite against this threat,” it adds. “TISA threatens public services. From postal services to the NHS, TISA could lock in privatisation and ensure that big multinationals increasingly call the shots on areas like health, education and basic utilities.” A so-called “ratchet” clause in the deal means that after a service – like trains or water or energy – is privatised, this is almost impossible to reverse even if it fails. According to the report, a “standstill” clause also means “no new regulation can be passed that gives foreign companies worse treatment” than when TISA is passed. “Taken together, the standstill and ratchet clauses could make it much harder for a future government to renationalise the railways, a move backed by a majority of the British public,” it says. “Similarly, it could mean that the creeping privatisation of the NHS becomes more and more irreversible with greater involvement of companies from countries like the USA. And forget taking control of the electricity system back from the big six energy firms.” Migrant workers could be classified as “independent service suppliers”, the report says, meaning they would not be eligible for the minimum wage or be allowed to join a union. People going to another country may find their visa is tied to their job, so if they were sacked, they would be deported. “This sort of system of modern indentured labour is wide open to abuse by unscrupulous employers who may get away with illegal practices safe in the knowledge that they can threaten any employee with deportation if they complain," the report says. “This sort of system is used in countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and has resulted in working conditions that have been described as being close to slavery.” The global economic crash of 2008 was precipitated by the sale of complex financial products linked to unsafe "sub-prime" mortgages. The report says there was a danger the final TISA deal would “undermine efforts to regulate risky financial products” with a proposal that firms should be allowed to offer “any new financial service”. “The danger is that TISA will deter governments from limiting the use of such ‘innovative’ financial products and leave us powerless to stop the next financial crisis,” it says. TISA could also potentially prevent governments from favouring renewable energy over fossil fuels – despite the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the health effects of air pollution. Private firms would also be allowed to move online data from one country to another under one proposal being considered. While the original country’s privacy laws would have to be respected, the report said it was “not clear how this will be … enforced”. While developed countries in Europe have established public services that would not be threatened unless a state’s government decided to open them up to private firms, the same is not true of many developing countries. If they signed up to the deal, it could effectively prevent them from setting up public institutions taken for granted in the West. The TISA negotiations were held behind closed doors for about 18 months until they were publicly revealed by the global trade union group Public Services International (PSI). Information about some of the proposals has been also disclosed through Wikileaks and similar sites. Daniel Bertossa, PSI’s director of policy, said: “Anybody who’s interested in maintaining democratic control of national institutions should be very concerned about the Trade in Services Agreement that is being negotiated in secret. “It will remove large sections of national sovereignty and the ability of any government, including the UK Government, to regulate important service sectors [on issues] such as energy, such as transport, such as privacy. “The Trade in Services Agreement is part of a radical project to limit governments’ sovereign right to regulate and freeze it almost in permanence in the interests of foreign corporations.” According to the European Commission, TISA is about "facilitating trade in services". "The EU is the world's largest exporter of services with tens of millions of jobs throughout Europe in the services sector.  Opening up markets for services will mean more growth and jobs," its website says. The Independent has contacted “Team TISA”, a group of mainly American companies in favour of the deal, asking for a comment. On its website, it says: “Services are the fastest growing sector of the global economy and account for two-thirds of global output, one-third of global employment and nearly 20 per cent of global trade. “The TISA provides an opportunity to expand services trade among over 50 countries, covering nearly 70 per cent of global trade in services. “The potential expansion TISA provides will benefit not only global growth, but also US domestic growth. “As the world’s largest services exporter, with over $1.3 trillion (about £1 trillion) in annual cross-border and foreign-affiliate sales, the United States will benefit tremendously from elimination of services barriers.” A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Public services are under no threat whatsoever from this deal or any other trade agreement. The UK remains committed to an ambitious Trade in Services Agreement.” Independent Independent News Service Related Content TTIP negotiations should stop, French government says EU-US trade deal will not happen this year, says Francois Hollande EU-US trade deal talks have stalled, says German economy minister UK biggest investor in US, underscoring 'economic special relationship' - report TTIP: People in Republic of Ireland want referendum on trade deals TTIP: European Commission attempts to resurrect deal as countries go cold on plan TTIP far from over despite massive Greenpeace document leak, European Commission says TTIP talks are 'likely to stop', say officials, as François Hollande signals France will reject deal TTIP leak could spell the end of controversial trade deal, say campaigners TTIP: UK Parliament 'would not be able to stop NHS sell-off if treaty is passed' TTIP: UK Government found secret courts in trade deal have 'lots of risk and no benefit' in its only assessment TTIP: More than 130,000 people urge Barack Obama to kill controversial trade deal during UK visit TTIP: Big business and US to have major say in EU trade deals, leak reveals Beef industry will suffer significantly if TTIP deal between EU and US goes ahead: Michelle O'Neill TTIP could block governments from cracking down on tax avoidance, study warns Exclude NHS from TTIP appeal signed by Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Nicola Sturgeon and Natalie Bennett Cut NHS from TTIP trade deal say doctors What is TTIP?

Meet TISA, the 'secret privatisation pact that poses a threat to democracy' Government insists 'public services are under no threat whatsoever from this deal' Ian Johnston Tuesday 30 August 2016 16:14 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Anti-TTIP protests have brought thousands onto the streets across Europe, while the TISA talks have gone largely unnoticed Getty An international trade deal being negotiated in secret is a “turbo-charged privatisation pact” that poses a threat to democratic sovereignty and “the very concept of public services”, campaigners have warned. But this is not TTIP – the international agreement it appears campaigners in the European Union have managed to scupper over similar concerns – this is TISA, a deal backed by some of the world’s biggest corporations, such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, Walt Disney, Walmart, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. Few people may have heard of the Trade In Services Agreement, but campaign group Global Justice Now warns in a new report: “Defeating TTIP may amount to a pyrrhic victory if we allow TISA to pass without challenge.” Like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TISA is being negotiated in secret, even though it could have a major impact on countries which sign up. Read more TTIP's 'failure' gives us a clue about Britain's post-Brexit trading future TTIP has failed – but no one is admitting it, says German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel Thought we'd escaped TTIP by leaving the EU? Think again- it's setting the terrifying blueprint for our future trade deals 'TTIP on steroids': Campaigners warn post-Brexit UK faces 'disastrous' trade deal with US While TTIP is only between the EU and US, those behind TISA have global ambitions as it involves most of the world’s major economies – with the notable exceptions of China and Russia – in a group they call the “Really Good Friends of Services”. The Department for International Trade dismissed the idea that public services were at risk from TISA, adding that the UK was committed to securing an "ambitious" deal. But according to Global Justice Now’s report, the deal could “lock in privatisation of public services”; allow “casino capitalism” by undermining financial regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 recession; threaten online privacy; damage efforts to fight climate change; and prevent developing countries from improving public services. Jeremy Corbyn vows to veto TTIP Nick Dearden, director of group, said: “This deal is a threat to the very concept of public services. It is a turbo-charged privatisation pact, based on the idea that rather than serving the public interest, governments must step out of the way and allow corporations to ‘get on with it’. “Of particular concern, we fear TISA will include clauses that will prevent governments taking public control of strategic services, and inhibit regulation of the very banks that created the financial crash.” He suggested pro-Brexit voters should be concerned at the potential loss of sovereignty. “Many people were persuaded to leave the EU on the grounds they would be ‘taking back control’ of our economic policy,” Mr Dearden said. “But if we sign up to TISA, our ability to control our economy – to regulate, to protect public services, to fight climate change – is massively reduced. In effect, we would be handing large swathes of policy-making to big business. “ Read more Trade agreements like TiSA, TPP and TTIP will sideline national laws, The report says the widespread opposition to TTIP, a deal between only the EU and US, had not yet been repeated over TISA. “It is vital for elected representatives, campaigners and ordinary citizens to unite against this threat,” it adds. “TISA threatens public services. From postal services to the NHS, TISA could lock in privatisation and ensure that big multinationals increasingly call the shots on areas like health, education and basic utilities.” A so-called “ratchet” clause in the deal means that after a service – like trains or water or energy – is privatised, this is almost impossible to reverse even if it fails.  According to the report, a “standstill” clause also means “no new regulation can be passed that gives foreign companies worse treatment” than when TISA is passed. “Taken together, the standstill and ratchet clauses could make it much harder for a future government to renationalise the railways, a move backed by a majority of the British public,” it says. “Similarly, it could mean that the creeping privatisation of the NHS becomes more and more irreversible with greater involvement of companies from countries like the US. And forget taking control of the electricity system back from the big six energy firms.” The 6 reasons why we should be scared of TTIP 6 show all The 6 reasons why we should be scared of TTIP 1/6 The NHS Public services, especially the NHS, are in the firing line. One of the main aims of TTIP is to open up Europe’s public health, education and water services to US companies. This could essentially mean the privatisation of the NHS. The European Commission has claimed that public services will be kept out of TTIP. However, according to the Huffington Post, the UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston has admitted that talks about the NHS were still on the table Getty 2/6 Food and environmental safety TTIP’s ‘regulatory convergence’ agenda will seek to bring EU standards on food safety and the environment closer to those of the US. But US regulations are much less strict, with 70 per cent of all processed foods sold in US supermarkets now containing genetically modified ingredients. By contrast, the EU allows virtually no GM foods. The US also has far laxer restrictions on the use of pesticides. It also uses growth hormones in its beef which are restricted in Europe due to links to cancer. US farmers have tried to have these restrictions lifted repeatedly in the past through the World Trade Organisation and it is likely that they will use TTIP to do so again Getty 3/6 Banking regulations TTIP cuts both ways. The UK, under the influence of the all-powerful City of London, is thought to be seeking a loosening of US banking regulations. America’s financial rules are tougher than ours. They were put into place after the financial crisis to directly curb the powers of bankers and avoid a similar crisis happening again. TTIP, it is feared, will remove those restrictions, effectively handing all those powers back to the bankers Getty/Bloomberg 4/6 Privacy Remember ACTA (the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement)? It was thrown out by a massive majority in the European Parliament in 2012 after a huge public backlash against what was rightly seen as an attack on individual privacy where internet service providers would be required to monitor people’s online activity. Well, it’s feared that TTIP could be bringing back ACTA’s central elements, proving that if the democratic approach doesn’t work, there’s always the back door. An easing of data privacy laws and a restriction of public access to pharmaceutical companies’ clinical trials are also thought to be on the cards AFP/Getty Images 5/6 Jobs The EU has admitted that TTIP will probably cause unemployment as jobs switch to the US, where labour standards and trade union rights are lower. It has even advised EU members to draw on European support funds to compensate for the expected unemployment. Examples from other similar bi-lateral trade agreements around the world support the case for job losses. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada and Mexico caused the loss of one million US jobs over 12 years, instead of the hundreds of thousands of extra that were promised Dave Thompson/Getty Images 6/6 Democracy TTIP’s biggest threat to society is its inherent assault on democracy. One of the main aims of TTIP is the introduction of Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS), which allow companies to sue governments if those governments’ policies cause a loss of profits. In effect it means unelected transnational corporations can dictate the policies of democratically elected governments AFP/Getty Migrant workers could be classified as “independent service suppliers”, the report says, meaning they would not be eligible for the minimum wage or be allowed to join a union. People going to another country may find their visa is tied to their job, so if they were sacked, they would be deported. “This sort of system of modern indentured labour is wide open to abuse by unscrupulous employers who may get away with illegal practices safe in the knowledge that they can threaten any employee with deportation if they complain," the report says. “This sort of system is used in countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and has resulted in working conditions that have been described as being close to slavery.” The global economic crash of 2008 was precipitated by the sale of complex financial products linked to unsafe "sub-prime" mortgages. The report says there is a danger the final TISA deal would “undermine efforts to regulate risky financial products” with a proposal that firms should be allowed to offer “any new financial service”. “The danger is that TISA will deter governments from limiting the use of such ‘innovative’ financial products and leave us powerless to stop the next financial crisis,” it says. TISA could also potentially prevent governments from favouring renewable energy over fossil fuels – despite the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the health effects of air pollution. Private firms would also be allowed to move online data from one country to another under one proposal being considered. While the original country’s privacy laws would have to be respected, the report said it was “not clear how this will be … enforced”. While developed countries in Europe have established public services that would not be threatened unless a state’s government decided to open them up to private firms, the same is not true of many developing countries. If they signed up to the deal, it could effectively prevent them from setting up public institutions taken for granted in the West. TTIP controversy: what an FOI request revealed 14 show all TTIP controversy: what an FOI request revealed 1/14 TTIP controversy Responding to a Freedom of Information request from an EU watchdog regarding contacts between officials and the tobacco industry, the European Commission released a set of documents that had been so heavily redacted as to be meaningless.

Information about some of the proposals has been also disclosed through Wikileaks and similar sites. Daniel Bertossa, PSI’s director of policy, said: “Anybody who’s interested in maintaining democratic control of national institutions should be very concerned about the Trade in Services Agreement that is being negotiated in secret. “It will remove large sections of national sovereignty and the ability of any government, including the UK Government, to regulate important service sectors [on issues] such as energy, such as transport, such as privacy. The Trade in Services Agreement is part of a radical project to limit governments’ sovereign right to regulate and freeze it almost in permanence in the interests of foreign corporations.” According to the European Commission, TISA is about "facilitating trade in services".  "The EU is the world's largest exporter of services with tens of millions of jobs throughout Europe in the services sector. Opening up markets for services will mean more growth and jobs," its website says.  The Independent has contacted “Team TISA”, a group of mainly American companies in favour of the deal, asking for a comment. Corbyn: Labour would veto TTIP On its website, it says: “Services are the fastest growing sector of the global economy and account for two thirds of global output, one third of global employment and nearly 20 per cent of global trade.  “The TISA provides an opportunity to expand services trade among over 50 countries, covering nearly 70 per cent of global trade in services.  “The potential expansion TISA provides will benefit not only global growth, but also US domestic growth.  “As the world’s largest services exporter, with over $1.3 trillion (about £1 trillion) in annual cross-border and foreign-affiliate sales, the US will benefit tremendously from elimination of services barriers.” A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Public services are under no threat whatsoever from this deal or any other trade agreement.

Large companies like Walmart have pumped thousands of dollars into an initiative called Keep Dollars In Crawford County and canvassers have spent months securing signatures from voters in hopes of having enough to put the issue before voters in November. The initiative would let voters decide if alcohol sales should be allowed within the county. There are opposing groups that have put up signs asking voters to not allow the issue to make the ballot. According to the Crawford County clerk, more than 90,000 signatures were turned in earlier this month to be counted.  A little more than 9,000 were verified to be usable in the count and approximately 3,000 verified signatures are still needed for the initiative to make the ballot. The clerk's office will have until 5 p.m. tomorrow (Aug. 30) to decide whether enough signatures were collected. "Whatever is certified to us at that point in time will go on the ballot. If we do not have the certification from the county clerk at that time then it will not go on the ballot," said Crawford County Election Commissioner Bill Coleman. Sources said the clerk's office could see a potential lawsuit filed against it alleging some collected signatures should be counted. The clerk said some signatures were not counted because the person or persons collecting the signatures weren't certified to do so by state law. In Johnson County, the clerk there is being sued by the group Stand Strong, Stay Dry, Be Safe. The lawsuit alleges the clerk did not certify paperwork according to state law and some canvassers were also not verified correctly. According to Johnson County clerk's office personnel, whether or not the issue will make the November ballot will be decided by a circuit court judge Wednesday.

But what I realized on my most recent sojourn was that the only thing that I’ve never shopped for there was the one thing I actually did happen to need: denim. I ventured into the men’s section of denim offerings (the straight silhouette works better for my silhouette in general), and saw a glimmer of a wide-leg pair of dark-wash jeans that were not, actually, all that different than the Céline numbers that my friend who I was with was wearing. And that wasn’t all: There were heaps and heaps of clean-cut workwear-type pieces. In 15 minutes, I had scooped up an armful of jeans, tried them on in less than 10 minutes (the fitting stalls were fantastically empty), and managed to walk out with four pairs for less than $100. This is not the norm, in the fashion world. Denim, once a workwear staple, has in recent years become a luxury item. A standard pair of skinny jeans from AG or J Brand waver around $150 to $250, while a pair of those artfully torn restyled vintage “Ass Rip” jeans from Re/Done are roughly $280. The epic Vetements jeans cost a whopping $1,450. Sure, America runs on denim—but it’s also become incredibly unaffordable.   Expand Vetements Spring 2017 Ready-to-Wear Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv And yet my return to my runway-observing office in my bulk-copped denim was entirely positive: Those high-waisted dark-wash wide-leg pants were confused with a designer label, while my light-wash 30×30 Wranglers were mistaken for tailored vintage. The throwback ’90s camouflage pair and their stonewashed brown duck version (both courtesy of Dickies), received a slew of “where did you get those” type of questions. It was refreshing, especially knowing I had snagged everything for a bargain. Kelly Connor, Vogue.com Market Editor (and a bonafide denimhead), has a soft spot for sturdy big-box jeans. Her obsession started last year when she ventured into a Walmart in North Dakota. “They have amazing normcore streetwear-type stuff. The most classic paired-down original styles,” says Connor, who also recommends buying from the men’s section (“they fit better”). These are places beyond trends. “It’s the stuff I always want, but brands are always pushing newer styles in NYC. It’s all basics at its core.” Labels are catching wind of the popularity of standard workwear denim, too. Carhartt’s younger, stylish sibling, the label Carhartt WIP (Work in Progress), which has existed for a number of years mostly in Europe, opened a New York City-based store in 2011. It’s the streetwear-based, chicly nipped and tailored version of the construction worker–, hunter-appealing Carhartt. In fact, Vetements churned out haute Carhartt WIP as part of its nearly 20-label collaborations for the Spring 2017 show. Pieces came in that synonymous rustic tan hue, including a massive halter–smock dress and a pair of hip bone–hanging slouchy pants. It’s a far cry from the original big-box retailer look, sure—and will most likely cost 10 times more than a single pair of jeans from a Walmart or Target by the time they hit the market. For now? Those on-sale Wranglers look just as good—sans the dent in the bank account.   Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Denim Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2017 Condé Nast.

The next time you talk to a trucker, please thank them for their service, because without their hard work none of our lives would be possible. In America today, very few of us live a truly independent lifestyle, and that means that we rely on the system to provide what we need. Most of us take for granted that there will always be plenty of goods at Wal-Mart and at the grocery store whenever we need more "stuff," and most of us never give a second thought to how all of that "stuff" gets there. Well, the truth is that most of it is brought in by trucks, and if the trucks stopped running for some reason the entire country would devolve into chaos very rapidly. I came across a quote from Alice Friedemann that detailed what we would be facing during a major national transportation disruption very nicely: Within a week, in roughly this order, grocery stores would be out of dairy and other items that are delivered many times a day. And by the week, the shelves would be empty. Hospitals, pharmacies, factories, and many other businesses also get several deliveries a day, and they'd be running out of stuff the first day. And the second day, there's be panic and hoarding. And restaurants, pharmacies would close. ATM's would be out of money. Construction would stop. There'd be increasing layoffs. Increasing enormous amounts of trash not getting picked up, 685,000 tons a day. Service stations would be closed. Very few people would be working. And the livestock would start to be hungry from lack of feed deliveries. Then within two weeks, clean water supplies would run out. Within four weeks to eight weeks, there wouldn't be coal delivered to power plants and electricity would start shutting down. And when that happened, about a quarter of our pipelines use electricity, and so natural gas plants wouldn't be fed natural gas and they'd start shutting down. There is so much infrastructure that we take for granted that would suddenly become very vulnerable in this type of scenario. There are countless numbers of workers out there that never get any glory that do the hard work of maintaining our nuclear power plants, our natural gas pipelines, our electrical grid, etc. If they suddenly were not able to do their jobs, the consequences would be absolutely catastrophic. The following comes from Tess Pennington: They rarely mention the dozens of nuclear power plants that litter the United States. If no one is there to operate them, how long before they melt down and bury millions of survivors under a radioactive cloud? Then there are the 12,000 facilities around the country that store large quantities of toxic or flammable chemicals, and reside close to residential areas. 2,500 of these sites contain chemicals in quantities that, if a catastrophic accident were to occur, could affect 10,000 to 1 million people each. And let's not forget the 2.5 million miles of oil and gas pipelines that can be found in every state. They suffer hundreds of leaks and ruptures every year, and are much more likely to explode when they aren't maintained. That detail seems to be conveniently forgotten by post-apocalyptic films. And finally, most post-apocalyptic movies will forget to mention what happens when there aren't any functional fire departments. Aside from the obvious consequences, like whole neighborhoods routinely burning to the ground, who's going to put out landfill fires that are occasionally radioactive? For most Americans, a major national emergency of this magnitude may seem unimaginable right now. But the truth is that it isn't difficult to see how this kind of scenario could happen. The Yellowstone supervolcano is becoming increasingly active, a single large asteroid could change all of our lives in a single moment, a crippling pandemic could bring normal life in America to a complete standstill, a terror attack involving weapons of mass destruction would spread panic and fear like wildfire, and a historic earthquake along the New Madrid fault, the Cascadia Subduction zone or any of the major faults in California could literally change the geography of our entire continent. In addition, a massive EMP burst from a nuclear weapon or from the sun could fry our power grid and send us back into the stone age in a single moment. This is something that I have written about extensively, and those that want to minimize this threat simply don't know what they are talking about. And an electromagnetic pulse is not even required to cause very serious problems with our electrical grid. For instance, just consider what happened in Ukraine toward the end of last year: On December 23rd, 2015, the Prykarpattyaoblenergo power distribution station in Ukraine was hit by a carefully coordinated cyber-attack that was months in the making. The technicians lost control of their cursors as they watched hackers open breakers and take circuit after circuit offline, plunging 230,000 residents into darkness. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=858193288" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=858193288" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The hackers took backup power of the stations offline, plunging the electrical workers into darkness too, and worse yet, they even rewrote the low-level firmware that controls the electrical transformers. The attack had come after months of careful infiltration and planning by a dedicated team of elite cyber-warfare specialists and the result was devastating. Even months later, technicians struggled to regain full capacity in the electrical grid due to the overwriting of firmware. With Ukrainian moves to nationalize power companies, it is possible that the powerful and Putin-connected Russian oligarchs who own large parts of Ukraine's infrastructure were sending a message: We can shut down the system anytime we want. The truth is that we are far more vulnerable than most of us would like to admit. So what would you do if "normal life" suddenly came to an end and you no longer had access to food, water or power? How would you and your family respond? Hopefully you would continue to act in a civilized manner, but history has shown that many people would not. Desperate people do desperate things, and it would only take a matter of days for some people to become violent: Before long, getting mugged or being a victim of some type of crime is as unpredictable and as common as a car accident. You'll realize everyone in the neighborhood has now beefed up security on their homes. All your family, friends, and coworkers have experienced a mugging, carjacking, or worse. You'll have no choice but to accept this new way of life and count on basic safety measures (a form of passive denial) or further learn to defend yourself and remain in a constant state of alert (a very stressful state over time). It's difficult emotionally, mentally and physically to remain on high alert 24/7 for any length of time. Most people will revert to a form of passive denial until the next incident happens to them or a family member. And even though things may seem relatively stable for the moment, concern about what is coming is one of the factors that has led an increasing number of Americans to arm themselves. According to a brand new study from the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of all American homes now have a gun. Just two years ago, a different study found that number was sitting at just 31 percent. The way that we are living our lives right now will not last indefinitely. At some point a major national emergency will strike, and when that day arrives we could suddenly be facing major power grid and transportation disruptions. Are you prepared for that? If not, you might want to do so while you still have time. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

News Sports TideSports.com Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Search Classifieds log in Police: Daughter stabbed mother in Walmart lot in Bessemer Tuesday Aug 30, 2016 at 9:00 AM BESSEMER — Alabama authorities Monday arrested a 29-year-old woman on murder charges in the slaying of her mother, who died over the weekend after being stabbed in a Walmart parking lot. The Associated Press BESSEMER — Alabama authorities Monday arrested a 29-year-old woman on murder charges in the slaying of her mother, who died over the weekend after being stabbed in a Walmart parking lot. Ashia Christine Huddleston was captured Monday morning by the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Task Force and Bessemer police, said Sgt. Cortice Miles of Bessemer police. Huddleston had eluded authorities for nearly two days after fleeing the scene of the stabbing Saturday. Authorities have accused Huddleston of stabbing her mother, 49-year-old Tammy Lynn Huddleston, several times in the abdomen in the parking lot of a Walmart in Bessemer. Witnesses told police they saw the two women fighting before the younger Huddleston stabbed her mother and fled in a car with her boyfriend. Tammy Lynn Huddleston died Sunday morning at a hospital from her injuries. The violent slaying stunned her friends, who remembered the victim as a caring mother and grandmother, al.com reported. “She was a great mother that went far and beyond to help her kids,” said friend Kimberly Clayton. “She not only raised her daughter and her son, but she was raising her daughter’s two daughters. She ate, slept and lived for those grandkids.” Ashia Huddleston was jailed Monday with her bond set at $250,000. It was not immediately known if she had an attorney representing her. Miles said the suspect’s boyfriend had been cooperating with police. Clayton said after the stabbing she messaged Ashia Huddleston and pleaded with her to turn herself in to police. She said the young woman blocked her phone number after replying: “It was an accident.” “I hate that her daughter did this,” Clayton said. “I hope they lock her up for a long time. You don’t murder the lady that brought you into this world and always had your back no matter what.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe/Manage Account Manage Print Account Manage Digital Account Photo Reprints Corrections Contact Us Submissions Events Calendar Submit News Letters to the Editor Photos Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertise With Us Search Classifieds Search Display Ads Online Services Newsletters Mobile Apps RSS Facebook Twitter E-Edition Forum Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

The store was evacuated Sunday in Millbrook, 10 miles north of Montgomery, after customers complained of irritated eyes and breathing problems. WSFA-TV reported that authorities initially blamed a piece of rotting produce for the problems. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Leslee Wright said Monday that employees later found an empty can of pepper spray under a merchandise display and suspect that caused customers' reactions. Wright credited store managers for taking the situation seriously and says the company is thankful no one was seriously hurt.

The Chicago Tribune reports that the line features peach, mixed berry and apple cobblers (each $6.98), an apple pecan cake ($9.98) and a sweet potato loaf ($4.48). All are available nationwide, except the loaf, which is only available in select stores. Shout out to Patti LaBelle! According to the press release, 6.4 million pounds of peaches go into the Patti’s Peach Cobbler. The Tribune sampled everything except the loaf, and noted that the crust of the cobbler “is covered in cinnamon, which is aromatic but actually distracts from the cobbler’s sweetness. Too much cinnamon on the interior turned the tasters off.” READ RELATED STORY: Look! Patti LaBelle and James Wright Chanel Together Eatin’, Dancin & Singin’ (VIDEO/PHOTOS) The publication also reports that Patti’s Berry Cobbler is “stuffed with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries,” and that it’s “the right balance of sweet to tart.” Additionally, the “cobblers are not sold frozen, so they don’t need to be heated to be enjoyed, but heating them through does offer a bit of that “fresh baked” sensation.” Patti’s Good Life Apple Cobbler has a texture that is “spot on.” The desert is made with Fuji apples that have retained a bit of their tartness, and the filling has a “more balanced mixture of cinnamon and sugar than the peach.” Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake was a major turn-off for the tasters because of the “near-impenetrable helmet of buttercream icing and too-rich caramel goo.” The cake itself is a tasty “Southern-style layer cake of Fuji apples and Georgia pecans.” Overall, the tasters aren’t sure these treats are worthy of breaking out into song over, as James Wright Chanel did after he sampled Patti’s now famous Sweet Potato Pie,  but they do offer “good value and flavor.”   Share this: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr patti labellepatti labelle cobblers and cakeswalmart Previous ArticleEagles Player Myke Tavarres Backtracks & Won't be Sitting Out the National Anthem Like Kaepernick Next ArticleJackie Robinson (in 1972) Said What Colin Kaepernick is Saying Now and More Show/Hide Comments Speak your Mind Cancel reply Follow Us Recent Videos Top Views Condola Rashad: Phylicia Rashad’s Daughter Engaged to Fellow Actor January 6, 2017 Lamar Odom Considering Reality TV Comeback, Watch Video Of Brawl At Ricky Harris’ Funeral January 6, 2017 Serial Killer Charles Manson No Model Prisoner During Decades in Jail January 6, 2017 Ciara Drops $15M Defamation Lawsuit Against Ex Future January 6, 2017 Jeanette J.

But before you get ready to munch on those prepackaged, fresh-cut veggies, you'll want to read this first. Country Fresh, Inc., just recalled 30,000 of its precut packaged vegetables due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination.  A variety of these products can be purchased at several stores such as Walmart, Publix, Winn Dixie, Harris Teeter Supermarkets, and BI-LO. Shoppers in the Southeast should be on the lookout because the products were distributed across several southern states including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  According to the US Food and Drug Administration, customers should be wary of Country Fresh items that have the "best if used by" dates that range between August 7, 2016 to August 19, 2016, as they may be affected. These items in question are also packaged in either clear containers or Styrofoam trays wrapped in plastic. A list of the recalled items and the store in which they are sold can be found here.  More from CafeMom: 6 Foods This Expert on Food Poisoning Will Never Ever Eat (PHOTOS) Fortunately, there have been no reported illnesses in relation to the recalled vegetables.  The director of food safety for the Conroe, Texas–based company, Max Payen, explained in a news release: "We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available."  The Georgia Department of Agriculture originally identified the contamination in a routine sample that tested positive for the bacteria. More from CafeMom: Major Hot Dog Recall Underway: Here's What You Need to Know Right Now Listeria causes short-term symptons for healthy people, but can cause serious infections in children, elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems. Infection can even cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women. If you have purchased any of the possibly contaminated items, please return the items to the store for a full refund. Customers can also reach out to Country Fresh about any questions via phone at 281-453-3305, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CT.    Image via StudioSmile/Shutterstock Read More recalls, food safety, kitchen safety Share this Story Share Tweet Pin comments Related Articles Politics & Views Ivanka Trump's New $5.5 Million DC Mansion Is Seriously No Joke Good News 14 Ways 2017 Might Actually Be Looking Up Get the latest from The Stir directly to your inbox Subscribe Please enter a valid email address.

Posted 7:53 pm, August 29, 2016, by cjoellison, Updated at 10:45AM, August 30, 2016 Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Please enable Javascript to watch this video VAN BUREN (KFSM) -- The wet versus dry issue is heating up in Johnson and Crawford Counties. Large companies like Walmart have pumped thousands of dollars into an initiative called Keep Dollars In Crawford County and canvassers have spent months securing signatures from voters in hopes of having enough to put the issue before voters in November. The initiative would let voters decide if alcohol sales should be allowed within the county. There are opposing groups that have put up signs asking voters to not allow the issue to make the ballot. According to the Crawford County clerk, more than 90,000 signatures were turned in earlier this month to be counted.  A little more than 9,000 were verified to be usable in the count and approximately 3,000 verified signatures are still needed for the initiative to make the ballot. The clerk's office will have until 5 p.m. tomorrow (Aug. 30) to decide whether enough signatures were collected. "Whatever is certified to us at that point in time will go on the ballot. If we do not have the certification from the county clerk at that time then it will not go on the ballot," said Crawford County Election Commissioner Bill Coleman. Sources said the clerk's office could see a potential lawsuit filed against it alleging some collected signatures should be counted. The clerk said some signatures were not counted because the person or persons collecting the signatures weren't certified to do so by state law. In Johnson County, the clerk there is being sued by the group Stand Strong, Stay Dry, Be Safe. The lawsuit alleges the clerk did not certify paperwork according to state law and some canvassers were also not verified correctly. According to Johnson County clerk's office personnel, whether or not the issue will make the November ballot will be decided by a circuit court judge Wednesday.

The store was evacuated Sunday in Millbrook, 10 miles north of Montgomery, after customers complained of irritated eyes and breathing problems. WSFA-TV reported that authorities initially blamed a piece of rotting produce for the problems. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Leslee Wright said Monday that employees later found an empty can of pepper spray under a merchandise display and suspect that caused customers' reactions. Wright credited store managers for taking the situation seriously and says the company is thankful no one was seriously hurt. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

(WDRB) -- The future of a Wal-Mart in the California neighborhood is still on hold. Right now, a lawsuit and several plaintiffs are blocking the store from being built on West Broadway. The plaintiffs have a problem with the proposed design of the store. However, but people on the other side say neither the lawsuit nor plaintiffs are legitimate. "We could really use a Walmart over here," said Patricia Walton, who lives in the California neighborhood. Walton live in California Square and said the proposed Walmart at 18th and Broadway would make her life a lot easier because she has limited transportation. Walton explained, "As far as going shopping, I have to wait on my grandchild and my daughter and they live way out and they got their own lives." "This is a project that is desperately needed in the California community," said Rev. Clay Calloway, who supports Wal-Mart. Rev. Calloway has advocated for the project from day one and has a petition with signatures of more than 5000 neighbors who support the proposed Walmart and bombard him with questions. He said, "They don't need to be asking me, they need to be asking the individuals on this list. Ask them -- they're the reason it's not here." Right now, the project is in the hands of the Kentucky court of appeals. Last year, the lawsuit was filed on behalf of the several people and organizations protesting the design of the store. "If you look at Kentucky Fried Chicken and Family Dollar and all the others, they have their buildings up on the street and the parking on the back," said Louisville attorney Stephen Porter, who represents the plaintiffs. Porter said the goal is not to block the store but to make sure the design is in compliance, like everyone else. Porter said, "Walmart comes in and has a building in the back and parking in the front and they say, 'oh, gee, oh, it's Walmart." Rev. Calloway's response to that? "Well, that's malarkey, that's some bunk, that is some mess." We asked Calloway, why the plaintiffs don't have as much say as the people who signed the petition. He responded, Well, because, first of all, they don't live in this neighborhood." Rev. Calloway also said, there is only one design the people on the lawsuit should be worried about. "What you see is urban design, which is neglect and desolation, that's urban design.." The Kentucky Court of Appeals could make a decision any day. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart is hiring but for a new store on the Outer Loop. For information on applying for one of those jobs, just click on the button. Copyright 2016 by WDRB News. All rights reserved.

Sherrie Neptune, who represents Ward 3 on of the Danbury Democratic Town Committee, claims in the lawsuit that she was examining some sales items on Halloween three years ago when she was struck by the cart. William Burke, an attorney from Fairfield who is presenting Neptune, said his client was bending over to examine the ingredients in a product on the lower shelf when the cart struck her several times. “She obviously didn’t expect to be hit by a shopping cart at the time,” Burke said. “She continues to suffer from the incident including headaches and back pain.” According to the lawsuit, Neptune has suffered lower back pain, headaches, neck pain, leg pain and bulges in two lower spinal discs. Neptune, a past president of the Greater Danbury NAACP chapter, was required to undergo surgery and has ongoing costs associated with the injuries, the lawsuit states. In its answer to the complain, an attorney for Wal-Mart refuted the allegations and denied that there was any negligence by the company or its employee. The lawsuit is seeking damages in excess of $15,000. dperrefort@newstimes.com; Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Reusable Toaster Sandwich Bag for free + free shipping That Daily DealPosted 14 hr 17 min ago SHOP NOW Ashford New Year's Clearance Sale: Up to 87% off + 20% off +...

Clayton Allen Slominski was charged with invasion of privacy, a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. He was arrested Friday in Schofield, the Marathon County Sheriff's Department said.  The so-called upskirting incident occurred June 26 at the Wal-Mart in Rib Mountain, the complaint said. The victim's stepdaughter saw the man take pictures as her stepmother bent over looking at merchandise, leading to the investigation, the complaint said. Newsline 9 featured the case in a Crime Stoppers report, using pictures of the suspect captured on Wal-Mart security cameras. After Crime Stoppers aired, police received three tips, helping identify Slominski and leading to his arrest, the complaint said. The surveillance video suggested Slominski "appeared to be trolling the store," the complaint said. Investigators interviewed Slominski about a month after the Wal-Mart incident and he admitted to the upskirting at the store, the complaint said. "Yup, it was me," he told investigators. "I am not going to sit here and lie to you about it." Slominski said he "pleasures himself and gets rid of the pictures," the complaint said. Slominski, who is married, said he did upskirting three or four times, probably on different dates, calling it something "he saw and tried," the complaint said. He told investigators he only took pictures up dresses of adult women, never children. A judge ordered Slominski jailed on a $5,000 signature bond, providing he put up $1,000 in cash, online court records said. He was also ordered to have no contact with Wal-Mart.  Most Watched VideosMost Watched VideosMore>> No injuries in Wausau house fire No injuries in Wausau house fire Rib Mountain neighborhood concerned with Lake Wausau racers Rib Mountain neighborhood concerned with Lake Wausau racers Walker works with task force to fight opioid and heroin abuse in Wisconsin Walker works with task force to fight opioid and heroin abuse in Wisconsin Community reacts to armed robbery in Schofield Community reacts to armed robbery in Schofield An armed robbery in Schofield Sunday night has left the community in disbelief.

On Oct. 28, 2015, Lindsy Ann Floyd, 31, of Salt Lake City, hit George Kassavetis, 71, who had just left Wal-Mart, 350 W. Hope Ave., and was pushing a shopping cart. Kassavetis hit his head on the pavement and died several days later on Nov. 3 at a local hospital due to his injuries. Blood was drawn from Floyd to be tested. Her blood-alcohol content was 0.18, more than twice the legal limit, according to charging documents. Floyd pleaded guilty in July to automobile homicide while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a third-degree felony. On Friday, she was sentenced to up to five years at the Utah State Prison and ordered to pay more than $5,700 in restitution.

Learn more Never miss a story from GET PUT POST Get updatesGet updates Gordon WintrobBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Aug 29, 2016 The Zinc API and pivoting before demo day Welcome to GET PUT POST, a newsletter all about APIs. Each edition features an interview with a startup about their API and ideas for developers to build on their platform. Want the latest interviews in your inbox? This edition, I spoke with Max Kolysh from Zinc. Zinc’s API lets you buy anything from major online retailers like Amazon and Walmart with a single POST request. We were housemates during the winter ’14 batch of Y Combinator and Max shares the inside scoop on how they found growth before demo day. Enjoy! What is Zinc? Zinc is an API that lets you make a purchase from any retailer on the internet. Retailers sometimes have APIs for getting product information and prices, but they rarely let you actually place an order. We saw the opportunity here and created an API to work across different retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, NewEgg, and many fashion retailers. This lets developers create new shopping experiences via apps, websites, their own stores, or something completely new. Instead of holding inventory themselves, sellers can use the product catalog of the entire internet. They can treat all of Amazon or all of Walmart as inventory and build the best discovery experience and the best shopping experience. They can find a clever way to drive traffic to their particular store and not deal with all the hassles of inventory like sourcing and shipping. We allow developers to build an e-commerce store within hours that’s already fully stocked with a ton of inventory. How many retailers are you integrated with? How much volume is the API driving? We support about ten retailers where you can make a purchase using the API. We are working on building more as soon as a customer requires it. The Zinc API processes over 5,000 orders per day. How do people use Zinc? A lot of people are cross-listing inventory across different retailers or marketplaces. They’re doing arbitrage between different marketplaces and the biggest opportunity right now is between Amazon and eBay. A few of the retailers supported by Zinc For example, someone will go on eBay and see a book for $30 and they’ll go check Amazon where that same book is on sale for $20. They’ll list the book on eBay for $29 dollars and source it from Amazon when someone makes a purchase. A lot of our customers are using our APIs to automate that process. We also have APIs that let arbitrage sellers regularly check the price of Amazon to make sure that their profit margin is going to be large enough and that items are still in stock. When something sells on eBay, we automatically fulfill it and ship it right to the consumer. Source: The Truth About Amazon to eBay Arbitrage There are lots of consumer-facing, price-saving extensions like Honey and camelcamelcamel that help find the best price on the internet, but only a small minority of consumers uses these. A tiny fraction of a percent. What’s cool about our software is that it actually lets the sellers do this same exact thing for the other 99%+ of buyers, regardless of whether those buyers are comparison shopping or not. Sellers are keen to do this because they already have the store infrastructure and we provide the APIs to plug into any retailer. Source: Chrome Store We also support sellers who arbitrage products between different countries. We have a lot of sellers and marketplaces internationally in Egypt, Dominican Republic, China, Oman, and a bunch of other countries that might not have direct access to certain retailers. Sometimes, buyers in those countries can access American retailers, but don’t have an American credit card. Sellers use our APIs to take inventory from Amazon or Walmart and make it available in these countries. They’ll handle the localization and international payment methods. When an item sells, they’ll use our software to ship it directly to the consumer or they’ll use a US freight forwarder. For another edition on international payments, check out this interview with Stripe: A look inside Stripe’s API platform We want every single developer and entrepreneur to have access to the tools they need to build a global online business…getputpost.co We enable people in different countries to have the same access to products that we do in the US. It’s easy to take it for granted, but if buying something online in Egypt is a lot more challenging than it is here. We’re doing something to fix that. I know you have some products that are built on top of the API. Tell me more. E-commerce is a generally unsexy industry. If you look at all the software for sellers, it’s just not that great. Some people will use spreadsheets to track all their items, update what sold on which marketplace, etc. We saw this as a huge opportunity to automate a lot of those headaches away so the sellers can focus on the things that they do best like customer support. It’s really nice to build good software in a land where not a lot of it exists. First, PriceYak provides an interface for arbitrage among eBay, Amazon, and other retailers. That product allows any seller to instantly sign-up and list products from Amazon or Walmart onto their eBay or Shopify store. If you are a Shopify store owner getting started with e-commerce and don’t want to buy tons of inventory in wholesale, then you can start with cross-listing and start driving traffic to your store right away. Source: YouTube Recently, we added AliExpress as a source market. A ton of people in the US don’t even know what AliExpress is (one of the largest e-commerce sites in the world). PriceYak sellers can take any item from AliExpress and cross-list on their site, selling to an entirely different market. We also offer JoeLister, which is a product for Amazon sellers to get their inventory out to other marketplaces. If you think of PriceYak as allowing anybody to list Amazon items on eBay, JoeLister allows an Amazon seller to list his or her own items on eBay. Source: YouTube Sometimes we would get comments from Amazon sellers asking why their items were being sold on eBay and we would explain that this is a missed opportunity for more customers. We would tell them: “Someone else is selling your items on eBay for you. If you want to keep the extra margin, you can list those products yourself.” We have over 500 PriceYak sellers, primarily on eBay. With JoeLister, we have about 3,000 Amazon sellers. Those are the two biggest SaaS products that use our underlying APIs. How did the company get started? Haha, the origin story is a long one and you’re familiar with parts of it. We started about 3 years ago. We first built a universal shopping cart for affiliate sites. We thought this would be the most important use-case for an automatic purchasing API. Large publishers create content with affiliate links to retailers’ sites. We let the publishers create a shopping cart on their blog or website that customers could use for products from Nordstrom, Macy’s, etc. and make the purchase all in one click. The blogger keeps the user on their website and they make the affiliate commission for their sales. Halfway through YC, we didn’t close on these two large deals that we were pursuing. We thought it could take months or years to make enough progress and we needed some growth before demo day. Source: Fast Company on YC W14 So, we pivoted to a consumer browser extension called Zinc Save to help people save money when shopping online. It was this funny idea where we would add a button to pay a lower price right when someone was checking out on Amazon. The button sent that person to our site and we would figure out how to source their shopping cart for less. We provided savings on every single purchase that came through our system. We would give you 5–15% off pretty much any purchase, even though often times we couldn’t find the savings ourselves. We would lose money on a lot of these purchases, mostly small amounts. Then, on a few purchases, we found crazy opportunities to source the same product for cheaper. On big purchases (e.g. for computers or monitors), we would find deals on other sites to make up for our losses. We eventually got a cease and desist letter from Amazon and had to shut the extension down. Luckily, this was a few weeks after demo day and we were able to raise a seed round. On top of that, we had good user growth, but we were about net zero on profitability. So, we shut Zinc Save down. For the next few months, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do next. My co-founder Doug used to do Amazon-eBay arbitrage in high school and college. This is the reason why we originally built the Zinc API. We knew there were people still doing it and making good money (former competitors). We figured we should try marketing this API and building a small software product around it. That’s how PriceYak was born. We actually didn’t think of that as a primary product for us at all, until we had a few customers who were making several thousand dollars a month in revenue. Even then, we contracted out the development work because we didn’t think that was going to be a huge opportunity. It just kept growing and growing until we realized that’s where we should focus. After over a year trying to market the API for different applications, it turned out the best market was the people who wanted it for its original purpose. Zinc’s Founding Team: John Wang, Doug Feigelson, and Max Kolysh We still continued to pursue various API deals. For example, the Ohio State Lottery uses our API for their award prizes. We have a bunch of different customers in that reward fulfillment space. We are unusual for a start-up in that we had multiple products early-on that had revenue growth. We couldn’t justify shutting one down. We now have three main products: PriceYak, JoeLister, and the API. How do you decide what to expose through the API vs. building a separate service on top of it? That’s a good question. As soon as we see a large enough niche for something on top of the API, we might try to wrap that into its own separate product. Source (no idea what’s going on here :) For example, there were a lot of non-technical users who wanted to do some basic automatic ordering. They weren’t familiar with how to use an API or didn’t have the time to write the integration. Once we heard from enough people, we built a simple file exchange program to email in a spreadsheet of orders. We run all those orders through our API and then we email back the results. I think that’s a good example of the 80/20 principle where the API, for a lot of use cases, is 80% of the way to being a finished product. Sometimes there is something on top that you need to make it much more accessible. That was the case with PriceYak and with the file exchange. We would love for other people to build things with our API as well. Some hobbyists have built pretty interesting projects. For example, when the Amazon dash button came out, we got an influx of support emails asking how to create a DIY dash button. I want a button in my fridge, maybe using a Raspberry Pi, that lets me buy a new gallon of milk. One developer built a site that lets you pay him $50 a month and he will just order you random things from Amazon. What else would you like people to build on Zinc? The whole internet of things is something that we’ve been excited about. Nobody’s really tapped into that, but I think in the next 2–5 years there is going to be a big push for not having to order anything yourself. When your fridge runs out of groceries, it’ll know what to buy. When your light bulb’s almost out, it’ll reorder a new one. That’s something that you can do with our API. Like I said, there is this 20% on top that you need to build, which is sometimes the hardware or some GUI. Source: Engadget We do hack trips with the team occasionally to come up with new ideas. We just did one in Portland. One cool idea is a gifting app we’ve been thinking about. I want to get gifts for my friends and I want it to be semi-automated. A week before their birthdays, I want to get an email saying, “Hey, your best friend’s birthday is coming up. Here are some gifts that we thought would be cool.” and I can just click a button to send one to them. Source: Magic I can imagine more personal assistant apps like Magic, Fetch, and Operator (some of those are actually our customers). I think that’s a good interface to be able to order anything. In those situations, you are converting natural language to some sort of structure. Before, they used to have humans place those orders manually, but a lot of it can be automated away. We’ve built our own internal tool that would let you send a search query over SMS and immediately place an order. What’s your stack? We built our web apps in Meteor, so we have a lot of Meteor and Node.js and some Flask for anything consumer-facing. Then, in the back end, we do crawling with PhantomJS. We have a lot of Selenium jobs as well through Python. Source: PhantomJS Where do you see the market heading? We are in the middle of a trend of all manufacturing moving to China, but there are lots of new platforms to discover and buy products around the world. There’s a many-to-many relationship between the places where products are being manufactured and a ton of different outlets where products are being discovered. There are so many opportunities to improve the product discovery process. Amazon, for example, is great for fulfillment, but not the best for discovery. Very few people go there to find trendy, new jeans. If you think about this many-to-many relationship between manufacturers and the apps and websites to purchase products, there needs to be something that connects them. We’re building the platform for those e-commerce connections. Source: Discount-shopping app Wish gets a premium $50M investment We’re breaking down information asymmetry. If you figure out that a lot of people are discovering t-shirts through a new app and you want to access that same inventory, you shouldn’t have to buy a bunch of shirts and keep them in a warehouse. These arbitrage opportunities exist because of information asymmetry. There’s no one way to figure out the best price for a particular item from a particular manufacturer. Before something arrives at your door, there are a bunch of suppliers and wholesalers and drop-shippers as middlemen. Each person increases the price. We think that increasing the transparency drives down the price and increases the selection for consumers. Source: Wall Street Journal Amazon sees the same problem. They’re trying to decrease shipping times from China by building their own ship fleet, because they’re trying to cut as many intermediaries as possible. We’re building infrastructure to streamline the supply chain for any seller. If you like the post, please give it a 💚 below: Want more API interviews in your inbox?

The recalled products were reportedly not sent to any Texas stores, however. The Food and Drug Administration announced the recall on Friday for the products, which have "Best If Used By" dates between Aug. 7 to Aug. 19. The recall affects vegetable products wrapped in clear plastic under the Country Fresh label or store-branded label and shipped to Walmart, Harris Teeter, Winn Dixie, Publix, QuikTrip, Bi-Lo, Fresh Point and The Spinx Company stores in nine states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia). A listeria-contaminated product was found at a store in Georgia by the state's agriculture department. Products affected by the recall, according to the FDA release, include diced peppers, diced onions, stir fry vegetables, grilling vegetables and stuffed mushrooms. No illnesses caused by the products have been reported, the FDA says. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria spread through eating contaminated food and can cause causing serious infection and even death in children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. Consumers who have purchased any of the products can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

(WMT) Rally Is Out of Gas Get ready to sell short-term positions in Walmart stock, and even consider going short WMT By Serge Berger, Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader  |  Aug 29, 2016, 8:16 am EST     Popular Posts: Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Is a Must-Watch in 2017 Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is on the Comeback Trail 5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017 Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is on the Comeback Trail SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY): This Is Your Next Upside Target Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Stock Is Defying the Bears! View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is higher by about 16% year-to-date. But that progress actually includes a 5.5% pullback in Walmart stock over the past couple of weeks. I wouldn’t make a big deal about it, except this stumble has occurred at a bigger-picture resistance level. My advice: Watch WMT stock carefully in the coming weeks, because this pullback could turn into something meaningful and ugly. Walmart bears are quick to point out that increased pricing pressure in the retail space (a good portion of which is on Walmart’s shoulders), as well as competition from e-tail giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Bulls still like the defensive nature of Walmart stock. Specifically, consumers tend to shop more at WMT during economically challenged times. Me? I respect both dynamics at work. But investing and trading are exercises in risk management. So when price action makes a meaningful move at a meaningful cross-section, I take notice. So, before we look at the below charts, remember: Some stocks are better watched on weekly charts than daily charts. WMT is one of those stocks; it gives better signals on its weekly charts. Walmart Stock Charts On the weekly multiyear chart, we see that the sharp rally off the November 2015 lows two weeks ago pushed WMT stock back into an area of former technical support in the low to mid-$70s. This horizontal area now also lines up with Walmart’s 100- and 200-day simple moving averages to form a sort of confluence technical resistance zone. Walmart stock promptly rejected this area two weeks ago, falling more than 5%. 7 Companies That Could Go Bankrupt Soon From a candlestick perspective, Walmart showed exhaustion buying two weeks ago. On a weekly closing basis, that resulted in shares ending lower. Then, last week, WMT shares showed follow-through selling, which technically confirmed an intermediate-term top in the stock. For now. Click to Enlarge On the daily chart, we see that the last two weeks of selling pressure have since pushed Walmart stock down to its blue 100-day simple moving average. This might act as support in the near-term, but for now, just consider it a reference point. A break below this MA on at least a daily closing basis could force WMT to mean-revert even lower toward its red 200-day moving average, which currently resides around $67. Click to Enlarge If you want to take a stab on the short side of Walmart stock, feel empowered. I would suggest buying cheap puts or put spreads on WMT, as implied volatility still is low in both absolute and relative terms. Like what you see?

Pre-Cut Veggies Sold In Walmart, Publix, 6 Other Stores, Recalled Over Listeria Concerns Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Pre-Cut Veggies Sold In Walmart, Publix, 6 Other Stores, Recalled Over Listeria Concerns August 29, 2016 9:28 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler don't eat that winn dixie publix walmart recall vegetables pre-cut vegetables listeria food and drug administration Picking up a package of pre-cut, pre-washed fresh vegetables at the grocery store can make preparing dinner (lunch or breakfast) a bit easier. Unless, of course, you could get sick from those convenient vegetables. Walmart, Publix, and six other retailers have recalled packages of pre-cut veggies over listeria contamination concerns.  Texas-based Country Fresh LLC announced over the weekend that it would recall 30,000 cases of fresh-cut vegetable products after finding the potential for a listeria contamination. According to a notice posted with the Food and Drug Administration, the 45 varieties of veggies were shipped to retailers Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia under the Country Fresh and store brand labels. Retailers who received the products include Walmart, Publix, Winn Dixie, Harris Teeter, Quik Trip, BI-LO, Fresh Point, and Spinx Company. The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, Country Fresh reports. The test revealed that the finished product tested positive for the bacteria. Since then, the company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the FDA and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem. The recalled product, packaged in clear plastic containers or in Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film, can be identified by the “Best If Used By” dates between August 7, 2016 through August 19, 2016. Country Fresh says it is unaware of any confirmed illnesses related to the recall.

Nearly 300 executives will attend, and keynote speakers include executives from Samsung, Medtronic, HumanaVitality, and Walmart. Registration is open, and media are invited to register for a press pass. "The adoption of connected healthcare devices has increased 40% in the last two years," said Harry Wang, Senior Research Director, Parks Associates. "We are at a pivotal time in understanding this evolving market as businesses work to involve consumers in managing their health -- whether it's through wearables and smart watch apps, connected blood pressure monitors, personalized health coaching services, or new IoT platforms in the smart home that could adapt health-focused use cases." Parks Associates has studied the digital health sector since 2006, analyzing the development of this market and the implications for multiple connected home industries. The connected health market has seen continued innovations in devices, apps, and services as well as the emergence of successful strategies to increase consumer satisfaction, enhance care quality, and reduce costs. At the forefront of the industry's growth is the continued expansion of the connected home concept and the consumer-based Internet of Things (IoT), which is growing the "opportunity footprint" for health solutions. "There is an ongoing shift in healthcare from a fee-for-service to a pay-for-performance model, and customers of connected health solutions and services are picking their winning vendors and partners for long-term commitments," said Jennifer Kent, Director, Research Quality & Product Development, Parks Associates. "Now more than ever, sharing best practices and success stories is critical for the progression of the connected health industry." "We are in the sickcare age and not healthcare age.

Officials with Metro Nashville Police said they believe the incident may have happened under a bridge between a Walmart and a laundromat on Nolensville Pike. The victim told officers that he was stabbed in his side during an attempted robbery. From there, he reportedly walked to the store and asked employees for help. Police said they could be looking for a suspect who was described by the victim as a white man with a ponytail. The suspect may have been driving a silver or grey Ford Mustang. The victim told officers the suspect approached him, demanded his belongings and then stabbed him when he said he didn't have anything. According to police, the victim was a bit incoherent due to the pain so they'll follow up with him at the hospital.  Investigators were working to review surveillance footage from the store.  Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Everybody Is Fearful' By Nicholas Ibekwe The trip to Ely, Minnesota, was my first encounter with rural America. To be honest, I hadn't had much of an encounter with America itself. I had only arrived the country the first time just over a week ago. And my encounter had been mostly limited to the pleasantly choreographed tours around the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis by the wonderful organisers of the World Press Institute (WPI) fellowship. I had only gone out once on my own to a nearby Walmart to buy groceries. The trip to Ely was also particularly interesting to me because I was earnestly looking forward to seeing what life in rural America looked like, having spent some part of my teenage years in a rural community in Lagos. I like making comparisons. I have come to believe that most big cities around the world are essentially alike - a core, made of huge concrete edifices, mostly fenced by affluent suburbs, with a mix of undesirable slums pushed further away or hidden from view like piles of used dishes after a feast. So, Lagos minus 17 million people, the chaotic rush hour traffic, and Keke Napep (tricycle popularly called tuk-tuk in some parts of the world) would not be much different from the Twin Cities. I had not spent time in rural communities in any other countries I had visited before so I was eager to see how rural America compared to rural Nigeria. There was not much comparison to be made. Rural America was not the neglected poverty-stricken, hopeless settlements that rural Nigeria is. One could move back and forth from urban America to rural America without the degraded standard of living that such a movement in Nigeria would have automatically elicited. I tried to imagine how things would have been different if politicians back home could be made to see the benefits of developing their rural communities but the picture of Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, commissioning a hand pumped borehole early this year kept popping up in my mind. I had no intention of getting depressed so turned and mimicked Marina, the fellow from Bulgaria and Natalia, from Ukraine, who were speaking Russian inside our van. The ensuing laughter was therapeutic. Ely was a beautiful town of 3,500 people sheltered by forests of tall pines and several lakes. Ely was old money. You know this as soon as you drive into the town. Its picturesque setting provides the perfect summer getaway for wealthy Minnesotans, who own beautiful lakeside cabins inside the woods. I didn't have to wait long before I found out the source of the old money - mining. A resident, Hans Olsen, 73, told me that buried under the pines of Ely is huge deposits of copper, nickel and 20 other minerals. John Seliga, inside the old Pioneer Mine, Ely Minnesota. "At its peak, two-third of all the iron ore in the United States came from Ely," he said. The Pioneer Mine, which opened in 1888 was forced to close in 1967 due to the introduction of new steel-making technology where oxygen was directly shot into the steel via ceramic lances thereby ending the demand in the richly oxygenated ore found in Ely. However, by the time it closed the mine had shipped 41,112,587 tons of iron ore. In 2015, many inhabitants were filled with hope of the return of the town's heydays after Twin Metals LLC, owned by Chilean mining conglomerate, Antofagasta Plc, announced it was considering revisiting an underground mine near the Birch Lake, southeast of Ely, where large deposits of copper and nickel were found. The announcement caused a crack in the relationship between local Ely politicians and residents, who wanted the mines back and state politicians and environmentalists, who feared that the return of sulphide mining in the area might destroy the forest and contaminate the pristine lakes in the area. John Seliga, who worked at the Pioneer Mine from 1957 to 1966, six months before the mine was closed, said the concerns about the resumption of mining in the area were unfounded. He added that if anything at all there are now technologies to stop any environmental hazards that may result from mining in the area. "The mining company (Oliver Mining Company, a division of US Steel) allowed you to go to college. As long as they do it right there shouldn't be any problem," he said, his voice overflowing with nostalgia. Similarly, Seraphine Rolando, picker/historian, who conducted the WPI fellows on a tour of the Pioneer Mine, said the state of Minnesota maintained the highest environmental standards you can find anywhere. He doesn't see the reason why the anti-mining people are worried. "At this stage, the mining company is only testing to see what can be found. But it would eventually happen because there is a lot of jobs to be created. Job creation and the prosperity of the town was also high on the mind of Anne Swenson. "The three biggest industry in the town are mining, logging, and tourism. How much do loggers make? Maybe $9,000. You'd be lucky if you made $9,000 from working in tourism but studies have shown that miner could make up to $60,000 to $70,000 a year," she said. Ms Swenson was probably referring to a 2009 study by the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The study revealed the enormous impact of the return of mining in northern Minnesota. The Study, "The Economic Impact of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Mining Study on the State of Minnesota" found that Iron mining helped contribute $3.1 billion to the state's economy in 2007 and helped support more than 10,000 jobs. Iron mining paid $148 million in state and local taxes in 2008, based on 2007 production levels. Of that amount, $46 million was used to supported local schools, $11 million supported the University of Minnesota and what was left was spent on mining communities. The study also showed that mining was the single largest contributor to the region's economy. It was responsible for 23 percent of the gross regional product in 2001; in 2007, mining was responsible for 34 percent of the gross regional product. As she drove me back to her lovely cabin on Eagle Nest Lake, Cynthia Stokes, 83, said she believed that the numbers of pro-mining people of Ely are exaggerated. "Usually, the company goes away after five or six years. It could create negligible jobs and pollution will stay for a long time," she said. However, she added that she somehow understands the need to kick-start the economy of Ely and as someone who only spend the summer in the town she doesn't think she qualifies to tell the people what they want. Lessons for Nigeria I think Nigeria has a lot to learn from the arguments for and against mining in Ely. As the federal government moves towards the exploration of solid minerals as an alternative means of revenue in the face of cascading oil prices, I believe some of the arguments going on in Ely should be replicated back home. But unfortunately, I do not see any of those. The government seems to have made up its mind and unlike in Ely are forcing its decision down the throats of the communities where these mining are expected to take place. All I have read is about how much the government stands to make. Very little, if any, attention is being paid to the impact mining would have on the environment and on the lives of the people in mining communities. This is most unfortunate because it seems we have not learned from the havoc wrecked by oil exploration to the rich creeks of the Niger Delta. Neither have we learned anything from widespread deaths due to lead poisoning in Niger and Zamfara States. In Ely, the people are part of the debate. Even those in support of mining are insisting on the highest safety standard. To avoid the debacle that the Niger Delta has since become, the Nigerian government should copy this model.

To be honest, I hadn’t had much of an encounter with America itself. I had only arrived the country the first time just over a week ago. And my encounter had been mostly limited to the pleasantly choreographed tours around the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis by the wonderful organisers of the World Press Institute (WPI) fellowship. I had only gone out once on my own to a nearby Walmart to buy groceries. The trip to Ely was also particularly interesting to me because I was earnestly looking forward to seeing what life in rural America looked like, having spent some part of my teenage years in a rural community in Lagos. I like making comparisons. I have come to believe that most big cities around the world are essentially alike – a core, made of huge concrete edifices, mostly fenced by affluent suburbs, with a mix of undesirable slums pushed further away or hidden from view like piles of used dishes after a feast. So, Lagos minus 17 million people, the chaotic rush hour traffic, and Keke Napep (tricycle popularly called tuk-tuk in some parts of the world) would not be much different from the Twin Cities. I had not spent time in rural communities in any other countries I had visited before so I was eager to see how rural America compared to rural Nigeria. There was not much comparison to be made. Rural America was not the neglected poverty-stricken, hopeless settlements that rural Nigeria is. One could move back and forth from urban America to rural America without the degraded standard of living that such a movement in Nigeria would have automatically elicited. I tried to imagine how things would have been different if politicians back home could be made to see the benefits of developing their rural communities but the picture of Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, commissioning a hand pumped borehole early this year kept popping up in my mind. I had no intention of getting depressed so turned and mimicked Marina, the fellow from Bulgaria and Natalia, from Ukraine, who were speaking Russian inside our van. The ensuing laughter was therapeutic. Ely was a beautiful town of 3,500 people sheltered by forests of tall pines and several lakes. Ely was old money. You know this as soon as you drive into the town. Its picturesque setting provides the perfect summer getaway for wealthy Minnesotans, who own beautiful lakeside cabins inside the woods. I didn’t have to wait long before I found out the source of the old money – mining. A resident, Hans Olsen, 73, told me that buried under the pines of Ely is huge deposits of copper, nickel and 20 other minerals. John Seliga, inside the old Pioneer Mine, Ely Minnesota. “At its peak, two-third of all the iron ore in the United States came from Ely,” he said. The Pioneer Mine, which opened in 1888 was forced to close in 1967 due to the introduction of new steel-making technology where oxygen was directly shot into the steel via ceramic lances thereby ending the demand in the richly oxygenated ore found in Ely. However, by the time it closed the mine had shipped 41,112,587 tons of iron ore. In 2015, many inhabitants were filled with hope of the return of the town’s heydays after Twin Metals LLC, owned by Chilean mining conglomerate, Antofagasta Plc, announced it was considering revisiting an underground mine near the Birch Lake, southeast of Ely, where large deposits of copper and nickel were found. The announcement caused a crack in the relationship between local Ely politicians and residents, who wanted the mines back and state politicians and environmentalists, who feared that the return of sulphide mining in the area might destroy the forest and contaminate the pristine lakes in the area. John Seliga, who worked at the Pioneer Mine from 1957 to 1966, six months before the mine was closed, said the concerns about the resumption of mining in the area were unfounded. He added that if anything at all there are now technologies to stop any environmental hazards that may result from mining in the area. “The mining company (Oliver Mining Company, a division of US Steel) allowed you to go to college. As long as they do it right there shouldn’t be any problem,” he said, his voice overflowing with nostalgia. Similarly, Seraphine Rolando, picker/historian, who conducted the WPI fellows on a tour of the Pioneer Mine, said the state of Minnesota maintained the highest environmental standards you can find anywhere. He doesn’t see the reason why the anti-mining people are worried. “At this stage, the mining company is only testing to see what can be found. But it would eventually happen because there is a lot of jobs to be created. Job creation and the prosperity of the town was also high on the mind of Anne Swenson. “The three biggest industry in the town are mining, logging, and tourism. How much do loggers make? Maybe $9,000. You’d be lucky if you made $9,000 from working in tourism but studies have shown that miner could make up to $60,000 to $70,000 a year,” she said. Ms Swenson was probably referring to a 2009 study by the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The study revealed the enormous impact of the return of mining in northern Minnesota. The Study, “The Economic Impact of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Mining Study on the State of Minnesota” found that Iron mining helped contribute $3.1 billion to the state’s economy in 2007 and helped support more than 10,000 jobs. Iron mining paid $148 million in state and local taxes in 2008, based on 2007 production levels. Of that amount, $46 million was used to supported local schools, $11 million supported the University of Minnesota and what was left was spent on mining communities. The study also showed that mining was the single largest contributor to the region’s economy. It was responsible for 23 percent of the gross regional product in 2001; in 2007, mining was responsible for 34 percent of the gross regional product. As she drove me back to her lovely cabin on Eagle Nest Lake, Cynthia Stokes, 83, said she believed that the numbers of pro-mining people of Ely  are exaggerated. “Usually, the company goes away after five or six years. It could create negligible jobs and pollution will stay for a long time,” she said. However, she added that she somehow understands the need to kick-start the economy of Ely and as someone who only spend the summer in the town she doesn’t think she qualifies to tell the people what they want. Lessons for Nigeria I think Nigeria has a lot to learn from the arguments for and against mining in Ely. As the federal government moves towards the exploration of solid minerals as an alternative means of revenue in the face of cascading oil prices, I believe some of the arguments going on in Ely should be replicated back home. But unfortunately, I do not see any of those. The government seems to have made up its mind and unlike in Ely are forcing its decision down the throats of the communities where these mining are expected to take place. All I have read is about how much the government stands to make. Very little, if any, attention is being paid to the impact mining would have on the environment and on the lives of the people in mining communities. This is most unfortunate because it seems we have not learned from the havoc wrecked by oil exploration to the rich creeks of the Niger Delta. Neither have we learned anything from widespread deaths due to lead poisoning in Niger and Zamfara States. In Ely, the people are part of the debate. Even those in support of mining are insisting on the highest safety standard. To avoid the debacle that the Niger Delta has since become, the Nigerian government should copy this model.

Are we all fine with that? by Leah Douglas Magazine Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email In the age of farm-to-table restaurants and the mainstreaming of organic foods, transparency has become an increasingly valuable commodity in food production. Nearly every day, more companies are committing to sourcing cage-free eggs, labeling genetically modified ingredients, and reducing antibiotic use in livestock production. One might take these changes as signs of a healthy, resilient food system. But in fact, these consumer-oriented nods to sustainability can reveal only so much about the opaque power structure that lurks behind the scenes of food production, distribution, and retail. Concentration and Power in the Food System: Who Controls What We Eat? by Philip H. Howard Bloomsbury Academic, 216 pp. With Concentration and Power in the Food System, Philip Howard, of Michigan State University, poses a simple question: Who controls what we eat? This question has animated Howard’s decade’s worth of research on the food system. Howard’s work investigates the corporate power web that forms the food industry’s structure, and helps us understand how and why we eat what we do. This slim book takes the reader through the history and importance of economic consolidation using a political economy lens. Howard seeks to demonstrate the negative effects of “fewer and fewer people [having] the power to make important decisions, such as what is produced, how it is produced, and who has access to these products.” In Howard’s analysis, a consolidated food landscape has negative effects on producers, consumers, and workers. Farmers have fewer and less-competitive markets in which to sell their hogs or corn. Shoppers consider thousands of goods at the grocery store, but many of them are produced by the same few food processors. And mega-retailers like Walmart set standards of low wages that are copied by competitors. The outcomes of these realities “tend to disproportionately affect the disadvantaged—such as women, young children, recent immigrants, members of minority ethnic groups, and those of lower socioeconomic status.” By looking at the interactions between regulation and corporations, Howard is able to more fully understand the political context in which consolidation has flourished. Other commentators on the food system, such as Marion Nestle, Michael Pollan, and Mark Bittman, have encouraged changes in consumer habits (such as “voting with your fork”) or to public health policies (such as taxing sodas) to address supply chain issues. But Howard focuses on the specific effects that deregulation and growth of corporate power have had on the food system. With this book, he demonstrates that some of the greatest woes of our food industry—the decreasing number of farms, subsidies that primarily benefit large-scale producers, lowering of farm income, poor access to healthy food in some regions—can be traced to lower enforcement of antitrust policy and the unchecked influence of corporations. Howard briefly discusses how, in prior decades, the U.S. more strongly monitored corporate power. Populist and progressive political movements effected antitrust regulation during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Such legislation included the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, and the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936. Those laws provided tools for regulators to break up existing trusts, thereby keeping markets open and competitive, and to limit concentration in other industries. Antitrust regulations were seen as crucial to protecting farmers and producers from exploitation by large corporate buyers, and to protecting suppliers and distributors from the monopoly power of monolithic retailers such as the A&P, the Walmart of its day. The greatest woes of our food industry can be traced to lax enforcement of antitrust policy and unchecked corporate influence. But by the 1970s, antitrust regulation had become unpopular with wealthy corporate executives, many of whom were politically connected and donated to the campaigns of anti-regulation candidates. The Reagan administration directed federal agencies to decrease enforcement of antitrust regulations and to raise the burden of proof on the potential harms caused by concentration. Concentration became a problem only when the consumer was directly and obviously harmed—stakes that Howard calls a “dramatic change from the intent of [antitrust] legislation” from earlier decades. As a result, mergers and acquisitions that would have been unthinkable in prior decades became commonplace. This trend of deregulation and low antitrust enforcement was as true in the food sector as in many others. Companies became larger and their control over supply chains more comprehensive. Today, we see the pork, beef, and chicken industries each dominated by four companies, the milk industry controlled by two, and the beer industry barreling toward just one monolithic parent. Those companies at the top of the industry wield outsize political power and influence, can dictate unfair terms to producers, and create a less resilient supply chain. Howard takes a wide-lens approach to looking at the effects of food system consolidation. He considers a chicken industry that is built on abusive and secretive contracts with farmers who have little say in how their birds are raised. He highlights how the top four grain companies—ADM, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus—are estimated to control up to 90 percent of the global grain trade. He discusses how the market share of just one milk company, Dean Foods, reaches 70 percent in most cities. And he examines the growing role and importance of venture capital in consolidating the power of individual corporations. Howard also extracts a few lesser-told stories from the annals of food industry concentration. One is in the relative niche of organic food distribution. The largest player in this sector is United Natural Foods, or UNFI, a Providence, Rhode Island–based company that is a primary supplier for Whole Foods and Safeway. In 2002, UNFI and its then competitor Tree of Life (which was bought by KeHE, another distributor, in 2010) controlled about 80 percent of organic food distribution. UNFI’s original competitors, many of whom were cooperatively owned, couldn’t keep up with its aggressive expansion, which was partially funded by Wall Street investors. Between 1982 and 2002, the number of cooperative distributors dropped from twenty-eight to three. Today, many natural and organic food retailers are sourced exclusively by UNFI. While not the most powerful entity in the food industry, UNFI has an “overwhelming dominance” in its supply chain. This power allows it to “make or break” organic food manufacturers, and creates higher barriers to entry to newcomers in the industry. Another lesser-known issue that Howard discusses is concentration in livestock genetics. The livestock genetics industry is fairly small, at about $4 billion a year in global annual sales, one-tenth the size of the pesticide industry. But it is also highly consolidated, which has resulted in a dramatic reduction in animal diversity. Most commercial chickens are one of just four breeds, and just two or three firms control 94 percent of sales. For turkeys, just one breed comprises 100 percent of the global supply. Most pork in the U.S. is Duroc, Hampshire, or Yorkshire, and more than 85 percent of milking cows are Holsteins. Livestock animals are increasingly bred for profitable characteristics, such as a chicken’s breast size or a cow’s milk production, rather than for traits such as resistance to disease. And demand for consistent products has encouraged producers to standardize their flocks. The resulting homogeneity makes livestock animal populations more vulnerable to disease outbreaks such as avian flu. And growing consolidation in genetics firms makes it hard for smaller companies to enter into the industry. In his concluding chapter, Howard does nod to some positive trends combatting monopolization in the food industry. For instance, craft beer has grown to comprise 14 percent of beer sales by revenue, and the two giants in the industry-Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller—have taken on relatively little market share in recent years. This lack of growth has prompted ABI to seek an acquisition of SABMiller. The deal got a green light from Justice Department regulators and awaits shareholder approval. Though Howard is a professor and Concentration and Power in the Food System contains many academic citations, the book avoids slipping into jargon. It’s accessible to any reader interested in learning how political economy can help us understand who really does control what we eat. And as the food industry continues to consolidate, Howard’s work will become increasingly vital to imagining an economy with open, competitive markets for farmers and eaters alike.

Done Editing Tags 95 Comments Share this article 101 101 101 Ducks and Llamas ham it for my phone camera on property owned by Internet pioneer Jeffrey Barringer of Kingsnake.com On a hot and humid morning last week, I drove through flat farmland way east of the more familiar Central Texas hill country and eventually found my way onto the working ranch of an old-school internet business pioneer. The purpose of the visit was to try and understand a serious dilemma he and thousands of other website owners are now facing. The site owner is Jeff Barringer, who started the forerunner of Kingsnake.com more than 20 years ago to serve people interested in various reptiles and assorted exotic animals. Back in the pre-internet late 80s and early 90s, there were communities of people with special interests, just like there are now. Parents of kids with rare disease, admirers of medieval plumbing—you name it. Snake and reptile collectors were one such assortment. But like other specialized cadres, they were geographically spread out, especially in the U.S. desert southwest, where reptile collecting was booming. Barringer was among the first to bring them together online. “At the peak I made as much as I used to make setting up computer networks in the 90s. So this isn’t something that made me rich,” he told me. “Just a living.” In a shed off to the side of the sprawling lot sit three millennium yellow Corvettes with various, instantly visible custom modifications. One sports a flat air-foiled stabilizer on its tail big enough for a Cessna. A fourth matching yellow ‘vette is said to be in the shop. A giant four-wheel drive pickup truck on a monstrous lift-kit stands tall in the gravel driveway, the obvious workhorse on this mini-ranch located about 50 miles northeast of Austin. “If certain trends continue, it could all fade into the sunset,” he continued. “Because of social media, like Facebook.”  What followed was an interesting lesson in how the Internet works and how it’s changing—arguably for the worse—for some people. Join us below and we’ll try and explain those virtual mechanics.  All I did,” Barringer explained at the start, "is digitize an existing reptile hobbyist network. It was already there in the real world, I just made a website as sort of an experiment and it got big, like instantly—not through any foresight on my part—but thinking back it almost seems like it exploded overnight. It was lucky timing, I started it in 1994.” Within a few years, he had turned the experiment into a business, at one time employing 12 paid staff and paying dozens of third-party contractors over the years. Just a single side business turned into a revenue source: Barringer had hundreds of small vendors wanting to sign up for classified and display advertising accounts, for everything from books about raising prey mice efficiently to exotic feed for exotic animals. His readers included some of the most famous wildlife naturalists in the world. The late Steve Irwin, aka the Crocodile Hunter, was one such icon that kept in touch, as did Mark O'Shea and others, many of whom participated in guest chats and other site events. And in a marketing guru’s dream, many readers regularly came to Kingsnake.com just to peruse the ads.  “People came to the site for many other reasons. For example, there was a lot of interest in regs. There are a lot of laws about owning reptiles, what’s legal in one state might not be legal in another. Catch the wrong turtle in the wrong state, and you could be looking at a huge fine.”  Now we’re strolling through the muddy center of the petite ranch surrounding a long one-story house, and the land is swarming with animals. It’s been raining all month. On one side llamas sit resting in thick, cropped grass, their legs tucked delicately below, while another one stands off, alone, watching our every move with those enormous, eerie black eyes that all large herbivores seem to own. Flocks of noisy geese, turkeys, and unusual-looking ducks colored like penguins ramble around at will, clucking their approval and disapproval at one another. It’s Texas, so there have to be a few goats and several magnificent horses patrolling the grounds. All the animals appear well-fed, well-groomed, and happy as clams. A highly prized scarlet king snake showing the distinctive coloration that often gets confused with the venomous coral snake. Barringer had hit on a mini gold mine, with the emphasis on mini. For more than a decade, there were no giant corporate competitors to Kingsnake.com. The same holds true for thousands of other boutique online communities that sprung up organically with the Internet boom of the mid 90s. The key indie niche was size: These communities might be global in reach, but they are so small in absolute numbers that they never attracted big biz with an insatiable thirst for growing earnings year over year. Until now. “Actually, until more like 2007 to 2008. That’s when Kingsnake.com peaked and I knew we had peaked. MySpace pointed the way, but Facebook started really getting big and soon after that, small communities began to grow out of that platform in a huge way. Facebook and sites like it are shifting the ... Internet foci, I guess you would call it, from those smaller site owners and writers and developers, like me, like we used to be, to FB groups on Facebook pages.” It’s a subtle point Barringer is making here, but one that has quietly snuck up on lots of small online businesses. For the non-Internet expert trying to understand it all, he compares it to the demise of small town America. “Think of Walmart, what can happen to a town when a big Walmart moves in? It can kill off main street, all the store owners, shoe makers, bakers, hardware stores, whatever, those functions all get relocated to the Walmart. Where the majority of employees don’t get paid much. Communities like mine provide a living wage to lots of people. “ Not only has Facebook drawn away community members and the business that goes with them for so many smaller sites, the social media titan feeds targeted advertisements aimed at that specialized audience and pockets the revenue. Veteran owners of indie sites serving tight-knit communities will point out, with some justification, that they cultivated and drove this premium traffic from their small site to their own Facebook pages in the first place. So, why shouldn’t the social media giant share any revenues generated by that traffic, especially since those same big media platforms are already hurting small site owners with the rise of groups and hobby pages? “You know, it’s one thing to deal with competitors who are trying to take your business. It’s another thing when a giant like Facebook doesn’t even set out to grab any of your business, they just sorta roll over it without really meaning to. How do you compete against that?” Walking through the ranch house, it’s pretty obvious this is a guy who likes to build things, especially gadgets. There are tools everywhere, big and small, on racks and in piles. There are carefully crafted model warplanes hanging down all over the ceiling in the home office, some with sophisticated ducted-fan jet engines and radio controlled flying surfaces, others assembled and hung purely as showpieces. I asked him if he’s tried competing with the big guys, and he assured me he’s tried everything he can think of for the past five years now—and nothing has worked. “Maybe someone smarter than me can figure out how to recapture that traffic,” he admits near the end of our visit. Barringer shrugs his shoulders and says there’s nothing illegal or unethical going on, but it’s hurting his revenue just the same, and probably doing the same thing to other indie site operators for the same reason: Falling site traffic due to group and hobby pages developed on social media networks, mostly Facebook. And there’s no telling how many people this might eventually affect. We’re talking about a vast, diverse array of boutique communities populating every indie niche, plus that portion of the technology feeding chain they collectively support. Many of these sites generate a living for the owner, and a good number directly employ additional staff. Indirectly, each site needs layouts and templates, hosting services, special coded scripts written and implemented, maintenance, plus authentication and other special server services just to name a few basic items. If they get big enough, they will undoubtedly need legal work done from time to time, and if business is being conducted right on the site with credit cards or PayPal, they need security. Those are some of the ripples spreading away from the unwanted social media splash, potentially taking thousands of jobs with them. As for Barringer, he’s already started a whole new, animal related business. “I’m going to produce duck eggs,” he said proudly, walking to the bird-proof gate to let me out. “Maybe some other stuff, too, all organic and free range. And of course I’m already starting to set up a site for it. It’s called Turtle Hill Farms.” As I stopped briefly at the gate to thank him on my way out, he handed me some fresh duck eggs to take home and shook his head in final, obvious regret. “I hope you tell people, it’s not even the loss of money that makes me the saddest. It’s the loss in the community. We have a good niche serving a great community of adventurous, really unique characters. I’ve become close friends with lots of them. And a big hunk of it is being absorbed, mindlessly, by social media giants that don’t even really care one way or the other about it, or about us.” 95 Comments Share this article 101 101 101 95 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Miserably. “We felt the tools and technology weren’t good enough for our use case,” said Bryan Leach, founder and CEO of the Denver-based shopping app. “You had to pinch and zoom. Customers weren’t getting an immediate notice on their reward. It was not seamless. We were unhappy.” Leach is much happier today because the company took a different route to encourage mobile-app users to buy online: through another app. In a week-long soft launch of the new program — which goes live Wednesday — a tiny portion of Ibotta’s 20 million users tried the new feature and wound up spending more than $1 million while using other apps, booking rooms on Hotels.com app, ordering beer from Drizly’s app and buying coupons with Groupon’s app. Ibotta integrated “deep linking” technology from New York’s Button to connect other apps to its own. Adding some custom technology, Ibotta’s app offers personal deals for users — and retailers, which can now change the rebate depending on the user.

Heck yeah, Fluid is from Denver! “On the web, everyone starts with Google. But in mobile, that’s not where commerce starts anymore,” Leach said. “Ibotta is positioning itself as the front door to all mobile commerce.” Ibotta’s app typically rebates cash based on a percentage of a user’s in-store purchase, like 25 cents for buying Bar-S Bologna at Walmart. To get the cash, Ibotta users must scan in a print receipt in the app and when they reach $20, Ibotta pays up. The new app-to-app feature is similar, but cash credit is automatic with payouts still coming in $20 increments. Some retailers credit accounts instantly while others, like Groupon, have a 45-day wait period. Ibotta’s approach could help turn app users into actual buyers, which is not common, said  Andrew Lipsman, vice president of marketing and insights for market researcher comScore, Inc.  In comScore’s first-quarter report on U.S. retail, it found that two-thirds of consumers use a mobile phone to browse on a retailer site but end up buying on a PC or tablet. Mobile commerce made up just 20 percent of the $83.5 billion spent digitally that quarter. “People are more likely to shop on mobile than buy on mobile,” Lipsman said, calling it the mobile-commerce gap. “Mobile has a lot more friction.” Friction includes security concerns, inability to see product details, difficulty of navigating between screens and slow or spotty connection speeds. “But we should see that gap narrow. People will get over security issues over time. Screen sizes are getting bigger and that’s helping dollars flow more quickly,” Lipsman said. But the other boon for the app economy is the promise that Ibotta’s app will encourage people to try new apps. On average, says comScore, mobile users have no more than three retail apps, with the top one being Amazon. Button CEO Mike Jaconi agreed that it may be a pain to download a new app, add a credit card number and remember to start using the app. But this isn’t about downloading a new app. It’s “the means to an end,” he said. “As an example, with Ibotta we are seeing an install rate north of 59 percent, while industry averages are in the order of 15 to 20 percent,” Jaconi said. “The beauty of Button’s marketplace is that after the install, a significant number of these new users end up purchasing and becoming repeat purchasers.” Current Ibotta rebates: Groupon: 5% Jet: 5% Boxed: 15% Hotels.com App: 5% Spring: 15% Drizly: 7.5% Door Dash: 10% Ticketmaster: 1% Handy: 10% delivery.com App: 10% Ibotta’s tech team helped build an ad-targeting-like feature known as Dynamic Segmentation. That means Ibotta users who frequently use Groupon, for example, may get a 5 percent cash rebate.  Through the soft launch, some users saw a 40 percent offer on Groupon. Now that the new feature is official, Ibotta said that current cash rebates are between 1 to 15 percent. For this first week, however, Ibotta shared that users who don’t have a Groupon app may also get the 40 percent offer. But a key point, Jaconi added, is that buying on an mobile app is much easier than buying on a mobile website. App users have already logged in and stored a credit card and a shipping address. “The reason mobile proved challenging for retailers was that checking out in mobile wasn’t easy — whether it was the slow loading and constant re-entry of credit card and address details,” Jaconi said. “Mobile web experiences were and, in many cases, still are terrible.” Updated Aug. 31, 2016 at 9:32 a.m. to mention the different cash-rebate percentages currently available on the new Ibotta feature, plus specifics about the 40 percent rebate on Groupon purchases.

The plans will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. FILE - In this March 15, 2012 file photo, Ben Gleitzman uses a traffic and navigation app called Waze as he drives to work in Menlo Park, Calif. Google is set to expand a San Francisco carpooling program that could morph into a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn't trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider's work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers' belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber's early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber's board because of potential conflicts with Google's ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond's departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to "continued cooperation and partnership" with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze's carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple's board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google's Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple's iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone's software to create Android. FILE- In this March 15, 2012, file photo, Ben Gleitzman waves his hand over a traffic and navigation app called Waze on his Apple iPhone in a Menlo Park, Calif., parking lot during a demonstration showing traffic conditions on the display. Google is set to expand a San Francisco carpooling program that could morph into a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home.

(WIAT) — Anniston police are searching for the person who shot at a passing car. The driver is OK, but he has a warning for drivers to be aware of their surroundings. Bailey Fendley says he was heading to Walmart down Highway 78 in between Anniston and Oxford. It was still daylight when a car heading the oppose way fired one shot as their cars were passing. He says he immediately pulled over to make sure he was OK. His windshield was riddled with what looks like bird shot from a shot gun. Nothing made it through the windshield, but Bailey says he’s really lucky because his window was open. Bailey said, “You never think it is going to happen to you. You hear about random acts of violence every day, but you never think it’s going to happen to you.” His mother says she posted a picture of the damage to Facebook to try and raise awareness and get the word out. The post has been shared more than 550 times. She says multiple people have reached out to her, “I’ve had a couple people message me and say they know people in Anniston, that the same things happened to them. So hopefully, it raises awareness.” Police are investigating. If you have any information, contact local authorities.

MUST CREDIT: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg. Google's carpooling service, which is being offered via Google's... Going head to head with Uber and Lyft, Google plans a fall introduction of a low-cost ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, according to the Wall Street Journal. Based on Google’s social-navigation app Waze, the service sounds closer to carpooling than on-demand taxi rides. It would connect Waze drivers with riders who are going in the same direction, with low fares so the drivers would not use it as a primary source of income, the Journal said. In a pilot Waze carpooling program taking place around Google’s Mountain View headquarters since May, rides averaged around 54 cents per mile. That’s the Internal Revenue Service mileage reimbursement rate to cover fuel, maintenance and other costs, and it is used by several carpooling apps as the payment from riders to drivers. By contrast, the UberX service is considerably more than 54 cents per mile. (UberPool, which matches unrelated riders going the same way, has cheaper rates, but they’re still much higher than 54 cents a mile.) Google’s pilot program involved 25,000 workers at large employers such as UCSF, Adobe and Walmart Global eCommerce, as well as Google itself. Waze announced today a new carpool service in San Francisco The new service is by invitation only "to a select group of employers and their employees in the Bay Area," Waze says But if it grows popular, it could put Google in direct competition with ride-hailing giants like Uber and Lyft the Waze Rider app simply matches users with a driver heading their same direction like a virtual version of a casual carpool Media: Wibbitz Any of Waze’s 700,000 Bay Area users could participate in Google’s program as either a driver or rider. Unlike Lyft and Uber, Google will not vet drivers with background checks, instead relying on passenger reviews, according to the Journal, which said the Bay Area program could expand to other regions as well. ALSO The Dow, Yahoo Finance, and Trump all miss their targets Boston turns into hotbed for shoe companies State Farm still overcharging some customers, state says One-time allies Google and Uber have been increasingly competing lately, to the point where David Drummond, a senior executive at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, resigned from the Uber board a few weeks ago “given the overlap between the two companies,” he wrote in an email to the Journal. GV, Google’s venture capital division, invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. Google has been muscling into the transportation arena with its work on self-driving cars, a technology that Uber is also fiercely pursuing. Uber plans public tests of robot taxis in Pittsburgh in the next few weeks, beating Google to commercial testing. Ride-hailing is a natural application for driverless cars, and Google reportedly would like to test its own vehicles in a ride service. Waze, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.1 billion, has been testing a carpooling application in its native Israel since last year. The turn-by-turn navigation system, which relies on community input to generate the best ways to avoid traffic, learns its drivers’ routes to work to match them with riders going the same way.

Diced peppers and onions. Some precut, packaged vegetables from Country Fresh are being recalled over possible Listeria contamination. Getty Images/iStockphoto Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email About 30,000 cases of precut vegetables are being recalled in many Southeastern states because they could be contaminated with Listeria. But how, exactly, do these bacteria get into veggies? This week, the food manufacturer Country Fresh announced a recall of several of its vegetable products — including precut onions, mushrooms and peppers — after one of its products being sold in a Georgia grocery store tested positive for Listeria bacteria. The recall affects products sold at a number of grocery stores — including Walmart, Harris Teeter and Winn-Dixie — in nine Southern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia). Listeria is found naturally in soil and water, and animals can carry the bacteria without appearing sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Raw vegetables can become contaminated with Listeria either through contact with soil or with animal manure that is used as fertilizer, according to the Mayo Clinic.  [Top 7 Germs in Food That Make You Sick] 11 Photos Foodborne illness: The most guilty foods list Here are the foods most likely to make you sick from nasty bacteria like salmonella, e. coli and more From there, Listeria may get into a food processing factory, where it might live for years on equipment, according to the CDC. Unlike many other types of bacteria, Listeria can grow in the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. “It’s a pathogen that’s particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments,” Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science in a 2015 interview. Other foods that have been historically linked with Listeria outbreaks include raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheeses and deli meats, Chapman said. So far, there have been no reported cases of anyone becoming sick with Listeria from Country Fresh’s recalled vegetables, Country Fresh said in a statement. But Listeria infections can be serious, and even deadly, particularly for certain groups of people, including young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. The infection can cause fever, muscle aches and diarrhea, and in pregnant women, it may cause miscarriage or stillbirth, the CDC says. The CDC offered the following general recommendations to reduce the risk of Listeria infection: Rinse raw produce, including fruits and vegetables, before eating, cutting or cooking. Use a produce brush to scrub firm vegetables, such as melons and cucumbers. Dry produce with a clean cloth or paper towel. When preparing food, separate uncooked meats from vegetables and cooked foods. When you handle uncooked foods, be sure to wash your hands afterward, as well as the knives and cutting boards you used for the foods. Do not drink unpasteurized milk. Heat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hot. People at higher risk of infection, such as pregnant women, should not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts or other deli meats unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). They should also avoid eating soft cheeses, unless the label says it’s made with pasteurized milk.

Jan 03, 2017 Products and Trends>Food and Beverage Q&A: Why the 'humane economy' is the new norm Humane Society CEO Wayne Pacelle on merging our values and actions, cage-free eggs and why companies that rely on animals must evolve or perish. Jenna Blumenfeld - Blogger | Aug 30, 2016 Treatment of animals has markedly improved over the last century. Myriad groups across the country are focused on finding “forever homes” for stray cats and dogs (and horses and parrots and lizards). Per Bob Barker’s persistence, animals are routinely spayed and neutered. And importantly, every single state has laws that criminalize mistreatment of animals—often resulting in a felony. But responsible strides still lag for animals being raised for food. Millions of hens are confined to battery cages—enclosures that allow for only 67 square inches of space, too small for hens to even stretch their wings. Sows are restrained in 2-foot-wide cages throughout their pregnancies, also called gestation crates. Related: 3 plant-based food categories with momentum in the natural channel All this is horrifying for obvious reasons. But in his new book The Humane Economy: How Innovators and Enlightened Consumers are Transforming the Lives of Animals (William Morrow, 2016), Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the Humane Society of The United States, says that meaningful improvements in animal welfare are not just good for animals and our moral compass. Humane business practices are now essential for modern capitalism to flourish—increasingly mindful consumers won’t stand for it otherwise. Here, Pacelle discusses how the new economy—the humane economy—is good for you, good for animals and vital for the bottom line. What’s the elevator pitch for the “Humane Economy”? Wayne Pacelle: It’s about marrying our values with our commerce and business practices—separating them not only produces bad outcomes for society, it also undermines the success of business and government. Any business or government that has animal cruelty baked into its operations is facing unprecedented risks in society and in industry. For example, SeaWorld recently ended the breeding of orcas because children in classrooms were boycotting them, and customers were complaining. SeaWorld saw their stock declining, and they realized that in order to succeed in business, they had to move into animal protection. How has the Humane Society shifted into the food industry—how did that transition occur from an activist standpoint and what’s the vision going forward? WP: The largest number of at-risk animals are caught up in the food production system: 77 billion animals worldwide, and that number excludes fish. One of the biggest concerns we’ve had is the intent of confinement on factory farms, so we’ve been focused on laying hens, veal cows and sow pigs. We have pressured trade associations and food retailers to change the way they do business and to end this era of confining laying hens in small battery cages where the animals are immobilized. In my book, I recount how we are changing the most basic operations in the veal, pork and egg industry. In the last year we’ve gotten 200 major food retailers, including Kroger, Safeway and Wal-Mart, to phase out their purchases that confine animals in cages. I think it’s easy for lots of folks to get on board with the “humane economy.” Consumers understand it. It feels good. But how exactly does the Humane Society convince big brands that rely on animals for profit to make this shift? WP: Executives at these big brands want to do the right thing. When we make the scientifically sound case and say [animal cruelty] is awful, it softens them up because they are people too. Plus, this is where the mass of customers are moving. It’s disqualifying for companies. When animals are mistreated, you often see other bad outcomes in society, too. [Overcrowded factory farms] produce so much waste in the environment, and overuse of antibiotics might eventually render them useless for humans. I think the convergence of so many social concerns is driving these changes in the food industry. But it’s truly a major revolution. We’ve had this intensive confinement of animals during my whole lifetime—we’re now unwinding this. Several large food chains have recently made commitments to improve their sourcing practices for animal products, for example McDonalds said they would transition to cage-free eggs by 2025. This is good. But what needs to be done from a supply standpoint to accelerate such commitments? WP: Some of these companies are phasing in cage-free eggs immediately. The year 2025 doesn’t mean when they start… it’s when they finish. Essentially what we have now is 300 million laying hens in the United States. A year ago, 270 million of 300 million hens are in confinement. Over the next twenty years, we’ll see 10 to 20 million hens per year getting out of these cages. No new traditional cages for hens are being built. Is cage-free good enough? Should these commitments placate us? WP: What we have is a minimum standard when we have cage-free. At the very least, animals with legs and wings should move. And it’s up to consumers to lift the standards higher. Some people are going to demand that these animals live their whole lives in a way that reflects conscious concern for their well-being. There’s going to be a lot of variety in the marketplace. But now, cage-free is the new normal. Conscious consumers are going to reach for higher standards. Some people won’t eat eggs or meat at all. In your book you mention the growth of companies that offer animal product-free alternatives, including Hampton Creek, which makes vegan mayo. Should humane consumers be totally vegan? WP: I think it’s an outstanding option for people who want to steer clear of animal exploitation. What we have is a host of entrepreneurs who are giving us options we never had. If you can mimic the taste and texture of meat, eggs or milk, and get all the protein but none of the fat and cholesterol and none of the animal cruelty, what’s the problem with that? People will have the same sort of palate experience without any of these social costs. Moral intention combined with human ingenuity is going to give us a pathway to a more humane society. We’ve already won the moral argument—there are very few people who say that animals don’t matter. Still, when we are so physically removed from these problems, [animal welfare] doesn’t seem urgent. Animals aren’t slaughtered in front of us; the hen is out of the picture. When you educate people, and give them a product that competes on price, taste and health but is so superior on the moral dimensions, it liberates us. It gives us new options. Do you follow a specific diet? WP: I’ve been a vegan for a long time. I became vegan when I was a college student at Yale—I saw images of factory farming and it turned me off. I just decided I was going to get out of the entire enterprise. But at the Humane Society, our metric is progress not perfection. We want people taking steps to make a difference, and celebrating these steps. Like Meatless Monday? WP: Yes! I was recently on Oprah’s show, SuperSoul Sunday, and she asked me what people can do to help stem animal cruelty. I said Meatless Mondays are a great way to start, and she later urged her Twitter followers to do the same. Do you have any pets? WP: I do. I have a dog named Lily, and she’s a rescue. She was about to be euthanized when we adopted her and she’s the love of my life. Her sister is Zoe the cat. I saw this beautiful stray kitty one day when I was walking Lily, and I scooped her up. How can we move the dial on animal cruelty specifically as it relates to raising animals for food in other countries, too? WP: We need a global movement for animal protection. [The Humane Society] has an international arm and we’re active in 50 countries now, just as we’re doing so in the United States. We have to confront these challenges all over the world.

August 30, 2016 WSP Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world’s largest online retailer, is leaving competitors in the dust but if you ever wondered just how well they are doing, this chart by market research firm Baird Equity Research should give you an idea. According to Baird Equity Research, Amazon sold 6 times more online than 8 of the largest big box retailers combined. The research firm estimated Amazon’s earnings to $59 billion worth of products sold online during the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the retailer’s 8 closest rivals on the list – including  Walmart, Target, and BestBuy – sold about $10 billion worth of products in the same period combined. As for Amazon’s growth in online sales volume, it is about 10 times higher than 8 of its closest competitors combined. The online retailer saw its sales volume or gross merchandise volume (GMV) increase $14 billion year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, its 8 closest rivals only saw their online sales volume increase to a disappointing $1.3 billion over the same period. According to Baird, this puts Amazon’s growth to 10 times in online sales volume than 8 of its other competitors combined. In addition, Amazon generated about ~30% of US retail sales growth. According to data released by the Department of Commerce, Amazon’s US retail sales, which include sales transacted via its physical stores, grew by a staggering $31.5 billion year-over-year in the second quarter of this year. The Baird chart illustrates that Amazon’s North American GMV is estimated to have spiked about $9.1 billion year-over-year in the same period. This means Amazon drove 30% of total US retails sales growth, an extraordinary feat despite having almost zero presence in the physical retail space. Last June, Business Insider reported that Amazon is set to expand in 5 “mega categories,” which Baird believes could open a $1.7 trillion market share opportunity altogether. The categories include clothing, home & kitchen, health & beauty as well as grocery and office equipment. According to the report, Amazon owns about less than 5% of the retail shares in the five categories but this could jump significantly once Amazon increases its presences in these segments. Baird noted that the online retailer’s vast customer base, improving service infrastructure, and growing online commerce market will give Amazon the edge it needs to make a mark in these markets. “Amazon currently has less than 5% market share in each of these five mega-categories representing $1.7 trillion in market share opportunity, addressable we believe due to an increasingly loyal customer base, increasingly sophisticated fulfillment and logistics network, and the increasing adoption of online shopping across traditionally bricks-and-mortar product lines,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote. “Amazon continues to add product selection at a rapid (double-digit %) clip, which we view as one of the fundamental drivers of unit sales growth.” AMZN Previous article Next article Related Articles News Notable Downgrades: 3D Systems (DDD), Amazon.com (AMZN), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Virgin America (VA), SeaDrill (SDRL) April 27, 2015 WSP Consumer Guess What’s Coming to a Mall Near You (AMZN) September 13, 2016 WSP Consumer Amazon Prime Growing at Breakneck Speed (AMZN) October 3, 2016 WSP Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Please hurry. After a bruising three months when moviegoers often had to strain to find something good to see, this year's fall film season looms like an oasis. It's about to get better at the multiplex. Here are 10 movies, performances and story lines that AP film writers Lindsey Bahr and Jake Coyle are most looking forward to, come autumn: LONERGAN-MANIA: Little is settled about this fall's coming awards season except for this: Kenneth Lonergan's "Manchester by the Sea" (Nov. 18) is one of the best films of the year. Already celebrated at its Sundance premiere, it's the third film from the acclaimed New York playwright following the wonderful "You Can Count on Me" and the criminally underseen "Margaret." Casey Affleck excels as a small-town New Englander haunted by tragedy. Lonergan's naturalistic touch and deft feel for the rhythms and details of life remain unmatched. — Jake Coyle This image released by Sony Pictures shows Joe Alwyn, portraying Billy Lynn, on a screen in a scene from the film, "Billy Lynn¿s Long Halftime Walk," in theaters on November 11. (Mary Cybulski/Sony-TriStar Pictures via AP) ANG LEE, INNOVATOR: Ang Lee is continually pushing cinema to new technological heights, and his adaptation of "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" (Nov. 11) is no less ambitious than bringing a hyper realistic CG Bengal tiger to the frames of "Life of Pi." The first screening will be in 4K, 3D and 120 frames per second — essentially, hyper reality. Oh, and he also manages to meld all that tech talk with some extremely resonant stories. Take us there, Mr. Lee. — Lindsey Bahr A MORE DIVERSE OSCARS: After two straight years of "OscarsSoWhite" blanketing a dishearteningly homogenous Academy Awards, a richly diverse array of possible nominees is lining up for this season. Though a rape case from the past is clouding the once-bright fortunes of Nate Parker's "The Birth of a Nation," a revamped Academy of Motion Pictures may be hard pressed to ignore the likes of Denzel Washington's "Fences" (Dec. 16), Barry Jenkins' "Moonlight" (Oct. 21), Theodore Melfi's "Hidden Figures" (Dec. 25) and Jeff Nichols' interracial marriage tale "Loving" (Nov. 4). — Coyle FEMALE DIRECTORS TO (RE)DISCOVER: While the percentage of female directors remains dismal, there are a number of exciting projects from new and veteran talents this fall, like the feature debuts of Julia Hart ("Miss Stevens," Sept. 16) and Kelly Fremon Craig ("The Edge of Seventeen," Nov. 18). Also coming are films from exciting veterans like Jocelyn Moorehouse ("The Dressmaker," Sept. 23), Andrea Arnold ("American Honey," Sept. 30) and Kelly Reichardt ("Certain Women," Oct. 14). — Bahr A LEGITIMATELY GOOD SHIA LABEOUF: Performance-art theatrics have overshadowed the transformation Shia LaBeouf has undergone. He's made it easy to not take him seriously in recent years, and maybe that's been the point. But in Andrea Arnold's Midwest teenage odyssey, "American Honey" (Sept. 30), LaBeouf and breakout star Sasha Lane are exceptional. The film is your opportunity to 1) See why LaBeouf was sporting a rattail last year; 2) Watch him dance to Rihanna on a Walmart check-out counter; and 3) See the vibrant latest from one of the most interesting directors currently working. — Coyle EMMA STONE GETS A PROPER SHOWCASE: How do you come off of a dud like "Aloha"? By singing, dancing and romancing your way back into America's hearts in what could be a career-defining performance in Damien Chazelle's musical love story "La La Land" (Dec. 16) of course. Stone stars as Mia, a struggling actress in Los Angeles who falls for a moody musician in the form of Ryan Gosling. Looking like "Singing in the Rain" meets "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg," ''La La Land" — and Stone's touching melodies and emotive almond eyes — promises to have audiences swooning and sobbing in no time. — Bahr SMARTER SPECTACLES: Even the blockbusters this fall look more enticing than the summer's. There's Denzel in glorious cowboy-hero mode in "The Magnificent Seven (Sept. 23), Peter Berg's visceral true tale "Deepwater Horizon" (Sept. 30), the brainy smarts of Benedict Cumberbatch in "Doctor Strange" (Nov. 4), the mind-bending sci-fi of Denis Villeneuve's "Arrival" (Nov. 11) and the cozy fantasy of J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" (Nov. 18). Oh, and another little "Star Wars" film is coming: Gareth Edwards' spinoff "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" (Dec. 16). — Coyle OLD HOLLYWOOD THROUGH BEATTY'S LENS: The Golden Age of Hollywood holds a not-so-surprising allure for directors of a certain age, but perhaps none has seemed quite as suited to the task as Warren Beatty, coming off of a 15-year hiatus from acting and an 18-year break from directing with his long-time-coming "Rules Don't Apply" (Nov. 23), once simply known as the Warren Beatty Howard Hughes pic. Beatty plays Hughes, but it looks to be more of a showcase for a youthful romance between an aspiring actress (Lily Collins) and her driver (young Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich). — Bahr HAILEE STEINFELD GROWS UP: Steinfeld was just 13 when she made her Oscar-nominated breakout in the Coen brothers "True Grit" in 2010. In Kelly Fremon Craig's "The Edge of Seventeen" (Nov. 18) — a coming-of-age tale in the John Hughes tradition — her maturation is self-evident. As a whip-smart but confidence-lacking high-schooler, Steinfeld navigates embarrassment after embarrassment with wit and spirit. — Coyle THE UNDERSTATED MIKE MILLS: Director Mike Mills takes his time between projects, but each is a lovely, whispered little cinematic event, from the tender "Thumbsucker" to the achingly poignant "Beginners." His latest, "20th Century Women" (Dec. 21) takes him back in time to 1979 Santa Barbara, where three women (Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning) explore what love and freedom means in their time. — Bahr This image released by Summit Entertainment shows Mark Wahlberg in a scene from "Deepwater Horizon," in theaters on September 30.

A Sector By Sector Summary Review: Part 1 By Scutify Aug 29, 2016 4:14 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Introduction As a value investor, I must admit to being very frustrated with the valuations I'm seeing on high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks. I have been vigorously searching for fairly valued dividend growth stocks to invest in. I have thoroughly screened and evaluated every company in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats, all three of the CCC (Champions, Contenders and Challengers) lists produced by David Fish, every dividend paying stock on the S&P 500, Fortune 500, NASDAQ 100, S&P 100 Large-cap, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and even the S&P 400 mid-cap universe. Much to my chagrin, I have found the pickings to be quite slim indeed. It seems rather obvious to me that low interest rates and a large appetite for yield in an environment where fixed income yield is low, has driven valuations of high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks to unprecedented levels of high valuation. Consequently, the vast majority of my favorite and preferred dividend growth stocks are beyond a level of valuation that I would be comfortable investing at. In short, and in my opinion, this is a tough market for the value focused dividend growth investor. On the other hand, I am on record many times of stating that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market. More recently, I have also added the idea that it is also a market of sectors. What these statements imply is that regardless of the level of the overall market, there will always be value to be found. Naturally, it's easier to find value in a bear market than it is in a raging bull market like we have had for the past several years. As it relates to my market of sectors statement, this implies that various sectors of the market can be valued quite differently than the overall market at large. From the perspective of diversification, this can be problematic, because if there are only a few sectors where attractive valuation can be found, it then becomes quite difficult to construct a properly diversified dividend growth stock portfolio. As I've been searching through the lists referenced above, most of the good valuations I have seen have been limited to only a few sectors. Moreover, some of those sectors, the energy sector for example, are rife with problems and challenges. Consequently, many blue-chip energy related companies such as Chevron and Exxon are trading at or near low historical prices. However, their current valuations (P/E ratios) are very high because earnings have fallen precipitously. Lower stock prices in the energy sector come with higher levels of risk today. When looking for attractive valuation, it is typically found in unpopular companies and/or sectors. In other words, there is almost always a reason behind attractive valuations. Sometimes the reasons are valid and real, sometimes they are exaggerated, and sometimes they are completely unfounded. The trick is to understand and evaluate the reasons in order to determine if they are systemic or isolated, temporary or permanent, real or unreal. This is not always easy to do, and in my opinion, can only be done through comprehensive research and due diligence. In order to keep this article of reasonable length, I offer the following fair valuation sector by sector review of the 50 constituents in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. For each of the nine major sectors comprising the S&P Dividend Aristocrats, I will provide, where possible, an earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ example of a fairly valued and overvalued company in each sector. Additionally, I will add brief commentary regarding the relative valuation levels of the overall sector. The key to gaining the maximum benefit and insight from these earnings and price correlated graphs is to recognize that the orange line on the graph is offered as a fair valuation reference line. Moreover, it's also important to recognize that the P/E ratio of the orange line is the same all the way across the graph. The actual P/E multiple is listed in the orange rectangle in the FAST FACTS color-coded boxes to the right of each graph. Once you are fully conscious of the P/E ratio multiple of the orange line, the next thing to key in on is how the price (the black line on the graph) tracks the orange line over the long-term historical period of time. Finally, when examining the overvalued examples, notice how the black price line has significantly deviated from the orange line and risen significantly above it in recent times. Additionally, notice how the black price line has moved back to the orange line, or is in the process of moving back to it, and in some cases below it, when examining the fairly valued examples. The Consumer Discretionary Sector There are only six consumer discretionary companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. Unfortunately, I would consider five of the six too overvalued to invest in as evidenced by the following earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ on Genuine Parts Company. Genuine Parts Company (GPC) The only consumer discretionary company in the Dividend Aristocrats that I consider reasonably attractive is Target. However, I question whether or not it belongs in the consumer discretionary sector considering that Wal-Mart is considered a consumer staples company. Nevertheless, notice how the price is currently related to the orange valuation reference line indicating fair value. Target Corp (TGT) The Consumer Staples Sector There are only 13 consumer staples sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. However, I consider all of them too overvalued to invest in currently. Brown-Forman Corporation represents a classic example. Low interest rates have driven the valuation of this company significantly above historical norms, and also notice that this has been occurring for a long period of time. Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) I also consider Walgreens Boots Alliance overvalued at this time. However, this company has been gradually moving towards fair value since the summer of 2015. When, and if, the price gets down to below the orange line, I would consider this an attractive investment opportunity for the dividend growth investor. But personally, I would not invest in Walgreens Boots Alliance until valuation appears more attractive. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) There are only two energy sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats - Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation. However, they are easily considered the premier energy companies in the world. Current P/E ratios are extremely high because earnings have been in a freefall as the price of oil has collapsed. The real question here is what the future valuations look like based on forward earnings if and when energy prices recover. Chevron Corporation (CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) There are only five financials sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. However, with the exception of Cincinnati Financial Corp, I consider all of the other five attractively valued. Further note the cyclical historical earnings record of Cincinnati Financial Corp in spite of the fact that their dividend has increased steadily over time. The financial sector is one sector where reasonable or attractive valuations can be found today. Cincinnati Financial Corp (CINF) HCP Inc is a healthcare REIT that appears attractively valued on a price to FFO basis. However, FFO is expected to be down 11% this year. As previously stated, attractive valuation is often associated with a reason, especially in an inflated market environment like we have today. I also found it interesting that the price has recovered strongly in 2016 after falling precipitously for most of 2015. HCP Inc (HCP) There are only seven healthcare sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. There are two Dividend Aristocrats in this sector that I consider attractive or fairly valued. Cardinal Health Inc is one, and the other is AbbVie, Inc. However, AbbVie was created as a result of the spinoff or split-up of Abbott Laboratories. Consequently, I consider it a stretch to be included in the Dividend Aristocrats because its dividend history as an independent company is quite short. CR Bard Inc represents another classic example of how overvalued the other healthcare companies and the Dividend Aristocrats are. Although this company has historically commanded a premium valuation as illustrated by the dark blue normal P/E ratio of 20.4, its stock price has recently risen above even that high standard. CR Bard Inc (BCR) Cardinal Health represents an example of an overvalued healthcare sector Dividend Aristocrat that has recently moved back into fair value territory. Cardinal Health Inc (CAH) There are only eight industrial sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats and I consider all of them overvalued. Cintas Corporation represents a classic example of how overvalued the companies in this sector are. What I consider truly enlightening about this example is how significant overvaluation from 1999 into the Great Recession led to extremely poor price performance in spite of good earnings growth and a rising dividend. The average total annual rate of return over this timeframe was a -5.3%. I think it should be clear that overvaluation and not poor business performance was the culprit. Cintas Corporation (CTAS) Pentair presents the only Dividend Aristocrat in the industrial sector that is even close to a reasonable valuation today. However, I do consider it overvalued on a current earnings basis, but perhaps less so on forward earnings estimates. Pentair plc (PNR) There is only one information technology sector company in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. Automatic Data Processing Inc represents a classic example of a company that the market has historically placed a premium valuation on. However, if you are comfortable paying a premium valuation for this company, then its current valuation is only modestly above historical norms. Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP) There are five materials sector companies in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. I consider all of them currently overvalued as evidenced by the Air Products and Chemicals earnings and price correlated graph below. Air Products and Chemicals (APD) PPG Industries Inc looks moderately overvalued on a long-term historical basis. However, the company is currently off of its previous overvalued highs. Additionally, note the acceleration of earnings growth post the Great Recession. PPG Industries Inc (PPG) I have added a second shorter term graph on PPG Industries Inc that suggests that this company might be undervalued based on recent earnings growth. However, the question is whether or not this accelerated growth is sustainable long-term or not? There is only one company in the telecom services sector in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. AT&T Inc appears attractively valued today and offers an above-average current dividend yield. However, this company's valuation was much more attractive last year than it is today. AT&T Inc (T) There is only one company in the utilities sector in the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. However, as a general statement, most utilities have become significantly overvalued in 2016 relative to their rather low or subdued earnings growth potential. Consolidated Edison represents a classic example of utility stocks being currently overvalued. Consolidated Edison (ED) Putting Fair Valuation Into Perspective Fair valuation and its importance is a concept that I have written about extensively. However, it is also the concept that I believe is often misunderstood. If you spend some time examining the examples presented in this article, you will note many cases where overvalued stocks continue to advance in spite of high valuations. Low interest rate levels over the past several years have contributed to this chronic overvaluation. Therefore, it should be understood that high valuation does not necessarily indicate a losing investment. However, I do contend that paying a high valuation will always indicate taking on a greater level of risk for the returns that a stock will give you over the long term. Sometimes it works out well over the intermediate or short-term. However, if you're a long-term investor, I contend that investing when valuations are too high will lead to returns that are lower than the risk you are assuming to earn them. I wrote extensively about this in a recent article titled "Get Higher Returns and More Dividend Income - in Less Time with Less Risk." Summary and Conclusions With this article I have surveyed the relatively small universe of S&P Dividend Aristocrats in order to illustrate the overvaluation conundrum that exists with premier dividend growth stocks today. In today's low interest rate environment, the quest for yield has clearly attracted a lot of money into high-quality dividend growth stocks. The Dividend Aristocrats are clearly the crème de la crème of dividend growth stocks. However, as I have illustrated with this article, finding attractive valuation in these premier dividend growth stocks is very rare today. In part 2, I will broaden my scope into a larger universe looking for value in dividend growth stocks. My primary emphasis will be revealing the specific sectors where attractive valuations do exist in today's inflated market.

Privacy laws prohibit the hospital from releasing the condition of John Sanchez who, according to police, was badly hurt with internal injuries and broken bones after allegedly running off from store employees in relation to a shoplifting incident. According to Lt. James MacIntosh, Sanchez was seen running to the back parking lot at 9:30 p.m. Friday and jumping a fence with a drop-off of 20 to 100 feet. Patrolmen Mike Reilly and Kyle Parrill checked the surrounding area, and then climbed down the wooded area below the fence. They walked several hundred feet to check the area, and Sanchez was located at the base of the high retaining wall below the fence. He was on his back and unconscious. The Pompton Lakes Riverdale First Aid Squad, paramedics, and the Riverdale Fire Department were all contacted, along with the State Police's NorthSTAR medevac helicopter. Sanchez was extracted from the area and taken to a landing zone where he was loaded onto the helicopter. According to MacIntosh, police learned that Sanchez had attempted to take a cart full of $462.58 in merchandise from the Walmart, which is located at 48 Route 23 North. Sgt. Chuck Quant charged Sanchez with fourth-degree shoplifting. He will be processed and given a court date when he is released from St. Joe's.

I’m lifting the term “contingent academic labor” from COCAL (Coalition of Contingent Academic Labor), whose mailing list provides terrific resource for understanding the wages and working conditions of a bewildering variety of non-tenured faculty: Adjuncts, part-timers, grad students, visiting professors, lecturers: Contracted faculty who work semester to semester at the pleasure of their administrators, generally paid on a piecework basis by the course. These terms seem to vary by the institution, and I tend to group all contingent academic labor under the heading of “adjuncts,” because that’s the term my university uses, and I will continue to use that term (as opposed to, say, “temp”). That said, all these workers are members of what Guy Standing has dubbed the precariat, and participate in what others have called the gig economy (a.k.a. the sharing economy, at least for services like Uber[1]). As such, contingent academic labor has a lot in common with contingent labor generally. Gerald Friedman has a fine review: Growing numbers of Americans no longer hold a regular “job” with a long-term connection to a particular business. Instead, they work “gigs” where they are employed on a particular task or for a defined time, with little more connection to their employer than a consumer has with a particular brand of chips. Borrowed from the music industry, the word “gig” has been applied to all sorts of flexible employment (otherwise referred to as “contingent labor,” “temp labor,” or the “precariat”). Some have praised the rise of the gig economy for freeing workers from the grip of employers’ “internal labor markets,” where career advancement is tied to a particular business instead of competitive bidding between employers. Rather than being driven by worker preferences, however, the rise of the gig economy comes from employers’ drive to lower costs, especially during business downturns. Gig workers experience greater insecurity than workers in traditional jobs and suffer from lack of access to established systems of social insurance. Special surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1995, 2001, and 2005, and by the General Accounting Office in 1999, yielded widely varying estimates of the scale of the gig economy. The GAO estimated that as many as 30% of workers were on some type of contingent labor contract, including some categories of workers (self-employed and part-time workers) who are not counted as contingent workers by the BLS. Using the narrower BLS definition, 12% of workers were on contingent contracts in 1999 (similar to the number estimated from more recent surveys). Higher education has been in the forefront of lowering the quality of work and life for its faculty by turning them into temps[2]; their percentage of contingent labor is far above the national norm: The number of contingent faculty nationwide has exploded in the past few decades. Since 1975, tenure and tenure-track professors have gone from roughly 45 percent of all teaching staff to less than 30 percent, according to the American Association of University Professors. Part-time faculty and graduate teaching assistants now make up more than 50 percent of the academic labor force. And exactly as Friedman urges, the universities have engineered this explosion to lower costs (and/or to redistribute revenues. But we’ll get to that). And they do this not for any educational benefit, and certainly not for the benefit of the students. From the (sadly defunct since 2015) Adjunct Commuter Weekly: And what is behind the resistance of higher education administrators to regularizing and valuing the work of the majority of their instructors? Are there any academic studies that show that underpaid highly trained professional university and college teachers do a better job than those that are well compensated? Are there new results from higher education scholarship that demonstrates that the very faculty who are evaluated on their teaching (as opposed to mainly their research) should be part-time, at-will, temporary parts of their communities, marginalized and encouraged to move-on after a few years of paid-by-the-class piece-work? Have middle-level Deans and other bureaucrats shown that underpaying, disempowering, and churning trained university instructors with advanced degrees and excellent evaluations really does save money and yet keeps instructional quality high? Of course not. There are no such studies. The relentless pressure to keep contingent teachers precarious comes from the short sighted desire of small minded academic officials who want to keep all possible power in their hands. But that’s unfair. It’s not just power. It’s money, too! Now, one obvious answer to lousy wages and working conditions is a union, and there’s a good deal of union organizing going on in academia (with many bargaining units seeming to be divided by contract — that is, tenured vs. non-tenured — which rather seems to give away the game before it starts). I’ll list some random recent successes in the Appendix, but for today I’m going to focus on wages and working conditions, and then propose some very simple fixes that university administrators of good will could make, to ameliorate the suffering of their proles temps contingent labor forces. For most of what follows, I’ll rely on the writing of the adjuncts themselves who, being academics, are writing up a storm. (It doesn’t seem to have occurred to our elites that creating an badly exploited class of highly educated professionals isn’t exactly a recipe for regime stability.[3]) Wages In a word, awful. You surely remember the stories of Walmart workers who are so badly paid that they had to go on welfare? Well, the universities have so arranged matters so that this is true for those who teach our nation’s college students too: According to an analysis of census data by the University of California–Berkeley’s Center for Labor Research and Education, 25 percent of “part-time college faculty” and their families now receive some sort public assistance, such as Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, food stamps, cash welfare, or the Earned Income Tax Credit. For what it’s worth, that’s not quite so bad as the situation faced by fast-food employees and home health care aids, roughly half of whom get government help. But, in case there were any doubt, an awful lot of Ph.D.s and master’s degree holders are basically working poor. (What does it say about our society that the people who care for the sick and the elders, who feed us, and who teach our children are treated like garbage? But I digress.) In fact, conditions are so bad that for many, a $15-an-hour minimum wage would be an improvement: I am excited to be joining my fellow hard-working Americans at the Fight for $15. I am going not only to advocate economic justice but to serve as a voice for those faculty members who are starting to speak up for themselves. If we all come together, we can finally overcome this battle we have been fighting for centuries. Finally, let’s consider benefits. In a word, down: The number of institutions offering health care benefits to part-time faculty and staff members fell four percentage points since last year, to 33 percent. Doctoral institutions were the most likely kind of employer to offer benefits. The drop will likely disappoint adjuncts, who have increasingly been advocating not just for better pay but access to benefits in recent years. (Of course, this crazy pants incentive structure means that a percentage of adjuncts will feel themselves unable to miss class even if they’re sick, and will transmit whatever they have to their students. Those adjuncts who teach at multiple institutions will put multiple student bodies at risk.) Working Conditions “The dignity of an office”: Like other adjuncts, who are an ever-larger part of college teaching staff, my colleagues and I don’t have the dignity of an office to prepare course materials, meet students or grade papers. We work in our homes and cars, and meet students in coffee shops or by video chat. Certainly sending a strong message about the value of an education! In more measured terms: Respondents said that hiring faculty to more stable positions would reduce stress and enable instructors to better prepare for upcoming courses, according to the report. Many said that undergraduate class sizes were too big for providing opportunities for critical thinking and student engagement, and others said they worried classrooms were poorly laid out for learning. Some wanted private meeting spaces. Others reported wanting more opportunities for professional engagement, as well as more pedagogy and classroom training in their own graduate programs as preparation for teaching. Another concern was a perceived increased need to spend classroom time on remedial work in first-year courses, such as on essay structure. In other words, the adjuncts simply want the conditions to do their jobs well (something that’s not, apparently, a priority for university administrators). One adjunct, being an academic, went meta and transformed their experience into a parody syllabus, “The Philosophy of Adjuncting”: Weeks 11-15: For the last five weeks of the course, class will not meet. Instead, students are required to spend, for each week, eight hours travelling between home and various college campuses. You must write the term paper during these hours while loitering in fast-food chains and uncomfortable public spaces. Bonus points if you can figure out how to connect to the various on- and off-campus wireless networks you encounter. Please email me your grade if/when you do. Next, I would like to propose some steps that academic administrators can personally take to improve this terrible situation; simple, simple steps that will improve their public relations, don’t involve excess regulation, let alone those pesky unions, and which I hope will be taken in the spirit they are given. The Modest Proposals The first proposes better wages, and (as one might expect) the second better working conditions. The proposal for wages comes from Sarah Wilkinson of Champlain College: Here’s How We Can Pay Our Adjuncts Better Turns out, the top 15 executive positions at Champlain College earn a combined $3,967,742, including bonuses. This number doesn’t even count the salaries of deans and other administrative positions. Why does a school of only 2,000 students needs so many vice presidents, deans and provosts anyway? And why are the top 15 alone paid so highly when our adjuncts are paid less than even UVM’s adjuncts, who make $6,600 a class? I propose that we make salary cuts at the top – for the 15 highest paid executives – spreading that wealth to the bottom, where two-thirds of our professors have been toiling for the same low wage for the last decade. In 2013, the top 15 executives made a base salary, plus extra compensation. If we take 10 percent of their base salaries and use 100 percent of their bonuses, $1,209,641.60 can be dispersed evenly among our adjuncts. By adding the college executives’ bonuses and 10 percent of their base salary, 220 adjuncts teaching four classes each over the course of two semesters see their wages increase from $3,300 to $4,674.59 per class, an increase of $1,374.59. That’s a great start, but what if we took it one step further and deducted another $1,000,000 from the executive salary pool and re-distributed it among adjuncts? That would still leave $1,758,100.40 for 15 executives, which would be $117,206.69 for everyone if split evenly — a perfectly substantial wage. With that additional $1,000,000, adjunct salaries rise to $5,810.96 per class, an increase of $2,510.96 over their current wage. The money is already in the budget. To lift our adjuncts up from the bottom of the ladder, it might be necessary for those at the top to take a few steps down. This seems very simple; it amounts to a demand that well-paid administrators tithe themselves on behalf of the adjuncts they exploit. What could be simpler, or easier to accomplish? And the second proposal is like it: I propose that the top administrators allow adjuncts to use their offices when they are elsewhere; their offices have windows, WiFi, are quiet, even hushed, have excellent seating and even real desks! What environment could possibly be better for faculty-student interaction? In fact, the truly innovative administration would develop an app for this purpose. When geolocation shows that a Dean is on the golf course, or at a conference hotel, or servicing an important donor off-site, the app would alert nearby adjuncts, and they could schedule their meetings with students in the Dean’s office, or even use the Dean’s WiFi for handling their email, working on their curricula, or sending out grades, or they might even sit in the Dean’s (leather padded) chair for a brief moment of relaxation. Surely it is better to maximize the use of the university’s office facilities for educational purposes, and not simply allow them to lie idle? Conclusion Adjunct Commuter Weekly invokes Saint Precaria: A while ago in Italy contingent workers, all those workers without secure and sustainable employment (almost everyone these days), started carrying around their invented saint, Saint Precaria, a saint for precarious workers. Lecturers, adjunct faculty, part-timers, freeway flyers, the frontline teachers at the universities and colleges of North America now also call on St. Precaria for succor. After all, she is the saint of those fighting for more democracy, justice, to educate the next generations well, and to honor the work of the mind. And above all, she is the saint of those who help themselves. True, “those who help themselves” are important; I would never disagree with that. But I like to think even though academic administrators have helped themselves — and to heaping portions, I might add — a proper sense of noblesse oblige would lead them to accept the two modest proposals I have outlined here. Otherwise, how will they live with themselves? NOTES [1] Note the class bias in so-called sharing economy usage companies like Uber, Lyft, and AirBnB: Some 41 percent of Americans with an annual household income of $100,000 or more have used four or more of these services. That’s three times more than households earning less than $30,000 annually, according to the survey. [2] As usual, I wonder if we have the right rhetoric. I don’t much like “precariat,” although it’s accurate so far as the social relations go, because I don’t see people wishing to self-identify as having precarious lives; an entrepreneur without any capital is a failure by definition, just as a musician is a failure who has no gigs. [3] Adjuncts of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your debts! APPENDIX: Some successes Champlain College, Burlington, VT, a success for SEIU: The adjunct faculty and administrators at Champlain College in Burlington have struck a tentative deal in their first contract negotiations. According to a source close to the talks, the deal as it stands would include a double-digit percentage bump in adjunct pay plus some investment in professional development. The person refused to be publicly identified. CUNY, New York, NY, a success for the Professional Staff Congress: 94 percent of voting members ratified a new union contract. A record-breaking 72 percent of eligible voters took part in the three-week long ratification vote administered by the American Arbitration Association. No single contract, especially one in a regime of economic austerity, can end the scandal at the center of American higher education: the reliance on a radically underpaid, precarious workforce for the majority of undergraduate instruction. The CUNY budget, like the budgets of most public colleges and universities, is based on the underpayment of more than half of its teaching workforce. While the provision in our new contract for adjunct job security represents the first crack in the wall of precarious labor, it does not end the system of exploitation, nor does it narrow the gap between full-time and part-time salaries. One adjunct comments: “As a CUNY adjunct I’ll make less over my career than my coworker Paul Krugman does in a year.” Oddly: What’s a bully pulpit for if you don’t use it? 00010 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Politics, Social values, Student loans, The destruction of the middle class on August 30, 2016 by Lambert Strether.

My modest proposal is to require all administrative hires to undergo extensive psychological testing. Candidates who score low on either empathy or conscience (ie, people who are worrisomely high on the sociopathy scale) are disqualified from employment in any function that has anything remotely to do with human beings. torff August 30, 2016 at 1:14 pm I’m an adjunct in both the philosophy and economics departments at one of the better community colleges in the country. As you would expect, the working conditions are basically awful, which says something about the conditions in the rest of the community college world. Our adjuncts are also unionized, though. And that such poor pay and poor working conditions (even if both are good relative to many other community colleges) continue despite having a union highlights the severe limitations of unionization for many adjuncts. Not to say people shouldn’t do it, but something more needs to be done. In particular, when you have so many adjuncts teaching at multiple institutions, and the perpetual possibility of classes getting cut at the last minute, the reach of unions is substantially curtailed. What really needs to happen is bargaining units that aren’t tied to one specific institution but to a geographical/metropolitan region. (You could, I think, make a similar argument re: fast food workers.) This could be done in a way that helps ensure, say, a minimum income each year for any adjunct dedicated to teaching, so that they aren’t scrambling to pay bills when a class gets cut, with the possibility of an income beyond that minimum if enrollment levels can sustain it. Obviously this goes well beyond your quite reasonable and welcome proposals, but it’s something that needs more discussion than it’s getting. (Side note: I was part of the Faculty Forward movement being led by the SEIU at first, which I still support, but got alienated by their lack of long-term thinking and almost total ignoring of non-four-year institutions.) Lambert Strether Post authorAugust 30, 2016 at 2:29 pm That’s a really good idea. I deliberately stayed away from the nuts and bolts of organizing, because I know very little about it. Further discussion most welcome! Joey two hands August 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I think most of the unions that are trying to organize on campuses (I know this at least consists of SEIU, AFT, UAW, USW and maybe NEA and UE) want to have a so-called hiring hall model. The basic premise is that you need to organize all of the adjuncts in a metro area since most adjuncts teach at more than one place. This model has not been fully implemented in any cities as far as I know, although I know of several cities where it is in the works. This is really the only way to get sustained increases in pay and benefits over the course of years, since if only one school is unionized and getting regular salary increases, eventually the admins can (justifiably) say that the pay at the unionized school is much higher than other schools in the region and call for a wage freeze until the other schools catch up, which will be never. One problem that has already been encountered with this strategy is that there are several unions that want to implement it, sometimes in the same city. This had lead to competing unionization drives at some schools, which hurts both the unions and the adjuncts, and at least one high level agreement (that I know of) between different unions over who gets what turf. The nuts and bolts organizing is really where all the action is, but there is no way to know about it unless you are involved somehow. torff August 30, 2016 at 7:05 pm Having been somewhat involved in the early stages of Faculty Forward, which is an SEIU campaign, I never heard anything like what we’re talking about here. The union which I’m currently a member of is part of NEA, and again I’ve never anything either from them or my own union leadership about this idea. (To give some context, I teach in the Chicago area.) However, if it’s being seriously discussed elsewhere, I’d love to hear more details. relstprof August 30, 2016 at 7:57 pm Interesting. That strategy seems to be what’s happening in my neck of the woods. Though it’s all SEIU from what I can tell. I don’t know if it was SEIU’s internal strategy, or local universities were ripe for whichever union put time into courting the adjuncts. Michael C. August 31, 2016 at 3:21 pm Regional organizing is going on in areas, such as Pittsburgh and NE Ohio, as well as successfully done in the DC area. It’s the way to keep universities in the area from colluding to keep wages low. Thanks for the article and the imbedded links. Very useful. akaPaul LaFargue August 31, 2016 at 11:44 am It is good to see this proposal put out by someone with “on-the-ground” experience with the deficits of current organizing. Below is an excerpt from a recent essay: “In terms of strategy, however, the precariat needs to gain control of labor just as the industrial workers intended to do by forming labor unions. (That promise was betrayed by union leaders who pursued “business unionism” and upended by capitalists who globalized the workforce in a race to the bottom.) Today, gaining control of labor may be accomplished by adopting a version of the old union practice of hiring halls. The building trades still have these, as do some hotel worker unions. And this is the strategy of work centers where hiring takes place under the supervision of the workforce. A new strategy to seize privatized platforms like Uber and Mechanical Turk by cooperative structures follows this same course – the workforce controls the job assignments by controlling the platform.” From “An Agenda for a Politics of Time” schultzzz August 30, 2016 at 1:26 pm Excellent article! By way of ENFORCING these reforms, I’d suggest this: Any university that takes any government money must be required to publish a pie chart of where every penny of their money goes (how much to adjuncts, to faculty, to janitors, to administrators, to the sports teams). So students and the parents of students could compare all colleges side by side, forcing them to compete on cutting wastes. I can’t think of a way to fit ‘donations’ and ‘grants’ from the military, Exxon, Mosanto, etc, into the pie-chart, although some of us might like to know that information as well. TheCatSaid August 31, 2016 at 3:15 pm That’s a great idea. Transparency. About both where the money comes from (including research grants) and where the money goes. cocomaan August 30, 2016 at 1:42 pm Love the idea of the top administrators giving up their offices to adjuncts. Two things driving down wages from my perspective: Graduate students teaching: Why pay someone with a doctorate to adjunct when you can have your graduate student do it for their stipend (1500/month back in the late 2000s when I was in grad school)? My humanities undergraduate work at a private IHE involved not one, not two, but three classes taught by PhD students. Not just 101 courses, mind you, but things in my junior year. Graduate students are cheap, expendable, and have less labor protections. Students as employees but exempted from all kinds of DOL rules: As a college administrator involved with student pay, I’ve looked many times at the Department of Labor’s rules with regard to student labor. It’s pretty dismal. Students can be paid less than minimium wage: https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/q-a.htm What minimum wage exceptions apply to full-time students? The Full-time Student Program is for full-time students employed in retail or service stores, agriculture, or colleges and universities. The employer that hires students can obtain a certificate from the Department of Labor which allows the student to be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. The certificate also limits the hours that the student may work to 8 hours in a day and no more than 20 hours a week when school is in session and 40 hours when school is out, and requires the employer to follow all child labor laws. Once students graduate or leave school for good, they must be paid $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. There are some limitations on the use of the full-time student program. For information on the limitations or to obtain a certificate, contact the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour National Certification Team at 230 South Dearborn Street, Room 514, Chicago, Illinois 60604, telephone: 312-596-7195. Here’s the big secret: go into departments employing students. Chances are, the students are paid a “stipend” (without an accompanying contract, mind you) that is fixed. But they are probably working more than 20 hours a week. Research labs in particular are notorious for this. Some students treated, more or less, as administrative assistants for departments. Why wouldn’t they? Their professors are responsible for their grades. cocomaan August 30, 2016 at 1:47 pm One other thing I forgot, students as IHE employees is very peculiar, because they can act as admin assistants in a variety of settings, however according to most internal policies, they are not agents of the institution. Good universities clean up this issue with a contract, confidentiality agreement, what have you. But if that student is answering the phone, you damn sure better believe that they are now an agent of the university, IMO. On the other hand, these student jobs were one of the things that really bailed me out in my academic career. Double edged sword. TheCatSaid August 31, 2016 at 3:20 pm What is IHE? I couldn’t find an explanation here or elsewhere. jrs August 30, 2016 at 2:08 pm The colleges using students as free labor issue may have gotten worse, but some of these issues go back 60 years or more. Maybe they weren’t used so much for teaching faculty then (there were more real tenured professors) but they WERE used for cheap research assistants, which the schools would play games with to delay graduation to keep the cheap labor going, I’ve heard the stories. Therefore I think it was to some degree always thus in academia (ie there were no “good old days”), but it does seem to have gotten worse. cocomaan August 30, 2016 at 2:10 pm I think there’s probably data out there on this phenomenon, but I don’t have the capacity to parse it out. If someone can, it would probably help frame that part of the discussion. BS Detective August 30, 2016 at 2:51 pm Really? You “don’t have the capacity to parse it out“? Can you be more direct? ChrisPacific August 30, 2016 at 5:18 pm Anecdotally this is very common (I can remember one program that graduated two Ph.D.s in the space of 10 years, who took 9 and 12 years respectively to complete). Even in the programs with a reasonable reputation where you can graduate in a normal span of time, teaching university level classes for less than minimum wage always felt exploitative. Teaching quality (never a high priority at most institutions in the first place) can also suffer – more than once I can recall students being assigned to teach a class on a subject they didn’t know anything about, because “it will help you learn it.” They get away with it because grad students are a captive audience (you can change programs to get away from the sweatshops, but you are still stuck in the graduate education sector in general) and because the faculty often have little to no interest in teaching either. I had a friend who wanted to make a career out of teaching at tertiary level and who volunteered to run a course – defining the lecture content, writing and grading exams, the whole works. A large number of his students described him as “the best professor they had ever had.” With no training and minimal experience, simply having a natural interest in and aptitude for the profession and being willing to put in the work to do it properly were enough to move him to the top of the heap. That’s how low the bar was. And this was at a reputable program at an Ivy League institution (actually the Ivies are the worst for this – less well-known schools actually have to do a decent job of teaching in order to compete). Uahsenaa August 30, 2016 at 4:05 pm Grad students aren’t always cheaper. Where grad students are unionized they quite often have good or at least decent benefits with pay that is commensurate to the lowest tier of lecturers/adjuncts, who receive no such benefits. This means in certain cases contingent faculty can actually be cheaper, and the one group is quite often played against the other. It was a cause for concern at Michigan, before the lecturers unionized, and still is at Iowa, where the grad student union was told in their most recent negotiation cycle that they are “pricing themselves out of the market.” Grad students also have time limitations and are a strain on resources in ways that adjuncts are not. They’re also far less disposable. An adjunct can simply not get their contract renewed, whereas schools typically make longer term commitments to grad students in order to see that their education is paid for. Also, when there are massive enrollment increases, as there were at my school this year, you can’t just suddenly take on another dozen or so grad students in each department. Peter Dorman August 30, 2016 at 2:02 pm I would like to report another success story (mostly), my own institution, Evergreen State College, where adjuncts make 90% of the corresponding faculty salary. (All faculty, regardless of fields, are on the same salary grid, where what you make depends only on the number of years of experience.) The difference is justified by less expectation of governance, although there are no restrictions on adjunct participation and many have been very active (including faculty president). As administrators here point out, replacing a continuing faculty with an adjunct is not, in general, a way to reduce costs, since the adjunct may well be paid more. During recent years, as a result of collective bargaining, there has been an effort to give as many adjuncts as possible multi-year contracts. Ultimately, the only reason Evergreen has adjuncts at all is to provide extra flexibility. It has nothing to do with cost reduction. The one area where I think adjuncts could be better served is offices. All of them have offices, but often they must share. It would be great if we had parity on this front. But that gets into space constraints. john buell August 30, 2016 at 2:11 pm Careful attention needs to be paid to the big time sports teams. Even many high profile programs are a big drag on university budgets, but these costs are often hidden. Stadium maintenance can be mixed in with routine building and grounds. Some defend these programs on the grounds they attract money to the university, but usually the money just goes to the football or basketball program. These schools compete for the high profile athlete and pass the costs along tot the other members of the community. Lambert Strether Post authorAugust 30, 2016 at 2:34 pm It seems like the higher education system is as messed up and corrupt as the health care system. In the same way that the ObamaCare debacle, besides being interesting in its own right, is a good vantage point for the health of the system, I’m looking at the treatment of adjuncts with the hope that can play the same role. Clearly, it’s not just administrators, though administrative bloat is important (and provides “good jobs at good wages” for the 10%. Big time sports is one area, as you suggest, and another one would be construction, much of which has nothing to do with education. Other areas would be “star” professors. Another one might be naming rights and the roles of boosters and donors generally. When you remember that the pre-Reagan University of California guaranteed an education at free or low cost, and to a world-class institution (granted, on merit) it just makes you want to weep. vegeholic August 30, 2016 at 10:44 pm When you look at the highest paid state employee in every state, it is usually the coach of the football team at the state university. Occasionally it is the dean of the medical school. $2 million/year seems to be the entry level wage for football coaches in the Big-10. Of course the “revenue” sports claim to be self supporting but I am sure if you looked at the details, they takes resources away from the academic side. Intercollegiate football is really just a minor league farm system for the NFL. Who needs them? paul August 31, 2016 at 6:08 am I remember a great James toback/Milos forman film,the gambler, that left me with the impression that sports,besides the mainline graft, was there for underground betting industry. Unorthodoxmarxist August 30, 2016 at 2:36 pm Did my PhD in political science and have adjuncted since 2004 (when I was a grad student), and did a year’s stint as a Visiting Prof, too. The proposals are decent, but I’d add: – same-level pay for adjuncts as full-time, tenure-track profs. This has to be the same demand as eliminating tiered wages in other labor negotiations. – multi-year contracts, but a minimum of a two-semester deal. The one-semester gig has to be eliminated except for emergencies (someone takes another job in the middle of the summer, gets ill, etc.). The difference between knowing you have two semesters and being forced to run a treadmill looking for spring work as soon as you secure fall is staggering. – in the long run, there has to be a reduction in the amount of courses taught by contingent faculty due to hiring of more tenure-track lines. There should be a ratio cap (75-25?) that favors tenure-lines to contingent. – grad students need experience but they shouldn’t be used as temp workers/low wage replacements to prevent wage rises for contingent faculty. Allowing grad students to teach discussion sections while being given at most 2 classes to teach until they finish their degree makes sense. This would mean increasing the years & amount of their stipend. solublefish September 1, 2016 at 10:24 pm PhD 2000 History; also of the precariat most of the time since. Agree with most of what you offered but would add: per-course pay for adjuncts needs to be HIGHER than regular profs. First, for reasons of equity: there are many other forms of compensation that the regular faculty enjoy and adjuncts do not. Some are externalized costs of regular instructors – e.g. an office in which to store one’s books (most of us own many hundreds after a decade or two of working). No, my office in in my house – a “spare” bedroom, which we had to add to the cost of our home. Not enough to give me an office on campus, either – not if I also have to travel odd days to another university to teach there, etc. The second reason is because the inequity is institutional. To get rid of it necessitates changing the underlying factors that led to the creation of the institution. Making adjuncts MORE expensive than regular profs creates a market incentive to DO SOCIAL GOOD and eliminates the perverse incentive to inflict social harm. It gives university admins a reason to think more carefully about enrollment, course offerings, hiring practices, etc. Above all it gives them an incentive to move adjuncts onto the tenure track. Personally I would like to see that as a law: businesses of all sorts, from Wal-Marts to universities, could be penalized for “underemployment” – waste – of human resources – just as they are penalized for toxic waste, etc. The penalty should be such that it universally renders temp employees more expensive, hour per hour, than full time. “Flexible” business practices are fine — but NOT if the costs of those practices must be borne by the human flesh and blood of exploited workers. And to generalize again: a principle aim of our economic policy should always be to do social good rather than harm. It would be nice if those fancy economics schools could actually direct some of that brain power they have to identifying perverse incentives and developing plans to curtail and eliminate them. You know, “economics as if people mattered”. DJG August 30, 2016 at 3:30 pm Bonuses? Bonuses? What does one get a bonus for at an educational institution? If a faculty member wins a Nobel Prize? Bonuses are based on profits: So what does the existence of a bonus structure say about the institution? This is still another instance of the idea that everything should be run as badly as U.S. businesses are. allan August 30, 2016 at 5:48 pm Welcome to the new U. Presidential Perks [InsideHigherEd] …“In the last 20, 30 years, the notion of what the employment agreements and compensation for university presidents looks like has changed,” Finkelstein said. “We think of them more like CEOs than public executives. But they are public officials, and we treat them differently from any other class of public officials in our society.” The changes to contract structures mean base salaries don’t come close to reflecting contracts’ actual values. Base salaries for presidents averaged $437,347, according to Finkelstein’s work. They ranged from a low of $136,200 to $900,000. But one-time payments — perks like retention bonuses, signing bonuses and moving reimbursements — averaged $145,400. They ranged in value from $900 to $1 million…. relstprof August 30, 2016 at 8:12 pm When did USN&WR start ranking universities and colleges? When did they dictate the metrics for what higher education (“successful businesses”) ought to look like? Just googled it: 1983. urban legend August 31, 2016 at 5:33 pm Bingo! US News has been a hugely toxic force in American education, in my opinion. For one critical and germane thing, doesn’t USNWR count size of endowment relative to enrollment as a very important thing in the financial resources factor? And doesn’t that mean there is (1) an endowment arms race, with huge amounts of money, light-years more than any genuine need including any conceivable contingency planning, being socked away solely for bragging rights about the size of one’s, er, endowment; and (2) a perverse incentive to hire more administrators by slicing and dicing duties into infinity as another method of enhancing the school’s financial resources ranking (and as a way to keep pushing the top executives’ compensation upwards as the scale and the appropriate distance between ranks become more complicated? Does Harvard really need a $36 billion endowment, i.e., $1.7 million per enrolled student, approximately $17 million per faculty member? And why would it need 17% of its faculty to be part-time with these kinds of resources? cwaltz August 30, 2016 at 3:51 pm It’s good that academia is joining the fight for $15. A decent wage should not be contingent on a college education and a college education should be attainable for anyone who wishes it. I recently made a visit to my local representative after my third child was transported via ambulance for a “panic attack” after finishing a shift(several of the co workers walked out because they had no break and the manager was absent from actually managing.) We have laws that outline breaks and lunches for minors but nothing to prevent an employer from taking advantage of a 19 year old and require them to give time to eat and rest when you schedule for a 13 hour day. These are entry level positions so essentially the people running these establishments ought to be teaching workers good habits not exploiting them and our government should be aiding them in doing this if they aren’t willing to do it of their own accord. (I also had the same conversation with McDonalds saying that instead of having their employees walkout it make much better sense to schedule people their breaks into the shift.) Working conditions are hard all over folks. so August 30, 2016 at 5:39 pm Thank You! Its as if people who work with their hands and minds don’t exist. Nobody gave a crap 30 years ago when this all started. I know, if you didn’t get a degree you just don’t matter. Elitism. Katharine August 31, 2016 at 8:58 am We have laws that outline breaks and lunches for minors but nothing to prevent an employer from taking advantage of a 19 year old and require them to give time to eat and rest when you schedule for a 13 hour day. How can that be? The Fair Labor Standards Act used to mandate that full-time workers had a paid half-hour minimum lunch break (no interruptions) and two unpaid fifteen-minute breaks, as well as comp time or time-and-a-half overtime pay for time over 40 hours a week. Does someone scheduled for a 13-hour day not have enough weekly hours to qualify as full-time? Has the law changed since the days when I cared so much I kept track? Or are employers just thumbing their nose at the law while the NLRB ignores them? ekstase August 30, 2016 at 5:50 pm This is a great piece: “a proper sense of noblesse oblige would lead them to accept the two modest proposals I have outlined here. Otherwise, how will they live with themselves?” One can only ponder this, one of life’s grotesque mysteries. The term “adjunct” always struck me as pejorative. It is not a noun; it’s not something one can be. It means, “something added on, but not part of the whole.” That is not a job title. We don’t call assistant professors, “Assistants'” or full professors, “Fulls.” I think it’s often a put-down. And I’d like to add that there is a particular pool of exploited teachers who come out of arts programs and are, as practicing (i.e. full-time) artists, very exploitable by this system. Punxsutawney August 30, 2016 at 10:31 pm My wife is an adjunct at a local community college here. Being unionized has helped, but I still tease her, saying “she would make more per hour if she was flipping burgers at McDonalds”. Oh, and now she’s considered “Fully Employed” even with only one class. Makes 1/4 of what she did when she was an engineer before her company’s manufacturing was sent to China. Maria Maisto August 30, 2016 at 11:35 pm This piece is a welcome addition to the work of the movement to preserve quality higher education and to preserve the integrity of the profession of college teaching. Please also check out the work of New Faculty Majority, which grew out of COCAL and since 2009 has been a major factor in the increased attention being paid to adjunct working conditions, including by media, unions, and the federal government. (Representing NFM, I testified before Congress in 2013). The metro strategy for adjunct organizing discussed above was laid out by Joe Berry in his book Reclaiming the Ivory Tower. SEIU Local 500 in Washington DC is pioneering this strategy and other unions are taking it up as well. Organizing is not just about unionizing — collective and collaborative action is necessary to reverse the tide of precarious employment in higher ed and across the economy. http://www.newfacultymajority.org Reynolds August 31, 2016 at 6:08 am I am glad for the geographical emphasis of the comments. I continue to fill out surveys and deal with administrations at the universities where I work that seem completely oblivious to the fact that most adjuncts are employed at more than one school. The model of a unionizing a “shop” is completely obsolete in this instance: it would best be a region that is unionized. Second, I have two MAs and have completed coursework, long ago, for a doctorate, but more to the point, just published a well received scholarly book, regularly publish scholarly articles and go to conferences, at my own expense, of course. Yet completing my PhD at this point means repeating a lot of pointless coursework. I can’t afford it (I am actually willing to do it if I could afford it, but am older and unwilling to go into debt.) The point is that I am trapped. Nothing matters but the PhD, and yet, as an adjunct, there is no reasonable way I have found to get it, which means I can never be more than an adjunct. A big part of reform is offering adjuncts a way up: paid education as a benefit, maybe paid book leaves. But I dream. TheCatSaid August 31, 2016 at 3:33 pm Great idea that institutions should develop creative ways to make it possible for adjuncts to finish their nearly-complete PhDs w/o having to pay for their education twice. Precariatus Spiritus August 31, 2016 at 3:17 pm Kent State University began organizing in Spring 2016. We’re about 51% of the faculty and do not have one spot on the Faculty Senate, kind of like a crazy uncle in the attic that is not talked about. We have a lot of work ahead of us if we are to bring part-time faculty a bit of dignity and economic fairness. dbk August 31, 2016 at 5:54 pm The increasing use of adjuncts has been going on for decades now, and I view it as another aspect of the so-called “hollowing out” of the middle class, comparable to the destruction of industrial production jobs, the precipitous decline in entry-level positions for new lawyers (with document review moving to Asia and the computer), and public employees no longer being able to afford to live anywhere near the cities whose residents they serve (cf. San Francisco, which is starting its academic year 600 teachers short, because salaries no longer enable teachers to live near SF). What will happen when no one can any longer afford to become a teacher, an adjunct professor, or even a lawyer? Will any middle-class professional or skilled production jobs even remain? What will happen when there are no jobs apart from minimum-wage jobs? Who will foot the bill for Medicaid and SNAP, for infrastructure maintenance, for public investment of any sort – who will comprise the U.S. tax base? And if the U.S. is ultimately a post-industrial, exclusively service-based economy, who will pay for these “services”? One percent – or five percent – of the population will be supporting the other 95 percent through the purchase of services? I spent nearly thirty years in higher education at an American institution abroad, starting as an adjunct and progressing to regular faculty and then administration. Being an adjunct was indescribably stressful – never knowing whether you’d have the sections you’d been scheduled for, having no long-term job security, being compelled to spend all your time preparing for class, teaching (I taught four-five sections a semester) and marking papers, with no time for professional development – research and writing. Question for U.S. adjuncts: Are you eligible for TIAA-CREF, or on SS? solublefish September 1, 2016 at 10:37 pm “What will happen when…” No need to ask, the answer is already before us – in Flint, in Ferguson, in Detroit, in New Orleans, in Cleveland. After being deprived of their jobs, the people of these and other American cities have been gradually and systematically deprived of their [rights of] citizenship and their humanity – so that we may now lock them up (or shoot them down) with impunity. Nor is it only Black and Brown people who have been so affected: look at the economic and social devastation of Appalachia, especially in KY and WV – among other places. J Lopez September 4, 2016 at 7:45 pm Graduate students being paid to teach is so old school. Why pay anyone when you can charge them? My university is way ahead: make teaching part of a student “education”. This way graduate students don’t have to be paid a cent. In my university, labs get money from NIH to pay graduate student stipends and tuition, and the university uses these students to teach. Thus, no need for adjuncts, and no need for faculty who can’t get grants from NIH. Even better, these money’s generate indirects! So an extra 70% to the university for handling the gig.

By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | August 29, 2016 03:28pm ET MORE Credit: Maria Uspenskaya About 30,000 cases of precut vegetables are being recalled in many Southeastern states because they could be contaminated with Listeria. But how, exactly, do these bacteria get into veggies? This week, the food manufacturer Country Fresh announced a recall of several of its vegetable products — including precut onions, mushrooms and peppers — after one of its products being sold in a Georgia grocery store tested positive for Listeria bacteria. The recall affects products sold at a number of grocery stores — including Walmart, Harris Teeter and Winn-Dixie — in nine Southern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia). Listeria is found naturally in soil and water, and animals can carry the bacteria without appearing sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Raw vegetables can become contaminated with Listeria either through contact with soil or with animal manure that is used as fertilizer, according to the Mayo Clinic.  [Top 7 Germs in Food That Make You Sick] From there, Listeriamay get into a food processing factory, where it might live for years on equipment, according to the CDC. Unlike many other types of bacteria, Listeria can grow in the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. "It's a pathogen that's particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments," Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science in a 2015 interview. Other foods that have been historically linked with Listeria outbreaks include raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheeses and deli meats, Chapman said. So far, there have been no reported cases of anyone becoming sick with Listeria from Country Fresh's recalled vegetables, Country Fresh said in a statement. But Listeria infections can be serious, and even deadly, particularly for certain groups of people, including young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. The infection can cause fever, muscle aches and diarrhea, and in pregnant women, it may cause miscarriage or stillbirth, the CDC says. The CDC offered the following general recommendations to reduce the risk of Listeria infection: Rinse raw produce, including fruits and vegetables, before eating, cutting or cooking. Use a produce brush to scrub firm vegetables, such as melons and cucumbers. Dry produce with a clean cloth or paper towel. When preparing food, separate uncooked meats from vegetables and cooked foods. When you handle uncooked foods, be sure to wash your hands afterward, as well as the knives and cutting boards you used for the foods. Do not drink unpasteurized milk. Heat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hot. People at higher risk of infection, such as pregnant women, should not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts or other deli meats unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). They should also avoid eating soft cheeses, unless the label says it's made with pasteurized milk. Original article on Live Science.

just-style home News & insights News US Q2 in brief - The Finish Line, Cherokee, Zumiez, Vince Holding, Tailored Brands By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 9 September 2016 Font size Email Print In the most recent second-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Tailored Brands showed improvement on Q1 but saw earnings slide, while DSW booked mixed results. Abercrombie & Fitch widened its net losses but remained optimistic, while Destination Maternity revealed improved losses. Express, meanwhile, delivered what it described as a "disappointing" second-quarter, below management expectations, and Macy's saw a "distinct" improvement in its sales and earnings trends for the quarter.  The Finish Line Athletic footwear and apparel retailer The Finish Line delivered second quarter results in line with its expectations, with net sales rising 5.4% year over year to $509.4m, and same-store sales up 5.1%. But net income in the 13 weeks to 27 August, slipped 14% to $22.1m from $25.9m. CEO Sam Sato says the company will now shift its focus to streamlining its organisational structure to optimise productivity while at the same time taking the necessary steps to position the company for long-term profitable growth. Cherokee Global Brands  Cherokee has offered an optimistic outlook, despite issuing mixed second-quarter results. GAAP net income totalled US$1.5m from $1.9m in the year ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings totalled $1.9m from $2m. Revenues of $8.5m were flat with the prior-year period. Increased revenues for the Cherokee brand in South America, India, Middle East, South Africa, and Asia were offset by an expected decrease in North American royalty revenues as the company transitions the brand from Target to its new wholesale licensing partners. CEO Henry Stupp, said: "As we advance through fiscal 2017, we are pleased with our ability to further build our brand platform and diversify our global business." Zumiez Inc Zumiez said it continues to navigate through the current retail environment with a "balanced approach" to executing its strategic growth objectives and protecting near-term profitability in the face of "challenging" consumer demand. The company moved to a net losses in the quarter of $0.8m, compared to earnings of $3.2m in the prior year. The results for 2015 include costs of around $0.4m for charges associated with the acquisition of Blue Tomato. Total sales fell 0.9% to $178.3m, while comparable sales were down 4.9%.  Vince Holding Corp. Vince Holdings narrowed its net loss in the second quarter but saw sales tumble, largely in line with company expectations. Net losses amounted to US$2m from a loss of $5m in the prior year. Gross margin widened to 45.1% from 26%, but net sales fell 24.1% to $60.7m. CEO Brendan Hoffman, said: "Our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations. As we transitioned our product to fall, we flowed fewer styles into the wholesale channel as well as our own retail stores, which contributed to the reduction in sales. Overall, we believe that we are on track to achieve our net sales and diluted EPS targets for fiscal 2016." Tailored Brands, Inc.  Tailored Brands says its second-quarter showed improvement on the prior quarter but reflected a  challenging retail apparel spending environment as well as the continued transitioning of its Jos. A. Bank business. As a results, earnings almost halved to US$25m from $47.8m a year ago. Gross margin narrowed 40 basis points to 45.1%, primarily due to the impact of clearance activity as the company exited its factory/outlet business. Total sales fell 1.1% to $10.4m, while retail sales dropped 3.4% to $28.7m. Comparable sales, however, grew 2.9% at Men's Wearhouse. The company maintained its outlook for full year adjusted EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.85 per diluted share.  DSW, Inc US footwear retailer DSW Inc has booked mixed results in its second-quarter as earnings fell to US$25m from $37.6m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 28.4% from 30.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales, however, reached $658.9m compared to $627.2m in the year ago period, primarily driven by the DSW segment and incremental sales from the company's acquisition of Ebuy, a digital marketplace and accessories retailer, in March.  Genesco, Inc  Genesco booked a mixed second-quarter with earnings climbing and sales falling, reflecting the divestiture of the Lids Team Sports business. Earnings from continuing operations reached $14.5m compared to earnings of $7.6m in the year ago period. Results reflect a pre-tax gain of $10.4m, including an $8.9m gain as a result of a litigation settlement and a $2.5m gain on the sale of Lids Team Sports. Net sales dropped 4.6% to $626m, while comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalogue sales, decreased 1%. J Crew, Inc US fashion retailer J Crew says it is pleased with the steps the company is taking to improve its core business in a "challenging traffic environment". As a result of these measures, net losses narrowed to $8.6m from $13.6m a year earlier. Gross margin improved to 35.7% compared to 34.3% in the second quarter last year. Net sales, however, were down 4% to $569.8m, while comparable store sales dropped 8%. Millard Drexler, CEO, said: "Looking ahead, we are focused on driving sales productivity with exciting new merchandising and marketing initiatives that are expected to enhance customer loyalty and extend our brand reach. We have several key operational initiatives underway that we believe position us to optimise our global sourcing and supply chain and we will continue to review all aspects of our business to drive further efficiencies." Oxford Industries, Inc Oxford Industries exceeded management expectations in its second-quarter as operating income increased 11% to $38.7m. Gross profit reached $165.7m from $151.1m in the year ago period. Margins narrowed slightly to 58.6% compared to 60.3% last year. Net sales, meanwhile, were up 13% to $283m. CEO Thomas Chubb, said: "We are mindful the retail environment remains uncertain for many of our wholesale customers, who are taking a more cautious approach to re-orders and the upcoming holiday season. We are committed to closely managing discretionary costs and our inventory levels, while still investing wisely in infrastructure." Shoe Carnival, Inc Shoe Carnival has offered an optimistic outlook, despite booking a drop in second-quarter earnings. Net income fell to $4.1m from $4.8m in the year ago period. Gross margin narrowed to 29% compared to 29.1% in the second quarter of last year. Net sales climbed 1.8% to $231.9m, while comparable store sales edged up 0.5%, thanks to non-athletic footwear categories, particularly sandals, performing well in the quarter. CEO Cliff Sifford, said: "We remain focused on the execution of our multi-channel strategic initiatives to fuel future growth in sales and profitability." Chico's FAS, Inc.  Chico's is to cut around 200 jobs, or 13% of its workforce in a strategic move to create a "flatter" and more nimble organisation, as it revealed lower earnings and sales in its second-quarter. Adjusted net income, taking account of the sale of the firm's Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business, fell to $33.3m from $37.6m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 37.9% from 38.6% in the prior year, while net sales were down 7.3% to $635.7m. Comparable sales declined 3.1%. Shelley Broader, CEO, said: "We expect that the more streamlined organisational structure combined with the other cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, will result in a strong, scalable foundation, that is well-positioned for long-term, profitable growth and value creation." Caleres Footwear retailer Caleres has maintained its full-year earnings guidance as it reported second-quarter results boosted by "good execution" in what it described as a challenging environment. Net income reached $19.7m from $16.8m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 47 basis points to 41.7%, driven by the group's Famous footwear and brand portfolio. Net, however, dropped 2.3% to $622.9m, due to a "challenging" retail environment. G-III Apparel Group, Ltd G-III Apparel has offered an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, despite booking lower sales and moving to a net loss in its second-quarter. Losses amounted to $1.3m from earnings of $12.5m in the year ago period. Results included professional fees of around $3m in connection with its pending acquisition of Donna Karan. Net sales fell 7% to $442.3m. As a result, the company lowered its fiscal 2017 full-year outlook to net sales of around $2.48bn, and net income between $102m and $106m. CEO Morris Goldfarb, said: "We believe forecast cool weather trends should be in our favour this fall and holiday season compared to last year and should provide the impetus for improved sales for Wilsons and Bass in the second half." Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Teen fashion retailer Abercrombie & Fitch has reported a second-quarter broadly in line with its expectations. Net losses amounted to US$13.1m from $0.8m a year earlier. Gross margin was down 140 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher average unit costs, partially offset by higher average unit retails. Net sales fell 4% to $783.2m, with comparable sales also down 4%. Nonetheless, CEO Arthur Martinez said: "We were encouraged by strong growth in the direct-to-consumer business, both domestically and internationally, and by a comparable sales recovery in the Hollister European business, including in the UK." For fiscal 2016, the company is forecasting comparable sales to remain "challenging" through the second half, net income of around $5m, and a gross margin rate flat to last year's adjusted non-GAAP rate of 61.9%. Destination Maternity Corporation Destination Maternity offered an optimistic overview of its second-quarter results as it revealed an improvement in GAAP net losses of 6.5% to US$2.5m. The company incurred store closing, asset impairment and asset disposal expenses of $0.4m in the period. Adjusted net losses widened to $2m from $1.7m a year earlier. Net sales dropped to $106.5m from $119.3m in the comparable prior year quarter, primarily driven by the closure of Sears and Gordmans leased department locations, and reductions in Kohl's sales given the planned exit in 2017. Comparable sales were down 2.7%, while gross margin improved 510 basis points to 51.5%.  Sears Holding Corp US retail giant Sears has secured US$300m in debt financing from CEO Edward Lampert's ESL Investments as it moved to a loss in its second-quarter. The loan is secured by a junior lien against the company's inventory, receivables and other working capital. Lampert said: "We continue to face a challenging competitive environment and while we continue to focus on our overall profitability, including managing expenses, we reported a net loss for the second quarter." Losses amounted to $395m in the quarter, from a profit of $208m in the year ago period. Total sales dropped to $5.7bn from $6.2bn, primarily driven by a 5.2% decline in comparable store sales. Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, noted: "If losing sales was like losing weight then there is little doubt that Sears would win the award for 'slimmer of the decade'. Indeed, having seen comparable sales decline for at least 10 years, the company is now significantly smaller than it once was." Burlington Stores Burlington Stores has booked higher sales and earnings in its second-quarter thanks to continued improvement in the execution of the company's off-price operating model. As a result, Burlington raised its full-year guidance and now expects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.92 to $2.96, and a net of 7.8% to 8.3%. Earnings in the quarter soared 87.1% to $20.4m, while gross margin improved 50 basis points to 39.6%. Net sales climbed 9.7% to $1.25bn.  Destination XL Group, Inc Destination XL has booked a positive set of results, despite uncertainty around consumer spending. The company made a profit of $0.2m from a loss of $1m in the prior year quarter. Total sales rose 3.3% to $117.9m from $114.1m, driven by a comparable sales increase of 2.4%. CEO David Levin, said: "Our positive second-quarter results reflect the fundamental strength of the DXL transformation, which drove growth in sales and profitability even as uncertainty weighed on consumer spending." Tilly's, Inc Tilly's saw earnings climb to US$1.4m from $0.6m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 40 basis points to 28.5% compared to 28.1% last year. This was thanks to a 70 basis point improvement in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales were up 5% to $136.4m, while comparable store sales, which include e-commerce sales, edged up 0.9%. CEO Ed Thomas, said: "We are focused as a management team on continuing these directional improvements. Our back-to-school results have been mixed, but we believe our merchandise assortment is well positioned for the season." Express, Inc Express has delivered what it says was a disappointing second-quarter performance as sales and earnings fell below guidance, reflecting challenging store traffic. Net income dropped to US$10.1m from $21m a year earlier. Total sales were down 6% to $504.8m from $535.6m in the prior year quarter, while comparable sales slipped 8%. E-commerce sales fell 7% to $70.1m. CEO David Kornberg said: "We believe we have identified the necessary actions to position Express to regain momentum and we are moving on them." The Buckle, Inc   The Buckle saw both earnings and sales fall in its second-quarter with net income dropping to US$15.5m from $23.5m a year earlier. Net sales for the 13-week period decreased 10.1% to $212.2m from sales of $236.1m in the year ago period. Comparable store sales were down 10.8% Online sales, however, were up 1.4% to $20.4m. Stein Mart  Off-price fashion retailer Stein Mart saw its second-quarter net profit fall 26.8% to $3m from $4.1m in the prior year. For the three months ended 30 July, total sales climbed 2.6% to $319.8m yet comparable store sales fell by 1.4%. Gross profit meanwhile, narrowed to 28% from 28.5% in the year ago period.  For the first six months of 2016, net income fell to $16.3m from $17.7m last year, while sales increased 1.6% to $675.5m. Foot Locker, Inc US footwear retailer Footlocker has booked a positive second-quarter with gains across all regions and channels thanks to the success of a number of strategic initiatives. Net income reached US$127m from $119m a year earlier, while gross margin improved to 33% from 32.6%. Total sales were up 5% to $1.78bn, from $1.69bn a year earlier. Comparable store sales climbed 4.7%. CEO Richard Johnson, said: "Within the second quarter, we drove comparable sales gains across basketball, running, and classic footwear, as well as apparel. We also posted gains in all regions and channels in which we operate, reflecting the success of our strategic initiatives to build our company to be an enduring retail leader with strengths across many dimensions." Stage Stores  US department store retailer Stage Stores said is "intensely focused" on generating positive cash flow, investing in its stores and growing its omnichannel business despite second-quarter results that were hurt by a challenging retail environment. For the three months ended 30 July, the retailer saw its net profit fall 97.5% from $1.6m to $40,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, versus $0.05 per diluted share for the prior year. The company said its performance was weighed down by continued regional pressure from depressed oil prices and the weak peso. Total sales fell 1.2% to $338.4m from $380.9m a year ago while comparable sales also decreased, by 9.8%. The company has affirmed its fiscal year guidance of comparable sales of -6% to -4% and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.40.  Cato Corp The Cato Corp booked mixed results in the quarter as net income grew 2% to $15.9m compared to $15.6m in the same period last year but gross margin narrowed 100 basis points to 37% as a result of higher buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Net sales were $236.7m, or a decrease of 5% from sales of $249.2m in the prior year quarter. Same-store sales were down 6%. The company's estimate of earnings per diluted share for the full year is now a range of $2.32 to $2.41 versus $2.39 last year. New York & Co, Inc New York & Co has issued second-quarter result in line with company expectations as GAAP net income reached US$0.9m from a loss of $0.1m in the year ago period. Gross margin increased by 30 basis points to 28.8% versus 28.5% last year thanks to benefits from a new private label credit card agreement, reduced product costs, and an improvement in the leverage of buying and occupancy costs. Net sales dropped slightly to $232.8m from $235.7 million, while comparable store sales edged up 0.3% driven by strength in the company's e-commerce business.  Ross Stores, Inc Ross Stores has booked growth in both earnings and sales in its second-quarter, ahead of company expectations. Net earnings grew to US$282m, up from $259m last year. Sales for the quarter rose 7% to $3.18bn, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of 4% growth in the prior year. CEO Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Higher merchandise gross margin during the quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.4%, up from 13.9% in the same period last year." Based on second half guidance, Ross Stores is now forecasting a fiscal 2016 earnings per share increase of 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75, on top of a 14% gain last year. Perry Ellis International, Inc Perry Ellis said it plans to close 15 underperforming retail locations over the next 18 months as it revealed lower sales and a higher net loss in its second-quarter. Net losses amounted to US$3.6m from $1.3m a year earlier. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 36.6%, while total sales dropped 5% to $202m. Increased sales across the company's core global brands were offset by 3% planned business exits as well as 2% reductions in special market revenues. The company has maintained its fiscal 2017 EPS guidance of $1.95 to $2.00. Revenues are expected in the range of $885-$890m. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores said is has "made progress" on a number of its strategic initiatives despite gross profit falling $6.5m to $198.1m in the second quarter, primarily as a result of decreased sales volume. Sales also fell, swinging 2.4% to $542.4m, compared with $555.4m in the same period of the prior year while comparable sales also decreased 2.0%. Gross margin narrowed to 36.5%, compared to 36.8% in the same quarter last year. Net loss narrowed to $38.7m from $39.6m the previous year. Håkon Helgesen, retailanalyst at Conlumino said: "Today's numbers from Bon-Ton are moderately better than those posted for the first quarter. True, sales are still in shrink, but the pace of decline has eased off and, along with it, the promised improvement to gross margin is starting to come through." Walmart US retail giant Wal-Mart has said it is pleased with the "positive momentum" in its business after posting an increase of 0.5% in total revenue, edging up to $120.9bn, rising 2.8% excluding currency impacts. Comparable store sales were up 1.6%, marking the eighth straight quarterly gain. Earnings amounted to $3.8bn, up 8.6% from $3.5bn in the same period last year. Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, said: "On the whole this is a positive update which indicates not only an improved performance in core areas of the business but also underlines the company's determination to drive future sales growth through innovation." L Brands, Inc L Brands has upped its full-year guidance on the back of revenues that beat expectations. The owner of Victoria's Secret said sales grew 5% in the second quarter to reach US$2.89bn from $2.76bn a year earlier. Comparable sales were up 3%. Net income amounted to $252.4m compared to $202.5m last year. Håkon Helgesen, retail analyst at Conlumino, said: "Although L Brands' growth remains some way below historic levels, the company has improved its performance on the last quarter in terms of net income. That said, much of this gain is down to exceptional items and on an underlying basis income rose by a far less impressive 1%." American Eagle Outfitters, Inc US apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters says efforts to lift its brands through merchandise leadership and innovation, and investment in technology are paying off as it revealed strong earnings growth in the second quarter. Net profit increased 24.9% to US$41.6m, while gross margin improved 160 basis points to 37.3%. Net sales were up 3% to $823m, while comparable sales climbed 3%. CEO Jay Schottenstein, said: "As we enter the fall season, our execution, focus and market opportunities are greater than ever. In today's evolving retail landscape, we are committed to offering the very best product and customer experience to position AEO's brands as leaders in a new generation of successful retail brands." Urban Outfitters, Inc Urban Outfitters drove what it said were record second-quarter results thanks to positive retail segment comparables and a "substantial" improvement in merchandise margins. Earnings reached US$76.9m from $66.8m in the year ago period. Gross margins increased by 179 basis points. Net sales increased 3% over the same quarter last year to a record $891m. Comparable tetail segment sales, which include the company's comparable direct-to-consumer channel, edged up 1%. Comparable retail segment sales were up 5% at Urban Outfitters, was flat at Free People, and dropped 3% at the Anthropologie. Wholesale segment sales increased 4%. Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said it was pleased with its second-quarter, particularly in light of liquidation activity in the market. Earnings reached US91.4m from $90.8m in the year ago period. Net sales increased 7.9% to $2bn, while same-store sales were up 2.8%, beating company guidance of negative 4% to negative 1%. Looking ahead, the company says it is focused on "capturing the displaced market share and remain confident in our ability to strengthen our leadership position". The Children's Place, Inc The Children's Place has delivered what it described as "another outstanding quarter", raising its guidance for the full year. Net losses narrowed to US$2m from $13.7m in the year ago quarter. Gross margin leveraged 200 basis points to 33.4% thanks to merchandise margin and fixed cost leverage and a higher Australian dollar. Net sales were up 1.4% to $371.4m. CEO Jane Elfers, said: "We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our multi-pronged transformation strategy - superior product, business transformation through technology, global growth through alternate channels of distribution and store fleet optimisation - despite the challenging retail environment and the continued weakness in store traffic." For the full year, the company now expects adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, from previous guidance of $4.17 to $4.27. TJX Companies, Inc TJX Companies has revealed second-quarter earnings and sales in line with management expectations thanks to strong customer traffic and comps. Net income reached US$562.2m from $549.3m in the prior year. Gross margin was up 0.3 percentage points to 29.4% thanks to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains related to the company's inventory hedges. Net sales were up 7% to $7.9bn, while comparable sales increased 4%. CEO Ernie Herrman, said: "The third quarter is off to a solid start, and we see plentiful opportunities for our business in the second half of the year and beyond. We remain laser focused on achieving our goals for 2016 and are passionate about surpassing them." JC Penney Company, Inc Department store retailer JC Penney reaffirmed its outlook for the full year as it revealed higher second-quarter sales and an improved net loss of $56m from a loss of $117m last year. Gross margin improved by ten basis points to 37.1%. Net sales were up 1.5% to $2.92bn, while comparable store sales increased 2.2%. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We are pleased with the sequential improvement we achieved throughout the second quarter, and our solid performance across all key metrics is encouraging. We are continuing to win market share and improve the bottom line of our business." For the full year, the retailer is expecting a comparable store sales increase of 3-4%, and gross margin expansion of10 to 30 basis points. Dillards, Inc Dillards reported what it described as "poor" second-quarter results as earnings tumbled and sales and gross margin declined. In the three months ended 30 July, net income fell to US$12.1m from $29.9m in the year ago period. Consolidated gross margin declined 99 basis points, while net sales dropped 4% to $1.45bn from $1.51bn in the prior year. CEO William Dillard, said: "The challenges facing apparel retailers continued through the second quarter, and our poor results reflect this. In spite of weak sales, we returned $57m to shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends. While we continue to deal with weakness in the fashion retail industry, we believe we are in good financial shape for the long term." Nordstrom, Inc US upscale fashion retailer Nordstrom has delivered what it says are "better than expected results" for the quarter. Earnings amounted to US117m from $211m in the year ago period. Gross margin was down 101 basis points to 34.3% due to increased markdowns to align inventory to current trends and higher occupancy expenses related to new store growth. Net sales dropped 0.2% to $3.6bn, while comparable sales were down 1.2%. CEO Blake Nordstrom, noted: "Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory, expense and capital, and in the second quarter, made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in-line with sales. Those efforts, along with the strength of our Anniversary Sale and a great response from customers to that event, drove better than expected results for the second quarter." Analysts, however, described the results as disappointing, and pointed out that, like others, it has been affected by declining mall traffic, a trend they believe will continue to drag down sales growth across the second half.  Macy's US department store retailer Macy's said it is encouraged to see a "distinct" improvement in its sales and earnings trends for the second-quarter despite a drop in figures across the board. Net profit swung to US$11m from $217m a year earlier, while sales dropped 3.9% to $5.87bn compared to $6.10bn in the same period last year. For the quarter ended 30 July comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis were down by 2%, and on an owned basis declined 2.6%. Gross margin stayed the same at 40.9%. The difference between the year-over-year change in total and comparable sales largely resulted from the closing of 41 underperforming Macy's stores in fiscal 2015. Macy's now expects full year comparable sales to drop by 3-4%, while earnings per diluted share are forecast in the range of $3.15 to $3.40. "Over the past few months, we have been saying that a setback is a setup for a comeback, and we now believe we are set up well to proceed to a comeback," adds Terry J Lundgren, Macy's chairman and CEO.   Kohl's  Department store retailer Kohl's has booked a mixed second-quarter as earnings climbed but sales fell, coming in below management expectations. Net profit amounted to US$140m, an 8% increase on earnings of $130m in the prior year. Gross margin improved 53 basis points to 39.5%. Net sales, however, dropped 2% to $4.18bn. CEO Kevin Mansell, said: "Our sales improved over our first quarter results, but were below our expectations. Our associates throughout the organisation continue to effectively manage expenses in response to changing sales trends and I appreciate all of their efforts." Iconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group delivered what it said was a "solid" second-quarter, despite declines in both earnings and sales. GAAP net income dropped 16% to $11.6m from $13.7m a year earlier. Net sales were down 2% to $95.7m. CEO John Haugh, noted: "I am pleased that for the second quarter, our company has delivered solid results. Our primary goal is to position ourselves to achieve growth while at the same time improving the balance sheet, and we are making progress on both of those fronts." Crocs, Inc US footwear firm Crocs has booked a mixed second-quarter as earnings on a GAAP basis increased 21.1% to US$11.7m, while revenues dropped 6.3% to $323.8m. CEO Gregg Ribatt said the global retail environment became more challenging as the second quarter progressed. He added: "This impacted our wholesale reorder opportunities and contributed to our sales shortfall relative to expectations. We remain confident that we have successfully repositioned the business and built the platform to provide sustained growth and profitability over the long-term." For the full year the company expects revenue to be down low single digits. Kate Spade & Company Kate Spade posted a "respectable" set of numbers for the quarter, but they showed a clear slowdown in the pace of growth compared to last quarter, analysts said. Earnings reached US$26.8m from $8.5m a year earlier, while gross margin narrowed to 59.7% from 61%. Net sales increased 13.7% to $320m, with direct-to-consumer comparable sales growing 4% compared to a 19% uplift posted during the first quarter. Analysts pointed to three factors that negatively impacted growth: the comeback of competitors like Coach; an increase in consumer uncertainty, especially among younger female shoppers; and a weakening of marketing impact, which has hit visiting and purchasing.  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden has adjusted its sales outlook for fiscal year 2016 after posting lower than expected second-quarter results. For the three months ended 30 June, earnings dipped to US$24.7m from $24.5m last year, while gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 37.2%, compared to 35.9% in the same period last year. Net sales were up 0.6% to $325.4m, while same store sales grew 5.4%. Despite the growth, CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company is seeing "softer than anticipated trends" in its private label footwear business and with certain international distributors. The company now expects net sales for 2016 to increase 0% to 1% compared to 2015. Weyco Group Footwear business Weyco has booked a drop in earnings and sales in what the company described as a "challenging" second-quarter. Net profit amounted to US$1m from $2m in the year ago quarter. Gross margin widened to 32.6% of net sales from 31% last year, while revenues fell 11% to $56.9m. North American retail sales were down 6% to $4.7m, with same-store sales down 2%. CEO Thomas Florsheim, said: "In addition to the reduced demand for our BOGS product following last year's mild winter, our retail partners saw a slowdown in traffic and a weaker sales trend, which resulted in a general concern about inventory levels which impacted our other three brands." Black Diamond, Inc Outdoor equipment and apparel business Black Diamond continued to experience foreign exchange challenges in the second quarter, particularly with the euro, which impacted both revenue and gross margin. Net losses narrowed slightly to US$3.2m from $3.8m. Gross margin was down 640 basis points to 28.6% due to foreign currency headwinds, an unfavourable mix in lower margin products, and costs associated with the continued ramp of its recently repatriated manufacturing activities from Asia to the US. Sales were down 3% to $29.1m. Columbia Sportswear Inc  Columbia Sportswear has booked record second-quarter sales of US$388.8m, a 2% increase on revenues of $380.2m a year earlier. Net losses totalled $8.2m, higher than losses of $5.8m in the prior year. The company reaffirmed its full-year outlook of mid-single-digit percentage net sales growth, and a high-single-digit percentage increase in net income to between $184m and $191m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our successful first-half results were highlighted by solid growth from three of our four major brands and improved gross margins in a challenging global environment." Rocky Brands US apparel and footwear company Rocky Brands says it is disappointed in its results for the three months to 30 June, which swung to a loss of US$1.8m, for the three months to 30 June, compared to a profit of $2m last year. Sales fell 9% to $62.6m from $68.6m last year. Wholesale sales declined 23% to $41.5m from $53.9m, while retail sales were down 2% to $10.4m from $10.2m. Military segment sales jumped 139% to $10.7m compared to $4.5m. Gross margin dropped 700 basis points to 26% from 33% as the increase in military segment sales carry lower gross margins than the company's wholesale and retail segments.  Sequential Brands Brand management company Sequential Brands has reiterated its fiscal year guidance after posting a 69% hike in second-quarter sales. Revenue for the three months to 30 June increased to $34.2m, compared to £20.2m in the same period last year. Net income reached $3.6m, compared to $3.3m on a non-GAAP basis. Sequential Brands now continues to expect US$155m to $160m in revenue, GAAP net income of $12.7m to $14.6m and adjusted EBITDA of $88.0m to $91.0m. Skechers USA Inc Skechers saw its shares tumble around 12% on the release of its second-quarter results that fell short of analyst estimates. The company reported earnings of US$74.1m, or $0.48 per share, on revenues of $877.8m. Wall Street Journalist analyst had expected earnings of $0.52 on revenue of $888.9m. In the year ago period, earnings amounted to $79.8m on revenues of $800.5m. Earnings were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation, exchange losses, and losses from a fire at its Malaysia warehouse. Gross margin widened to 47.4% from 46.8% thanks to higher sales in its international subsidiary, joint venture businesses and company-owned retail stores.  Under Armour, Inc Under Armour continues to post strong topline gains, with sales up 28% in the quarter to US$1bn. The performance didn't, however, filter through to the bottom lie where earnings plummeted 58% to $6m as a result of a $23m impairment related to the liquidation of Sports Authority. Gross margin narrowed slightly to 47.7% from 48.4%, primarily due to negative impacts of around 130 basis points from sales mix driven by strong growth in footwear and international, partially offset by around 50 basis points from improved product cost margins. Despite the challenges, analysts believe the company has good growth potential across both its international and domestic businesses where sales were up 68% and 22%, respectively. Wolverine Worldwide US clothing and footwear business Wolverine Worldwide said it has delivered better-than-expected results for the second quarter, reaffirming its forecast for the year. Reported revenue of US$583.7m was in line with expectations, declining 7.4% versus the prior year. Reported gross margin narrowed to 38.8%, compared to 39.1% in the prior year, and 39.8% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. For the full year, Wolverine said it expects revenue in the range of $2.47bn to $2.57bn, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.40.  Carter's Inc Children's wear maker Carter's Inc said it has achieved its sale and earnings objectives in its second quarter despite lowering its full-year EPS guidance to growth of 5-6% from previous growth of 6-7%. Earnings in the quarter increased 0.3% to US$36.2m, while operating margin decreased around 20 basis points to 9.9%. Net sales grew 4.4% to $639.5m, reflecting growth in the company's US Carter's and OshKosh retail as well as in its international segment.

Brett Hershman , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ?

CES Day Two: Wearable Pet Tech Is Real; Why It Matters (Investor's Business Daily) Related GOOG FANG Stocks Looking Sharp In 2017 Thus Far Should Apple And Samsung Be Worried About This Chinese Smartphone Maker? Self Driving Cars Are A Disaster For The Car Industry, But Great For The Rest Of Us (Seeking Alpha) Struggling department stores know they need to make a splash to remain relevant and survive in a constantly changing retail environment. Connecting with the consumer inside and outside of the store has become more important than ever. As has ever been the case, those who capitalize on changing trends will emerge better positioned for the future within the retail landscape. Some have wondered why department store Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) is struggling and has announced it is closing 100 stores, while a competitor like Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) delivered excellent earnings recently and is up 37 percent in the last three months. One thing that sets Nordstrom apart from Macy's is its online footprint. Nordstrom has been performing well due to its strong e-commerce presence and loyalty program. Likewise, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) recent Jet.com acquisition for over $3 billion has brought to the forefront the importance e-commerce strength plays in the future of any business. Related Link: Retail ETFs Rebound, But Shorts Smell Blood It's All Reality, Whether Tangible Or Virtual The balance between brick-and-mortar and the virtual store space continues to be a precarious relationship, as retailers need to leverage their physical store presence to boost e-commerce sales. As further testament to the success of both physical and virtual presences, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has already done so with its physical locations, dubbed Amazon Books. A growing trend in business is the need for a local, social and mobile strategy, which could be the key to the resurrection of struggling retail stores. 'Mocial' "Mocial" (Mobile Local Social), as the trend is known, is a way for retailers to connect with consumers inside and outside of the store to drive revenue. One way the retail landscape change is beginning to be realized is through the introduction of beacon technology. One example of such technology has been seen in Pokémon Go (Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTC: NTDOY)); the app identifies when users are in an area, and through mobile beacons, a Pokémon character pops up. Knowing that apps can incentivize users to go to physical locations to get "rewards," retailers are likely to jump on the trend and utilize this innovative technology to drive people to their businesses. Other Initiatives Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the process of developing "Google Nearby," which will be a way for mobile users to interact with what's around them. In turn, it will be a way for what's around the user to interact and drive traffic to specific locations through incentives. Google Nearby will allow users interact with Devices up to 100 feet away to do things like pay for parking in a garage from their phone and order food to your seat at a baseball game. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) is also altering the retail experience with analytics tools from its supercomputer Watson. IBM knows consumers shop for products before they ever get to the store, and Watson will allow retailers to better identify product and channel preferences "while engaging and serving consumers in an always-on, tech-addicted world," according to the company. Companies that utilize this new technology and strategy to enhance customer shopping experience will be able to capitalize on the next wave of retail, and possibly survive the current slump.

So argue Barry Libert, CEO of OpenMatters, Megan Beck, the chief insights officer, and Wharton marketing professor Jerry (Yoram) Wind. In this opinion piece, they say it’s time to upgrade Standard & Poor’s Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) and GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) to more fully reflect the value of intangible assets as digital companies take the lead in this economy. The top market cap rankings in the S&P 500 already show this shift, with tech titans coming out on top and supplanting industrial firms. These days, every company either is or must become a digital organization if they want to survive and grow in the age of platforms and networks. But getting there is no cakewalk. The journey requires leaving behind old mental models of industry and value. A decade ago, the five most valuable companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were Exxon, GE, Microsoft, Gazprom and Citigroup. Today, the ranking has radically changed. The index’s top five most valuable companies are in tech: Apple, Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. What is so amazing is not just the fact that these five companies have risen to such heights in market cap, but also the following: They are all American companies. They rose relatively quickly to reach top market valuations. They supplanted asset-based organizations, which experienced an astonishing decline. Among the five, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft are designated by S&P as information technology companies. Only Amazon is considered a consumer discretionary business. But it is arguable whether Amazon is truly a consumer discretionary company, like Wal-Mart. Indeed, Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the S&P’s top 10 most valuable companies. But is Amazon’s classification correct? A decade ago, the five most valuable companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were Exxon, GE, Microsoft, Gazprom and Citigroup. Today, the ranking has radically changed. And how about the other four — are they all the same type of high tech company? To understand the context to this question – whether today’s industry classifications make sense in a flat world — one must simply look back at the history of industries and the way value has been measured. Sponsored Content: Industry Silos Are Out, Business Models Are In In 1957, oil had an outsized impact on the U.S. economy. Thus, the biggest energy company was also the most valuable company: Standard Oil of New Jersey — an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company — a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. Indeed, half a century ago, it was all about physical assets, manufacturing and distribution of material goods — such as GE appliances and locomotives. But this is a new time and place — one dominated increasingly by horizontal digital platforms, virtual networks and Big Data that span traditional industry verticals. And new companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber and Airbnb have sprung up to take advantage of today’s new opportunity — to build horizontal platforms that leverage the assets of you and me and what we have (cars and homes), do (drive) and know (friends). The 10 main industry allocations by S&P — or Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) — have become antiquated in a world that is flattening, a phenomenon first depicted by New York Times’ columnist Thomas Friedman in his bestselling book, The World Is Flat. S&P’s classifications are based on an old-style vertical or silo approach to corporate designations. These outdated groupings also affect where investors put their money. However, the five tech leaders are pan-company, pan-industry and even pan-country, and as a result, they dominate the physical and material world and supplant the old way of thinking as evidenced by the GICS. For example, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S&P 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10%.  Even that level is not sustainable if they want to compete for investor dollars and employee talent in an increasingly digitally dominated and flat world. But that’s only half the story. Time for a New Mental Model Looking back, it wasn’t long ago that huge companies (at least by the traditional measures of sales and assets) such as GE, GM and Exxon Mobile were the companies considered most valuable by the market. Subsequently, asset behemoths were replaced by financial services giants (Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase), which had fewer physical assets. In time, services firms fell from the top spots as investors valued intellectual and network capital more than physical capital and services. We all need to recognize Facebook’s 1.7 billion monthly active users as valuable an asset as GM’s or GE’s physical assets. To put this massive value shift in context, not only is the current classification system outdated, so is the measurement system that supports it — called GAAP — or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In many ways, there is a massive gap – pun intended — in GAAP. According to financial consultancy Ocean Tomo, 83% of the market value of the S&P comprised companies whose businesses were based on physical, or tangible assets in 1975. As of early 2015, that number had fallen to 16%. To help companies pivot their business models to compete with the tech giants, it’s time to update the 50-year-old GICS as well as GAAP. We all need to recognize Facebook’s 1.7 billion monthly active users as valuable an asset as GM’s or GE’s physical assets — if we want to help investors, customers and employees navigate the new tech landscape with better insights. Further, every firm in time needs to become a digital firm that leverages intangibles, virtual networks and technology platforms if it wants to compete in the virtual and non-material world that will be characterized by virtual reality and augmented reality. It’s time to fix the underlying systems that guide our every action – our industry classification and accounting systems. Together, these two systems miss the point when they categorize today’s most valuable companies without prioritizing intangible assets. Moreover, they put companies like Amazon in the wrong bucket. What the tech giants can do is bring the world of accountants and regulators into the 21st century of horizontal business models and intangible assets. If they don’t, investors will circumvent them and newer, more modern standards will emerge to disrupt those standard setters just as disruptors are emerging in other industries.

It's Your Birthday WHAT'S ON Watch NBC The Two Virginias' CW MeTV Two Virginias' Dub Request Form Beckley leaders looking to annex former coal camps Posted: Tuesday, August 30, 2016 9:47 AM EDT By Annie Moore, WVVA Multimedia Journalist - Beckley newsroom BioEmail Connect Biography amoore@wvva.com Beckley leaders are working to close some of the donut holes across the city. While some of the unincorporated areas are mainly residential areas, others have large businesses that could mean big bucks for the city. Decades ago, when coal was king, the city of Beckley was small, stretching from Uptown to the Wildwood House. But as the city grew, several major coal camps in places like Skelton and Sprague held out. They've now been replaced by businesses like Wal-Mart, the Beckley AutoMall, and Roger Summers' trucking company. "I hope it doesn't go through, and I hope the citizens of Sprague, Prosperity, and the surrounding areas agree with me, “says Roger Summers, owner of a trucking company in Sprague. Summers is opposed to the annexation of Sprague, and the taxes that come with it. "They want the money because the bigger the city, the more federal funding they can get,” says Summers. "While some residents would argue the benefits don't outweigh the costs, city leaders say their businesses are already taking advantage of being in close proximity to the city,” says WVVA Multimedia Journalist Annie Moore. "We don't think there's any double that those donut holes are deriving great benefit from being located where they are, says Beckley Mayor Rob Rappold. While Rappold may consult the state Legislature later on, for now, his focus is on bringing in the Skelton car dealerships, considering a reduction in B&O taxes to sweeten the deal. "We want to make our tax structure palatable to them, particularly the dealers we would like to entice to come into the city,” says Rappold. After all, he says, a majority residents have to agree. "We feel like at this point it needs to be driven by those who would like to come into the city,” says Rappold.

Before now, businesses wanting to use drones had to apply for special permission, a process that could take many months. However, the new regulations – unveiled by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in June – do away with this procedure, allowing commercial outfits to incorporate the technology into their work far more quickly, so long as they stick to the new rules, of course. They include operating drones weighing no more than 55 pounds, keeping them at an altitude below 400 feet, and at speeds no faster than 100 mph. In addition, they can only be operated during daylight hours, up to 30 minutes before sunrise and after sunset. Most significantly, they also have to be flown within the line of sight of the pilot at all times, a rule that clearly messes with Amazon’s plan for a drone-based delivery service. Other big-name firms, Google and Walmart among them, also have plans for similar drone delivery operations, though such services are unlikely to get off the ground until a full-fledged air traffic control system for remotely operated and autonomous flying machines is firmly in place. For some drone operations, including night flights and tasks that require a drone to fly above the 400-foot limit, businesses can still attempt to obtain special permission from the FAA. In another notable change, the new rules also mean that commercial drone operators no longer have to be in possession of a pilot’s license for a regular airplane. Instead, anyone who wants to operate a drone for commercial purposes now has to gain a “remote pilot certificate,” which involves a basic knowledge test carried out at an FAA-recognized test center. “With these rules, we have created an environment in which emerging technology can be rapidly introduced while protecting the safety of the world’s busiest, most complex airspace,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a release. Related: Flying pizza on its way to New Zealand – Domino’s demos drone delivery Industries interested in making use of the technology include agriculture, construction, surveying, conservation, and movie and TV production. The FAA unveiled its first-ever set of comprehensive drone regulations in a 624-page document released two months ago, and said the new framework could help generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and create more than 100,000 new jobs over the next 10 years.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation 5 Online Marketing Tips for Conversion Rate Optimization Published by Joydeep Bhattacharya, in E-Commerce The ultimate goal of website design is conversion. Conversion Rate Optimization or CRO is a common practice followed by successful marketers aiming to convert visitors into paying customers. Contrary to the common misconception that online marketing is costly and only high-profile entrepreneurs can afford it, CRO boosts conversion rates without implying unreasonable expenses. 5 Tips to Increase Newsletter Engagement Rate 5 Tips to Increase Newsletter Engagement Rate The money is in the list; we have all heard this lots of times. It is true that…Read more In this post, I’ll show you five well-researched online marketing tips that will help you increase your conversion rates, and boost your business. 1. Reduce Page Load Times Back in 2009, Google conducted a research in which they analyzed users’ reaction to slower search result pages. They found that when Google’s search pages were slowed down by 100-400 milliseconds (less than half a second), the searches reduced by 0.2%-0.6%. This might sound like a small number, but it amounts to a loss of 14,400 searches per minute. Google assumed that other sites dealt with similar rates – and they warned website owners against ignoring low speed for a considerable time so as to not further detach users. By 2016, the general intolerance towards slow websites has become even worse. With a plethora of options available to users, page loading time has turned into the most important KPI to measure conversion rates. If your website fails to load within 3 seconds, 40% of your users abandon it. Many other data sources prove the same. Amazon found that for every one second delay, conversions dropped by 7%, which amounts to a loss of $1.6 billion. Walmart came to the similar conclusion – they measured 1% revenue increase for every 100ms of site speed improvement. Walmart’s conversion rates with respect to page load time Apart from the poor UX, low page load time also limits the crawling ability of Google bots. Google’s John Mueller pointed out in his reply to a user question at Webmaster Central Help Forum, that a delay of over 2 seconds in fetching a single URL limited the ability of spiders to display the page in Google search results. How to Make Your Pages Load Faster Compress and optimize images especially on the home page, in slideshows and hero sections. Above-the-fold information must load as quickly as possible, but you can use lazy-load effects for other less important features such as carousel images. Here Are 12 Plugins to Speed Up Your WordPress Website Here Are 12 Plugins to Speed Up Your WordPress Website Everyone loves a fast loading website (that includes you and your readers too), so of course, you already…Read more Find the right place for your tracking script according to the needs and the type of the script. Use a single tracking script, as multiple scripts for different analytics tools can considerably slow down your loading time. Also don’t forget to optimize dependencies. Use Gzip encoding for data compression, as it considerably compresses the size of webpage and its elements. IMAGE: Radenko Zec’s blog Consider loading background images using unconventional CSS methods. If you can avoid don’t use inline CSS and JavaScript. It can also significantly improve performance if you use CDNs, specialized fast network servers for static components such as Javascripts, CSS, forms and images. Load times of different site components with and without CDN Optimize caching and minimize cookie size for better loading speed on subsequent visits. You can use Google PageSpeed Insights to analyze the content of your website and generate suggestions. The Site Speed feature of Google Analytics (Google Analytics > Behaviour > Site Speed) allows you to measure real-world load times instead of the lab results. 2. Reduce Complexity of Your Design Your website needs to be as simple as possible. When you try to stuff all the services of your trade onto a single page, it disastrously affects conversion rates – the most important KPI of your business. GravityDept’s case study quantitatively explains the impact of a website redesign from a more complex to a simpler interface. Before: After: The changes were subtle but profound. Besides improvements on the backend, the new site got a responsive design, a multifaceted navigation with structured attributes such as color, fabric, and pattern, and high-quality images that helped achieve a cleaner look. The performance also improved, the uncached initial page load time became 63% smaller. As a result, the conversion rate significantly increased, and the revenue sharply grew. How to Simplify Your Site Design Your home page should only contain the most important things such as the logo, the headlines, and CTAs. Make your services easily available with intuitive navigation using dropdown menus if necessary. According to the Baymard Institute’s statistics 68.63% of online customers abandon their cart due to various complications, so if you have an online store make checkout as simple as possible to reduce the drop off, and also use the guest checkout option. Recommended Reading:How to Reduce Cart Abandonment Rates on your e-Commerce Site Don’t place ads on your home page. Websites embedded with ads look very unprofessional, and generate high bounce rates. Consider simplifying the registration and login processes by using social logins. Make user feel better by making your forms smaller and simpler. Autofill forms based on past purchases and user history. Also ensure that error messages do not contain technical jargon as it deters many users. 3. Have a Single Focus What is the use of being jack of all trades but master of none? The goal of your website must be clear and exclusive. It must serve a unique and single purpose in the user’s life. Unrelated information on a single website makes it hard to trigger the interest of visitors. They get distracted from the original goal, hence your conversion rate suffers. How to Keep Your Site Focused You need to clearly establish the goal of your website. Don’t give users other actionable options apart from the single goal. It creates confusion and hesitation, and negatively affects your conversion rates. Use social media buttons carefully. Sometimes they are distracting. Perform A/B testing to see if they increase CTR, or the other way around. In case you have an e-Commerce store, display the availability of products with the help of SKUs in order to take leverage of the urgency factor. Multiple CTAs can create confusion such as in the image below. The ensuing hesitation can result in lower conversions, so it’s better to use only a single CTA. 4. Get Rid of Dullness and Redundancy The first impression is commonly also the last impression. The competition is fierce, as interesting information keeps flowing from all over the web. A study has proven that due to the wide usage of the internet, humans now have an attention span of 8 seconds. Hence you need to grab users’ attention in a very short period of time. If you fail to make an impact within the given time period, they will simply walk away from your product without a second thought. These days, a quirky headline is much more important than the content itself. To make a headline more appealing you can infuse it with the following features: Surprise – The word BEWARE! does the trick effectively. Question – Why Does My Website Suck – because you don’t have this title! Numbers – Organize your content into lists, and use a number in the title just like I did in this post. Curiosity – Leave your readers hanging in midst of a statement, such as I Used to be Afraid of Programming but Then I Started…. Negatives – Understand How Electronic Waste is Destroying the Planet. Direct references – HEY YOU! Have You Already Designed the Perfect Website? After an interesting title, give relevant and interesting subheadings like below: How to Make Users Interested in Your Content Use keywords in your titles, headings and subheadings. Keep keywords limited, simple and precise. Make sure your CTA copy is strong with interesting text and visual appeal. Your content must sound and look friendly, not pushy. Write directly to your audience by using the word “you”. Consider adding videos, audios, and other media to your page to explain your product and service. They tend to have higher engagement rates than other content forms. IMAGE: How Video Content Improves Different KPIs If you collect payment on your site, include the latest payment options, such as PayPal, AndroidPay, ApplePay. Ensure users can easily toggle among them. You lose a customer if their preferred payment option is not listed. On the diagram below, you can see the payment options companies already use and plan to introduce. IMAGE: Let’s Talk Payments 5. Gain Trust Great design makes people trust you, while poor design creates mistrust and makes users bounce off. Trust is a big deal, whether we deal with offline or online customers. It extends way beyond the field of conversion rate optimization. Users form opinions about your website in less than a second (50 ms). When you are dealing with an audience you haven’t even interacted with, it will be your website that will drive the trust of your customers into your business. How to Build Trust Online As shallow as it sounds, people will trust you if you look good, so don’t hesitate to show off. People do judge the book by their cover, and your business by your website design. It’s also crucial to assure your users you’re easily available. It doesn’t mean to stay online 24×7 or replying to every email. It’s enough to make your address and phone number visible, and specify the time when your customers can call you. It’s also a good idea to save the preferred settings of your customers, and make it default for them when they return to your site. Testimonials using visuals, such as the logos of prestigious clients, also help build trust and credibility online. One of the best ways to build trust is to get help from the people who already trust you. A very simple way to put this principle in use is to ask for authentic user reviews that will hopefully boost your ratings. On the following infographic you can see the impact of reviews and testimonials on conversion rates. Final Words Conversion rate optimization is a complex field. You need to work hard to get the results you want. The online community constantly pursues exciting innovation you need to follow. Apart from using the above CRO tips, you also need to constantly innovate and come up with unique ideas in order to secure your online success on the long run. © 2007‐2017 Hongkiat.com (HKDC).

The world’s largest retailer by revenue, Walmart, reiterated its open source contributions and commitments to support OpenStack – highlighting its OneOps cloud management platform, which handles over 100,000 monthly auto repairs. Comcast, the world’s largest service provider, also proved OpenStack’s incredible scalability and extensibility. But it was Bloomberg that I thought made the case for how best to serve its 4,700 engineers who crave the freedom to innovate fast and require a radically flexible operational model. Media providers are no strangers to the need for cloud platforms to support their fast-paced, increasingly digital demands. We have long showcased 20th Century Fox’s media PaaS platform transformation, built on HPE Helion.

(NASDAQ:SPLS) announced a deal to acquire Office Depot Inc (NASDAQ:ODP) in a merger, effectively consolidating the office supplies industry from a duopoly to a monopoly. Though the terms were announced, investors need to remember that the SPLS-ODP acquisition isn’t set in stone yet. The merger still requires regulatory approval, which means the Federal Trade Commission must agree that this corporate combination doesn’t violate antitrust rules. While SPLS is clearly confident about the deal going through, investors shouldn’t be quite so optimistic. 3 Cybersecurity Stocks for 2015 and Beyond Why the Staples Office Depot Merger is Dead on Arrival Prior Rulings: This deal has been attempted before. That’s right, Staples tried to buy Office Depot in 1996, but the FTC shot it down on the grounds that product prices would rise as a result. In 1997 the deal was dead. But history repeats itself, and 19 years later, SPLS is at it again. Some argue that things are different this time around, as the emergence of e-commerce and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) — as well as the growth of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) — makes the industry much more competitive. But, as I’ll show in a minute, the industry isn’t nearly as competitive as it sounds. ODP Stock Price: While the fact that the FTC already rejected a Staples-Office Depot deal once before is damning in and of itself, what’s even more telling is what the current ODP stock price is telling us. The day after the Wall Street Journal broke the news that the two companies were in advanced negotiations, ODP stock rocketed 21% higher, closing at $9.28. The next day, when the deal became official, ODP stock rose just 2.3%, closing at $9.49. As of this writing, ODP was sitting at just $9.62. In a world where Wall Street thought this deal would go through, that ODP stock price simply wouldn’t make sense. The Staples acquisition valued ODP stock at $11 per share. Staples Has Beef With the President: After reports that Staples threatened to fire employees for working more than 25 hours in an effort to skirt insurance expenses required by the Affordable Care Act, Obama called out Staples, saying “I haven’t looked at Staples stock lately or what the compensation of the CEO is, but I suspect that they could well afford to treat their workers favorably and give them some basic financial security.” Unfortunately, the company actually fired back, accusing Obama of “not having all the facts,” and claiming their part-time policy actually predated Obamacare. Not a wise move, especially since Obama nominated all five current FTC commissioners reviewing the deal. Mergers Increase Prices: A decades-long, academic study of corporate mergers, culminating in a recent book, found that prices rose by 10% or more in about 20% of the mergers. The author, John Kwoka, called this a “serious policy mistake.” If the FTC, whose motto is “Protecting America’s Consumers,” finds that the price of office supplies will rise by 5% or more in the wake of a SPLS-ODP deal, the merger will be deemed anticompetitive. The average price increase seen in the merged companies in the 30-year study was 5.1%, just above the target level. While consumers can indeed shop online for pens, paper, ink and the like, high-volume customers like businesses and governments have far fewer options. If Staples expects the FTC to pass a merger that could raise prices on consumers, businesses, and the government itself, SPLS is downright foolish. No More Competition: This is not like when Office Depot acquired Office Max. That deal, which was approved by the FTC in November 2013, effectively reduced the number of office supply superstores from three to two. But a core point in the FTC’s approval of the Office Depot-Office Max deal was the heavy competition the new entity would still face from — you guessed it — SPLS itself. In other words, the FTC said the industry was still competitive, and to a large extent was still competitive because of Staples. It would have to seriously backtrack from those remarks, made less than 16 months ago, for the Staples and Office Depot merger to go through in its current form. If you’re holding onto ODP stock waiting for the deal to go through smoothly, holding your breath could be hazardous. The regulators are gonna strike this one down.

At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses where Democrats already govern. That’s not how the charter school lobby is customarily described, I’ll allow, but it’s most certainly what it’s become. Next year, the progressive mayors of America’s two largest and overwhelmingly Democratic cities—New York’s Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles’s Eric Garcetti—will each stand for re-election. So far, the only visible challenger to Garcetti’s bid is Steve Barr, founder of the Green Dot charter schools. In New York, de Blasio’s critics have suggested that Success Academy Charter Chief Executive Eva Moskowitz would be the candidate most likely to depose the mayor, though Moskowitz has denied any interest in running. This abrupt elevation (or self-elevation) of today’s charter school entrepreneurs into tomorrow’s civic leaders may seem surprising, but it’s part of a larger pattern. In California, political action committees funded by charter school backers have become among the largest donors to centrist Democratic state legislators who not only favor expanding charters at the expense of school districts, but have also blocked some of Governor Jerry Brown’s more liberal initiatives. In New York’s upcoming primary, such longtime charter supporters as Walmart heiress Alice Walton have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to a PAC seeking to unseat several Democratic legislators who’ve defended the role and budget of traditional public schools. In future decades, historians will have to grapple with how charter schools became the cause célèbre of centrist billionaires—from Walton to Bloomberg to Broad—in an age of plutocracy. The historians shouldn’t dismiss the good intentions behind the billionaires’ impulse: the desire to provide students growing up in poverty with the best education possible. But neither should they dismiss their self-exculpation in singling out the deficiencies, both real and exaggerated, of public education as the central reason for the evisceration of the middle class.  If Walmart, the corporation from which Walton derives her wealth, hadn’t compelled its suppliers to make their products abroad to reduce the price of their goods, more public school students’ parents might have the kind of stable employment and adequate incomes that foster learning-friendly upbringings. Despite the fact that our traditional ladders of mobility—decent blue-collar and service sector jobs, unions, cross-class marriages—have largely collapsed, seemingly sentient billionaires insist that teachers and their unions are the main obstacles blocking young people’s escape from poverty. The poor, or their tribunes, don’t necessarily agree. In the past couple of weeks, both the Movement for Black Lives (50 organizations active in the Black Lives Matter movement) and the NAACP passed resolutions declaring that charter schools increase segregation and leave school districts with both fewer resources and a more challenging student body. While many in minority communities dispute these views, there’s clearly some real skepticism about the merits of charterizing education among the very people it purports to help. That’s one reason the Steve Barrs and Eva Moskowitzes aren’t likely to be supplanting their mayors next year. But the charter advocates don’t need to win the high-visibility offices to prevail. By spending sufficiently to shift the composition of Democratic caucuses in legislatures, city councils or school boards to the right, they can undermine public education. Whether they mean to or not, by backing more conservative Democrats, they can also impede unrelated progressive initiatives for greater environmental protections and workers rights. And by making Democratic elected officials even more dependent on the mega-donations of the 1 percent, they make campaign-finance reform all the harder to win. In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with some of the upper-class progressives of a century ago, another time of great wealth and pervasive poverty. Some of those progressives, in the tradition of Jane Addams, genuinely sought to diminish the economy’s structural inequities, but others focused more on the presumed moral deficiencies and lack of discipline of the poor. Whatever the merits of charters, the very rich who see them as the great equalizer are no closer to the mark than their Gilded Age predecessors who preached temperance as the answer to squalor.

Walmart has listed five different screen protector covers for the upcoming Samsung Gear S3, and it even included images of the unannounced smartwatch. The protectors are branded ‘iLLumiShield’, and come in a range of variants, including ‘Ultra Clear’, ‘AquaShield’, and ‘Matte Anti-Glare’. Unfortunately, it’s not exactly clear whether the images really depict the actual Samsung Gear S3. There’s every chance these could simply be placeholder images, pending the reveal of the final design. That said, we wouldn’t be disappointed by the smartwatch pictured; it looks distinctly high-end, and could easily be mistaken for a normal, luxury wristwatch. Related: Best Android Phones 2016 Samsung has already basically confirmed that the Gear S3 is coming this September at IFA 2016, Berlin’s annual technology tradeshow. The wearable – a sequel to the Gear S2 – is expected to feature a rotary bezel, and will reportedly ship in three different variants: Gear S3 Classic, Gear S3 Frontier, and Gear S3 Explorer. Unfortunately, we can’t verify any of this information until the official launch, so take any pre-reveal leaks with due caution.

We’ll go beyond natural resources like air and water to look at how efficiency in raw materials can boost the bottom line and help the environment. We’ll also examine the circular economy and design for reuse — with an eye toward honoring those resources we do have.

Last week, Coca-Cola announced that it is the first Fortune 500 company to balance the water all of its 863 plants take from communities around the globe with local conservation projects that ensure the water is replenished. It’s a massive undertaking, and it should light a fire under other companies on the Fortune list — we’re looking at you, Walmart (No. 1), ExxonMobil (No. 2) and Apple (No. 3). For the record, Coca-Cola comes in at No. 62 on the current list. Coca-Cola and water conservation: Who’s counting? Before we get into the particulars, it’s important to define some terms. According to Coca-Cola’s press release, the company’s new water conservation report covers water used in the company’s products, including plant operations. Coca-Cola makes it clear that the report does not cover water used in agricultural operations in its supply chain, and apparently it also does not cover water-related transportation impacts. Those are two important sectors. But the new report is still consequential because it expands the company’s approach to water conservation beyond the footprint of its plants, to include impacts on its host communities. In addition, back in 2012 Coca-Cola handicapped the replenishment benefits of its largest, best-in-class projects so they would not have an outsized effect on the company’s total global figures. As for the tracking, don’t just take Coca-Cola’s word for it. The company used an assessment tool that comes with the seal of approval from LimnoTech, which conducted the water conservation review. Deloitte performed the verification, and the Nature Conservancy was also involved in the project. The result is a total of 191.9 billion liters of water returned to communities, which actually surpasses the company’s global sales volume by a significant amount. Percentage wise, it works out to 115 percent of sales volume. That’s all wrapped up in a 1,188 page, peer-reviewed report. Giving more than water back To arrive at the figure of 115 percent, Coca-Cola included water conservation projects that enhance local watersheds outside of its plants’ sources, in addition to projects that directly replace water used in its plants. According to the company, many of those projects have secondary beneficial impacts. These side effects were not included in the water calculations, but they can also affect local water use: “In many cases, projects also provide access to sanitation and education, help improve local livelihoods, assist communities with adapting to climate change, improve water quality, enhance biodiversity, engage on policy and build awareness on water issues,” the report reads. The company also designs its water conservation projects with the aim of enabling local communities to scale them up. Where possible, the projects are also designed to be models for new efforts elsewhere. Both of those aspects of project design are critical if Coca-Cola is to continue to grow its sales volume. Water conservation, beyond the product As part of its water conservation plan, Coca-Cola requires each plant to assess its water lifecycle impacts, including plant wastewater: “… One of the factors Coca-Cola plants must examine is whether or not their use of water and discharge of water has the potential to negatively impact the ability of other community members to access a sufficient quantity and quality of water.” Plants that spot problems in this area are required to develop a Source Water Protection Plan and “mutually seek solutions” with local stakeholders for long-term sustainability. Coca-Cola also points out that the wastewater treatment efforts add up: “On the production side, the Coca-Cola system returned approximately 145.8 billion liters of water used in its manufacturing processes back to local watersheds near our bottling plants through treated wastewater in 2015.” Coca-Cola has also taken an expansive approach to sustainability that includes energy-efficiency upgrades, the development of a sustainable plastic for its bottles, and funding for sustainable development among many other projects. So, even though the new report does not cover total lifecycle and supply chain impacts, it still represents a big step forward for Coca-Cola’s vast network of bottling plants. And it demonstrates that even a traditional, global industry can re-engineer its operations and tailor them, location by location, to provide for a more sustainable future. What now, ExxonMobil?

Photo: Mint What is the cost for a business of tripping up on quality standards? For Welspun India Ltd, that number could be in excess of the Rs.6,000 crore that it lost in market value after its second largest customer, the US-based discount retailer Target Corp., pulled the plug on $90 million of business from its Indian supplier. Welspun’s crime was that the sheets and pillows it sold to Target were labelled as made of premium Egyptian cotton but were actually made with another type of cotton. Just a month ago, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, adjudicating in the case between Ranbaxy Laboratories and Daiichi Sankyo, passed severe strictures on the way the Indian company had hoodwinked its Japanese buyer which paid Rs.19,804 crore in 2008 to buy a majority stake in the company. The court noted that Ranbaxy “deliberately” buried information that allegedly implicated its owners and top management in a host of irregularities, from fraud to falsehood, to dupe its new owners. The details of the order tantamount to one of the most searing indictment of an Indian company for fraudulent practices. Significantly, both Welspun and Ranbaxy have been market leaders in their businesses of bed sheets and generics, respectively. And both companies led in a space where India’s factor advantages had made it a global leader; Indian manufacturers have a 47% share of the worldwide bed sheets market, while the country is the largest provider of generic drugs globally with Indian generics accounting for 20% of global exports in terms of volume. The trouble, of course, is that Indian companies don’t know how to slow down when they have a good thing going. For almost 10 years now, home furnishing has been good business for Indian companies with high margins and assured sales to global buyers like Target, Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney ensuring steady profits. Margins in the business have always been better than in garments. The problem is that along the way companies like Welspun got some basics wrong. Instead of focusing on building value they went after valuation, taking on higher debt to meet the growing order book.

People in the business say that they have had consignments rejected merely because the thread count differed. It isn’t just about adhering to quality standards one time, but about doing it each and every time a product is manufactured for shipment. Staying in the business is then akin to being on a treadmill. At the first sign of a slowdown, and in the case of Welspun that seems to have happened when Egyptian cotton went off the markets, companies start cutting corners. In this case, Welspun, or its vendor, chose to substitute the promised Egyptian cotton with a lower quality one. Therein lies the nub of the problem—the lack of a corporate culture which has quality built into its DNA. We have seen that in the automobile space, where earlier this year many of the most popular Indian cars failed crash tests by Global NCAP, while the repeated FDA (Food and Drug Administration) bans on the plants of Indian pharma companies point to how poorly some of them have been run. Around 1998-2000, a number of Indian companies did realize that if they wanted to compete at the international level they needed to adhere to strict quality standards. The result was many of them moved to adopting quality management processes like total quality management (TQM) or Six Sigma. In 1998, Sundaram-Clayton Ltd, Brakes Division, was the first Indian company to win the Deming Prize, the global gold standard for quality processes, and three years later Sundaram Brake Linings Ltd became the second company of the group to win the prize. Since then, another 21 Indian companies have won the prize. The benefits of a sustained quality program can be seen in how Delhi-based SRF Ltd, which won the prize in 2004 for its Industrial Synthetics Business, has now implemented the same standards in its much more complex chemicals business which entails custom synthesis, a highly precision-driven activity. This business won the prize in 2012. A September 2015 report, titled “Make in India: How Manufacturing in India Can Become Globally Competitive”, by management consultant A.T. Kearney recommends: “In the medium term, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) should invest in building quality into their designs, so that it is easier for lower-skilled suppliers to ensure quality. This can be further improved by investing in fixtures and poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) for suppliers to reduce quality issues. However, the best results will come from a long-term approach, focused on suppliers and supply relationships. These relationships should have built-in incentives and mandates for lean improvements that will result in quality and cost improvements across the entire value chain.” If we are to avoid more spectacular blowouts of the kind we have seen in Welspun this month, Indian companies will have to look at investments in quality processes as an integral part of their businesses.

By Steven Rosenfeld / AlterNet August 29, 2016 Print Comments Photo Credit: http://detroitkids.mi.aft.org As the 2016-2017 school year begins, champions of privatizing traditional public schools appear to be launching a new round of political and media campaigns to defend charter schools, despite growing criticism of their academics, business models and calls for a charter moratorium. The latest media volleys from the pro-charter establishment are typified by a recent editorial at the Washington Post, which slammed a proposed resolution now before the NAACP — and one passed by Black Lives Matter organizers — that says the privately run takeover of traditional K-12 schools should be halted nationally until its negative impacts are reversed. As is often the case with pro-charter forces, the argument framed by the Post’s editorial writers is cast as doing what’s best for the children, in this case non-white kids from poor cities. “The thought of denying school choice to these families — something that middle- and upper-class parents blithely take for granted — is simply maddening,” fumes the Post. No, what’s maddening is the Post's wholesale dismissal of the substantive complaints laid out in the NAACP’s draft resolution, which cites unaccountable private boards running schools, extremely segregated student bodies, psychologically harmful environments, diversion of limited taxpayer resources, fiscal mismanagement and corruption, and more. The NAACP wants state and federal civil rights and education regulators to end the litany of harmful practices. Not every charter school is the same. There are 6,700 nationwide with 3 million students. Some embody the idea of locally run experimental schools as envisioned by the American Federation of Teachers in the 1980s and first authorized by state legislatures a quarter century ago. Today, however, there is a rapidly growing national charter industry that is dominated by corporate franchises seeking to build branded educational chains at taxpayer expense. This industry’s boosters are blind to the self-dealing and harmful record, instead putting forth the notion that the wealthy and business leaders always know best—even when it comes to running public schools. That’s the assumption in another recent pro-charter epistle from Harvard Magazine, aimed at its well-off and often influential alumni who are urged to support privatizing traditional K-12 schools. “Defenders of the status quo will argue that some indefinable essence is lost if anyone other than a government agency operates a school,” the article states. “The long-term consequences of greater competition within an industry for consumers and society as a whole can be highly beneficial, as deregulation of the airlines and telecommunications industries has shown.” These assertions, which deride democratic access and accountability, protect the interests of the billionaire funders that launched the sector's growth and continue to deploy a private army of lobbyists and policy experts to chip away at traditional schools. They don’t advocate improving today’s existing schools, but replacing them in a wholesale and deregulated manner. One recent example from education blogger Mercedes Schneider is revealing. The Walton Family Foundation, underwritten by Walmart profits, funded the creating of a new non-profit called the School Empowerment Network. It won a $2.3 million contract from Michigan’s education agency that has taken over Detroit’s public school, she noted, despite lower bids from others with longer track records in public education. Schneider quoted a Detroit Free Press report that said, “The contract was awarded as the EAA [Education Achievement Authority of Michigan] is under siege because of poor academic performance, declining enrollment and an FBI investigation into kickback schemes involving vendors.” In other words, the sector’s self-dealing continues. This complicated and byzantine backdrop is what’s behind the NAACP’s draft resolution calling for a nationwide charter moratorium. It’s illustrative of how the fine print of K-12 privatization plays out on a state-by-state basis, which the NAACP’s resolution notes as it cites a 2014 report by the Journey for Justice Alliance, “an alliance of 38 organizations of black and brown parents in 23 states, which has joined with 175 other national local grassroots community, youth and civil rights organizations calling for a moratorium on the Federal Charter schools program, which has pumped over $3 billion into new charter schools, many of which have already closed or have failed the students drawn to them by the illusive promise of quality.”     10 Reasons Why the NAACP Is Right The Journey for Justice Alliance report is aptly titled, “Death By A Thousand Cuts: Racism, School Closures and Public School Sabotage.” Here are 10 points from the NAACP’s draft 2016 resolution on charter schools, and why the organization is absolutely correct that a nationwide moratorium is warranted—and should be supported by more progressive groups. 1. Targeting of poor communities. The charter industry, especially its ambitious chains, has targeted poor communities, telling policymakers and parents they will do what traditional public schools have not done—provide a better education. However, the NAACP has said this targeting mirrors the “predatory lending practices that led to the subprime mortgage disaster, putting schools and communities impacted by these practices at great risk of loss and harm.” 2. Anti-democratic practices. Charter proponents tell lawmakers, who authorize their creation and expansion, they cannot achieve desired results unless freed from government oversight and regulation. That translates to replacing locally elected school boards with private boards, keeping those meetings private, not releasing documents, being exempt from bidding for contracts, being exempt from hiring credentialed teachers, etc. 3. Selective admissions. Unlike traditional public schools, charters do not have to admit all students in the district. They can pick and choose and many do, avoiding students with learning disabilities and those learning English as a second language. That is to try to cut costs associated with special needs students and to boost student test scores, one of the industry’s favorite metrics and talking points. The prevalence of excessive discipline and punitive practices in some schools is similarly tied to the test results they seek. 4. Extreme segregation. Charter schools in urban America are among the most segregated in the nation, especially for black youth. While segregation for blacks among all public schools has been increasing for two decades, black students in charter settings are much more intensively segregated, with the Civil Rights Project of the ACLU finding urban charters typically enroll more than 90 percent of students from under-represented minority backgrounds. The expansion of charters in many cities is hastening a return of highly segregated schools.    5. Unwarranted financial perks. Charter schools are given many taxpayer-funded privileges such as per-pupil subsidies, access and use of buildings owned by school districts, access to government borrowing and bonding authority, and many tax breaks, all of which have been used to divert funds from classrooms to the benefit of top managers, contractors and investors. The NAACP's proposal opposes any diversion of public funds to "for-profit, private and/or charter schools."   6. Fiscal mismanagement. The secrecy surrounding school administration creates a climate that encourages financial self-dealing. As the NAACP noted, upwards of half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds given to charters nationwide cannot be accounted for—the result of introducing a business model that lacks transparency, avoids government oversight and implicitly cultivates corruption and enrichment opportunities. 7. Diversion of taxpayer funds. Charter proponents could put their energies into private schools in their communities. Instead, they seek to access public funds to create new schools instead of improving existing ones. One consequence is the diversion of limited taxpayer resources in communities where those are scare to begin with. As a result, traditional K-12 schools find their budgets cut, school buildings and facilities usurped, “resulting in shortages of resources and space and increasing tension and conflict within school communities,” the NAACP said. 8. Self-dealing and loss of local control. The replacement of locally elected school boards and publicly accountable administrations with privately run operations creates a scenario where students and communities are put at risk while those on the inside can make profits. That’s the case regardless of educational outcomes or whether public funds are wasted. That same lack of transparency is a major issue for parents, according to the NAACP, who cannot find out why students are “dismissed from school for disciplinary reasons.” 9. Violation of civil and educational rights. The NAACP noted that not only are charter schools anti-democratic and harmful to communities, but likely are violating civil rights laws and education statutes when it comes to admissions, disciplinary practices and expulsions, all of which need to be investigated by the requisite federal and state authorities.   10. No more state agency coverups. Part of the problem with the proliferation of charters and their harmful practices is the reality that state and federal education officials frequently are more responsive to the charter lobby than to communities. That is why the NAACP’s draft resolution says it “opposes bills that would weaken the investigative powers of any legislative body from uncovering charter school fraud, corruption, and/or waste” and it support actions “that would strengthen local governance and transparency… [and] protect students and families from exploitive governance practices.” For all these reasons, the NAACP’s proposed resolution is calling for a moratorium “on the proliferation of privately managed charter schools” and “full funding and support of high quality free public education for all children."  The NAACP votes later this fall on whether to formally adopt it, and as a result is now being pressured by a powerful pro-charter establishment to back off. The Pro-Charter Lobby’s New Offensive? The Washington Post’s latest pro-charter editorial characterizes the claims of charter critics as exceptions rather than the rule. While that is to be expected from defenders of a new industry and national institution that has gained a foothold, it is deeply wrong to belittle the issues that affected communities raise—which is the basis for the NAACP’s draft resolution. “To be sure, there are charter schools with problems, as was demonstrated by comedian John Oliver’s recent skewering of several outrageous cases,” the Post wrote. “But rather than impose artificial limits, the response should be to fix such problems as lax authorization standards or unfair discipline practices while replicating the successes. Schools that fail to educate students — be they charter or traditional — should be shuttered.” What the WaPo editorial writers miss, or simply don’t want to see, is that a new industry has been created that is fundamentally threatening the democratic promise and nature of public education across America. By introducing the private sector into education, the forces of privatization are doing what they have always done—seeking to exploit a new system, paid for by taxpayers, regardless of its stated public purpose.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ CHENNAI:Entrepreneurs in Western Tamil Nadu's textile belt who had till now banked on debt to run their privately held businesses are concertedly opening up to the idea of taking their companies public -a marked departure in raising funds and change of mindset in one of the state's oldest business clusters. Integrated firms manufacturing goods across the supply chain from yarn to finished apparel numbering close to at least 80 work out of Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode. They boast fairly high levels of operating margins, international clientele like Walmart and Macy's and strong business continuity typical of family-run businesses. But, have thus far held back their exposure to capital markets. Over the last decade, only a handful of Tamil Nadu's textile barons have taken to Dalal Street -KRP Mill, Ambika Cotton and Loy al Textile Mills being the prominent names that have fared well after their IPO and sustained interest among investors over the decade. A slow-but-promising European recovery , strong domestic demand and a gradual increase in exposure to how the capital markets work appear to have pushed entrepreneurs towards the markets now. Cotton Blossom, a Tirupurbased garment maker specialising in knitted apparel, began nearly two decades ago -with 40 workers and 24 sewing machines. Now, it runs 3,600 sewing units, rolls out 40,000 pieces a day to Indian retailers and the ones in West and Australia. Even though, it had entered the global markets nearly a decade ago, the thought of going public is discussed only now at Cotton Blossom."It was largely our mind set. Lack of exposure limited the way we structured our companies -it was either proprietary or the Limited Liability Partnership. Some extended it to Private Ltd companies," said Milton Ambrose John, MD of Cotton Blossom, who estimates about six months to apply for listing. "But now, globalisation has expanded our horizons to the avenue of tapping public money . Secondly, in a competitive, volumes-driven business environment, a company needs to have a strong fund flow," he noted. Peers like CBC Fashions, a 40-year-old manufacturer of knitted garments, now supplying to brands like Allen Solly , Peter England, and Alpine Knits of Tirupur, are considering it too. TR Vijayakumar, MD of CBC Fashions, says it was a gradual awakening. The process was aided by two awareness sessions by NSE for its Emerge platform. One such meet, held four months back, had Chitra Ramkrishna, MD of NSE, deliver a talk to Tirupur's entrepreneurs for months on why they should end their IPO drought. "At a time of high interest costs, capital markets are a great way to access funds.Moreover, clients would feel safer buying from a listed company ," said Kumar.

Cotton is fed into the machines, fine thread is spun and after a five-step process, the yarn is produced—the first in a series of steps as the yarn winds its way through the facility before ending up as bed sheets and pillow covers sold in the United States on the shelves of retailers such as Wal-Mart and Bed Bath & Beyond. While the majority—65 percent—of Indo Count Industries Limited’s business comes from retailers in the US, it also exports to 54 countries and has taken baby steps in selling products under its own brand, a bold step for a company that was set up only in 1991 as a yarn maker and entered the home textile business in 2006. In August, it also plans to launch its range of bed sheets in India under the Boutique Living brand. In the last decade, a handful of Indian home textile companies—Welspun, Alok Industries, Himatsingka Seide, Trident Industries and Indo Count—have carved out an enviable 47 percent share of the bed linen segment in the US market. Simply put, there is, today, an equal chance of bedding sets sold in the US being made in India or China, which earlier had a much larger market share. In India’s case, it took a smart set of entrepreneurs to tap this opportunity after the abolition of World Trade Organization textile quotas in 2005. What this meant was that countries could no longer discriminate about where the goods came from. As margins in the home textile business are far better, some companies decided to try their hand at this. But this is also a business that takes time to break into since retailers tend to be very finicky about whom they contract to. But once the contracts are in, they are inclined to be long-term and sticky. It is in this highly competitive and specialised business that Indo Count, run by Anil Kumar Jain, 63, and his son Mohit Jain, 40, has carved a niche for itself. As Mohit admits, “We looked at a whole host of other businesses, from flexible packaging to co-generation of power from sugar mills and hydropower, in the early 2000s.” The shift is remarkable, given that most of India’s textile companies are still in the spinning business and haven’t managed to make the transition to value-added products. Spinning is capital-intensive, where capacity needs to be added at regular intervals. And single-digit margins mean that companies can never earn enough to add this capacity without taking on debt. As a result, profitability is always low. But Indo Count has chosen to build itself differently. “This is an industry that is characterised by high capital expenditure, low return on capital employed and low asset turnover. Indo Count has chosen to outsource and so its use of capital is far more efficient,” says Sandeep Raina, vice president at Edelweiss Global Wealth Management Research. In the last five years, revenues have risen 25.5 percent annually to Rs 2,070 crore while profits have touched Rs 250 crore in the year ended March 31, 2016. Of Beginnings In 1990, before they started Indo Count, Anil Kumar Jain, chairman, was far removed from the textile business. “In 1975, my father had bought me a brewery and I ran it along with my cousin,” he says. During those days, his brother-in-law, based in Manchester, England, would often complain about the quality of yarn available in India. He convinced them there was an opportunity in the business, and that sowed the initial kernel in Jain’s mind. With the economy opening up, the government had also announced a host of incentives, including an exemption from import duties for factories set up as ‘export-oriented units’. Jain decided to get into the business and placed an order for machines from Reiter, a Swiss manufacturer. “There hadn’t been any orders from the Indian market for the last 30 years, so Reiter was reluctant to come back, but the demand was so high that when their representative landed in India, he had to also give appointments on the way from the airport to his hotel,” says Mohit Jain, managing director at Indo Count. Image: Courtesy: Indo Count Industries Indo Count’s manufacturing facility in Kolhapur, Maharashtra Anil went off to Kolhapur in south Maharashtra and bought land in a region known for its cotton. The company began operations in 1991 with a capacity of 12,000 spindles and with all the yarn being exported. Capacity was swiftly expanded to 60,000 spindles in the next five years and Indo Count clocked revenues of Rs 150 crore. Over the next 10 years, till 2005, the company continued to serve its clients. “By 2005 the company was debt-free, it had a regular dividend payout and had created an export-oriented culture where serving clients and supplying a high-quality product was paramount,” says KK Lalpuria, executive director at Indo Count. They then decided to leverage their balance sheet and make use of the government’s Technology Upgradation Fund to buy machinery. It was at this juncture that the company confronted a fork in its path.  In order to move into the business of manufacturing finished products (which has higher margins) Indo Count decided to outsource some part of its low-margin business of simply spinning and selling yarn, a move that most other spinning companies don’t make. At present, the company produces 30 to 40 percent of the yarn it consumes; the rest is outsourced. “We could have either continued to invest in the spinning business or moved up the value chain,” says Mohit, who, as a 29-year-old, led Indo Count’s charge into the home textile business. The phasing out of textile quotas meant companies like Dan River and Springs Global, which would earlier manufacture in the US, could now pay low import tariffs and import instead. At that point, India had a 10 percent share of the US bed linen market. Homing In Getting into the US home textile market takes a while. This is something Mohit would quickly learn. First, he engaged Swiss consultants Gherzi to help the company chart its entry into the market. Next, he started meeting buyers with a blueprint of their plans. He’d explain they had been in the yarn business for 15 years and were looking to enter the home textile business. Now, retailers are very careful about signing on new suppliers and getting their quality specifications right tests a lot of suppliers. On-time delivery is key and a missed shipment can permanently impair the relationship. Still, Indo Count managed to sign on Springs Global and Belk, a retailer based in Charlotte, North Carolina. There was no looking back then, though it would be three years before Indo Count’s manufacturing capacity of 36 million metres would be fully utilised.   That was in 2012. At the Kolhapur facility, the company has set up a state-of-the-art plant where yarn is processed. The cloth is then dyed and printed, and the bed sheets and pillow covers are ‘cut and sewn’ before being packed into boxes. Indo Count has now expanded capacity, in three phases, almost three-fold from 36 million metres to 90 million metres by December 2016. As an exporter, Indo Count has had to deal with three types of key risks over the years. First is a sudden fall in demand due to a recession in the developed world. “Could demand fall tomorrow? The answer is yes,” says Mohit, but he explains they have access to live data on what is selling at the retailers they supply to and so orders are tweaked accordingly. Second, Indo Count’s earnings are vulnerable to currency fluctuations. The company had an unfortunate experience in June 2008, when their erstwhile CFO signed a zero-cost derivative contract. This was a time when the rupee was quoting at 40 to the dollar and consensus was that it was expected to strengthen further. In order to lock in their dollar receivables, the company got into a contract that stipulated they would have to pay double the amount if the rupee depreciated. That is exactly what happened and Indo Count was saddled with a Rs 150 crore loss. “We just didn’t know what to do,” says Anil. They could have sued the banks that sold them the contracts as they were sold without being signed by two signatories. Instead, the company decided to repay what they owed. The decision resulted in Indo Count going for corporate debt restructuring, which set them back by at least three years. Although their customers were still serviced on time, payments to suppliers were delayed. Indo Count has now put systems and processes in place to ensure a repeat never occurs. They would typically hedge about 60 to 70 percent of their dollar receivables over the next one year and stick to pre-decided limits. “What I like about them is they don’t change their strategy based on short-term currency fluctuations,” says Abhishek Goenka, managing director at IFA Global, which advises them on their foreign exchange and treasury strategy. Indo Count’s credit rating has also allowed them to avail cheaper dollar borrowings, bringing down their overall cost of working capital. Third is the risk of cotton prices fluctuation, cotton being a key raw material. In the last month, a sharp and sudden rise in cotton prices has been an overhang on the sector. This was the result of low supply due to a poor monsoon in 2015. This led to the Cotton Advisory Board pegging the closing stock figure at 17 million bales in June. This has recently been revised to 43 million bales, which should lead to a tempering of prices. Indo Count says it has enough cotton to keep making yarn till November when a new crop should stabilise prices. The global cotton price index (the Cotton Season Index A) has risen 17 percent between April and July 2016 to 81 cents per pound. Indo Count has also decided to import cheaper cotton from Australia. However, they do concede that, going forward, rising prices could cause a dent in their Ebitda margins, which, at 21.5 percent, are the highest in the industry. The Road Ahead After having established Indo Count as a leading supplier of bed linen, the Jains once again had to brainstorm on the next steps, while leveraging on its existing strengths. The fashion bedding space, which comprises duvets, comforters, quilts as well as mattress protectors, was an obvious extension. Indo Count is also looking at institutional sales to hotels, a space that has so far been served mainly by Chinese companies. It has also set up B2B showrooms for retailers in New York, Manchester and Melbourne. For those who don’t want to order in large quantities and want to avoid the shipment or freight risk, the company has set up a warehouse in Charlotte to ship out bed sheets in smaller numbers. Indo Count’s bed sheets are also available on Amazon under their house brand. Later this year, the company plans to stock its own brand at retail outlets in the US. Typically, 75 percent of the stock at a department store is the retailer’s brand. Branded products by manufacturers (which Indo Count is targeting) make up the balance 25 percent, but yield higher margins. This is also a sign of the confidence of a manufacturer that its product will sell, since the risk of no-sale is with Indo Count. For the Indian market, Indo Count has tied up with Asim Dalal, who set up The Bombay Store, to market a range of bed sheets as a premium product—priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 9,000—through Indo Count Retail Ventures, in which Dalal holds a 20 percent stake. In the next five years, the company targets Rs 500 crore in revenues from the Boutique Living brand. As is evident, the business is about staying ahead of the game: For instance, the company recently came out with a patented fabric that absorbs body heat when it is hot and radiates it when it is cool. Innovations like these help Indo Count stay one step ahead of competition. And while some factors, like cotton prices, are beyond its control, it says it’ll do everything to ensure that nothing like the forex derivative loss happens again, even as they become more and more integrated into the global supply chain of their retail partners.

How to request old military records online Kim Komando, On Technology 12:06 a.m. ET Aug. 30, 2016 At Archives.com, users can request a family member's service records. (Photo: PhotoObjects.net, www.jupiterimages.com) QUESTION: Kim, help! My grandfather served in World War II. You mentioned a way to find old military records with a caller on your national radio show. What was that website called? ANSWER: Archives.gov lets you request a family member's service records and browse through photos captured during the war. It's a great place if you're researching family history or want to replace lost or damaged medals. Certain requests do require a $25 to $70 flat copying fee. Q: My daughter just started college and needs furniture for her new apartment. Where can I find cheap furniture that's still in good shape? A: Craigslist is a great place to look. Be sure to use specific search terms to find the best deals. "Moving," "divorce," and the phrase, "everything must go," are buzzwords that help locate truly motivated sellers. A jilted spouse, for example, may be willing to sell an ex's favorite chair for a dollar. Someone who's moving out of state may lower their price because they don't have room to take everything with them. Q: I have a slew of VHS tapes from the kid’s younger years. How can I get them into this century? A: Videotapes have a shelf life of only 10 to 12 years. As time passes, videotapes lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are your choices: Costco, Wal-Mart, and Walgreens will all transfer the old video formats to DVD. A Japanese company called Funai, the last company manufacturing VHS players, makes a device that transfers VHS content to DVDs. The device is inexpensive enough for home use and is available from a limited number of retailers. Q: I keep getting calls from an insurance company trying to sell me a policy. They always call back even though I hang up on them. How can I stop them from calling? A: Telemarketers are tricky. If you hang up without specifically stating you're not interested in what they're selling, most companies will mark you down as "No answer." So, they keep calling. Make sure your phone number is listed in the Do Not Call Registry. If you're really fed up, block these calls altogether. Q: Hi Kim! I'm visiting family next month and the airline recommends I arrive at the airport two to three hours before my flight departs. Is there any way to speed things up? A: The TSA recently introduced PreCheck to reduce wait times at security checkpoints. Visit TSA.gov/precheck to get started. You'll need to set up an appointment to provide the TSA with documentation, fingerprints and have a background check completed. The process takes a few weeks while the Department of Homeland Security determines your security threat assessment, and it costs $85. However, once you're cleared, your membership lasts five years and you'll be able to breeze through the security checkpoints at the airport. With the extra time you'll have on your hands, you might be tempted to browse the web while waiting for your flight.

Photos With Fluted Bezel Surface Ahead Of September Release By Pavithra R Posted on August 30, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Reports say the power-packed Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch will be launched at the IFA 2016 event, scheduled to take place in Berlin between September 2 and September 7. Samsung fans have seen some leaked configurations of the device in the past. However, now, two alleged photos of this smartwatch have surfaced ahead of the release. Samsung is already on cloud nine mainly thanks to the Galaxy S7 series and the?latest Galaxy Note 7. Good demand and sales are apparently keeping the South Korean tech giant busy. Samsung is also gearing up to introduce a 6GB variant of the Note 7 in selected countries. So you might wonder which other device this company could introduce at the IFA event. Apart from the Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch, the South Korean tech giant will also introduce the long-awaited affordable tablet?Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 in Berlin. Meanwhile, SamMobile just shared two alleged Samsung Gear S3 photos ferred out from a Walmart listing. Along with the smartwatch, a screen protector can also be seen in the photos. One look at the photos and you will know Samsung has followed a traditional real ?watch-like? look and feel. But then, many were expecting a design overhaul that would be in-line with the modern-day outlook and needs. Samsung Gear S3 (Photo Credit: Sam Mobile) Samsung Gear S3 (Photo Credit: Sam Mobile) Nevertheless, one can see the?metallic bracelet and the fluted bezel as rumored earlier. The plus point of having fluted bezel, similar to Rolex, is that it gives a sophisticated glossy look to the gadget. However, the traditional look makes many wonder if these photos are genuine or not. In any case, it is just a matter of days before Samsung shows up with the new smartwatch at IFA 2016. The South Korean tech giant will reportedly offer three variants of the Gear S3 and they are: Samsung Gear S3 Classic Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Samsung Gear S3 Explorer Furthermore, this watch lineup will run Samsung?s own Tizen OS out of the box. Rumor has it that, unlike the predecessor, the Gear S3 will come with a bigger display to make reading easier. Also, as you can see from the photos, the?round dial will be maintained. Technically, these dials are hard to manufacture when compared to the square counterparts like the?Apple Watch. What do you think of the alleged Gear S3 photos? Do you think this is how the smartwatch will look upon release? Feel free to leave a comment.

(Reuters/Danish Siddiqui) Share Written by Suneera Tandon August 30, 2016 Quartz india Despite the hype around foreign brands entering the country, here’s the bitter truth: Indian cities have a long way to go before offering shoppers access to the world’s biggest brands. India’s biggest cities performed abysmally in a survey by real-estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle, which mapped the presence of top global brands in 140 cities. Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru ranked at 92, 109, and 126, respectively, reflecting the absence of many of the 240 global brands that the survey tracked. These include fashion, food, supermarket and electronics brands, among others. London tops the list, while three Chinese cities show up in the top 10. Even a clutch of southeast Asian cities are ranked significantly higher than India’s largest metropolises. The Thai capital of Bangkok, for instance, is ranked 13. Indonesia’s Jakarta is at 24, while the capital of Philippines, Manila is at 29, and Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City is ranked at 37. City Rank London 1 Hong Kong 2 Paris 3 Dubai 4 New York 5 Shanghai 6 Singapore 7 Beijing 8 Kuwait 9 Tokyo 10 Bangkok 13 Jakarta 24 Manila 29 Ho Chi Minh City 37 Delhi 92 Mumbai 109 Bengaluru 126 India’s low rankings underscore the government’s sluggishness in making the country’s $600-billion retail sector more investor-friendly. Many large foreign brands, including Walmart, Apple, and IKEA, have spent years negotiating with the government to open owned stores in India. Policy backlog India eased the rules for foreign retailers such as IKEA and Walmart only in 2012. Before that, supermarket chains such as Walmart and Tesco, defined by the government as multi-brand retailers, could only invest in wholesale stores (that sell goods to large businesses and not end consumers). Single-brand retailers such as Tommy Hilfiger and Puma could enter the market only through local partners. But with India seeking to create jobs and boost economic growth, the incumbent Narendra Modi-led BJP government further liberalised the policies over the last two years. Investment apart, foreign firms are eager to cash in on the demographic dividend in Asia’s third-largest economy. India has the world’s youngest population and a burgeoning middle-class, making it attractive for consumer-focussed companies. That is why, ever since they were allowed to invest directly in the market in 2012, Swedish retailers H&M and IKEA have been busy expanding their footprint. While H&M wants to double its store-count to 12 by the end of the current year, IKEA plans to add 25 stores over the next decade. Some of America’s largest retailers, including GAP, Aeropostale, and Kate Spade, besides Japan’s Muji, have also recently opened shop in India.

(Source: FDA) (RNN) - Country Fresh of Conroe, TX, has recalled 30,000 cases of packaged fresh-cut vegetables out of concern they may be infected with listeria, according to an FDA news release. The products were shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia; and sold at Bi-Lo, Fresh Point, Harris Teeter, Publix, QuikTrip, The Spinx Co., Walmart and Winn-Dixie stores. The affected vegetables were packaged either in a clear plastic container or in styrofoam trays wrapped with a clear plastic film. A list of recalled products can be found here. Consumers who purchased the products should return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305 Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. CDT. “We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome and high-quality products available,” said Max Payen, Country Fresh’s Director of Food Safety.  The contamination potential was discovered after testing by the Georgia Department of Agriculture revealed the product tested positive for listeria. Country Fresh stopped distributing the affected products as the FDA and the company investigate.  Listeria is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in children, older people and those with compromised immune systems. Healthy people may suffer short-term systems such as high fever, headache, nausea, stomach upset and diarrhea. Copyright 2016 Raycom News Network. All rights reserved.

Photo by Ryan McDonald by Ryan McDonald This is the second in a series of articles exploring opinions on the forthcoming Downtown Specific Plan Tony Choueke would seem to have a lot to be upset about. As the owner of half a dozen commercial properties in downtown Manhattan Beach, he is among those most affected by temporary development limitations put in place as the city attempts to shape its downtown. But Choueke, a regular at city council meetings, is consistently complimentary during public comment, focusing on what the body is doing right. “I don’t think it’s helpful to be confrontational,” Choueke said. Choueke’s calm, careful demeanor has made him a useful advocate for property owners. He serves as secretary of the Manhattan Beach Commercial Property Owners Association, and frequently discusses the issues facing the city with fellow property owners. Looming largest is the city’s preparation of the Downtown Specific Plan, a document that would govern future land-use decisions in the area. The idea for a specific plan emerged due to concerns over the rapidly changing face of downtown. Banks and real estate offices were rapidly filling spaces once occupied by independent shops and boutiques; while these operations can reliably meet the area’s ever-increasing rents, they draw less foot traffic than restaurants and retailers, threatening the social energy of the area. Development of the specific plan has been long and complicated. The city released a 300-page draft in March, and is set to release a Mitigated Negative Declaration draft of the document this Thursday. To prevent further change to the downtown area while the document was being developed, the city enacted a “moratorium” on land-use changes in July 2014. The moratorium was extended a year later, and then replaced by an interim zoning ordinance in July of this year. The zoning ordinance has a similar effect, requiring a conditional use permit for commercial land-use changes in the area, and must be renewed every 45 days; the council unanimously voted to renew it at its August 16 meeting. And while Choueke and other business owners have been cooperative in the process, they are concerned at the prospect of the interim restrictions being enshrined permanently in the specific plan. “The problem with the moratorium is that it looks at the past; the specific plan is to address the future,” Choueke said. “The world is changing very rapidly. People looking at past models, thinking they are going to work in the future, are quickly going to be disabused of that notion.” Choueke, who formerly worked in consumer trend forecasting for Wal-Mart, said that local retailers were victims of forces that reverberate far beyond the boundaries of Manhattan Beach. The explosive rise in online outlets like Amazon has cut deeply into the margins of brick-and-mortar retail stores, he said, and has transformed the way people view shopping. “The idea of the moratorium is to prevent formula stores from coming in. But both formula and independent retailers face the same problem,” Choueke said, pointing to a string of bankruptcy filings in recent years for chains like Circuit City and Borders. Supporters like Kelly Stroman, head of the Downtown Business and Professional Association say that the moratorium, and now the interim ordinance, have provided peace of mind, allowing businesses to invest in improvements they might otherwise hesitate to make due to uncertainty. But by limiting the types of uses that may come into downtown parcels, the zoning ordinance arguably serves to suppress rents in the area: rates that a bank could afford are unreachable for low-margin retailers. When asked about the extent to which changes embodied in the moratorium threaten the bottom lines of local property owners, Choueke demurred, saying that his issue was the way the moratorium threatened the vitality of the town. “When you try to have a planned economy rather than a market economy, it will be detrimental,” he said. “You run the risk of stagnation, that’s the problem.” Councilmember Mark Burton, who helped spearhead the specific plan process, declined to say how the risk of “stagnation” was affecting the council’s progress on the specific plan, noting that the city’s Planning Commission still had several meetings to hold on the document. But he defended the original decision to impose the moratorium, noting that “quaint little downtowns” were disappearing all across the country, and said the decision helped preserve establishments locals depend on. “If we hadn’t put the moratorium in place, we might have lost our downtown,” Burton said. As part of preparing the specific plan, the city hired the Urban Land Institute (ULI), a Washington, D.C. nonprofit focused on land-use, to assess the downtown and provide recommendations. Tom Eitler, senior vice president of ULI’s advisory services program, said in an interview that while all retailers are facing challenges from the Internet, restrictions like those embodied in the moratorium have a place in zoning regulations. “Our position was, there needs to be some consideration of incentives to get the right solution,” Eitler said. “ULI as an organization believes when you have the market decide everything, you have a problem. But the same thing is true when you let the community decide everything. The best scenario is where they intersect.” In the event that the specific plan enshrines unfavorable aspects of the interim zoning ordinance into law, Choueke said property owners are unlikely to pursue a legal challenge. Instead, they are likely to simply pursue opportunities in other cities, leading to deterioration and disinvestment in Manhattan’s downtown. “Those people who have the will, the creativity and the desire to make positive moves will make positive moves elsewhere,” he said. “There won’t be any motivation to improve.” When asked what he would like to see in a future downtown, Choueke pointed to in-person services not vulnerable to being replaced by the Internet, such as lodging and eateries, and growing retail industries, like communications and health and fitness. He also thinks that the city needs to attract more young residents, and could do so by permitting apartments above commercial properties in the downtown area. Such a move, he conceded, would require loosening parking requirements, an idea that has proven deeply unpopular among residents scrambling for extant spaces. But it may be preferable, he pointed out, to being overly reliant on tourists to supplement the bottom lines of downtown businesses. “I don’t think the answer is to bring in more tourists,” Choueke said. “We don’t want this to look like Venice.” As the specific plan goes through ongoing revisions, Choueke said some local property owners, had begun to favor scrapping the document entirely, returning to how things were before the moratorium. Choueke said he did not favor such an approach, agreeing that the city needed to provide guidance. Property owners would be willing to make some sacrifices, he said, but they must receive something in return. “What commercial property owners feel is that they are being backed into a corner,” he said. “This deterioration of their rights may seem like a victory, but it will come back to haunt the city.” comments so far.

Officials with the foundation believe one of the best features of this fundraiser is that all of the money generated in the area stays in the community. "As donor myself, I like to know where my money goes and where it impact is," said Jodi Reid, President of the CMN of Amarillo. "Know that when you make a donation at the register you're changing a child's life in your community." The money goes to local hospitals and families and services a wide range of needs. "The grants can be for a variety of things including, medical bills, doctor visits, prescriptions and home modifications," said Reid. This campaign happens across the country at every Walmart and Sam's Club. The majority of donations are only $1, but last year the chains raised more than $60 million for hospitalized children.

The product in question was shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia under the Country Fresh and store brand labels described in the product listing.   “We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available,” Max Payen, Country Fresh’s director of food safety, said in a press release. The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, which revealed the finished product tested positive for the bacteria. The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.  The product bears “Best if Used By” dates between Aug. 7 and Aug. 19. The product is in either a clear plastic container as labeled below or in styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film as labeled below. No products except those on this list are subject to this recall. To date, no illnesses have been confirmed by public health authorities. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.   Videos Sunkist Minneolas now in season The Minneola tangelos, which is the largest piece of fruit in the mandarin family, is currently entering its prime...Read More Sightings   FPFC annual charity luncheon Dale Liefer of Pura Vida Farms and Dick Spezzano of Spezzano Consulting Services.

"The wholesale wrongness of the dollar store stocks going into this quarter is one of the greatest mispricings I have seen in ages. I know I had stopped flogging them going into last week. They had just run too much," the "Mad Money" host said. The drastic drop in dollar store stocks last Thursday came so fast, many unsuspecting analysts were left confused. It made Cramer wonder if everyone who follows Dollar General simply didn't understand the changed landscape. Getty Images A Dollar Tree store in Miami "The wholesale wrongness of the dollar store stocks going into this quarter is one of the greatest mispricings I have seen in ages." -Jim Cramer The shifting environment includes price competition from Wal-Mart, price deflation hitting all supermarkets, the 10 percent price reductions on average for 450 of Dollar General's best-selling items and the 500,000 people who lost federal food stamp eligibility. "I would normally want to take an interest in a high-quality company like Dollar General after such a huge decline, but what this decline tells me is that we are dealing with a gigantic reset," Cramer said. There are too many questions lingering for Cramer. Were more people than 500,000 affected by the cut in food stamps? How wrong is the price for Dollar General? And when did food deflation get so out control that any food retailer is now being crushed? Cramer needs more information than what is available surrounding these topics. He also questioned the effect that the trading-up of these dollar stores could have. Historically, dollar stores are counter-cyclical, meaning they do well when economies do poorly. He wondered if Wal-Mart and Target have cut prices so low that they are capturing customers back. So, if the issue was just food stamps, Wal-Mart or deflation, Cramer could price it into the stock. But the combination of an improving economy, an aggressive Wal-Mart, diminished food-stamp eligibility and poor communication from Dollar Store's management told him to pass. "Let these dollar stores go down to 90-cents on the dollar, then maybe we can think about taking a swing," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

View of traffic on South Santa Fe Avenue, looking through the new sculpture titled "Prima Vista" that's in the middle of Vista's first traffic circle at Eucalyptus Avenue. (Charlie Neuman) The results of the large survey are expected to assist the San Diego Association of Governments with making long-term regional planning decisions, including policies on where new developments should go, what highway and rail lines are the biggest priorities for improvements, and other big-picture issues that affect quality of life. SANDAG said it will ask 200,000 San Diego County households — approximately one of every five residences — to give information about where they go, how they get there, what it costs and other details. Participants will be asked to download rMove, a smartphone application that uses GPS technology, to track them when they commute, and provide an unprecedented level of detail on people's transportation choices. “Technology has really changed the scenario for how it’s all done,” said Cindy Burke, SANDAG’s director of applied research. Respondents who submit to the commute-tracking app will receive a $20 Amazon or Walmart gift card. Those who only agree to be surveyed by phone, mail or website will only receive a $10 card. Research firm Resource Systems Group has a two-year, $1.75 million contract with SANDAG for the survey. The contract includes the cost of the gift cards. The funding comes from the federal government. The results will update a 2006 study that found that on any given weekday, the average county resident makes 3.95 trips that take 17.86 minutes apiece, and that the most trips occur on Tuesdays. It also provided detailed analysis about the mode of transportation they used, where they started their trip and their eventual destination, amongst other metrics. “Without accurate and up-to-date data on how residents use the transportation network, we would not be able to develop effective solutions,” SANDAG’s chairman, San Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts, said in a statement. SANDAG hopes that around 55,000 households agree to participate, Burke said. It will be the first time that the survey will use mobile technology, and it’s expected that the data will be more comprehensive and detailed. Participants will download the app and then launch the program whenever they make a trip — as minor as a stroll down the block to snag a sandwich for lunch or as big as the rush-hour commute on the Coaster. It will help give insight into how people get to work to how they chauffeur their kids to sports practices, Burke said. “We’re taking steps to protect privacy and confidentiality,” she said. Data collection will continue through December, and the report is expected to be finished in the spring. SANDAG has used past surveys to gauge voter sentiment for a ballot measure on a new half-cent sales tax that would partially fund decades-worth of transportation projects. Some politicians and organizations, including the San Diego County Taxpayers Association, said the planning organization’s polling was an inappropriate use of public money that bordered on a way of persuading voters to support a tax increase. But data collection for this survey will not be finished until December and a final report not completed until the spring — well after the election. The survey does not ask any questions about the proposed sales tax increase, Burke said. The U.S. Census asks respondents about their transportation habits but largely focuses on the type of vehicle (or lack thereof) people use, and how long it takes them to commute. It doesn’t ask participants the routes they take to work, nor does it ask for their perspective on a region’s transportation systems. joshua.stewart@sduniontribune.com (619) 293-1841 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune Trips and Vacations Travel Networking Telecommunication Service Chargers Latest Most Popular Today's Paper Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help 58°

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next RIDGETOP, Tenn. - A Ridgetop woman shared her story after criminals used a card skimmer to steal her private information. She asked to remain anonymous since the man who stole her information was still on the run. Earlier this month the bank she uses contacted her about several purchases made on her card. "Three of them were from a Smyrna Walmart. I was like I've been at work all day, I haven't gone to Smyrna," she said.  Someone made multiple purchases, totaling more than $600. Investigators believe they gained access to her account through the internet or by card skimmers. "I don't use my card too often, mostly at gas stations," she said.  However, that's where officers said it's happening more and more often. Card skimmers can easily be placed over gas pump readers, ATM's and card machines in retail stores, making it easy for criminals to get personal information from each card that's swiped. "I'd never heard of those," she said.  Some gas stations are even posting signs, warning customers and stating they check their machines before and after each shift. The suspect who stole her information, however, was caught on surveillance video. Ridgetop Police said he made 25 visits to area Walmarts in a three-day span. "He's still out there and there are thousands of people still out there that haven't been caught," she said.  For this victim, it's a crime that's changed how she goes about her day to day business. "I do feel a lot more vulnerable now and I pay attention a lot more to where I'm swiping my card and who's around and where I'm at and where I swipe it," she said.  If you've seen the man in these pictures, contact Ridgetop Detective Ryan Tomlin at 615-384-4911 or 615-851-0203.

In West Jordan, Utah, an initial plan to offer some $240 million in tax breaks over two decades fell apart after several local leaders said the lure was too rich. Negotiations have since restarted. In New Mexico, The Los Lunas Village Council agreed to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments that start at $50,000 and top out at nearly a half-million dollars. The village has yet to provide a tally of the revenues it would forgo under a complex economic development agreement that also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time. Officials in West Jordan say they can hardly compete with the generous offer from the town of 15,000 people in New Mexico. Dave Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University, says West Jordan's initial offer was greater than the total combined tax breaks offered for seven other data centers in Iowa. "This is nothing but a giveaway," Swenson said. Tax deals worth hundreds of millions quietly helped finance a new industry that formed from an unlikely pairing of rural America and Silicon Valley.Los Lunas officials foresee a possible $1.8 billion construction project that provides as many as 300 direct temporary jobs, and just 50 permanent jobs thereafter -- a fraction of the steady employment at the local Walmart distribution center. Still, supporters of such deals see an opportunity to attract a hot company that would bring tax revenue despite the incentives and could attract other high-tech companies. "If you're in the market for a new car and this dealer offers a rebate for the same car and this dealer doesn't, where are you going to buy the car?" said Vale Hale, executive director of the Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development. Facebook's latest expansion comes as the social media giant looks to beef up its video presence, said John Harrington, a data center expert with Verify Research Associates. Video is increasingly the way to attract advertisers and eyeballs, but it also requires more space. Data centers are typically large facilities filled with rows of hard-drives and servers that store and process vast amounts of information. They're increasingly essential to the global economy, but on the ground they function more like storage facilities that need few people to keep them running. While the Facebook plan has been contentious in Utah, it's enjoyed broad political support in New Mexico, where the Los Lunas Village Council voted to sweeten the offer last week. New Mexico officials appear eager to please businesses willing to set up shop in a state hit hard by a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors, and where computer chip maker Intel has been steadily unwinding a major manufacturing plant that was an early beneficiary of similar property tax breaks using industrial revenue bonds. There's been some question about whether the estimated 50 jobs are worth the trouble, but state Rep. Alonzo Baldonado, R-Los Lunas, anticipates that construction will spill over into other parts of the economy. Among other infrastructure upgrades, three industrial-scale solar power plants would be built to offset electricity consumed by the data center. The plants would be paid for through a power purchase agreement with Facebook. "You don't know until it's on the ground when it comes to seeing the economic benefits," said Baldonado, a staunch supporter of the data center project. "You have to take risks sometimes." The once-struggling timber town of Prineville, Oregon, for example, is reinventing itself as a digital hub since attracting Facebook's first wholly owned data center with the help of a 15-year abatement on property taxes. But in Utah's relatively healthy economy, critics of the Facebook deal argue the land eyed by the social media giant could be developed by another outfit that would pay more in school-funding taxes and create more jobs. They also worry that new companies coming to the state will expect similar treatment.

Only a few know of the lane’s namesake, and fewer still remember the man personally. Joe Tanner lived in Oak Hill when residents numbered in the hundreds, not thousands; when Highway 290 was an unhurried two-lane road; when most families lived on ranches or farms.  Joe Tanner was an important part of Oak Hill – he was the local blacksmith. Only a line can be found written here and there about Tanner. But several local residents remembered him. The process of blacksmithing was impressive to onlookers. “All of the work was done with a coal forge, no electricity, no power tools,” said longtime resident Archie Ray Enochs. “Everything was hand-hammered and heated on a coal forge and hammered on an anvil. There was no electricity in the shop. [Tanner] was the only blacksmith here. There were a few people that had really small stuff of their own out in the barn or something like that, but for the most part everyone brought everything to Joe.”   Under a spreading chestnut-tree The village smithy stands; The smith, a mighty man is he, With large and sinewy hands; And the muscles of his brawny arms Are strong as iron bands.   A blacksmith usually heats metal until it softens and then “forges” it by using hand tools to shape it. Some blacksmiths, called farriers, specialize in shoeing horses, but the old-time smithy could make or fix anything. Towns depended on them. Longtime resident Bill Maddox said of Joe Tanner, “He was really, really vital to the community in the older times. I’m 70 – when I was in my teens in those early years we didn’t have people in the Oak Hill area who had modern equipment to weld equipment, so we went to Joe Tanner, who did hammer welding, heating metal where you took broken pieces and welded them together.” “He kept all the old farm equipment for the village maintained,” said Enochs. “There were a lot of small farms in this area, all down these creeks between here down around MoPac, 290. People farmed cotton, so they had to keep all their farm implements sharpened and maintained. Joe was the one that did it.” Maddox described the blacksmith shop as 16 feet wide by 20 feet long. “It had doors at north and south end, as I recall, so you could open both ends, to keep it cool in summer. He had an anvil and forge. He used coal to heat the metal, to hammer it out in different shapes. He was a real master at tempering things, crowbar, sharpening plow points, knowing just how to watch certain colors of fire, red, plunge it in the fire, and go to a straw color. He knew all these things. He was a really first class blacksmith, at a time when it was really needed by a lot of us. He was well thought of in the community; he performed a really important service.”     His hair is crisp, and black, and long, His face is like the tan; His brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate’er he can, And looks the whole world in the face, For he owes not any man.   Younger generations cannot fathom a time when they couldn’t run to WalMart or Target to purchase any necessity. Modern day farmers often send old farm equipment to junkyards because it’s cheaper to replace it than repair it. But that was not always the case. Joe was a second-generation blacksmith. Some of the locals remember him attending Oak Hill schools, so he most likely was a lifelong Oak Hillian. He may have been a little slow when it came to school subjects, but he was a whiz when it came to his hammer and anvil. Maddox recalled, “He was actually an artist at the work he could do. He made all sorts of things out of metal. Crowbars … He made a wash pot stand that was perfectly made, perfectly round. He had hammer-welded a used wagon wheel. It has metal rim. He used that wagon tire metal rim. It was a round hoop. The wash pot had 3 legs. The legs were about 2 feet high. With a wash pot you put a wood fire under it to get hot water to wash the clothes. It was really a beautiful piece of work.”   Week in, week out, from morn till night, You can hear his bellows blow; You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow, Like a sexton ringing the village bell, When the evening sun is low.   Doris Jean Ellison recalls the sound of Joe Tanner’s blacksmith shop. “What I remember as a child — he was right across from the school. The rock building, that’s the old Oak Hill School. So Joe Tanner’s blacksmith shop was right across 290 from the school, so you could hear him working, hitting the anvil hard, doing metal work.” Maddox also remembers the sound. “Going to school, old Oak Hill School, we could hear his hammering on the anvil all throughout the day. You’d hear him hammering on that anvil.” Maddox recalled of Tanner, “He was a very strong fella. In shoeing a horse, sometimes when the horse would want to jerk its foot away, he could overpower it so he could finish shoeing. People have an idea that a blacksmith was strong — he was.” The street now named for him “was a little gravel road,” recalled Enochs, with Joe’s shop at the corner.” It stood where now there is a median on Highway 290 West at Joe Tanner Lane. “He shod horses under the hackleberry tree. He’d tie a horse to the tree and if the horse was still unruly he would tie one foot up also to the tree and that made him a little bit easier to work with.” Enochs recalls the street now known as Joe Tanner Lane as “a shortcut to get to the shop from over around the Beckett property area, over off Brodie and McCarty and that area, and I think it was eventually improved a little bit and eventually became a county road. It was a gravel county road when I was a kid. And it’s hard to believe how many of the roads were unnamed at one time. So I suppose in trying to identify it, it was eventually called Joe Tanner Lane.”   And children coming home from school Look in at the open door; They love to see the flaming forge, And hear the bellows roar, And catch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing-floor.   Enochs said local children were always welcome at Joe Tanner’s shop. “You had to be careful not to step on something hot. The floor in the shop was dirt and there were bits of horse shoes, shoe nails and things laying all around along with plenty of hammers and things.” Ellison said, “He had a mulberry tree that we schoolchildren would go across and get leaves for silkworms.” On occasion, 7-year old Enochs was asked by his dad, Buster, to take his horse over to Joe’s to get shod. “It was nothing to lead a horse across Highway 290,” he said. “Look both ways and lead the horse across the 2-lane highway, it was easy enough to do.” Decades later Enochs still does impressions of Tanner. “Joe was somewhat of an eccentric,” he said. “He always said, ‘I say I say.’ Today I use that and locals know who I’m talking about.” Ellison said, “I thought so many times — people wonder who Joe tanner is because of the street. No one knows who in the world that was. He was a character. He was eccentric. Quiet. Kept to himself. Yet he was so visible with his shop, and his house and his garden. He was outside all the time. He was a unique person.” Tanner was not the hulking strongman people imagine when they hear the word blacksmith. “He was a small guy, kind of stooped from leaning over that forge and anvil,” said Enochs. Added Ellison, “He was a thin man. I think he wore overalls all the time, kind of hunched.” Maddox said, “He had horn-rimmed glasses, brown, I think. In later years he walked a little bent over. Seemed his posture was always like that. Might have been from bending over shoeing horses. I can’t remember … he was probably gray haired and bald, as I remember.”   He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boys; He hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter’s voice, Singing in the village choir, And it makes his heart rejoice.   Tanner never married. “He was a bachelor, he lived there by himself,” recalled Ellison. “He was just a single man. I don’t even remember him having a car. I don’t know how he got around. I think he went over to Miss Martin’s store. That’s where Austin Pizza is now. That was a hardware store, plus they had some food, too. And a glass candy showcase, I remember that.” But Tanner stayed busy despite the lack of a family. Enochs recalled, “I know they built quarry tools for the rock quarry industry — Convict Hill and other people around. And the county, as they improved county roads and widened them, had a whole crew of workers that did the fence work. They’d move the property fence over to widen the road, and I remember Joe … the county would bring all kinds of rock bars and stuff for him to sharpen — quite a few of those. It was almost an ongoing process to have the county fencing equipment in there being maintained.”   It sounds to him like her mother’s voice, Singing in Paradise! He needs must think of her once more, How in the grave she lies; And with his hard, rough hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes.   While Tanner had no family in Oak Hill, he was not alone. “He got bit by a rattlesnake in his garden,” said Enochs. “He killed the snake, put it in a paper sack, and walked over to the house and had my dad take him to the hospital and he stayed for a couple of hours and went back home. He took the snake to the hospital so he could show them what bit him. He was quite old when that happened.” Fortunately the snakebite, brought on by his passion for gardening, did not do him in. “He was an avid gardener,” said Enochs. “He had a garden all around the blacksmith shop and all around his house. And he worked in the garden barefoot.” Ellison remembered, “He gardened all the time, besides working in his blacksmith shop. He squatted down on the ground to do his work. It was so odd to see the way he sat. I just wish I had a picture of him working in his garden. I don’t know how he got his knees, and everything, squatting. I don’t know how to describe it. You’d think, ‘How did that man get in that position, old as he was?’ But he was comfortable.” Enochs said Tanner often gave sacks full of beans or okra to other gardeners who in return gave him some of their own gardens’ bounty. Maddox said Tanner had an outstanding garden. “He had the best snap beans, the best flavored. He had a perfectly kept garden. He took all the rocks out, so it looked perfect.”   Toiling—rejoicing—sorrowing, Onward through life he goes; Each morning sees some task begin, Each evening sees it close; Something attempted, something done, Has earned a night’s repose.   “I watched. Shoeing horses is backbreaking. You’re stooped, holding up the horse’s foot and working on it leaned over. It’s hard work,” recalled Enochs. “He did a lot of work, just tool sharpening, hand making things, tools, from discarded plow parts. He made hay hooks, also called fargo hooks, so you had a handle on it, and could hook a bale of hay. He made those probably from old hay rakes. He took the tines off of one, made it into a hook for lifting hay bales. Most of the time someone would buy them or bring an old hay rake piece and basically have it custom made to their specifications.” Maddox was impressed with Tanner’s work. “He was a master at what he did. Invaluable, indispensable to the community.” Maddox recalled Tanner sharing a new technology with the neighbors. “When I was really little, until about 4, we lived in Oak Hill, and we later moved further out, within hearing distance of Joe’s shop. He had a radio — a lot of us didn’t have one. It was the late 30s. Joe really seemed to be the only one with one in the immediate area. So he played it real loud. He wanted everyone to get the benefit. That was kind of a funny thing.” Another funny thing was his fondness for liquor. Ellison said her husband, Bill, remembered Tanner always had a bottle of wine. Added Maddox, “Joe used to drink a little. He didn’t really get drunk. One time I had a shoe heel come off. The teacher let me go over [to Tanner’s shop and] Joe put it back on. I gave him a quarter and he headed up the road about a mile to the beer joint — I don’t remember him having a car — to get a beer. But I never saw him drunk.”   Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus at the flaming forge of life Our fortunes must be wrought; Thus on its sounding anvil shaped Each burning deed and thought.   Maddox said, “My brother’s mare was the last horse that Joe shod, He gave me his tools, I guess getting into the mid-1960s. I used those tools myself. I started shoeing my own horse.” Tanner’s death was much like his life: quiet, unassuming. “He lived in Oak Hill as long as he lived,” said Maddox. “Right at the end he probably became disabled, and went into a nursing home. He had no relatives in this part of the country. A brother in California I never saw. I think he did go into a nursing home. I don’t know where he’s buried. I think in the Patton Cemetery. But I’m not sure about that. Enochs recalled, “When he had health, age problems, he moved to, I believe it was the Old Confederate Home on West Sixth Street, and I think now it’s University Apartments or something like that. He had no family, at least no family here. I don’t think anyone knows when he died. At some point they knew about it afterwards.” Matt Miller, a present-day blacksmith in Maryland, recently told a journalist, “You have to be an odd type of person to be a blacksmith. I’ve done a lot of trades, and blacksmith work is the most diverse. You get dirty every day and work yourself to the bone. But I always have fun.” We can only hope that Joe Tanner did as well.   Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus at the flaming forge of life Our fortunes must be wrought; Thus on its sounding anvil shaped Each burning deed and thought.   The Village Blacksmith, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Share Tweet this Share on Facebook Stumble it!

Many stories untold ,happened there. Reply By James Lovejoy, August 19, 2015 I grew up in Oak Hill. My grandparents lived on 290. There was only 3 houses between Hill’s Arena and the old Oak Hill school. My grandfather sold their garage to the Travis County Barn. I remember a man they called Booger Red that worked with my grandfather because he rode that horse. I knew Joe Tanner that lived across from the school.It would be great to preserve the old school. I was driving by the old school 20 plus years ago and saw a truck pulling out of the school’s drive way with a trailer loaded with metal. I slammed on the brake sand started honking my horn for the truck to stop. They pulled over and I ran up to the driver and asked what are you going to do with all that metal on the trailer. He said they were going to sell it to a metal salvage company.I quickly made a deal with them and bought the old merry-go-round that was being hauled off from the old Oak Hill school. We set it up at our house and still use it. It got a good work out last year when my niece got married at our house. My grandparents old house is where the Kingranch Turf Grass is today. Not many of us anymore who used to swim in Williamson Creek in Oak Hill. I miss those days Reply By Ellen Montgomery, August 4, 2016 Does anyone remember the Rowley families that lived on old Bee Caves Road?

Chatham-Kent police said the fire was under control before flames could travel and destroy the property. The cause of the fire was related to a power outage at the time and involved a stove, which was left on when the power was later restored. Police are reminding citizens to take extra care and attention when dealing with power outages to make your homes safe when the electrical supply returns while you are away or asleep. Arrested by two police services in one day A 40-year-old London man was arrested outside Walmart in Chatham after allegedly stealing merchandise on Sunday. Chatham-Kent police were called by store security who reported seeing the accused place several items in a vehicle without paying for the merchandise. When he went to re-enter the store, he was confronted by security. Police said he ran off and officers were able to locate him. Through investigation, police learned the man was also wanted on outstanding warrants by a neighbouring police service and he was turned over to London police. Late-night cleaning queried Two men spotted washing down a white Ford truck inside and out with spray bottles caught the attention of a citizen early Monday morning.

If you’ve ever noticed, Target locations always have those big red balls out front that are mostly just things for kids to climb on. I assume they are really meant to give you a place to hide from that 80-year-old lady who gets confused between the gas and brake, if you don’t want to get squished. Now, Target is taking those red balls and is turning them into giant Poké Balls in an effort to seem more hip. They may be a bit late to the party with recent reports showing that the popularity of Pokémon GO is on the decline. Still giant Poké Balls are cooler to look at than plain red balls and either one will keep said old lady from crushing you with her car.

 This chart shows how completely Amazon is dominating the retail market Eugene Kim Aug. 29, 2016, 1:36 PM 9,237 facebook linkedin twitter email print We know Amazon owns the online retail market. But exactly how well are they doing?  This chart by market research firm Baird Equity Research should give you a better idea: Baird Equity Research Here's what that chart means: Amazon sold 6 times more online than the next 8 largest retailers combined: Baird estimates that Amazon sold $59 billion worth of products in the second quarter of 2016. The eight big box retailers on the list, including Walmart, Target, and BestBuy, sold roughly $10 billion worth of products in the same period combined, according to Baird's estimates. Amazon's growth in online sales volume was 10 times higher than the 8 large retailers combined: Amazon saw its online sales volume, or gross merchandise volume (GMV), increase $14 billion year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016. The other 8 retailers saw their online sales volume grow only $1.3 billion over the same period, Baird says. That's 10X the growth in online sales volume than the other 8 combined. Amazon alone generated ~30% of US retail sales growth: The Department of Commerce data suggests US retail sales, which includes brick-and-mortar sales, grew by $31.5 billion year-over-year in the second quarter of this year. Amazon's North American GMV is estimated to have jumped about $9.1 billion year-over-year in the same period, which means it drove roughly 30% of total US retails sales growth, even though it has almost no presence in the physical retail space. This kind of growth perhaps explains why investors are so upbeat about Amazon's stock, while the rest of the big box retailer stocks largely remain flat: Yahoo Finance SEE ALSO: Here's another reminder that Amazon is crushing Microsoft and Google in the cloud NOW WATCH: Here's why your iPhone has a tiny hole next to the camera Loading video...

Is this Samsung's Gear S3 smartwatch? Posted: 29 Aug 2016, 11:47, by Ben R. Share Tweet Share Tags : Samsung-Samsung+ Tizen-Tizen+ Wearables-Wearables+ Even though the Galaxy Note 7 is now very much official, Samsung still looks poised to play a role at this week's IFA trade show in Berlin. The South Korean firm has, for example, already revealed that its Gear S3 smartwatch line will be unveiled during the big tech gathering alongside the Galaxy Tab S3. Thanks to a leak, we may have a glimpse at one of up to three potential models.  Shared by the folks at SamMobile, the images seen below depict a Walmart listing for a Gear S3 screen protector. As you can see, the watch has a very traditional look and feel, though it's seemingly doubtful that we're looking at the real deal here. It's more than likely that the watch illustrated is simply a placeholder, so we'll reserve our judgements until something a little more concrete arrives.  It is expected that Samsung will reel off three new smartwatch models in the near future; the Gear S3 Classic, Gear S3 Frontier and Gear S3 Explorer. Apparently, the Frontier and Explorer models will be aimed towards active consumers, while the Gear S3 Classic will be reminiscent of the current Gear S2.  If these images are representative of Samsung's next wrist computer, are you impressed?

The U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force and Bessemer police arrested Ashia Christine Huddleston, who also goes by the name Ashia Fletcher, just before 11 a.m. She was taken into custody at the intersection of Johns Road and Mud Creek Road in Adger. She was formally charged with murder this morning in the slaying of 49-year-old Tammy Huddleston. Her bond is set at $250,000. "On behalf of the family and the police department, we would like to thank everyone for their assistance,'' said Bessemer police Sgt. Cortice Miles. As police continue their investigation, friends are rallying around the Concord family. "She was a great mother that went far and beyond to help her kids,'' said friend Kimberly Clayton. "She not only raised her daughter and her son, but she was raising her daughter's two daughters. She ate, slept and lived for those grandkids." The slaying happened Saturday in the Bessemer Walmart parking lot. Witnesses told police the mother and daughter were in a physical dispute that ended in Tammy Huddleston's stabbing death. The daughter fled the scene with her boyfriend in a blue Nissan Versa after the stabbing. Tammy Huddleston died overnight Saturday at UAB Hospital from a stab wound to her side. The victim's son witnessed the slaying. Ashia Huddleston was later seen on Alabama 216 between Bessemer and Tuscaloosa County but continued to elude police until this morning. Miles said the boyfriend has been cooperating with the police. Friends said Ashia Huddleston was seen at her mother's home after the stabbing. Clayton said she messaged her and pleaded with her to turn herself in, but that she replied, "It was an accident," and then blocked her. Clayton said set up a Facebook page called #justicefortammyhuddleston. "Tammy was a good person,'' Clayton said. "I just want to see justice for her." "I hate that her daughter did this,'' she said. "I hope they lock her up for a long time. You don't murder the lady that brought you into this world and always had your back no matter what." Court records show Ashia Huddleston has previous convictions for drug possession in 2014 and theft of property in 2013. In the theft case, she stole gold jewelry. She was sentenced to one year in prison in that case. Friends have started a GoFundMe account to help pay for Tammy Huddleston's funeral. She leaves behind her husband, son and granddaughters. "She was loved by so many and has unfortunately been taken too soon, in a tragic loss,'' according to the fundraising site. "She leaves behind so many that miss and care for her deeply."

 Egyptian cotton sheets might not be what you think they are Kate Taylor Aug. 29, 2016, 12:12 PM 3,598 facebook linkedin twitter email print Target sold inauthentic Egyptian cotton bedding from 2014 to 2016 Target Egyptian cotton is widely seen as the most premium option on the market when it comes to bedsheets. But, there is good reason to believe that some — if not most — of the Egyptian cotton sold in the US is fake. Retailers including Walmart, J.C. Penny, and Bed Bath & Beyond are  investigating one of the biggest suppliers of Egyptian cotton in the world ,  following reports that their products were fake. Target recently announced it would be refunding more than $90 million to customers, after selling fake "Egyptian cotton" sheets for two years. Supplier Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing the sheets between August 2014 and July 2016, the company said. Egyptian cotton is considered some of the highest-quality cotton in the world, because Egypt is known for growing a type of cotton with especially long fibers. Longer fibers result in a softer and more durable final product, making Egyptian cotton the perfect choice for luxury bedding Similarly high-quality cotton can be grown in other parts of the world. However, cotton must be grown in Egypt in order to be considered real Egyptian cotton. That creates some problems. Less than 1% of all cotton produced in the world last year can be traced to Egypt, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Plus, Egypt's cotton production has been shrinking, impacted by economic and political upheaval, reports the Wall Street Journal. A farmer shows cotton on a farm in Qaha, a city in northeastern Egypt. Thomson Reuters Target's refund is the biggest and most public indication that something is afoot in the Egyptian cotton industry. However, there is reason to believe that Egyptian cotton knockoffs may be a problem that stretches far beyond Target's bedsheet business.  "When you think about it, 1% of the world's crops are Egyptian cotton. You walk into any store, or look at any one of these websites and see they're all selling Egyptian cotton — it just doesn't add up," Scott Tannen, founder of luxury bedding startup Boll and Branch, told Business Insider. "I think [the Target case is] just at the tip of the iceberg." Tannen has reason to be skeptical of the Egyptian cotton industry. When he founded Boll and Branch, he says he struggled to find Egyptian cotton suppliers who could trace their supply chains to Egypt. Now, selling cotton sourced from India through a supply chain the company built from the ground up, Boll and Branch needs to clear the hurdle of convincing customers that "100% organic" cotton is just as good as "Egyptian cotton" when it comes to luxury bedding. Boll and Branch attempts to convince customers that "Egyptian cotton" isn't the only kind of luxury bedding on the market. Boll and Branch While Tannen has an invested interest in exposing fake Egyptian cotton, he isn't the only one suspicious of the industry. Earlier this year, the Cotton Egypt Association found that 90% of "Egyptian cotton" sold by retailers tested using a DNA-based authentication program did not contain any cotton produced in Egypt. The association at the time held up Welspun as a symbol of success — something that has clearly since been called into question. If Welspun, one of the few Egyptian cotton suppliers that the Cotton Egypt Association has actually certified, can't be trusted, how can consumers know that they aren't being duped when buying bedsheets? Few retailers are willing to disclose who actually makes the bedsheets that they sell. Target told Business Insider that the company typically does not disclose which vendors make which products, and a customer service representative at Overstock.com, another major seller of Egyptian cotton bedsheets, said that as an "online retailer," the company   doesn't "have the information regarding the supplier." Companies including Walmart, J.C. Penny, and Bed Bath & Beyond who previously worked with Welspun are now launching investigations of their own into the sourcing of their Egyptian-cotton products. Egyptian cotton has become synonymous with premium cotton in the US. Now that retailers are investigating their supply chain, however, it may be harder for retailers to sell bedding as "Egyptian cotton" without providing customers with proof.   SEE ALSO: I bought a Costco vacation — here's why the retailer has completely changed how I book travel NOW WATCH: Here's what successful people eat for breakfast Loading video...

(Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com) Print Email Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com By Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com Sun News Email the author on August 29, 2016 at 11:29 AM, updated August 29, 2016 at 11:31 AM comments CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Every year when elementary school classes begin, there are hundreds of students within the Cleveland Heights-University Heights District whose families don't have the means to purchase necessary classroom supplies. Fortunately, there exists the service organization Park Synagogue Sisterhood, who for the past dozen years have raised the funds and bought supplies most needed by those young students. Each year, the women of the Sisterhood collect donations; personally shop for what is needed, based on recommendations made by teachers and CH-UH Schools social workers; then make sure the goods are delivered to the district's seven elementary schools. It all began when Phyllis Wachs, of Lyndhurst, retired from her job in a dental office. "A patient in our office was a mentor in the CH-UH District and told me, 'When you retire, I've got a job for you,'" Wachs recalled. Wachs soon found herself working as a mentor to students at University Heights' Gearity Elementary School, an experience she thoroughly enjoyed. Wachs, who at the time became the Sisterhood's president, initially got the organization involved by providing during the holiday season jackets, pants and other clothing, as well as toys to children from four or five large families in need. "You can picture that there were about a dozen ladies in their 70s, 80s and a couple in their 90s, who would go to Walmart to buy these things for kids," Wachs said. "We didn't know (the youngsters') names or their families' names. We just did it." About six years into the program, it was learned from teachers and social workers, that school supplies were badly needed, so that became the new focus. Today, Wachs is mainly helped by her ace shopper, fellow Sisterhood member and Lyndhurst resident, and cousin Debbie Scolnick, along with four Sisterhood volunteers. Scolnick, a teacher of 38 years who retired in 2011 from the Mayfield School District, still enjoys helping children. She does the shopping for the items, which include backpacks, crayons, glue sticks, markers, pencil sharpeners, notebooks, erasers and more. "I still had the urge to buy school supplies," Scolnick said with a smile. "I love shopping." True to the giving spirit of all involved, the effort does not end with providing school supplies in August. Just before Thanksgiving each year, the Sisterhood provides 300 pairs of gloves, as well as scarves and hats to children who need them. Wendy Burkey is one of four social workers in the CH-UH District. Speaking of the Sisterhood program, Burkey said, "It is a lifesaver for teachers that all their kids are able to get supplies. The children are so excited to pick out the color of notebook they want or the pencil they want. It's something that becomes their own." Burkey said the youngsters are discreetly given the supplies out of view of their classmates and get the opportunity to choose the supplies they need that most catch their eyes. She said that, if needy children transfer into the district during the school year, they are also given an opportunity to select supplies. In all, Burkey estimates that 50-70 children per school are in need of supplies. "We are just so appreciative of everything Park Synagogue has done, and to the two women (Scolnick and Wachs) who do all the shopping and organizing." "That's how I was raised," Wachs said of her desire to help those in need. "It's something you do because it's the right thing to do, not because you expect to get a thank you." Of their anonymity in the eyes of the children and parents helped, Scolnick said, "When you're giving something, you're not supposed to say who it's coming from." With Thanksgiving three months away, and another school year always around the corner, the Park Synagogue Sisterhood, a group that provides several services to the community while working out of the synagogue's Cleveland Heights and Pepper Pike locations --is always in need of monetary donations. Monetary donations, Wachs explained, allow the Sisterhood to buy exactly what is needed.

(NFLX) Is a Sell Out of the Gate: Axiom Netflix stock has a hard time with overvaluation. Spending more than it's collecting isn't helping matters.

(MU) Stock Is Screaming Buy … On Any Dip View All Posts Stock research outfit Axiom doesn’t deny that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has several things working in its favor, like its award-winning original content and the fact that it’s the market leader. (Largely because Netflix built the on-demand, over-the-top category itself). On the other hand, with costs soaring and competition on the rise, Axiom sees no choice but to begin its coverage of Netflix stock with a “Sell” rating, suggesting a target price of $80 for NFLX. Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified) That’s 18% below Friday’s closing price for Netflix stock. The opinion has already ruffled some feathers among diehard Netflix investors who love the growth story. They are quick to point out it was just Friday when RBC Capital Markets sang the company’s praises, reiterating its $130 target price for NFLX stock. Moreover, on Monday morning, BTIG Research forecast Netflix would garner 6.58 million new subscribers (worldwide) in the second half of 2016, versus the 83 million it currently has. Axiom may have a point, though. Costs and long-term liabilities are reaching uncomfortable levels. NFLX: Not Like It Used to Be Giving credit where it’s due, Netflix is still the king. In a recent J.D. Power survey, it edged out rival Hulu in terms of overall satisfaction. It was alarmingly close, though. Netflix scored a total of 829, and Hulu scored 821. Vudu, owned by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), was surprisingly competitive with a score of 810. Missing from the mix were relatively young SlingTV, from Dish Network Corp (NASDAQ:DISH), and a very new service from Sony Corp. (NYSE:SNE) called PlayStation Vue, both of which offer a blend of network broadcasts in addition to a wide variety of on-demand content. Netflix holds a commanding lead on both in terms of market share, but the fact that Vue and SlingTV were able to launch and attract users at all makes it clear that consumers are ready to consider other choices. 7 Stocks That Could Fall to the “Restaurant Recession” In other words, NFLX has some real competition it didn’t have before. Axiom’s call simply acknowledges this reality, even if other observers see the current Netflix as the competition-free Netflix of yesteryear. It’s ultimately a matter of math and the business model. Netflix leases a lot of great content from studios, and what it can’t find, it makes for itself. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are just a couple fan-favorite originals. It’s good content, but it’s not cheap. Netflix Stock Weighed Down by Costs Netflix will spend $6 billion on its own programs this year. For perspective, the company has generated $7.6 billion worth of revenue over the course of the past twelve months. Entrenched owners of Netflix stock will point out that it’s an investment that’s paying off. The company reported income of $40.7 million last quarter on $2.1 billion in revenue. The figures were up 54% and 27% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. The figures don’t tell the whole story, however — the way Netflix books the expenses for its content can obscure the math. The operational cash flow for the quarter was a negative $226.3 million, which marks eight straight negative cash flow (operating) figures … most of which have been sequentially bigger than the previous total. And with that as the backdrop, the question of expenses versus revenue growth arises. In a nutshell, as fast as the top line is growing, content liabilities and expenses are growing even faster, including non-current (future) liabilities. The chart below plots the changing fiscal situation for Netflix. Click to Enlarge Something has to change soon; the current math doesn’t make sense for Netflix stock, which is presently trading at trailing P/E of 305 and a forward-looking P/E of 110. Neither are even in the realm of being close to reasonable. Bottom Line for NFLX For the record, CEO Reed Hastings has said the company will become meaningfully profitable in 2017, presumably with a combination of more subscribers growth and relatively less spending on … well, everything. It leaves one wondering, though: Does the company’s subscriber growth ultimately depend on spending growth? Hastings doesn’t seem to think so. Or, at least he’s not saying it. 7 Companies That Could Go Bankrupt Soon Whatever the case, even if NFLX is capable of curtailing its costs and growing its headcount, the triple-digit P/E ratios don’t leave room for much upside — particularly with SlingTV, Vue and Hulu making waves — even if Netflix performs heroically beyond 2017. Axiom is just asking a good question, and answering it with a plausible response. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan / AP) A recurrent theme in major speeches given last month at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia held that Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton look to “we the people” instead of rich, powerful and purportedly great individuals like Donald Trump to guide the United States. Repeating a prominent refrain in Obama’s 2008 campaign, top Democrats said the operative words for Americans aren’t “I” and “me” but rather “we” and “us,” as in “si se puede” (“yes we can”)—a chant repeated during Tim Kaine’s and Obama’s speeches. Here’s how Hillary Clinton worked this leitmotif in Philadelphia: Don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We’re not. Don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don’t believe anyone who says: “I alone can fix it.” Those were actually Donald Trump’s words [at the Republican convention] in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? “I alone can fix it?” Isn’t he forgetting? … He’s forgetting every last one of us. Americans don’t say: “I alone can fix it.” We say: “We’ll fix it together.” Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Americans [will “Stand Together” to build] a country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. The Revolving Door That was all very stirring, but who actually comprises the “we” that makes executive branch policy in the name of the common good when either Democrats or Republicans hold the White House? Not the nation’s working- and middle-class majority, that’s for sure. The Dutch political scientists Bastiaan van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff recently constructed a richly detailed career profile of the U.S. presidency’s top “grand strategy makers” (GSMs)—holders of key policymaking cabinet and senior advisory positions—over the administrations of the 42nd, 43rd and 44th presidents: Bill Clinton (1993-2001), George W. Bush (2001-2009) and Barack Obama (2009-2017). Their findings are like something out of Karl Marx’s and Frederick Engels’ notion of “the executive of the modern state” as “nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.” By van Apeldoorn and de Graaff’s calculations, 23 (more than 70 percent) of Obama’s top 30 GSMs had “top-level corporate affiliations”—executive, director, senior adviser or partner in a law firm—prior to their appointment to the U.S. executive branch. These 23 were linked through a combination of board memberships, executive positions and advisory roles to 111 corporations. These “affiliations in many cases display a revolving door pattern, indicating that the actors are not just closely tied to but actually themselves members of the corporate elite.” Elite travelers in and out of top positions in the Obama White House include Timothy Geithner, Jack Lew, Peter Orszag, Ken Salazar and Tom Donilon. Geithner went from being Citigroup Chair Robert Rubin’s handpicked head of the New York Federal Reserve Board to serving (Wall Street) as Obama’s first Treasury secretary to his current position as CEO of the leading Wall Street private equity firm, Warburg Pincus. Before replacing Geithner atop Treasury, Lew was chief operating officer at Citigroup’s alternative investment division, focused on risky and complex proprietary trading schemes. Orszag left his position as Obama’s Office of Budget Management director to become vice chair of global banking and chair of financial strategy and solutions at Citigroup and now serves as vice chairman of investment banking and managing director at Lazard. (Salazar and Donilon will be discussed later in this report.) “Perhaps,” Robert Reich writes, “it was not entirely coincidental that the Obama administration never put tough conditions on banks receiving bailout money, never prosecuted a single top Wall Street executive for the excesses that led to the financial meltdown and even refused to support a small tax on financial transactions that would have generated tens of billions of dollars in annual revenues and discouraged program trading.” The ultimate ruling-class, revolving-door role model is Rubin himself, mentor to both Geithner and Orszag. Before his positions at Citigroup and his continuing place co-chairing “Wall Street’s Think Tank”—the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—Rubin chaired Goldman Sachs and then became Bill Clinton’s top economic adviser and Treasury secretary, serving as the chief architect of the financial deregulation that helped set the stage for the epic financial crisis of 2007-2009. Citigroup was the leading immediate beneficiary of that deregulation and would be the financial institution that exposed the federal government to the greatest potential loss during the great state-capitalist bailouts that followed the epic financial implosion that Citi and other top banks caused. This oligarchic composition of top White House personnel is hardly unique to the age of Obama. Twenty-one (70 percent) of Bush II’s GSMs (linked to 87 corporations) and 18 (60 percent) of Clinton’s GSMs (linked to 48 corporations) held such elite corporate stations. The numbers get worse when you include GSMs who took such positions after they served in those presidencies. Broadened that way, the numbers for Clinton are 25 of 30 (83 percent) linked to 197 corporations and 27 of 30 (90 percent) linked to 157 companies for George W. Bush. By last year, seven former Obama GSMs had rotated back into top corporate roles after their White House stints. The leading faction of capital represented in these GSM positions across the last three two-term presidencies is the financial sector and is overwhelmingly linked to “transnationally oriented capital.” Van Apeldoorn and de Graaff find that the “overall composition of the corporate background of these grand strategy makers” is “broad in terms of sectors,” with “U.S. transnationally oriented capital” in the lead and “the financial sector predominat[ing] among the corporate links of all three administrations.” Finance’s prevailing role indicates the global orientation of the Fortune 500 interests that hold sway in the U.S. presidency, “as financial capital is by definition more transnationally mobile than productive capital.” The legal and consultancy firms (e.g., Kissinger Associates) that have together provided more than a fifth of all GSMs since 1993 principally represent multinational corporations and investment firms. Perhaps it is not entirely coincidental that the last three presidential administrations have overseen a significant loss of jobs and opportunity for the working-class majority in an ever more globalized New Gilded Age wherein the top 0.1 percent owns roughly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent—an age of neoliberal austerity for the many, and vast governmental subsidy, protection and bailout for the wealthy few. The Policy Planning Group Filter The revolving door between top corporate/financial and government positions and the promise of heightened remuneration in the “private” sector (after one does Big Business’ bidding while “serving” in the “public” one) is a very big and often underestimated part of this overall system of class rule. Also unduly neglected is the role that elite neoliberal and corporate-financial-networked policy planning bodies play in staffing, socializing, solidifying and doctrinally schooling top U.S. executive branch personnel. The key institutions here are the CFR, The Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Rand Corp., The Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Brookings Institution, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Hoover Institution, the Carnegie Corporation of New York/Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, The Rockefeller Foundation, the Foreign Policy Association, the Committee for Economic Development and The Bretton Woods Committee. These core policy organizations (with the CFR in the lead) share three basic properties: a strong commitment to the domestic and global “Open Door” expansion (non-territorial but not without considerable reliance on the U.S. and U.S.-sponsored military force) of American transnational “free market” capitalism (corporate, state and financial); principal funding by transnationally oriented Fortune 500 corporations and financial institutions; the ubiquitous presence of their top personnel both in the elite “private” (corporate, financial and legal) sector and in White House GSM positions. Of Obama’s 30 GSMs, van Apeldoorn and de Graaff find, fully 25 (83 percent) held prior top affiliations with one or more of these planning groups, totaling 162 such affiliations. The elite policy groups’ presence was slightly higher in the Clinton White House (26/209) and similar in the Bush presidency (22/211). Another part of the not-so-popular profile for those who become GSMs, supposedly planning domestic and foreign policy on behalf of “we the people” in the U.S. presidency, is training at one or more of the nation’s and world’s elite ruling-class universities, where neoliberal ideology and values prevail. Twenty-five of Obama’s (himself Harvard Law-pedigreed) first 38 Cabinet and top advisory picks had a degree from an Ivy League university, MIT, Stanford, the University of Chicago, Oxford or Cambridge. “Lady Klynton Kissinger Sachs” Will things be any different in the likely Clinton 45 White House? One would have to be very naive to think so. It’s not for nothing that Hillary Clinton is known on Wall Street as “Lady Klynton Kissinger Sachs.” The consistently war-hawkish Clinton is the quintessential power-elite and ruling-class insider.  She was minted and socialized at such ruling-class institutions as Oxford, Yale Law, Rose Law, the Wal-Mart board of directors, the Democratic Leadership Council (dedicated to pushing the Democratic Party further to the corporate-friendly right during the 1980s and 1990s), the White House (eight years as a highly policy-empowered first lady), the globalist Clinton Foundation, the CFR and the U.S. State Department. She and her husband “operate in … a world awash in money and connections … [a] very privileged place,” as The New York Times’ Carolyn Ryan recently said. She is the candidate of campaign finance and of (exorbitant) speaking-fee choice for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, the CFR, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Robert Rubin and the rest of the nation’s transnationally oriented corporate and financial aristocracy—including a remarkable number of pinstripe Republicans who do not trust the “unhinged” Trump. As New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd cleverly reflects: All these woebegone Republicans whining that they can’t rally behind their flawed candidate is crazy. The G.O.P. angst, the gnashing and wailing and searching for last-minute substitutes and exit strategies, is getting old. They already have a 1-percenter who will be totally fine in the Oval Office, someone they can trust to help Wall Street, boost the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, cuddle with hedge funds, secure the trade deals beloved by corporate America, seek guidance from Henry Kissinger and hawk it up. … The Republicans have their candidate: It’s Hillary. Personnel Is Policy But it’s not just about Hillary Clinton. It takes a ruling-class village to make policy for the few in the name of the many. Clinton’s vice presidential pick, Tim Kaine, is a financial-sector darling who backed fast-tracking the arch-global corporatist, Wall Street-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Her campaign manager, John Podesta, is a legendary ruling-class inside-outsider. A former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, Podesta has headed a major Washington, D.C., lobbying firm whose clients have included BP, Citigroup, Wal-Mart and Lockheed Martin. He founded the Center for American Progress (CAP), which has become a virtual policy arm of the neoliberal Obama White House and—as The New York Times reported after Obama appointed him as a special adviser in December of 2013—“taken millions of dollars in corporate donations and has its own team of lobbyists who have pushed an agenda that sometimes echoes the interests of those corporate supporters.” The CAP poses as a “progressive,” even “left-leaning” alternative to right-wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, but it really embodies a kind of reconstructed “Third Way neoliberalism” that is deeply captive to global corporate and financial interests. Podesta is also president of the Clinton-Kaine Transition Project. Clinton’s presidential transition team is what the liberal-left political commentator and activist Norman Solomon calls “a corporate presidency foretold.” Besides Podesta, the team’s chair is Salazar, a former U.S. senator who strongly supports the highly unpopular TPP and angered environmentalists and cheered Big Carbon by backing offshore drilling and fracking during his years as Obama’s secretary of the Interior. He’s a partner at WilmerHale, one of the world’s most politically powerful law firms, representing multinational capital at home and abroad—making him another example of the revolving-door phenomenon. Also on Clinton’s transition leadership team is Donilon, a member of the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee. After serving as Obama’s national security adviser from late 2010 through the spring of 2013, he became a distinguished fellow at the CFR and resumed his prior longstanding position as a partner in the leading multinational corporate law firm O’Melveny & Myers. Other senior Clinton transition officials are longstanding, Democratic Leadership Council-style operatives Neera Tanden (a Yale Law graduate and president of the CAP), Maggie Williams (partner in a leading Washington, D.C., management consulting firm and former director of a top mortgage lending firm that collapsed in late 2007) and Harvard Law graduate Jennifer Granholm (whose pro-Big Business record as a two-term Michigan governor helped score her lucrative positions on the boards of Universal Forest Products Inc. and Dow Chemical). According to William K. Black, who has held top federal regulatory positions, what we are seeing in this group “is complete domination by what used to be the Democratic Leadership Council. … Very, very right-wing foreign policy. What they call a muscular foreign policy … a euphemism for invading places. Very, very tough on crime … [and pro-] mass incarceration. And the economic side, all in favour of austerity. All in favour of privatization. Tried to do a deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. And of course, were all in favour of things like NAFTA.” It’s no small matter. “The transition team,” Black notes, “is the one that is both deciding what are we actually going to make our policy priorities in the magic—again a cliché—first 100 days? But more than that, who will the top people be?” There’s something of a false dichotomy in Black’s knowledgeable reflections. A longstanding and accurate Washington maxim reminds us that personnel is policy. And there’s a translation for what Black calls “our policy priorities.” The real meaning is their policy priorities, with “they” referring to the 0.1 percent. “It’s Just Politics” What about Clinton’s widely advertised, Bernie Sanders-influenced “shift to the left” during the recent primary campaign? A report published last year in the widely read insider Washington journal Politico was titled “Hillary’s Wall Street Backers: ‘We Get It.’ ” As Politico explained, “Populist rhetoric, many say, is good politics—but doesn’t portend an assault on the rich. … It’s ‘just politics,’ said one major Democratic donor on Wall Street.” A Democrat at a top Wall Street firm told Politico that Clinton’s outwardly populist rhetoric was “a Rorschach test for how politically sophisticated [rich] people are. … If someone is upset by this it’s because they have no idea how populist the mood of the country still is.” Hillary’s Wall Street bankrollers have always known populace-pleasing, egalitarian-sounding rhetoric is just part of the game. It goes with the populism-manipulating territory that lies at the longstanding, dark heart of American “capitalist democracy.” They reasonably expect a President Hillary Clinton to drop her current, nominal opposition to the TPP as soon as possible. The People Who Own the Country … It’s common to see all of this as discontinuous with, and even as a betrayal of, the U.S. founders. It’s a comforting but historically gullible sentiment. While Clinton is correct that the nation’s founding elites rejected monarchy, she failed to note that they led a national independence movement and wrote a Constitution to create a militantly undemocratic property-owners’ (including slave owners’) republic founded on the belief that—in the words of leading constitutional framer John Jay—“the people who own the country ought to govern it.” The New England clergyman Jeremy Belknap captured the fundamental idea behind the founders’ curious notion of what they liked to call popular government. “Let it stand as a principle,” Belknap wrote to an associate, “that government originates from the people, but let the people be taught … that they are unable to govern themselves.” There is a difference, however, one that actually reflects better on the aristo-republican founders than on today’s corporate and financial ruling class. Prior to the onset of the neoliberal era in the 1970s, Noam Chomsky has noted, the United States “had been, with ups and downs … a developing society, not always in pretty ways [quite an understatement—see this at once brilliant and horrifying history of U.S. cotton slavery], but with general progress toward industrialization, prosperity and expansion of rights.” Since the triumph of finance capital, however, it’s been about “de-development … a significant shift of the economy from productive enterprise—producing things people need or could use—to financial manipulation.” It’s also been about obliterating decent American jobs through technical displacement and capital and jobs export and the ruination of livable ecology—the cancellation of a decent future and the economy and society “where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach.” The only reason that a dangerous, white-nationalist, uber-narcissist and Breitbart-wielding hatemonger like Donald Trump—with his bombastic promise to “make America great again” partly by restoring lost U.S. industrial supremacy—is even still in shouting distance of Clinton is that millions of working- and middle-class Americans know in their bones that she is part of that great dark cancellation, foreclosure and enclosure. © 2016 TruthDig Paul Street Paul Street holds a doctorate in U.S. history from Binghamton University.

Volunteers and staff were taking care of the little details Aug. 28 – three volunteers started marking out the vendor spots on the Admiral’s Walk, truck loads of portapotties were being dropped off all around town, barricades too were being readied, signs painted, rooms readied and supplies laid in. Digby’s Mayor Ben Cleveland was attending to one last important detail. “I’m registering my 1985 Honda 750 Shadow and my daughter’s boyfriend’s bike,” said the Mayor. “Digby is excited to welcome the rally once again and open our doors to bikers from all across North America. “We hope everyone can respect their neighbours and have a good time.” The mayor is planning some good times for himself. His daughter Sarah is looking forward to riding with him through town on Saturday on the back of his Honda. And the mayor is challenging riders to a drift tryke competition 5 p.m. on the Digby wharf. Bean’re and Rick Crane and probably J.D Boyd, in his kilt, will be competing. Laura Simms executive director of the rally says she is working on finding some more talent to challenge the mayor. One thing Simms has confirmed this week is the flyover from Greenwood in honour of the late rally board member and Canadian army veteran Darren Williams. An Aurora, the type of plane Williams served on, will fly over the Digby waterfront Friday evening right after opening ceremonies. TRAFFIC The street closures and traffic flow changes start Friday Sept. 2 at 8 a.m. Water Street as always will be motorcycles only, flowing north. First Avenue will be open to all traffic but flowing south only. Queen Street will also be open to all traffic but flowing north only. People trying to park close to the downtown should remember not to block private driveways or park on private property without permission, but also drivers who park on the travelled portion of the road are subject to tickets and towing. Anyone looking for a missing vehicle could try Brinton’s Auto Salvage at 902-245-2927. Simms says a better option is to park up the hill or in Conway and to take the shuttle downtown. PARK AND SHUTTLE The Wharf Rat Rally shuttles run from the Walmart / Atlantic Superstore parking lot to downtown with stops across from Sunset Pub, in front of Guy's Frenchys, in front of the NSLC / Sobeys, at the Welcome Centre in the Evangeline Mall parking lot and at the Digby arena. The shuttle will run along Victoria, turn onto the Racquette Road and then onto First Avenue. There will be stops on First Avenue in front of town hall and behind the Wharf Rat Rally headquarters. Heading out of town, the bus will go to the Welcome Centre and back to Walmart. Riders can ask the driver to stop all along that route. Once riders are registered, they can meet Bean’re at the big Tim’s at 9:45 a.m. Aug. 31 for the first rally event this year: Ride with Bean’re to longterm care facilities in Bridgetown and Middleton. The full schedule for the rally is wharfratrally.com/enjoy-the-rally/schedule. Riders will be able to test their bike speed with the time trials at the airport again this year – or if they’re more into technical driving, a trial course involving ramps and bumps will be set up at the Sobeys parking lot Saturday, Sept. 3, noon to 3 p.m. FOOD VENDORS The rally is expecting a few new food vendors this year: Swiss Chalet will be selling ribs, C.S. Elliot Trading Company will have scones and coffee for breakfast and meat pies later in the day. Meadownbrook Meat Market is bringing their pulled pork, Tandoori Chicken will be here, and ShanGRILLA Foods will have falafels and more. Not to mention regulars like Manzer’s Sausages, Andrews Fish and Chips, Monster Fries, Beavertails, Maurice’s Belgium Waffles and Mini Donuts. Organizers have squeezed in a few more vendors by adding a vendor loop between the gazebo bandstand and the visitor information centre. Anyone travelling the loop can fill out a ballot to win a GPS for their bike or a bike windshield. Plus Nova Scotia Power will be set up on the loop and they’ll be having a draw for a $5,000 heat pump system. A complete list of confirmed vendors, builders, demo rides, tours, runs and rides, entertainment and dining venues is available on the Wharf Rat website and via the free app for your smartphone or tablet. jriley@digbycourier.ca E-Editions Shelburne County Coastguard Do not miss your latest complete newspaper edition.

This bacterium is fatal. According to Country Fresh officials from Texas, the recall receive some products delivered to the MS, AL, GA, FL, both Carolinas, Virginia, Kentucky, and TN. All this food has labels from the Country Fresh and such stores as Publix, Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie, Harris Teeter, Bi-Lo, Quik Trip, Fresh Point, and Spinx. They recalled all the products that were signed with the note “use by” from August 7 to 19. There are plenty of different infections that listeria can bring. It has a huge influence on children and weak people. Even very healthy clients can receive the whole symptoms with a fever and different pains. One patient has died in Connecticut in the epidemic in four states of listeria that was this year, few months earlier. Officials have listed all the products that were recalled. Among them onions, celery, fajita mix, diced pepper, grilling vegetables, mushrooms, green been, and so on. They recalled 45 types of fresh veggies. There are 30 000 different possibilities of harmed products. The list is available at the official website of the Country Fresh Inc. Right now there are no cases of complains on listeria. It was discovered during an ordinary test in Georgia, by the Agricultural Department. All the products were cut in the plastic clear containers or wrapped in the clear package, also made from plastic. As far as the products were stamped with the early dates, it is possible that consumers have already bought them.

Paul Portland what they considered a logical explanation. Salvatorian Fr. Joe Rodrigues, U.S. provincial and National Vocations Director, prays over Simon Muema, during Mass on Sunday, Aug. 14, when Muema made his first profession as a Salvatorian. (Catholic Herald photo by Peter Fenelon) “He just wanted to leave and didn’t want to tell you,” Fr. Portand recalls being told when he went to the police station to file a missing person’s report. Fr. Portland, director of candidates for the Society of the Divine Savior (Salvatorians), explained that a report was eventually filed for the missing Muema, but it was considered non-critical because the police thought he likely left of his own free will. Muema, 40, a native of Kenya, who came to Milwaukee and joined the Salvatorians in July 2014 with the intention of becoming a priest, was last seen volunteering at the St. Ben’s meal program on Sunday evening, Nov. 30. The following day, Muema’s housemates at the Salvatorian formation house in Greendale noticed he had not come home and his car was missing. They let Fr. Portland know and he checked with Cardinal Stritch University and discovered Muema had not shown up for his classes, something he had never missed. That’s when he went to the police department for the first time. After being told it was likely Muema left of his own accord, Fr. Portland went home mulling over the possibility. It just didn’t make sense to him, for Muema was an eager, conscientious young man who seemed to be clearly drawn to priesthood with the Salvatorians. Could it be possible he no longer felt drawn to a religious vocation, wondered Fr. Portland. Yet he knew that was not the case, Fr. Portland told the Catholic Herald in a July 22 interview in his office. “Besides, what young person would leave and leave his computer behind?” For days, the Salvatorians had no idea what had happened to Muema until they heard a television news report that a man had been shot on Milwaukee’s north side. They went to area hospitals in search of him and finally, on Thursday, four days later, discovered Muema, still unconscious entered in the hospital records as “John Doe.” He was hanging on to life by a thread, the victim of shots to his stomach, his groin and his leg. His spleen had been ruptured and had to be removed, he had to be operated on to have a bullet removed, his leg was broken, his pancreas and liver were damaged and he was on life support. “They didn’t think I was going to make it,” admitted Muema in an interview with the Catholic Herald. “They disconnected the feeding tube – which I had because I couldn’t eat, disconnected everything for a whole day, but I did not die and they returned the medicine again.” Simon Muema, right, makes his first profession of vows as a Salvatorian on Sunday, Aug. 14, at St. Pius X Church, Wauwatosa. (Catholic Herald photo by Peter Fenelon) Yet, after months of rehabilitation at Froedtert Hospital and Alexian Village, Muema pulled through. Last Sunday, he made his first profession as a Salvatorian during the 10:15 a.m. Mass at St. Pius X Parish, Wauwatosa. Admitting he was depressed following the shooting, during the long rehabilitation, Muema said the experience has shown him the strength of his faith. “I know God has a purpose for me. He said, ‘Simon, it’s not over yet.’ I know he has a special mission for me,” he said. He also admitted that the shooting has left him with scars beyond the ones on his leg and stomach. He’s less trusting of others and lives with the fear that the man who shot him may “want to finish the job.” It was a young man who shot him – someone about 22 years old – whom Muema had seen regularly at the meal program. He often chatted with him and even ran into him a couple times at an area gas station near the meal program. In fact, the two had struck up a friendship of sorts and Muema spoke with him several times about helping him find employment at a McDonalds or Walmart so he wouldn’t need to “hustle” for money at the gas station. “I wanted to introduce him to one of the African Amercian friends I know at Cardinal Stritch,” said Muema, explaining that he wanted him to earn his own check “and not have to stand at the gas station asking for quarters.” The evening the shooting took place, Muema said the young man, who he knows as Cody, asked him for a ride home, something he had done on a couple occasions. Muema said Cody seemed depressed that evening and as they drove, he remembers him saying, “Simon, please, I really need help.” What help do you need, Simon remembers asking. He was astounded when Cody said he needed $250 or $300. “Excuse me. I thought he was joking,” said Muema, recalling that he told him, “You know I am a seminarian and we don’t have that money. Hey bro, if I had that kind of money, I’d send it back to Africa to buy food for the kids,” he said, referring to his five nieces and nephews who are being raised by his 76-year-old mother, Brigit Nindi, following the deaths of his siblings, their parents. Once he told Cody he did not have the money for him, Muema said he sensed a change in his passenger. “I had no idea he was carrying a gun. I had no idea he was that aggressive. He was always nice in the soup kitchen and did not really look homeless. He comes in clean,” said Muema, who saw Cody grab the car door handle. He thought Cody was planning to get out of the car, but instead pulled a gun and shot Muema. The next few minutes are a blur, but Muema, a former high school volleyball and basketball player, said they somehow made it outside the car and began fighting. Muema got ahold of the barrel of the gun and hung on. Eventually Cody ran off, leaving Muema injured and bleeding, lying in the 2000 block of North 39th Street. Muema remembers hearing people nearby, but no one came to his aid. He figures they saw two people fighting and did not want to get involved. He managed to find his cell phone and dialed 911, but the operator wanted to know where he was. He had no idea. Eventually some of the people nearby came close enough to the phone to shout the address into the phone and police arrived shortly. He lost consciousness soon after, which is why he could not tell them who he was in order to let his fellow Salvatorians know of his plight. He spent the next month, including Christmas, in the hospital and the next seven months in rehab. The emotional healing has been a process, too, he admitted. “I grew up in a country where we are even friendly to a stranger, even a stranger on the street, someone waiting for a bus, people share wherever you go in the village and I still bring that mentality here 10 years down the line,” he said. “But this kind of changed me. I need to know somebody now before I open up. I need the other person to open up to me, then I can trust them.” Muema said he’s also been asked by many people if he forgives the man who shot him. “I can forgive him if he forgives himself first, but he has to (settle with) the law. The jail is somewhere you learn how to correct your mistakes because that is where he belongs,” he said. Muema said the experience has not been without lessons. “I reached a point where I asked God why this happened to me. Why did he put me on this journey?” he asked, thinking of the happy life he left in California where he lived for 10 years, attending Riverside College, double majoring in social work and nursing and working in home health care. “Really, God, I left my life in California for this, to wake up early for prayers, Mass, go to chapel, prayer, ministry. It was a totally different life that I wasn’t planning and then I go and get shot. I asked God why he did this for me.” But Muema said he reevaluated his life and realized he was complaining too much. “Many people go through worse,” he said, adding that maybe God was teaching him a lesson. “The lives of saints, or some saints go through hell to be where they are. They went through a lot, were persecuted and if I was expecting God to choose someone else other than me, that’s selfish,” he said. Muema said he is approaching his ministry with this new perspective on what he experienced. He has been changed, however. He no longer is comfortable ministering in a meal program setting, and, in fact, requested a different ministry assignment. With an associate degree in mathematics, he now tutors Wauwatosa Catholic middle school students in math, and he admitted when he drives downtown to attend a Marquette or Bucks basketball game – something he enjoys in his free time – his stomach clenches as he relives that awful night nearly two years ago. When he saw people in the food service line at a meal program, “it took my mind back to the shooting. I was thinking I want to help those people so badly, but now my trust is not there.” During Mass where Muema made his first profession, Fr. Portland, his formation supervisor, choked back tears during his homily as he reflected on the journey Muema traveled after being shot. “I journeyed with him the nine months it took for recovery, going each day to Froedtert or Alexian Village. I cannot tell you how much the support of the Pius family meant to me during those long days and I am sure all the prayers secured his recovery,” he wrote in the parish bulletin.

Business Amazon angers mom-and-pop sellers with 'arbitrary' suspensions Amazon Kevork Djansezian, Getty Images Kevork Djansezian, Getty Images Spencer SoperBloomberg Privacy Policy Andy Ayers was walking to his car in a Big Lots parking lot — shopping cart brimming with cereal, dog treats and Always brand feminine hygiene products he planned to resell for a markup on Amazon.com — when he got a phone alert that his account had been suspended. "I thought, 'Oh Crap. Perfect timing,"' says Ayers, 32, of Athens, Ga. An Amazon shopper had complained that one of Ayers' products wasn't authentic. Ayers disputed the claim and provided receipts to back it up. But about two weeks had passed by the time his account was reinstated, and the downtime cost him sales. "I wasn't doing anything shady," says Ayers, who estimates he'll sell $500,000 worth of goods on Amazon this year. "It seems there are a lot of Amazon sellers who aren't doing anything wrong and are getting punished. There's an arbitrary nature to it." He has plenty of company. Attendees at an annual gathering of online merchants in Seattle on Friday said merchants are "living in fear" that they'll be kicked off the site.

A federal court found Amazon liable for charging parents for unauthorized in-app purchases made by kids, siding with the Federal Trade Commission in a case that stretched back to 2014. The key question in the legal battle was whether Amazon's app store made it too easy for children to buy virtual... (Andrea Peterson) Most Amazon customers probably don't realize that almost half of all items sold on the site come from third-party merchants. That means a set of kitchen knives could have been plucked from a Walmart bargain rack in Nebraska by a mom-and-pop business looking to profit from a little retail arbitrage. Amazon relies on more than 2 million merchants like Ayers to keep its website and warehouses stocked with an assortment of goods no brick-and-mortar store could ever match. But the company's relentless focus on customer service means that when Amazon receives a complaint it's the shopper — not the merchant — who typically gets the benefit of the doubt. "We treat sellers like customers," said Erik Fairleigh, a company spokesman. "The perfect seller experience is seamless self-service that allows the seller to independently run their business. If a seller needs to contact us, we have Seller Support associates available 24 hours a day worldwide, including support for urgent issues with a response in an hour or less. Sellers have available to them at any time many comprehensive tools and services to reach and interact with our Seller Support team." But Ayers and other sellers maintain Amazon is too quick to suspend its business partners and too slow to review their appeals, cutting off their primary revenue source, leaving them saddled with inventory. That ties up thousands of dollars in Amazon accounts until the issues get resolved, they say. As a result, many are reducing their reliance on Amazon by placing some of their merchandise on other sites, including eBay Inc., one of Amazon's chief rivals. "Any complaint from any buyer or manufacturer can result in a seller suspension, and their livelihood stops," says CJ Rosenbaum, a New York attorney who says he's helped hundreds of sellers navigate the suspension appeal process in the past several months. "Mom-and-pop businesses can't make the mortgage and big businesses can't make payroll." Sellers say the suspension process is guilty-until-proven-innocent, forcing them to prove complaints are unwarranted or pledging to make improvements to get selling privileges reinstated. They also say that the email appeal process wastes time and energy, and they often field the same request, often vague, seeking additional information without specifying what's wanted. Amazon launches its own car research site Hayley Tsukayama Looking for a new car? Now you can look that up on Amazon.com.

Although Amazon isn't getting into the business of selling cars, a new section of its website is designed to help people looking for a new ride get more information on the vehicles out there. The Amazon Vehicles section of the massive... (Hayley Tsukayama) The tension between Amazon and its sellers was on full display at the Seattle conference, which attracted 100-plus merchants and vendors. The suspension process has given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers, former Amazon seller account investigators and veteran online merchants who charge up to $3,000 to help sellers navigate the mysterious suspension appeal process. Consultant Lesley Hensell was scheduled to lead an afternoon session on "hot button suspensions." She and her partner noticed the business of helping sellers deal with Amazon suspensions pick up a year ago, and they now have a 30-person team working on it. "Amazon is getting harder and harder to persuade," she says. "There's no consistency. It's all by email with different people handling the case. This isn't how business partners are supposed to act. If I'm your business partner and you're unhappy with me, I'd hope I could speak with you about it." Amazon is clear in its seller policies that its rules can change at any time, taking effect immediately. Sellers are informed about changes via email and other notifications sent on the platforms they use to manage their accounts. Amazon's view of the perfect customer experience is one that is completely automated with no person-to-person interaction. Someone orders something online, and it arrives on their doorstep. Any additional interaction — a complaint or a return — is considered friction that indicates a problem. Sellers maintain this policy is unrealistic and fails to recognize that some shoppers lodge unwarranted complaints to get refunds when they are simply having buyers' remorse. EBay has grappled with similar complaints from its marketplace sellers and last year relaxed its rules in an effort to make amends. Consultants for online merchants encourage sellers to get inventory on eBay and other platforms so their business isn't crippled by an Amazon suspension. That's what happened to Emad Abukheit, who spent several years building a $2 million business selling mostly health and beauty products on Amazon before his account was suspended in March. Customers complained that products they purchased were expired, damaged or not as advertised. He submitted a plan of action to improve operations in his North Carolina warehouse, but Amazon kept requesting additional information and saying his account remained under review without making a decision. Amazon plans to open a Chicago bookstore in Lakeview Lauren Zumbach Amazon is opening an offline bookstore in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood.

"We are excited to be bringing Amazon Books to Southport in Chicago," Amazon spokeswoman Deborah Bass said in an email Thursday. Bass said the store, targeted to open next year, will be at 3443 N. Southport Ave., the former... (Lauren Zumbach) He hired Chris McCabe, who once investigated sellers for Amazon and now runs a business helping sellers get reinstated. Frustrated with the lack of response from Amazon beyond generic emails telling him his account was under review, Abukheit filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in April. About two weeks later, he received an email from Amazon that his account would not be reinstated. Abukheit says he had to cut 10 warehouse employees and estimates the suspension cost him $600,000. He is shifting inventory to eBay and other online platforms but says sales are slower. He was frustrated since a handful of complaints put him out of business when he has sold thousands of products on the site. "It's been a nightmare," he says. "They were our partner. You can't just put your partner out of business." Ayers used to work at an Amazon warehouse in Lexington, Ky., where he noticed the volume of inventory sold by third-party merchants. He decided to go into business himself four years ago and purchased $40 worth of scented candles from Walmart. Now he gets products from retail liquidations and the shelves of various stores, including Big Lots and Marshalls. Of the $500,000 he expects to generate this year, Ayers keeps about 35 percent for himself and pays Amazon about $100,000 in fees and commissions. "My wife and I joke that we'll sell anything that makes a profit," he says. When his account got suspended, he paid $2,000 to a consultant and followed their advice to get reinstated. He says he'll sell on Amazon as long as he is able to make a living, and if it gets too onerous he'll return to the workforce. His primary suggestion is for Amazon to insert a human touch to the process so merchants get a warning before being suspended and there's a conversation in case complaints are unwarranted. In the meantime, he's shifting inventory to other sites so an Amazon suspension isn't so crippling. "I learned a long time ago not to stress about what I can't control," he says.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Thank you, Strubberg for 22 years Monday Aug 29, 2016 at 8:59 AM Carthage Police Patrol Officer David Strubberg's career began and ended in dramatic fashion. By John Hacker Carthage Police Patrol Officer David Strubberg's career began and ended in dramatic fashion. Strubberg said his first call with the Jasper County Sheriff's Office in 1990 was a fight in the old Los Amigos trailer park involving five men, bats, bats with spikes, knives and log chains. The final call of his 22-year Carthage Police Department career was Monday's standoff involving three suspects in an armed robbery who barricaded themselves in an apartment on Airport Drive for three hours before surrendering.   “Look at how I went out, my last day,” Strubberg said at a reception held for him Wednesday at Carthage City Hall. “It ended like it started. It started with a bang and ended with a bang.” Dozens of current and retired law enforcement officers joined Carthage firefighters and other city officials at the reception to thank Strubberg for his time with CPD. Strubberg said he is leaving law enforcement and going to work for Schreiber Foods in Carthage. Strubberg worked for the Jasper County Sheriff's Office from 1990-1994 before joining the Carthage Police Department. His final day with CPD was Monday. “It's been a good ride, good times,” Strubberg said. “I've seen a lot, learned a lot. I'm going to work at Schreiber, totally out of law enforcement and doing a job. It was just time, time for a new change. It just fell into place.” Memories of a career Strubberg said he'll carry hundreds of individual memories and stories — some funny and some he'd rather forget — with him into this new chapter of his life. He recalled the the day soon after the 1994 Oklahoma City federal building bombing when federal authorities descended on Carthage on reports that “John Doe No. 2,” a second suspect in the bombing, was holed up in the Kel-Lake Motel across from Kellogg Lake Park. Strubberg also recalled the time when he had to help carry an eight-foot alligator out of a Carthage home. Strubberg said he also has memories of Marian Days, the Carl Junction Tornado of 2003, and many more, but one event that really stands out in his career is the May 22, 2011 tornado that wiped out one-third of Joplin and killed 161 people. “The Joplin tornado is one that sticks out because I was there immediately after and that was the most devastating and dramatic event that I've seen,” Strubberg said. “I was on Range Line, the Home Depot, Walmart area right after the tornado and it was devastating. The wall at Walmart fell forward and was facing west, and I climbed up that and looked back and I could see the hospital, St. John's smoking, and you could see all the fires and the other ambulances and the disarray of the whole landscape. It was one of those things I'll remember, but a lot of stuff I wouldn't like to remember about that.” People at Strubberg's reception watched a video montage of photos from Strubberg's career. Thank You Dave Then Police Chief Greg Dagnan talked about Strubberg's reputation as an outdoorsman, and an incident with a skunk under the porch at the police department. “There was a skunk and occasionally you'd come to work and it would kind of stink, smell like skunk,” Dagnan said. “Not every day but some days you could smell that we had a skunk. One day I came to work and it just smelled horrible. It smelled like the skunk and all his family died under there. It turns out to be the fox urine that Dave put there to run away the skunk. So the skunk didn't smell bad anymore, but the fox urine smelled awful. Those are the kind of things that Dave gets a hard time about all the time.” Dagnan then turned serious. “I mean this with all sincerity, if you've got a crime scene and you want a guy to find something, the guy that's going to find what nobody else is going to find, it's Dave,” Dagnan said. “If you've got a reconstruction that you need to do of a crime scene and you need to know what happened here, Dave's the guy you want standing there to do it. Here's what I'll definitely say about Dave is, 22 years of doing this, a little more than 26 years all together, Dave truly cares about this community, he cares about the people. He gets very emotionally involved when he's trying to help someone and that is what has made him be a wonderful servant of this community for all these years. So on behalf of all of us, I want to say thank you Dave.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us e-Edition Place an Ad Submit Your News Calendar Market Place Cars Classifieds RadarFrog Featured Ads Boats Magazine Community Info The City of Carthage Chamber of Commerce R-9 School District Carthage CVB Missouri Government Carthage Demographics Church Directory Sports MSSU Pitt State MO Sports KC Royals KC Chiefs MU Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Home | Peter Morici Tags: Trump | Mexico | China | trade Trump's Foreign Policy Highlights Deficiencies of Recent US Practices By Peter Morici Monday, 29 Aug 2016 09:25 AM More Posts by Peter Morici Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Republican Party foreign policy establishment has joined Democrats in roundly criticizing Donald Trump’s background and undiplomatic temperament. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has laid bare flaws in policies of recent presidents that have undermined U.S. security interests and American prosperity. For example, President Clinton consented to China’s membership in the World Trade Organization in exchange for an agreement to open its markets to U.S. exports and investment — a promise that is yet to be fulfilled. Beijing still maintains much higher tariffs on U.S. products than are imposed on Chinese products here, subsidizes manufacturing by rolling over state bank loans to money-losing state enterprises, and suppresses the value of its currency to keep its exports cheap and American-made products expensive in China. American consumers do enjoy artificially inexpensive coffee makers at Wal-Mart but at a terrible hidden cost. Free trade destroys jobs when it admits additional imports but fails to create a comparable amount of new sales for American goods and services abroad. Campaigning for president in 2008, Mr. Obama promised to get tough with China and redress the trade imbalance but once elected, he put no teeth in that policy. During his tenure, the trade deficit with China has increased more than $100 billion, costing American workers some 800,000 jobs directly and 1.2 million jobs counting in those lost from workers not spending lost wages domestically. Mr. Trump’s proposed tariff on imports to force China to revalue its currency and renegotiate its trade practices is hardly reckless. Similar measures have been proposed by liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and Mitt Romney running for president in 2012. Mr. Obama has failed to adequately challenge China’s construction of an artificial island with significant military potential in the South China Sea, and not adequately support American allies in the Pacific when bullied by Beijing. Whereas Mr. Trump advocates beefing up US military assets in the region and confronting Beijing’s territorial claims from a position of strength, Mrs. Clinton describes the Sino-American relationship as “positive, cooperative and comprehensive.” Illegal immigration at our southern border has vexed American presidents for generations, but the Mexican government has generally refused to cooperate in stemming the flow. It may not be acceptable to say in the neatly pressed society of American foreign policy elites, but Mexico has one of the most corrupt governments among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development—the club of western industrialized countries. The weight of graft keeps Mexico City from providing its citizens with clean air and water, adequate social services and opportunities for decent wages, and those drive its citizens north in search of a better life. In turn, many Mexicans employed in the United States send sizeable remittances to relatives back home and that helps prop up a wanton regime. Many advocates of NAFTA, including this author, anticipated a more open commercial relationship with the United States and Canada would help propel political reform but that has not happened. Mr. Trump will not likely persuade the Mexican government to erect a wall along the border, however, cutting off remittances, as he advocates, would motivate it to adopt a more cooperative posture regarding border enforcement. President Putin is asserting Russian power and extending its influence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East by among other things violating Ukrainian territorial sovereignty and supporting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. American options for dealing with Russia and ISIS are limited by twin realities. Europeans, led by Germany, are unwilling to put ground troops into harm’s way to help defend freedom in Eastern Europe or to combat ISIS. Without such a European commitment, the American public would surely not countenance substantially greater commitments of U.S. forces to face down Russia or to destroy ISIS. In the war against ISIS, Mrs. Clinton generally shuns cooperation with Russia—characterizing President Vladimir Putin a man without a soul. Instead, she advocates establishing a no-fly zone over Syria whose purpose is vague but would put the United States in direct confrontation with Russia more than ISIS. The next best option is similar to the one chosen by President Truman when faced by Stalin after World War II. No matter how distasteful, cut a deal with Russia to circumscribe Russian influence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and more effectively combat ISIS. Foreign policy experts in both political parties have staked their careers on simplistic assumptions and flawed policy prescriptions that have often undermined American interests. Dealing with the world as we find it, not as we wish it would be, is hardly the inclinations of a reckless fool. Trump’s rhetoric may be clumsy and alarming, but his instincts are spot on.

We have to rebuild our country. And we have a long way to go.” These words are now etched into the fabric of American discourse. The man who said them—Donald J. Trump, 2016 United States presidential candidate for the Republican party—may have an incoherent and repugnant agenda for how this is supposedly to be done, but his theme of civilizational decline is one that is common to the political reactionary. It’s a theme that’s been explored extensively by Mark Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University who has made the subject of political reaction and reactionaries the focus of his work. No one remembers the scholar who observed that a historical event was caused by a range of intersecting causes. In his latest essay collection, The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction, he notes that while political revolutionaries have been the subject of countless studies, political reactionaries have undergone much less systematic study. So the nature of political reactionary thought is overdue for investigation, he argues. Those shocked by Trump’s candidacy, and his commentary, would probably agree. Lilla’s introductory essay sketches out the rough points of his observations on reaction. “Reactionaries are not conservatives,” he warns. “They are, in their way, just as radical as revolutionaries and just as firmly in the grip of historical imaginings. Millennial expectations of a redemptive new social order and rejuvenated human beings inspire the revolutionary; apocalyptic fears of entering a new dark age haunt the reactionary.” While the particular beliefs and agendas of reactionaries vary immensely, there is a common pattern to their thinking. “[The reactionary’s] story begins with a happy, well-ordered state where people who know their place live in harmony and submit to tradition and their God. Then alien ideas promoted by intellectuals—writers, journalists, professors—challenge this harmony and the will to maintain order weakens at the top. (The betrayal of elites is the linchpin of every reactionary story.) A false consciousness soon descends on the society as a whole as it willingly, even joyfully, heads for destruction. Only those who have preserved memories of the old ways see what is happening. Whether the society reverses direction or rushes to its doom depends entirely on their resistance. Today political Islamists, European nationalists, and the American right tell their ideological children essentially the same tale.” This is what Lilla means by ‘the shipwrecked mind’—“Where others see the river of time flowing as it always has, the reactionary sees the debris of paradise drifting past his eyes… The revolutionary sees the radiant future invisible to others and it electrifies him. The reactionary, immune to modern lies, sees the past in all its splendor and he too is electrified… he believes he is the guardian of what actually happened, not the prophet of what might be.” Lilla’s brief sketch of the political reactionary is compelling, but unfortunately doesn’t go much further. He notes that his purpose in this collection is not so much to develop a theory of political reaction, but rather to offer assorted sketches and reflections on political reaction in western history. His main subjects are modern western philosophers—Franz Rosenzweig, Eric Voegelin, Leo Strauss—while he also draws on an extensive secondary cast of religious and philosophical figures. The essays themselves veer into sometimes obscure, often theological, territory. Lilla draws on an expansive and eclectic range of knowledge, firing off philosophical, theological and literary references that risk leaving more general readers confused. It’s unfortunate that Lilla doesn’t fully develop a systematic treatise on political reaction, because it would be interesting to see what it says. While Lilla’s writing on contemporary events for journalistic outlets like New York Review of Books is among his best and most accessible stuff (a couple of his articles on Islamist terror attacks in Paris are included in revised form in this collection), his philosophical explorations sometimes meander into the intellectually obscure. While philosophical engagements with political reaction are important, what would be truly useful would be understanding the relationship between the intellectual roots of political reaction and the populist, identity- or class-based mass movements that drive political change. Most interesting, engaging and accessible are the final essays in this collection which focus on contemporary ‘Currents’ and ‘Events’. In “From Luther to Wal-Mart”, Lilla explores the ‘Road Not Taken’ literature among contemporary Catholics, in which authors and scholars struggle to figure out at what stage Catholicism took a wrong turn, leading to the gradual weakening of its moral authority over society. For example, historian Brad Gregory’s The Unintended Reformation presents one such narrative: the Catholic Church was guilty of not policing itself strongly enough, leading to the justified complaints of medieval Reformers (who were political reactionaries in their own right). But their reactionary spirit, seeking a return to a purer form of Catholicism, opened the door to other, more revolutionary forms of pluralism: “The radicals denied the need for sacraments or relics, which ordinary believers believed in, handing them Bibles they were unequipped to understand. Sola scriptura, plus the idea that anyone could be filled with the Holy Spirit, inspired every radical reformer to become his own Saint Paul—and then demand that his neighbors put down their nets and follow him.” The consequence of this was the fragmentation of belief into factions, and then eventually to conflict and wars, and the need to find a way of living together led to liberalism as the response to this state of affairs. “But the price was high: it required the institutionalization of toleration as the highest moral virtue. The nineteenth-century Catholic Church rejected this whole package and withdrew within its walls, where intellectual life declined and dogma ossified. It thus left the rest of us to sink ever deeper into the confusing, unsatisfying, hyper-pluralistic, consumer-driven, dogmatically relativistic world of today.” Here, Gregory offers an explanation for why Catholicism has ceased to be a driving intellectual force in society. Instead it has been reduced (reduced itself, really) to issuing grudging papal concessions in response to changing social norms rather than offering credible social and intellectual ideas and alternatives as it once did. Gregory, and other scholars and not-so-scholars, have developed other myths and stories to explain the perceived declines which so consume them. “Why,” asks Lilla, “do people still feel the need for such myths? For the same reason people always have. We want the comfort, however cold, of thinking that we understand the present, while at the same time escaping full responsibility for the future.” Is this what Trump supporters believe? Do they draw comfort from Trump’s narrative of American decline, believing that it helps them understand the woes they feel in the present? Do they evade taking responsibility for the future, thinking that by voting for Trump they’ve done their part to make America great? While voting for Trump is certainly a political act, the overall performative dimension of being a Trump supporter is evocative of what Lilla dismisses as ‘literary experiences’: the tantalizing, romantic thrill of thinking that you’re participating in a grand project without actually doing anything substantive. It’s a critique he applies to reactionaries on the Left as well. [S]o long as one remains in an armchair there is an undeniable frisson to be had in reading a clever defense of Lenin or Mao or Pol Pot, and a satisfaction to be found in discovering sophisticated reasons for singling out the Jews. One can even feel active again by signing an online petition calling for a boycott of Israeli academics and their institutions. But these are literary experiences, not political ones. They provoke a very old political romanticism that longs to live life on more dramatic terms than those offered by bourgeois society, to break out and feel the hot pulse of passion, to upset the petty laws and conventions that crush the human spirit and pay the rent. We recognize this longing and know how it has shaped modern consciousness and politics, often at great cost. Here Lilla is excoriating reactionaries of the left, particularly those like Alain Badiou, who apply their scholarly genius to a romantic predilection for bloody ideologies like Maoism, and who write controversial justifications for violence (extreme violence merely reflects extreme enthusiasm, argues Badiou, and “is always situated beyond Good and Evil” because in a revolutionary society values are being redefined and “morality is a residue of the old world”). Such thinkers find inspiration in the biblical character of Saint Paul (Badiou even wrote a book about him), whose epistles are full of comments that seem to reflect radical and revolutionary ideas—personal faith trumps adherence to the law; cultural particularity can be tossed out the window since God’s truth is for all peoples, et cetera. Lilla critically examines these modern enthusiasts of St. Paul, noting that “Bible study is hard and requires devotion, and the new Paulines want things to be easy and exciting.” Much like those who want America to be great again. There are two key lessons Lilla offers. “Apocalyptic historiography never goes out of style”, he writes. No one remembers the scholar who observed that a historical event was caused by a range of intersecting causes; but everyone buys the book of the latest scholar to discover the One Big Reason history unfolded the way it did and the One Key Cause for the collapse of contemporary civilization. Equally important—and a key part of this phenomenon—is that “epochal thinking is magical thinking.” Humans seem to love dividing things into distinct, discrete categories. While we’re slowly learning to stop doing that with things like race (and gender), we have yet to curb our tendency to do that in history and politics. “But what help is it to imagine that ‘medieval Christendom failed, the Reformation failed, confessionalized Europe failed, and Western modernity is failing,’ as if civilizations pass through discrete periods defined by a single ‘project’?” asks Lilla. “Life does not work that way; history does not work that way. Nor does it help to imagine that the peak of Western civilization was reached in the decades just before the Reformation—any more than it helps Muslims to imagine that the peak of Islamic civilization was reached during the reign of the early caliphs, or in medieval Spain. Such myths do nothing but feed a more insidious dream: that political action might help us find our way back to the Road Not Taken. The lesson of Saint Augustine remains as timely as it was fifteen hundred years ago: that we are destined to pave our road as we go.” The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction Rating: Hans Rollmann is a writer and editor based in Eastern Canada.

Local retailers such as Sun-Art Group and Yonghui Group pushed expansion in the hypermarket channel, with sales volume adding 10.7 percent and 33.4 percent from the same period a year ago, market research firm Kantar Worldpanel said today. Walmart still remains in the leading position with 6.4 percent market share, followed by Yonghui Group and Vanguard Group, thanks to their expansion efforts in the mid and western region. Yonghui has been aggressively expanding its consumer base with new openings in western region, the survey shows. Online shopping festival launched by JD.com also became the second largest promotion season for domestic online retailers apart from the Single's Day shopping spree, with online spending of fast moving consumer goods make up 5.5 percent of the total sales volume in the three-month period.
