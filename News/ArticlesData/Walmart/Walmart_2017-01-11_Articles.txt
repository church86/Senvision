REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2016) Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday said it plans to create more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. within the next 18 months, leveraging plans already in the works in part to patch up its contentious relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.  Continue Reading Below The additional jobs would swell Amazon's U.S. workforce to 280,000, compared with 30,000 in 2011. However, the online retail giant's rapid growth has kneecapped traditional retailers including Macy's Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which have been cutting jobs by the thousands.  Amazon said many of the new positions will be at already-announced warehouses under construction in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Others will be in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning and advanced logistics -- some of which eliminate jobs, experts say.  "Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs," said Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.  A spokesman for Mr. Trump seemed to credit the president-elect with Amazon's hiring bump because he had urged the tech industry to keep jobs and production inside the U.S., at a meeting with heads of tech companies last month. "The President-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon," the spokesman said.  Amazon's announcement highlights a new reality for companies as Mr. Trump prepares to take office: His public praising or shaming of corporations for their business decisions is pressuring them to stay in his good graces and to adjust their public-relations strategies.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made job creation a central message and blasted companies, including technology giants, for purportedly sending jobs overseas. Since his election, companies across a range of industries have scurried to announce plans to retain or add U.S. jobs.  Some, such as Carrier Corp. and Ford Motor Co., reversed existing initiatives to shift manufacturing abroad. Others trumpeted efforts that had been under way before November. In December, SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son met with Mr. Trump to say he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs -- money that would come from a fund he announced in October.  A few companies have held firm in the face of Mr. Trump's scolding, such as General Motors Co., which plans to import some cars from Mexico to sell in the U.S.  Jack Ma, chief executive of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., a Chinese competitor to Amazon, met with Mr. Trump on Monday and made a bold, if vague, promise to create new U.S. jobs by encouraging American sellers to sell to Chinese consumers.  In an echo of Mr. Ma's proposal, Amazon said additional jobs could be created indirectly for small sellers who offer their goods on Amazon's marketplace.  Rosy talk about jobs from companies doesn't mean they are truly shifting when or whether they bring on new workers, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  "What [companies] are going to do first is spin," he said. That approach is "just a whole lot easier to do than to actually change your real numbers," he added.  Companies are hedging against Mr. Trump's threats to punish businesses that move American jobs elsewhere, Prof. Cappelli said, and corporate leaders are concerned about potential policy changes.  During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's relationship with the tech industry was strained. Tech leaders overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Trump lambasted companies including Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.  The acrimony between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bezos was particularly charged. Mr. Trump accused Amazon's CEO of buying the Washington Post to influence politics. "If I become president, oh do they have problems," Mr. Trump said. He called Amazon a "no profit company" in a tweet in December 2015. (Amazon had a profit of $482 million in the last quarter of 2015.)  That same month, Mr. Bezos, who also runs closely held rocket-making company Blue Origin LLC, said he would reserve a seat on one of his rockets for Mr. Trump. "#sendDonaldtospace," a message from Mr. Bezos' Twitter account read. Weeks before the election, Mr. Bezos said that the candidate's behavior "erodes democracy around the edges."  Amazon's share price was one of the hardest hit among tech firms in the days after Mr. Trump's election, tumbling 9% to as low as about $719 before recovering.  Analysts were skeptical that Amazon's announcement Thursday reflected an acceleration of its hiring plans. "There may be some 'political capital' involved with the timing and details," said Colin Sebastian. an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. He said he expects Amazon's international and domestic employment both to increase.  Amazon's biggest source of jobs is its warehouses, which process and ship orders. Amazon opened about two dozen new warehouses in the third quarter of 2016, prompting costs to soar in part due to those investments, the company said. That brought its total number of warehouses globally to about 150.  Before the announcement Thursday, Amazon had been planning to open some 16 new fulfillment centers over the next few months, which would have created more than 15,000 jobs, according to data from supply-chain consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Marc Wulfraat, president of MWPVL, estimates another 20 warehouses could be announced this year, employing anywhere from approximately 300 to 6,000 people each.  To reach the 100,000 mark, Amazon is likely to convert some part-time jobs to full-time, Mr. Wulfraat said. There are also seasonal workers to pick from: Amazon said it hired 120,000 holiday workers in the U.S. in 2016, and thousands of them will stay on as the company continues to expand. "If you look at the growth curve, I think it's going to continue to be as strong as last year," Mr. Wulfraat added.  The rapid growth of Amazon and e-commerce in general has cost traditional retailers thousands of brick-and-mortar jobs. Wal-Mart plans to cut nearly 1,000 corporate positions before the end of January, according to a person familiar with the situation, after cutting about 7,000 back office store jobs last year. Last week, Macy's said it would slash more than 10,000 jobs and close dozens of stores.  Oliver Chen, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said online retail growth rates have been running as high as 25%, while in-store foot traffic can run down 6% or more. "The organizations are having to respond to the way in which consumers are changing their shopping habits," he said. "The penetration rate online is continuing to grow, and that means less need for physical stores."  Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley executives struck a conciliatory tone in part just by showing up at their meeting last month. During the 90-minute summit, Mr. Trump told the 13 executives, including Mr. Bezos, that he would work with them to foster innovation and to support fair-trade deals. The group also discussed job creation.  Mr. Bezos said in a statement at the time that Mr. Trump's promised focus on innovation "would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech -- agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -- everywhere."

It was two months before his family reported him missing. In October, a tipster called Crime Stoppers to report skeletal remains in a wooded area at the interchange of I-465 and South East Street, two-and-a-half miles from the Walmart. “Whoever called in the tip obviously saw the remains,” said IMPD Detective Bob Flack, who climbed sixty feet into the woods from the off ramp to look at the body. “It was pretty much a full skeleton, there were a couple of bones missing. “There was clothing left with the remains and we found the wallet and the work ID of the individual that was later identified.” Flack told IMPD Missing Persons detectives he had the ID card of a man they were looking for, but without a coroner’s ruling on the identity and cause of death, there was no proof that Capps’ death was a murder. Joseph Capps Until this week. “Two days ago I was notified by the coroner’s office,” said Flack. “We checked the name on the work ID and determined that individual’s dentist and found that person had seen a dentist and that’s how we made the identification of that individual.” Even though it took more than two months to attach a name to the body in the woods, Flack said investigators knew from the start they likely had a murder to solve. “They did an autopsy the next day and that’s when a defect was found on the skull of the individual,” said the detective. “There was blunt force trauma to the skull on the right side of the head.” There was no activity on Capps’ bank card or cell phone following his disappearance. Capps didn’t have a criminal record or evidence of drug use or a dispute with anyone. The location where the body was found is so inaccessible that Flack wonders if his original Crimestoppers tipster literally stumbled on the remains while hiking through the woods or knows why Capps was killed and dumped there. That informant has called Crimestoppers once before. Investigators hope the tipster will again at 317-262-TIPS. While Capps was murdered in 2016, his identification and cause of death were not determined until days ago and the homicide will be listed against 2017 statistics.

Bloomberg For years, Amazon.com has targeted shoppers who can afford a $99 Prime subscription. Last week’s announcement that it will deliver groceries to food-stamp recipients shows Amazon also wants to appeal to lower-income shoppers, traditionally Wal-Mart’s bailiwick. Amazon is authorized to start the experiment this summer in New York, New Jersey and Maryland. FreshDirect, Safeway and ShopRite are also joining the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which last year provided more than $66 billion of help to 44.2 million needy Americans. This will be the first time SNAP has accepted online payment for groceries. Low-income shoppers are an intriguing target for Amazon, which has tried with mixed success to disrupt the $800 billion grocery market. More than 80 percent of food stamp recipients live in or near big cities, which are served by Amazon’s vast network of warehouses and home to the affluent and poor in close proximity. A truck delivering gluten-free chia seed bars and organic soy coffee creamer to Manhattan’s posh Upper West Side can also cart a box of cereal, bread and baby food to low-income housing projects in Harlem. “There are very few retailers who can serve the high- and low-end of the income spectrum,” says Kirthi Kalyanam, director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University. “Costco customers are mostly affluent and Wal-Mart customers are mostly low income. No one retailer has been able to bridge the gap. Amazon is uniquely positioned to go all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom of the customer spectrum.” Amazon’s competition for urban food stamp recipients include convenience stores with limited inventory and high markups, providing Amazon an opportunity to stand out with its vast selection and low prices. The delivery program also lets food-stamp recipients use the benefit more discreetly than in a crowded store, where other shoppers can see how they’re paying for their groceries. For now, it’s unclear if Amazon plans to deliver the groceries to doorsteps, require pickup from central locations or leave that up to shoppers. Amazon’s push into groceries borrows a page from big box competitors that sell food at or below cost to get people into the store with hopes that they also buy higher-margin items such as clothing and electronics. People buy groceries frequently, putting a retailer in regular contact with the shopper and generating order volume that can help Amazon achieve economies of scale that are crucial to make e-commerce profitable. Annual online grocery spending in the U.S. will more than double to $70 billion by 2021, estimates Cowen and Company. “For Amazon, this continues to drive logistics and transportation costs per unit lower as these routes are combined with current routes to create more efficient transportation costs,” says Neil Ackerman, a former Amazon executive who runs e-commerce initiatives at Mondelez International. “While this program is focused on groceries, it also allows for customers to buy in other categories that Amazon can deliver, like fashion and electronics.” Amazon is the largest of seven retailers chosen for the two-year food stamps program. The Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, sees access to online groceries as a benefit to urban and rural residents with limited shopping options. The pilot will let the agency work out any payment and security issues before allowing online food stamp purchases nationally. Serving food stamp recipients would put Amazon on the front lines of eliminating “food deserts,” urban and rural areas where healthy, affordable food options are scarce for those without cars. Doing so provides a public relations boost for a company better known for delivering a bottle of laundry detergent within an hour to a time-strapped shopper willing to pay $8 to skip a trip to the store. Amazon took heat last year after a Bloomberg investigation revealed that some predominantly minority neighborhoods in Boston, New York, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, D.C., were excluded from Amazon’s same-day delivery service. Amazon has since expanded the service and filled the gaps. “We are committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers the lowest prices possible,” Amazon said in an e-mailed statement. “Amazon’s selection and competitive pricing can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants while helping them extend their benefits further.” The push is potentially bad news for Wal-Mart, which gets more than half its $298 billion in annual U.S. revenue from grocery sales. The world’s biggest retailer is already battling German-owned chain Aldi and other discount grocers for low-income shoppers. Now the world’s biggest online retailer is chasing those shoppers too. “It’s a whole new demographic and market for Amazon to tap,” says Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Yarbrough. Amazon in April introduced a $10.99 monthly payment plan for Prime, making it more appealing to those who can’t afford a one-time $99 yearly fee. That helped Amazon increase Prime membership among those earning less than $25,000 a year from six percent in 2014 to 11 percent at the end of 2016, says Michael Levin, of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago, which surveys Amazon shoppers. “Some of these customers use food stamps,” Levin says. “So Amazon would naturally want to accept them.” Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

The delivery program also lets food-stamp recipients use the benefit more discreetly than in a crowded store, where other shoppers can see how they’re paying for their groceries. For now, it’s unclear if Amazon plans to deliver the groceries to doorsteps, require pickup from central locations or leave that up to shoppers. Amazon’s push into groceries borrows a page from big box competitors that sell food at or below cost to get people into the store with hopes that they also buy higher-margin items such as clothing and electronics. People buy groceries frequently, putting a retailer in regular contact with the shopper and generating order volume that can help Amazon achieve economies of scale that are crucial to make e-commerce profitable. Annual online grocery spending in the U.S. will more than double to $70 billion by 2021, estimates Cowen and Company. “For Amazon, this continues to drive logistics and transportation costs per unit lower as these routes are combined with current routes to create more efficient transportation costs,” says Neil Ackerman, a former Amazon executive who runs e-commerce initiatives at Mondelez International. “While this program is focused on groceries, it also allows for customers to buy in other categories that Amazon can deliver, like fashion and electronics.” Amazon is the largest of seven retailers chosen for the two-year food stamps program. The Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, sees access to online groceries as a benefit to urban and rural residents with limited shopping options. The pilot will let the agency work out any payment and security issues before allowing online food stamp purchases nationally. Serving food stamp recipients would put Amazon on the front lines of eliminating “food deserts,” urban and rural areas where healthy, affordable food options are scarce for those without cars. Doing so provides a public relations boost for a company better known for delivering a bottle of laundry detergent within an hour to a time-strapped shopper willing to pay $8 to skip a trip to the store. Amazon took heat last year after a Bloomberg investigation revealed that some predominantly minority neighborhoods in Boston, New York, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, D.C., were excluded from Amazon’s same-day delivery service. Amazon has since expanded the service and filled the gaps. “We are committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers the lowest prices possible,” Amazon said in an e-mailed statement. “Amazon’s selection and competitive pricing can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants while helping them extend their benefits further.” The push is potentially bad news for Wal-Mart, which gets more than half its $298 billion in annual U.S. revenue from grocery sales. The world’s biggest retailer is already battling German-owned chain Aldi and other discount grocers for low-income shoppers. Now the world’s biggest online retailer is chasing those shoppers too. “It’s a whole new demographic and market for Amazon to tap,” says Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Yarbrough. Amazon in April introduced a $10.99 monthly payment plan for Prime, making it more appealing to those who can’t afford a one-time $99 yearly fee. That helped Amazon increase Prime membership among those earning less than $25,000 a year from six percent in 2014 to 11 percent at the end of 2016, says Michael Levin, of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago, which surveys Amazon shoppers. “Some of these customers use food stamps,” Levin says. “So Amazon would naturally want to accept them.” Published: Jan. 12, 2017, 12:17 p.m.  Tags: amazon.com, food stamps, FreshDirect, groceries, safeway, ShopRite, SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Wal-Mart Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Life & Style Books The Biblioracle: Don't shop at Amazon's new Chicago store Amazon bookstore Elaine Thompson / AP 2015 The few dollars you may save at the Amazon bookstore coming to Chicago’s Southport Corridor will come at a cost. The few dollars you may save at the Amazon bookstore coming to Chicago’s Southport Corridor will come at a cost. (Elaine Thompson / AP 2015) John WarnerContact ReporterChicago Tribune I have a favor to ask: When Amazon opens its retail store in the Southport Corridor area of Lakeview later this year, please do not shop there. It will be tempting, because the store will seem shiny and the merchandise will interact with your smartphone, informing you of prices and additional recommendations. You will be offered discounts on Echo, Amazon's home "digital assistant"; Prime memberships; and access to streaming content. And the books will be less expensive than at your local independent store. RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR But those few dollars saved will come at the expense of something more important: our community, our values. Amazon is not evil, but it is a corporation, and corporations do what corporations do — whatever it takes to maximize profits and shareholder value. In the case of Amazon, in the past, that's meant subjecting warehouse workers to inhuman conditions and their corporate employees to a kind of white-collar Hunger Games. Discounts are not free. They are financed with your privacy, as Amazon harvests and monetizes every last tidbit of information it can gather about you in order to sell you more stuff. Amazon is not concerned about your welfare and it is not in the business of protecting anyone's rights. Take that Amazon Echo, the cute little cylinder that will tell you the weather forecast or play Miles Davis or order new socks at your command. That device is always listening to everything said within its range. As of now, unless the Echo is activated, it does not record the information or send it to Amazon's servers, but as part of a murder investigation, police in Bentonville, Ark., have subpoenaed data collected by an Echo present in the home at the time of the alleged crime. An ever-present listening device is something out of a "1984"-like dystopia, and yet many are inviting this intrusion into their lives. Beyond the privacy issues, Amazon is unconcerned with quality of life in local communities. We have seen entire towns crash on the shoals after giving in to the siren song of Wal-Mart's low, low prices. Wal-Mart moves in, bringing not just those low prices but low-paying  jobs too. Unable to compete, the existing local businesses fail, putting communities into a death spiral, until so many people leave that Wal-Mart also pulls up the stakes. Instant ghost town. Obviously, Chicago isn't going to become a ghost town, but we should be very aware of the cultural and community riches we have in our many independent book stores. The vitality of places like Women & Children First, Quimby's, Unabridged Bookstore, City Lit Books, RoscoeBooks and a dozen others I could name are part of what make Chicago a vibrant city. That vitality is also why I am not overly worried about an Amazon store colonizing Lakeview. Chicago is better than this. But we must be vigilant in the face of these threats and remind ourselves that the people who own and work in the local stores are our neighbors, are here to stay and are invested in ways a corporation could never match. We have seen how easy it is to let something meaningful slip through our fingers. Chicago's literary culture shouldn't be trusted to one man in Seattle.

(NYSE: WMT), which will go a long way in boosting Workday’s brand value and will also set the stage for further high-profile deals in the future. Huge Wal-Mart Deal Wal-Mart, the largest employer in the United States, employing over 2.3 million people worldwide, would subscribe to Workday’s HCM, recruiting, learning, and planning solutions. The deal is a validation of Workday's product portfolio and ability to support one of the most demanding customers in the world. Moreover, the mega HR contract with Wal-Mart soothed investor concerns after weakness with large deals in early November resulted in soft fourth-quarter outlook, leading to a sharp selloff in Workday shares in early December. “Beyond the financial implications of today's win, we believe this deal has important psychological implications for the stock and the company's brand with leading organizations around the world,” Brian White of Drexel Hamilton wrote in a note. Assuming all of Wal-Mart’s 2 million plus employees subscribe to Workday, White estimates the deal could be worth $100 million to $200 million in annual revenue. However, Workday did not specify the number of Wal-Mart employees who will be part of this subscription. Also, a deal of this size will take some time to ramp. Thus, the analyst is not expecting the full revenue impact be felt in the first year or two. Recall that Workday did not change its guidance for 2017's fourth quarter or FY 2018. Prior To Wal-Mart Deal Before signing Wal-Mart, Workday clientele included International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM), 350,000 employees; HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ), 300,000 employees; Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), 300,000 employees; and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), 250,000 employees. “While already an impressive list, even the largest previously publicly announced customer (IBM) is smaller than one-sixth the size of Walmart,” Baird analyst Steven Ashley wrote in a note. Beyond the geo-political disruption, Ashley noted billings face additional headwinds in the form of reduced subscription revenues due to flexible deal terms, slowed long-term deferred revenue growth and slowed professional services revenue growth. A Positive Look Forward That said, the company’s business is gaining momentum, especially regarding financials. The company would announce the marquee customer it recently signed for Workday Financials in the fourth-quarter call. Ashley expects Workday to post a strong financials quarter in the fourth quarter. In fact, White believes the biggest market opportunity for Workday remains in financials (over $27 billion), followed by analytics (over $19 billion) and HCM (over $13 billion). White has a Buy rating with $104 price target and Ashley rates Workday Outperform with a target price of $90. At last check, shares of Workday had fallen 3.62 percent to $78.74 on Thursday after closing 10 percent higher on Wednesday.

Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. (MIke Mozart/Flickr/CC) The stock market has been on quite a roll in recent weeks, but signs of trouble continue to plague the real economy.  Earlier this week, I talked about the "retail apocalypse" now sweeping America. Major retail chains such as Sears and Macy's are closing stores and laying off workers, but I didn't think Wal-Mart would be feeling the pain as well. Unfortunately, that's precisely what is happening. USA Today is reporting that approximately 1,000 jobs will be cut at Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas by the end of this month: Wal-Mart's plan to lay off of hundreds of employees is the latest ripple in a wave of job cuts and store closures that are roiling the retail industry. The world's largest retailer is cutting roughly 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about it. The company is saying these cuts are necessary because Wal-Mart is always "looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively." But something doesn't smell right here. You don't get rid of 1,000 employees at your corporate headquarters if everything is just fine. I have driven past Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville a number of times, and it is in a beautiful part of the country. Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. Meanwhile, there are signs of trouble out on the west coast as well. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that there is going to be a new round of engineering job cuts at Boeing. Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide, including in Southern California, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. And according to Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder, similar job cut announcements are coming for other classes of workers as well. So why is Boeing getting rid of so many employees? Well, the truth is that Boeing's business is way down. The following comes from Wolf Richter: Business has been tough. In 2016, deliveries fell by 14 jets from a year ago, to 748. Net orders dropped 13 percent from an already-rotten level in 2015, to just 668, down 53 percent from 2014. And the lowest level since 2010! When the economy is doing well, air traffic tends to rise, and when the economy is doing poorly, it tends to go down. Needless to say, the fact that Boeing is doing so poorly does not bode well for the future. In addition to Wal-Mart, another major retailer that is letting people go is Petco. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1967879577" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1967879577" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Petco is cutting 180 positions with about 50 at its San Diego headquarters, the pet supply retailer confirmed Wednesday. The company made the cuts across its workforce and include both existing and open positions. Petco has about 650 workers at its headquarters in Rancho Bernardo. It employs 27,000 in the U.S. My wife and I have three cats, and even though Petco tends to be a bit overpriced, we have always appreciated the work they do. Unfortunately, when the economy gets tough, spending on pets tends to be one of the first things to get cut back, and this current trouble at Petco could be a sign that rough sledding is ahead for the entire economy. Of course, your personal perspective on these things is likely to be very heavily influenced by your immediate surroundings. Those who live in wealthy enclaves of major cities such as San Francisco, New York City or Washington, D.C. may be wondering how anyone could possibly be talking about economic trouble right now. But if you live in economically depressed areas of Appalachia or the upper Midwest, it may seem as though the last economic recession never even ended. There have been pockets of economic prosperity in recent years, and this has resulted in some people becoming exceedingly wealthy. Meanwhile, things have just continued to become even tougher for millions of other families as the cost of living always seems to grow faster than their paychecks do. If you are in the top one percent of all income earners, maybe to you it seems as though things have never been better. But most of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and is just struggling to survive from month to month. The following comes from CNN: The rich are money-making machines. Today, the top mega-wealthy—the top 1%—earn an average of $1.3 million a year. It's more than three times as much as the 1980s, when the rich "only" made $428,000, on average, according to economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the American population earned an average of $16,000 in pre-tax income in 1980. That hasn't changed in over three decades. The workers being laid off at the companies discussed above are real people with real hopes and real dreams. Perhaps many of them will be able to land other employment fairly soon, but the truth is that the job market is really tough in many areas of the country right now. Finding a good job that will allow you to pay the bills and support your family is not easy. You may find that out the hard way if you end up losing your current job during the economic troubles that will come in 2017. Earlier today, I came across an excellent article by Gail Tverberg that detailed a bunch of reasons a significant economic downturn appears to be imminent in 2017. If you would like to read it, you can find it here. She points to many of the same things to which I have been pointing for a very long time. Even though economic conditions were fairly stable throughout 2016, our long-term problems continued to get even worse. So the truth is that we are more primed for a major crisis today than we have been at any point since the last recession. My hope is that things will not be nearly as bad in 2017 as Gail Tverberg and others are projecting that they could be, but the warning signs are definitely there, and it isn't going to take much to push the U.S. economy off the rails.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing How Deep-in-the-Money Options Offer a Solid Alternative to Stocks Published Fri, Sep 21, 2012  |  Lee Lowell, Chief Options Analyst Whether you read my Wall Street Daily articles, you’re a subscriber to my Instant Money Trader or you’ve read my book, I’m sure you know by now that I’m a huge fan of selling put options. If that’s not for you, though, there’s another strategy I highly recommend as an alternative to just buying stocks. And that’s buying deep-in-the-money (DITM), long-dated, call option contracts. You see, option contracts are the greatest financial products ever created, since leverage lets many investors participate in trades that would otherwise be out of reach. Now, many investors think that leverage is too risky. And they have a point. Leverage’s ability to magnify your gains can have the reverse effect, as well. But here’s a way you can participate in the massive upside potential options offer, while reducing risk at the same time. Buying Shares At a 73% Discount Let’s use Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as our prime example. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of Wal-Mart today, it would cost you roughly $7,475. But by using DITM options, those same 100 shares would cost you roughly $2,020. That’s a solid $5,455 cheaper – or a 73% discount.  So what does deep-in-the-money mean? Basically, DITM options have strike prices that are set much lower than the current price of the stock. The options chain to the right shows a partial listing of available call option contracts to trade on Wal-Mart (at its current price of $74.75). Let’s focus on the January 2014 $55 strike price, which is around $19.75 below the stock price. The cost to buy the option is roughly $2,020 per contract. Remember, each contract represents 100 shares of stock. The benefits of buying the option instead of the stock are two-fold: First, you’re only spending $2,020 instead of $7,475 to control the same 100 shares, but you’re benefiting from similar movement (more on that below). Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020. Wal-Mart shareholders have $7,475 at risk. That’s a big difference. However, DITM isn’t the only thing you need to focus on to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible. High Delta is Key It’s also crucial that you pinpoint the options with at least a 90% or higher “delta.” Delta refers to how closely the option price moves in relation to the underlying stock. In other words, the higher the delta, the more the option moves in lockstep with the stock. Since the whole point of buying options is to pocket massive gains when the stock moves in your favor, the best way to do that is to choose options with a high delta. Have you ever bought a call or put-option contract and its value didn’t increase – even though the stock price moved a good distance in your favor? Depressing, wasn’t it? Most likely it was because you didn’t own an option with a high enough delta. As I said, a good delta to go with is at least 90%. Just to clarify, that means the option price should move 90% in the same direction of the stock’s movement. As you can see, the $55 strike price option boasts a 96% delta. The screenshots of an options calculator below show this principle working in real-time. The calculator on top shows what the options trade for at Wal-Mart’s current price of $74.75. The one on the bottom shows what the option would likely trade for if shares hit $75.75. As you can see, the option price went up almost a dollar, just like the stock. That’s the kind of movement you need. What novice option traders usually do is pick the cheapest option contracts based on the actual dollar value. It makes them feel like they’re getting a better deal. But what they don’t realize is that the cheaper the option price, the lower the delta will be, which means they’ll see less cash in the end. So what happens when the options expire in January 2014? Well, if Wal-Mart increased like you hoped it would, you can sell the options and bank the gain. Or you can “exercise” the option and turn it into actual shares of stock. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to pay for the stock in full at that time. Usually, the first scenario is the best bet, since you could just sell the option and use the profits to buy another position. And you’re still participating in the move higher like you would if you actually owned shares. Only this way, you’re keeping your cost and risk low at the same time. So do yourself a favor… If you’re ever going to buy a stock, consider buying DITM options with a high delta instead. You’ll be glad you did. Ahead of the tape, Lee Lowell Related Articles Solar Power: America Invented It… China Owns It… Opportunity Springs From It Why 5G Wireless Technology Is Buzzing in Las Vegas Elon Musk Is the Madman We Need Trump’s Defense Picks Are Already at War… With Each Other Comments (7) richard goodrick says: November 11, 2013 at 8:03 pm Thanks so much for your thorough, and easy to understand explanation of DITM calls. [Reply] Joseph says: April 26, 2015 at 3:00 pm You say “Plus, you’re cutting your total risk in the trade by $5,455. The most you can ever lose when buying options is what you paid for them. In this case, you can’t lose more than $2,020.” This is only partly true. Yes, the amount of money that’s on the line is smaller; but on the other hand, there is a much greater chance that you will lose all your money when buying the option than buying the actual stock. This is because if the stock price drops below your strike price you lose your entire investment whereas when you buy the actual stock the only way you lose all your money is if the company’s share price goes down to zero, a much less likely scenario than the price falling below the strike price. [Reply] Max Baer Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:27 am Excellent point, Joseph! Even deep-in-the-money options pose a high risk if a stock goes into an unexpected, yet temporary, free fall. If the option expires before the stock recovers, you could lose all your money on the position, whereas the underlying stock may well appreciate nicely after the expiration of the option, but too late for you to benefit from it. [Reply] Dominic says: July 11, 2015 at 4:15 am So I should find a DITM call with a high delta, right? As opposed to what? A DITM call with a low delta? (If your broker offers you a DITM call with a low delta you should find another brokerage.) [Reply] 56 says: August 9, 2016 at 10:11 am Deep in money have deep premiums in addition to another deep premium cost factor for options (time, and its your forgiving friend if you buy enough of it) . Less contracts for that $2000. What’s wrong with at the money/slightly out of the money. Lower premiums, more contracts, and time if you choose to pay for it. Delta of .6-7 isn’t as nice as .9 for sure but considering you can ramp up the number of contracts the $ buys and/or get more time I mean really the thing that matters is being proved right on strike+premium anytime before expiration. I would recommend the hell out of put options vs shorting. More gains, no obligations,no sneaky dividends. Time is against shorts anyways, not such a big swallow for a put.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE Job postings are shown outside a new Walmart Super Center as the company opens its first store in Compton, California, on January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake | Caption Patrick Reilly Staff January 11, 2017 —Even the world’s largest retailer can’t avoid the challenges facing brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart will soon cut hundreds of jobs from its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and its regional offices, as The Wall Street Journal first reported this week. The announcement comes amid a downturn for some traditional retail stores. Macy’s and Sears are cutting back, as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week, as more consumers shop online or at discount-rack stores, although some segments, like fast fashion, have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart, which predicts flat earnings growth for its next fiscal year, is also feeling the pinch. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” spokesman Greg Hitt told Fortune, although he did not confirm job cuts. But unlike other troubled chains, which have closed stores and laid off retail staff, Wal-Mart is cutting costs at the corporate level. Meanwhile, it’s continuing an expensive – and controversial – effort to improve its stores by paying workers more. For years, labor groups criticized Wal-Mart for its treatment of retail staff, including its wages and a lack of unions. A 2011 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that its employees earned an estimated 12.4 percent less than retail workers as a whole, and 14.5 percent less than workers in large retail in general. Last year, the chain announced a "two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers," in which all employees hired before January 1st, 2016 would receive at least $10 per hour; new hires' wages would start at $9 per hour, but increase to $10 after they complete a training program. Ten companies with great starting wages Amid rising concerns about inequality and low minimum wages, this pay hike at the world’s largest retailer sparked debate. Some saw the wage hikes as a smart business decision that better motivated workers and reversed years of customer complaints about poor service. But others saw the wage increase as trouble for Wal-Mart’s bottom line, and dismissed some arguments in favor of it – such as the idea that better-paid employees would spend more in-store, helping to offset the losses of paying higher wages.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Other critics argued the wage hike didn't go far enough, as the Monitor reported in 2015: But advocates for low-wage workers, while supporting the wage boost, say the pay increases will have minimal effect on workers' lives without a full workweek. Companies like Wal-Mart have turned the scheduling of part-time workers into a science, says Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. Computer programs used by Wal-Mart and other large retail outlets piece together employee schedules and are frequently programmed to keep employees' hours below the threshold where benefits kick in, she says. “These are super-sophisticated programs that work in real time calculating to the minute based on customer traffic, calling people in to work and sending them home accordingly,” she says. “Working there makes it nearly impossible to plan a stable budget, have another job, or go to schools.” This week's job-cutting news comes as the latest of several Wal-Mart cost-cutting measures which have left white-collar employees in Bentonville uneasy. In September, the company announced it would cut 7,000 back-office positions; last October, it eliminated 450 positions at headquarters, a move it said would make Wal-Mart more "nimble." But unlike their counterparts at Sears or Macy’s, the sales associates at your local Wal-Mart are probably breathing a sigh of relief.

Darin Dreiling, Walmart’s store manager in Great Bend, tells us the store at 3503 10th Street will undergo a small renovation with their frontend. Darin Dreiling Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dreiling-walmart-1.mp3 Along with adding more self-checkout stations, Dreiling says more belted self-checkouts will be installed. Walmart will also get new computers during the remodel that is expected to take two weeks and will start in the third week of February. Darin Dreiling Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dreiling-walmart-2.mp3 Dreiling stated Great Bend’s Walmart is still a few years away from a major full-scale remodel. A large renovation project would include new colors and refit fixtures throughout the store. Share this: Google Twitter Email Facebook Filed Under: Featured, Local Comments DEWEY BALL says January 12, 2017 at 8:42 am With the demand of Electric Carts so high in Great Bend and because many often are broke down or batteries won’t stay charged, It is clear that the store needs more electric carts.

But it isn’t the local management that decides. It is the money hungry selfish management in the corporate offices that make these decisions. I also perfer a live person. Then there is the issue of the rude hateful cashiers that would rather talk to their friends and flirt around before taking care of their customers.

Report this comment Reply Janelle Irwin says January 12, 2017 at 9:38 am Another thing they need to fix is the shopping carts that have 2 child seats. I have several children and daycare kids and every time I go there they are stored outside (which yes I know they take up a lot of room) so they are usually freezing cold or wet for the kids to sit in. And pretty much all of the straps to hold them in are broken, so I’m trying to hold kids down so they don’t fall out and push/shop at the same time 🙁 Current score: 0 (Please enable JavaScript to vote.)

(AMZN) Stock Is About to Catch Fire Why Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Won’t Be Growing Anytime Soon View All Posts There’s an age-old battle between Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) that leads investors to question which is the better stock. Target stock has gone up nearly 8% each year for the past five years, while Walmart stock only averages a little over 3% in the past five years. Likewise, TGT stock yields 3.2% and the company’s earnings grew 10.7% last quarter, but WMT stock only yields 2.8% and its earnings declined 8.2%. Yet investors generally view Target as weaker than Walmart — is this viewpoint wrong? Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Lately, TGT stock has certainly been the weaker big-box retailer. It’s up a measly 0.67% year to date, compared to WMT’s 13.8% bump. And its past series of missteps — a massive breach of customers’ credit and debit card information in 2013, its ill-conceived Target Canada launch, its controversial decision to allow transgender customers to use the bathroom of their choice, among others — have damaged the company’s once pristine reputation with the general public and Wall Street. But the above numbers put Target stock’s recent drop-off in perspective. Sprinkle in a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio of 13 (compared to Walmart’s P/E of 15), solid earnings growth projections for this year and next and some nice share-price momentum over the last six weeks, and you have a stock that looks pretty attractive. Sales Declines Are Dragging TGT Stock Down There’s just one problem with the picture: Target’s sales aren’t what they used to be. Revenues have only made a small comeback in the most recent quarter after significant declines in the past two quarters, and same-store sales have tumbled for two straight quarters. The store just doesn’t have the same buzz it once did. 7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50% Upside in 2017 But Walmart’s sales have been equally uninspiring, failing to reach more than 1% growth for seven straight quarters. Putting the string of embarrassing headlines aside, Target has the same problems as its much larger competitors: Americans are turning their backs on the big-box stores in favor of the convenience of online shopping. Therefore, the key for Target stock to return to growth is online sales. Right now, online sales account for less than 5% of TGT’s total sales, despite a 26% uptick in the third quarter, ahead of Walmart’s 20.6% digital growth. In fact, Target has routinely defeated WMT in that department, and it should continue to do so given that the average Target shopper is younger than the average Walmart shopper. (TGT’s customers also make about 25% more money than WMT’s customers do, which means they’re more likely to swallow the extra shipping costs that come with online shopping.)

In a Consumer Reports investigation on customer service, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer and its wholesale retail cousin Sam’s Club, were rated among the worst for customer service.  In fact, Walmart and Sam’s were among the worst for customer service in eight industries including appliances, electronics, cell phones and supermarkets. In the report, one Walmart shopper recounts how a poorly trained and dismissive sales associate insisted that her purchase of the wrong version of a Bible could not be returned because company policy didn’t allow returned books. After 20 minutes and the sales associate’s inability to produce the policy, the reluctant sales associate discovered it could be returned and funds returned to the customer’s charge card. In tough times, the number of people available to help retail customers usually diminishes.  But many Americans believe companies are deliberately making it harder to contact them by burying phone numbers of company websites, diverting phone calls, and steering customers online for answers. When was the last time you telephoned a company’s customer service center and had a human being answer? In all fairness, Walmart probably was listed in so many categories for poor customer service because is it one of the few retailers that competes in so many sectors, specializes in low-priced items, and its stores are so large, a lap or two around it could amount to a mile’s walk. But could its subpar service have contributed to Walmart’s stagnant U.S. sales last year? It’s true that many Walmart customers like one-stop shopping and may be willing to give up a little personal attention for the savings that come with cheap prices and bulk purchases. But I doubt that any shopper who isn’t competing to be the next American Idol wants to spend their money with a retailer that allows inaction, long waits and snippy responses from its staff. Of course, Walmart wasn’t the only big name company to piss its customers off.  The report also shares tales of frustrated customers getting bad customer service from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL). But that should be of little comfort to Walmart or any retailer when its customers can go elsewhere. If you think they aren’t, read the report which says that 64% of the survey’s respondents said that during the last 12 months they’ve left a store because the service was poor. Sixty- seven percent hung up customer service because their problem wasn’t addressed. In this age of social media, retailers should beware.  If they aren’t willing to listen to customers complaints, I’m sure that visitors to social websites, such as privately-held Facebook Inc., Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and YouTube, certainly are. As of this writing, Cynthia Wilson did not own a position in any of the stocks named here.

(Devin Heroux/CBC News) After two weeks of battling Walmart Canada, PJ Mazzonna has the resolution he's been hoping for.  CBC Toronto first published the story of Mazzonna nearly two weeks ago. His family had given him the money to buy himself a Sony Playstation virtual reality headset for Christmas but what he got was closer to a lump of coal. GTA man expected a gaming headset for Christmas - but got a dirty T-shirt instead When he tore open the sealed gaming box, he found a dirty T-shirt, two bottles of water, glass cleaner and a demo disc inside. Mazzonna immediately took the box full of items back to the Ajax, Ont. Walmart where the purchase was originally made. Store managers there didn't believe him. GTA man alleges he was sold a dirty T-shirt instead of a Sony headset1:25 On Wednesday, Mazzonna said a Walmart manager informed him by phone that the company would refund the nearly $600 it cost to buy the headset. "I guess they didn't believe me at the time," he said. "I don't know what ended up changing. I would have liked to have seen a bit of a faster response on this." Mazzonna says the managers at Walmart said they are still dealing with Sony to find out how the T-shirt, bottled water and can of glass cleaner ended up in the box. That investigation is still ongoing. In an email response, a Walmart official said a situation like this "is not common" and that they review their return policies on an ongoing basis.  But Mazzonna said his family and friends are now boycotting Walmart. "It isn't a good way to treat a customer. There's nothing Walmart offers I can't find somewhere else." Not a unique situation There is an increasing trend of people receiving damaged products, or as in Mazzonna's case, packaging with missing products, according to the Consumers Council of Canada. "It is an area that we're paying some attention to because of sales over the internet specifically," said the council's executive director Ken Whitehurst. Mississauga couple shocked after receiving empty iPhone box "When you get into a dispute where goods are not delivered or damaged then you have an evidentiary problem. How do you prove it?" Whitehurst said people have a high level of confidence in retailers and consumers should start making it common practice to open products in the store when possible. "We also have a convenience-driven society. We don't want to take that time. In fact a lot of retailers are becoming averse to people opening packaging that is quite secure." Whitehurst said the council is now asking people to submit their product problems so that they can document the incidents and report them to the authorities.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Alliston Apsley Barrie Bracebridge Brampton Brantford Burlington Caledon Cambridge Cobourg Collingwood Dundalk Fort Erie Goderich Gravenhurst Guelph Haldimand County Haliburton Halton Hills Hamilton Kawartha Lakes (Lindsay) Kawartha Lakes (Fenelon Falls) Kincardine Kitchener-Waterloo London Markham Midland Mississauga Mount Forest Muskoka New Tecumseth Newmarket Niagara Falls Norfolk North Perth Oakville Orangeville Orillia Oshawa Owen Sound Peterborough Pickering Port Carling Port Colborne Port Elgin Port Perry Quinte West Richmond Hill Saugeen Shores Simcoe South Bruce Peninsula St. Catharines Stirling Stratford Tillsonburg Toronto Toronto Island Trenton Vaughan Vineland Walkerton Welland Whitby Wiarton Wingham Woodstock Shelburne Monday Mainly sunny 3°C Tuesday Periods of freezing rain or rain 3°C Wednesday Chance of showers 6°C Thursday A mix of sun and cloud 4°C Friday A mix of sun and cloud 2°C More Weather Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Toronto News Headlines Male rushed to hospital after incident involving both crash and shooting in Rexdale 'You're a dust fart': Woman caught on camera swearing at passenger on York region bus video Slippery conditions ahead as Environment Canada warns of freezing rain Monday night 'It's not a deterrent': Experts question whether tougher sentences counter drunk driving Mechanical problems surfacing in new streetcars more often than expected: report Top News Headlines 'The super-rich and the rest of us': 2 richest Canadians have wealth equal to 11 million poorest Stern warning from CIA to Trump, as press corps waits for walking papers Market forces align against oilsands though innovation promises an upside read comments Trudeau's shuffled cabinet: Generational renewal or benched expertise? read comments Ottawa police not laying charges after cyclist, car standoff video read comments Most Viewed 'You're a dust fart': Woman caught on camera swearing at passenger on York region bus Ontario drivers with unpaid speeding tickets to be denied licence plates Porter Airlines resumes flights following system outage affecting about 400 passengers 4 people still in hospital after crash north of Orangeville, Ont., police search for 3rd vehicle Police search for man, woman after thefts at Forest Hill synagogue 'It's not a deterrent': Experts question whether tougher sentences counter drunk driving Man, 24, dead after car crashes into Brampton streetlight This Toronto artist learned English from comics books - now he's the force behind DC series 'Trinity' Slippery conditions ahead as Environment Canada warns of freezing rain Monday night Mechanical problems surfacing in new streetcars more often than expected: report Don't Miss Updated Male rushed to hospital after incident involving both crash and shooting in Rexdale 'You're a dust fart': Woman caught on camera swearing at passenger on York region bus Slippery conditions ahead as Environment Canada warns of freezing rain Monday night 'It's not a deterrent': Experts question whether tougher sentences counter drunk driving Mechanical problems surfacing in new streetcars more often than expected: report Ontario drivers with unpaid speeding tickets to be denied licence plates 4 people still in hospital after crash north of Orangeville, Ont., police search for 3rd vehicle Niagara police find Advil mixed in with french vanilla ice cream This Toronto artist learned English from comics books - now he's the force behind DC series 'Trinity' Man, 24, dead after car crashes into Brampton streetlight No charges after cyclist, car standoff video, Ottawa police say Porter Airlines resumes flights following system outage affecting about 400 passengers 94-year-old woman dead in house fire in North York Recap McElhinney solid in 1st start as Leafs down Senators Divorce file reveals luxurious lifestyle for Prince and Canadian ex-wife Explore CBC CBC Home TV Radio News Sports Music Life Arts Kids Local Documentaries Comedy Books Parents Indigenous Digital Archives Games Contests Site Map Stay Connected Apps RSS Podcasts Newsletters & Alerts Services and Information Corporate Info Public Appearances Commercial Services Reuse & Permission Terms of Use Privacy Policy CBC Shop Help Contact Us Jobs Doing Business with Us Renting Facilities CBC Radio-Canada ©2017 CBC/Radio-Canada.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 11, 2017 -- 19:51 GMT (11:51 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software Cloud software vendor Workday just announced its biggest customer win to date -- discount retail giant Walmart. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech In an 8-k filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Workday said Walmart has purchased a subscription to Workday's Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning products. Walmart has more than 2 million employees and is considered the world's largest private employer. Based on that employee count, the deal could, over time, be worth $100 million to $200 million in annual revenue for Workday, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White noted in a research report. "However, Workday did not specify the number of Wal-Mart employees that will be part of this subscription," White said. "Also, a deal of this size will take some time to ramp and thus we do not expect the full revenue impact be felt in the first year or two." Shares of Workday are up around 7 percent. Workday said it is not updating financial guidance for Q4 of the current fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 or for fiscal year ending January 31, 2018. Workday released its Learning and Planning products last September at its Workday Rising conference in an effort to dramatically boost its footprint and addressable market. Out of its newer releases, Workday Planning has the most revenue potential given that so many companies still plan on spreadsheets. Workday Learning, which relies heavily on video and peer sharing of knowledge, is designed as a companion to the company's core HR software.

The manhunt for Markeith Loyd, accused of gunning down Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton in front of a Walmart Monday, stretched into a third day Wednesday as video from November surfaced showing his girlfriend joking at a traffic stop. “Go ahead and kill him, babe, so we can get home faster,” Sade Dixon playfully told her boyfriend, referring to the officer who pulled them over them over, according to a Facebook Live video. It’s not clear why the cop stopped them. Police said Markeith Loyd (r.) allegedly killed his girlfriend Sade Dixon (l.) in December. (Orange County Sheriff's Office) Later, when Loyd started speeding, the 24-year-old again teased him. Reward in Debra Clayton Orlando cop killing raised to $100,000 “You not about to kill me and the baby!” she said in the video, first uncovered by the Orlando Sentinel. “I'm not going to live past 25. I’m not going to make it!” Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was shot outside of a Walmart Monday. (@OrlandoPolice via Twitter) About a month later, Loyd, 41, fatally shot Dixon inside her Orange County home in December, police said. The attack also killed their unborn child. Police had been hunting for the accused killer for weeks when Clayton, who was on duty and wearing her uniform, recognized him in front of an Orlando Walmart Monday. Loyd opened fire when the officer demanded he stop, police said. This man 😂😩Posted by Markeith Loyd on Friday, 4 November 2016 Clayton was rushed to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead, and the shooting triggered a massive manhunt across Orlando. Orlando police officer shot dead near Walmart, manhunt for gunman As officers combed over the city Monday, two Orange County deputies were involved in motorcycle crashes. Deputy Norman Lewis, 35, died after a van struck him. Minutes later, Deputy Nelson Borjas suffered minor injuries in an unrelated motorcycle wreck. Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on Wednesday. (Orange County Jail) Funerals are planned for Lewis on Friday, and Clayton on Saturday. On Tuesday, officers increased the bounty for information on the on-the-loose killer to $100,000 and said that they were preparing arrest warrants for those believed to have helped Loyd evade the cops. Zarghee Mayan was arrested Tuesday for allegedly helping Loyd. Zarghee Mayan, a 33-year-old former coworker of Loyd's at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested later that night and charged with giving the fugitive food, transportation and money to him after the Dixon shooting. He allegedly told investigators that Loyd threatened him with death and made him drive the armed fugitive to his ex-wife's house, where no one answered the door, according to an arrest report seen by the Sentinel. Mayan, who admitted giving $200 to Loyd through his niece, said that the last time he saw Loyd was Saturday, two days before the killing of Clayton, and that his friend had a gun and was wearing body armor. The niece, 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on Wednesday for collecting the money. Her arrest affidavit said that she originally cooperated with investigators after the Dixon killing before stopping. Also Wednesday, Jameis Slaughter, was arrested and is accused of being an accessory after the fact. Slaughter's relation to Loyd was not immediately disclosed.   With News Wire Services With CHRIS BRENNAN, CHRIS SOMMERFELDT Tags: florida pregnancy gun violence police officers shot domestic violence Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Carney spoke at the Northwest Arkansas Tech Council’s monthly meeting in Bentonville on Wednesday (Jan. 11) about her passion for mentoring young women in the area of STEM education. Carney said she’s spent more than three decades working in technology, the past 24 of those at Wal-Mart. “When I was in college half of the students in my math classes were women. That just isn’t the case today. We know girls that are encouraged to take STEM classes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and mentored along the way often excel in these fields,” Carney told Talk Business & Politics. But she said too often when there are not mentors beginning in the junior high years, girls will lose interest because they don’t fully understand that a career in technology doesn’t have to mean you are writing code for a lifetime. Carney said the first five years she worked at Wal-Mart, she was a database administrator, but most of her time since has been in a management capacity overseeing various infrastructure components, from hardware and software applications used by stores and suppliers for operations, logistics and elsewhere. MILLION WOMEN MENTORS Carney is taking part in the national movement known as Million Women Mentors along with Karenann Terrell, chief information officer for Wal-Mart Stores. They are leaders in the movement since Wal-Mart has sponsored the entire state as part of this national mentoring initiative active now for two years. Wal-Mart has not publicized this effort, and when asked for information twice last year, the retailer did not respond to Talk Business & Politics. Carney said the company is active in the program as a platinum level sponsor with funding, but the real work goes on with administrators in schools and the hundreds of mentor volunteers – men and women dedicated to engaging girls in STEM education and fostering mentorships for women and girls seeking technology careers. Rita Carney, vice president IT business continuity for Wal-Mart Technology Carney has taken on a mentee in the program who is now a student at NorthWest Arkansas Community College. Carney said mentors agree to spend 20 hours a year talking with and cheering on their mentees in the areas of STEM education. Carney shared a recent conversation she had with her mentee around her spring schedule at NWACC. Her mentee has an interest in robotics and works in the IT field now building and repairing computers. “I asked her what science she was taking this semester and she told me biology. I asked her why, wondering if she had an interest in medical technology. She told me biology would be easy. I then asked her what science might fit better with her field of robotics and she knew physics would be a better science but added there was so much math in that class. I asked her if she was taking a math class and what her grade was last semester in her math class. She told she had an A. So it wasn’t that she couldn’t do the math, she just needed a nudge. It felt great to get the text a few days later that she had changed her schedule and was now taking physics,” Carney said. She also spoke about the mentors she has had throughout her career, noting that some were men and some women and it took them all to get her where she is. WORKFORCE SHORTAGE Carney said part of the reason she is so passionate about mentoring girls in STEM education is because they are needed in the workforce as technology touches every business and is radically transforming most of them. Jobs in the STEM careers have grown three times faster than non-STEM jobs in the past decade and 80% of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. depend upon mastery of mathematics and scientific knowledge. While women comprise 50% of the U.S. workforce, just 24% are in STEM fields, a statistic that has held constant for nearly the last  decade, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Almost one-third of all male freshmen, compared with only 15% of all female freshmen, plan to major in a STEM field even though 15 out of the 20 fastest growing occupations in 2015 are expected to require science or mathematics training. Carney said women often leave STEM degree paths despite good academic standing. Even when they persist and earn a STEM degree, women are less likely than their male counterparts to work in a STEM field, despite the fact the pay is high. She said women might only earn 72 cents for every $1 a man earns in the same profession, but that isn’t true in technology related jobs. She said there is near parity and women who excel into leadership roles often earn more than men because they are in such high demand. ARKANSAS EFFORT She encouraged every business person attending the meeting to think about how they might take part in the Million Women Mentors program in Arkansas which began last year in concert with Lt. Governor Tim Griffin who conducted a roadshow in the six largest areas of Arkansas last year to drum up interest in the program. Carney said Griffin will in 2017 visit six more areas including Batesville, Harrison, Russellville and Arkadelphia. Carney said Wal-Mart is working with high school students and RockFish Interactive is working with middle school students and there are many opportunities for groups and businesses to engage. She said the Girls Scouts are taking part and working with girls as young as kindergarten age. “It’s going to take many more to help us reach our goal which is now 2 million girls with mentors, now that more states have jumped onboard,” Carney said. “We know that helping girls excel in STEM fields can be a game-changer for households and generations because women often reinvest their success in their communities.” Carney said there are several programs at work from Ozark Stem Education, AR Girls Code, Hour of Code and coding camps taking place for pre-teens across the region but too often even when there is a scholarship to cover the cost, the girls don’t have transportation for these camps that take place in the summer. “Surely there is an answer given we are an Uber society, but too many people don’t know there is problem,” she added. LOCAL SUCCESS Caroline Gschwend, a high school senior in Rogers, also spoke at the meeting. Gschwend, homeschooled her entire life, entered the Congressional App Challenge in 2016 after she attended a couple of summer coding camps. She began to play around with app creation in areas that interested her. She created the DefendUs App which was selected as the winner for the 3rd Congressional District. Gschwend said it took her about two weeks to come up the gaming app that is set in the American Revolution and has chief characters in the war (history heroes) fighting off their foes. She used IOS and Swift coding to design the app. Gschwend said she is still trying to decide on which college she will attend but the short list includes University of Arkansas, University of California-Berkeley, and University of California-Los Angeles. Her plans are to major in computer science and she has already signed up to mentor younger girls in STEM. Carney congratulated Gschwend on winning the Congressional App Challenge which garnered her a trip to Washington D.C. she plans to take in April. Also last year she was one of 28 international winners in the Google Code-In competition which landed her a trip to San Francisco and tour of Google Headquarters. “If you want to leave me your business card Caroline, I will be glad to take it,” Carney told the teen. “If you don’t have one, you really should get some and I am not kidding.” Carney closed the meeting with a call to action saying there are many more mentors needed and not everyone has to be a coder. She said marketing, design and an interest in technology can qualify someone as a program mentor. She said men also are being asked to step forward to raise the next generation of tech savvy females it will take to keep the world moving forward.

The catch: You'll need to pay to get your taxes done. H&R Block promotes its Refund Advance program on storefront windows, like one in Hazel Park in early January. (Photo: Susan Tompor) It's going to be hard to turn on the TV, drive past a tax preparation storefront or walk into a Walmart early into this tax season and not be deluged with pitches for fast-cash, refund-related loans at 0%. H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt and others are fighting for market share and trying to lock in customers who might otherwise turn to an online competitor, like TurboTax. The strategy is to heavily market easy money loans for a limited time — typically through February — to struggling tax filers who benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit but now face added delays for early refund money. Consumers who might receive refunds of $4,000 or more thanks to the Earned Income Tax Credit now are told not to expect refund money until Feb. 27, a few weeks later than usual. Experts say early filers still should file in January and February, like usual, as waiting might drag out the process even more. The 0% pitches come at a time when the working poor and moderate-income families are particularly vulnerable because they turn to early tax refunds to cover winter heating bills and other expenses. "They expect refunds at a certain time," said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center. "These are families who can use every penny they can get." But the rules changed this tax season, thanks to a push in Congress to combat fraud and crooks who steal IDs to file fake tax returns that tap into generous tax credits, like the EITC, to rip off the federal government. H&R Block estimates some 15 million tax filers who receive the EITC and often file early could face delays. "With this client, there are real needs for cash," said William Cobb, CEO of H&R Block. On Monday, H&R Block rolled out its Refund Advance product,  which is being pitched as a 0% interest loan with no finance charges. The H&R Block tax-related loan will be made in the amounts of $500, $750, or $1,250 upfront, based on the eligibility of the client. Refund Advance is offered by H&R Block through a partnership with MetaBank, a federal savings bank based in Sioux Falls, S.D., which can provide up to $1.6 billion of such loans to H&R Block customers. The loan itself is available if the tax filer is projected to have a tax refund of at least $1,000. The H&R Block loan is only available in H&R Block offices, not online. "We're driven to get more clients," Cobb said. "This is about as consumer-friendly as you can get." Refunds will be later This tax season, many tax filers on the edge could very well take a second look at such products. Beginning this year, the IRS by law cannot release tax refunds for returns that claim Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 — known as the PATH Act — put these extra hurdles into place as a way to combat fraud and ID theft. Realistically, tax experts say it could be until Feb. 27 or so by the time many early tax filers receive their refund cash. It's not a small point for many families. "For most Americans who file in January and February, they really rely on their refund as one of their biggest checks of the year," said David Prokupek, CEO of Jackson Hewitt. Prokupek said some $50 billion of refunds could be delayed as a result of the new law and many consumers will want some product to deal with those kind of numbers. "No one has that much spare change lying around," Prokupek said. Jackson Hewitt offers loans Jackson Hewitt's Express Refund Advance is marketed as a loan with no fees, a 0% annual percentage rate and no credit check. Jackson Hewitt's Express Refund Advance offers loans in amounts of $250, $500, $750, $1,000 and $1,300 — again depending on what the customer is approved for by MetaBank. For example, someone who is likely to get a $500 tax refund might qualify for a $250 advance. Jackson Hewitt kicked off its tax season in late November by offering a way for taxpayers to prequalify for an Express Refund Advance by answering a few questions on www.ExpressRefundAdvance.com. Early loans could even be granted with just a pay stub — not W-2s, which are to be out by Jan. 31. Shoppers at Walmart — Jackson Hewitt has tax service operations in 3,000 Walmart stores — are seeing signs in the store promoting the new refund advance product. Again, the advance loans are only available if you go to a Walmart location or one of Jackson Hewitt's storefronts. You cannot obtain the loans online. "Handing out money over the Internet without seeing your face or ID is not something we want to do," Prokupek said. To get the loan, you will have to pay to file your taxes with Jackson Hewitt. And if you take out a refund advance at H&R Block, you'd have to file your taxes with H&R Block. The advances would be repaid with actual tax refund money when that's issued. If you qualify for the Jackson Hewitt advance product, customers can receive the money via direct deposit or loaded onto an American Express Serve Card at no charge. One promotion offers customers who opt for the American Express prepaid card a $50 Walmart gift card. "Consumers are spending their refund dollars at Walmart," Prokupek said. With the American Express Serve card, consumers can withdraw cash for free at MoneyPass-branded ATMs, which are listed online at www.moneypass.com. Consumers would pay a $3.50 American Express Serve fee for withdrawing cash at non-MoneyPass ATMs. And it's possible that the ATM operator may also charge a fee. The H&R Block loan is loaded onto a H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. You'd pay a $3 fee at ATMs for withdrawing cash. You can avoid added surcharge fees by getting cash at MoneyPass ATMs or Allpoint ATMs in 7-Eleven and CVS stores. Ask before you sign up So what are the questions consumers need to ask, if they're tempted by 0% refund advances? One concern: How much will tax preparation services cost you? Financially strapped tax filers could be tempted to pay up to a few hundred dollars or so for tax preparation services instead of using free services, if they want to gain access to advance loans. DETROIT FREE PRESS More W-2s to have a 16-digit code to fight tax fraud Tax filers who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit  risk forgoing free tax preparation services via volunteer tax assistance programs, such as those offered by AARP and the Accounting Aid Society.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that 70% of the nation’s taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File where software is available to those with incomes of $64,000 or less. See www.irs.gov. "A taxpayer should ask about the costs involved with their tax preparation and any related products offered so they can make informed decisions," said Marshall Hunt, certified public accountant and director of tax policy for the Accounting Aid Society's tax assistance program in Detroit. DETROIT FREE PRESS Some families can't bank on a tax refund before Feb. 27 Other potential costs: How much will it cost you to get your money via a prepaid card? While many cards offer services with no fees, review potential fees with the card, including what it would cost you to go to an ATM to get money. For example, the Jackson Hewitt product offers no-fee transactions at MoneyPass ATMs but transactions at non-MoneyPass ATMs have a $3.50 American Express Serve fee. And it's possible that the operator of the ATM you use also charges another fee. If you don't use one of these prepaid cards for two months or so, you could be hit with inactivity fees each month. Wu, of the National Consumer Law Center, says there's always a concern that unscrupulous tax preparers could pad fees to borrowers. And she warns that consumers would want to consider any hidden fees and possible add-on fees if they opted for another product, like a refund anticipation check. In some cases, advocates warned that consumers can be hit with fees of $25 to $60 for refund anticipation checks. Consumers who face delays should consider contingency plans. Prioritize paying rent and utilities. Do not expect a tax refund to arrive like it did last year to pay those bills, especially if you receive the EITC. Even with the advance loans, consumers need to realize that there are limits on how much advance cash will be available. Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Jobs cuts looming at Wal-Mart. Sources say the world's largest retailer will announce as early as Friday that it'll lay off hundreds of people at its Arkansas headquarters. Workers afraid of losing their jobs have been flooding recruiting firms with resumes. Wal-Mart would not comment. The cuts - expected to be fewer than 500 - are a small percentage of its staff of 18,000. But it's part of CEO Doug McMillon's drive to cut costs. Wal-Mart has been increasing wages for half- a million workers at its stores. Those costs, combined with a stronger dollar, hurt its quarterly profit and forced the company to sharply cut its earnings forecast for the year. Wal-Mart is also spending more on training in its bid to improve customer service. Investors sent Wal-Mart shares lower at the start of trading. The stock has fallen nearly 25 percent this year, vastly underperforming that of its rivals, Amazon and Target.

"They gave me a box cutter and sent me down to hardware," Bohra said. He opened a box of merchandise but didn't know where the contents belonged on the shelves, so he asked another associate at the store, who showed him where to stock it.

Tips for safe online shopping PennSuburban Chamber planning Lansdale-centric subcommittee to spur business When he opened the next box, he again had to ask the co-worker where that merchandise went. "There was no structured training," Bohra, who is now a market manager for a group of Walmart stores, including the one in Hilltown (also known as the Hatfield store), said while speaking at graduation ceremonies Jan. 10 for the new employee training academy in the Hilltown store. Much of his initial training for the job came from fellow employees, he said. "Associates are the ones who taught me all along the way," Bohra said. Walmart plans to open about 200 of the training academies throughout the country by year's end, David Redfield, divisional senior vice president, said. "This is the 41st academy we're opening up," and the first in Pennsylvania, Redfield said. The academy at the local store will be used to train employees from about 20 other Walmart stores in the region, he said. "Our training academies help provide associates with the skills they need to succeed and advance while creating a better and more consistent customer experience," Michael Collischan, vice president and regional general manager, said in a release about the Jan. 10 graduation ceremonies and ribbon-cutting for the new academy. "Skills training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge, which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth and helps make working at Walmart a smart career choice," Collischan said. The academies will provide training for more than 140,000 Walmart employees per year, the company said. Associates at all levels of store operations, from entry-level to regional general manager, will take part in Walmart's new Pathways training programs, the company said. As part of the Pathways program, hourly frontline supervisors and department managers will attend a two-week training program at an academy. "Areas of study include leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service, in addition to the department-specific training," the Walmart release said. The first graduating class at Hilltown had 49 members who received a week-long training on retail fundamentals, Jay Galicki, the academy manager, said. "It intermingles the classroom with hands-on training," he said. Having more consistency in the training leads to more consistency in the stores, Tracy Ford, regional human resources manager, said. Jessica Perry, an academy department manager, was one of the graduates and is also a teacher at the academy, where she teaches apparel. 1 2 next  last »
Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Nintendo Switch Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC Rumor: Nintendo Switch Target Pre-Sale Listed at $300, 15 Launch Games By Boston Blake | 4 days ago  According to details from a leak on Twitter, the Nintendo Switch will be available for pre-order at Target for $300 and will release alongside 15 launch titles. As Nintendo prepares for its major Nintendo Switch event tomorrow, retail chains are gearing up store shelves in preparation for the flood of gamers looking to purchase the console. While the Nintendo Switch isn’t due out until March, big-box stores like Walmart and Target are getting their placeholder information finalized for the new Nintendo console. According to Twitter user Wario64, Target has generated a handful of placeholder entries in its system for the Nintendo Switch and its launch titles. If these placeholder entries are to be believed, the Nintendo Switch will sell for $299 and come alongside 15 launch titles. 15 Nintendo Switch games in Target's system https://t.co/kZRckMOV0Bhttps://t.co/gwIRTdYkQO $299 placeholder Switch https://t.co/v5FF71LFli pic.twitter.com/QlNa2ox2x7— Wario64 (@Wario64) January 11, 2017 The $299 price tag is much closer to what gamers and analysts expect for the Nintendo Switch than the Walmart price of $399 that was leaked earlier today. In that situation, a Redditor claiming to be a Walmart employee shared a photo of a Walmart price tag touting the Nintendo Switch pre-order cost at the $400 mark. It’s no surprise to see retail chains prepare for the release of a major consumer electronic item, especially one as highly anticipated as the Nintendo Switch. With the growth of social media over the last decade, it’s become difficult for video game hardware and software makes to keep pricing and release date information under wraps thanks to leaks that come by way of retail stores, both physical and online. What is interesting, at least in this instance, is the disparity between the prices revealed so far. Walmart’s tag claims the console will cost $399, while Target’s says $299. Analysts in Japan reported earlier this week that the Nintendo Switch would retail for no more than $250. Granted, that could be the Japanese pricing, which may differ from North America and Europe, but the differences are still noteworthy. Ultimately, gamers need only wait until tomorrow for Nintendo to reveal the official price for the Nintendo Switch. It will be interesting to see if the Nintendo Switch comes with different hard drive space options or bundles, which would make the pricing differences more understandable. Considering PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are available with different storage space options, and often come bundled with accessories or games, there could very well be a $299 and $399 option for the Nintendo Switch. In addition to the pricing for the Nintendo Switch, gamers are excited to see if Nintendo does, in fact, reveal 15 launch titles for the console. Doing so could shed some light on the potential power of the new console, as well as the amount of support expected from third-party game developers. What do you think about Target’s leaked pricing for Nintendo Switch? The Nintendo Switch is set to release March 2017. tags: Nintendo, Nintendo Switch, Switch Game Title Nintendo Switch Platform Publisher Nintendo Developer Nintendo Release Mar 03, 2017 Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2016 Game Rant, LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE
Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Walmart Scan & Go shopping app hits the Android platform By Rei Padla - January 11, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Hi-tech and digital shopping doesn’t end in using your credit cards, PayPal, or those other mobile payment services. There are several apps that have proven to be useful the past few years but we know this process can still be improved. Apart from the likes of Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, or Android Pay being enhanced and getting more features, there are company-specific apps that aim to make shopping easier, faster, and more convenient. No, it’s nothing like the drone-assisted Amazon Prime Air but just this Scan & Go app for shopping at Walmart. There’s he Walmart Pay already announced in December 2015 and rolled out during the second half of 2016. This time, Walmart is allowing shoppers to just scan their items on the smartphones, pay, and then go. The app is still in its beta testing phase at Walmart No. 5260. It’s only one store located in Rogers, Arkansas. The retail giant seems to be serious in going digital. This will benefit not only the consumers but also the employees as their work load will be reduced. As for the shoppers, standing in line will no longer be a problem because you may not have to do that anymore. Actually, iPhone owners have been using the app but it’s only now the Android community is getting it. The idea is for the shopper to scan the UPC code of an item, put it inside your basket or cart, shop for more, and then pay via the mobile app. An electronic receipt will then be sent to you. Once you’re done, show the receipt to a Walmart employee or guard, smile, and then you’re out. Shopping is over! It seems to good to be true because it requires honesty but of course, we know you will never shortchange Walmart. Remember: Honestly is the Best Policy. This app will require you to do extra work though, scan each item’s barcode while you shop. Every time you get an item, scan right away. The running total of the products inside your cart or basket will be shown. Check out to finally pay for all the items.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley Town Manager: Brown Act violation decision based on ‘incorrect facts’ Wednesday Jan 11, 2017 at 11:52 AM Jan 11, 2017 at 11:52 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The town’s chief employee has responded to last week’s appellate-court ruling related to Brown Act violations that made a ballot initiative passed by voters to bring a Wal-Mart Supercenter here illegal. After review of a 4th District Court of Appeal decision that upheld, in part, a trial court’s previous ruling, Town Manager Frank Robinson told the Daily Press the Town Council “will have to consider all of its options” going forward. “We are obviously disappointed in the Brown Act decision, especially as it was premised on some incorrect facts,” Robinson said in an emailed statement. “The trial court actually did not find that the decision to send the initiatives to the voters violated the Brown Act.” The trial court did find, however, that the Town Council’s August 2013 approval of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Wal-Mart did violate the Brown Act insofar as it was not agendized prior to the Council’s vote. It was that aspect of the ruling that the appellate court upheld. Documents show that “since the decision to place the Initiative on the ballot by the Town Council is null and void based on the Brown Act violation, the Initiative is null and void.” Town Attorney John Brown said attorneys for the town “attempted to explain the Brown Act distinction to the Court of Appeal during oral argument.” “However” he added, “the Court’s final decision did not reflect that discussion.” The MOU allowed the town to accept a gift from Wal-Mart to cover the costs of a special election related to the the initiative, known as Measure D. The trial court also ruled the initiative itself violated the California Constitution because it granted “special privileges on the ‘owner’ of the property, which is Wal-Mart," despite Wal-Mart not being named specifically as the owner. But a three-judge panel in the appellate court reversed that decision, stating in documents that because Wal-Mart could sell the property, "it would have no superior right over the subsequent owner or developer of the property.” “We are pleased that the Court reversed the decision on the Constitutional issue as it affirms the people’s power of initiative regarding land-use decisions,” Robinson said. “This decision has important statewide implications.” The appellate court found that upholding the violation would “extend” a section of the state’s Constitution, thus invalidating “any land-use initiative” because “one only would need to establish the company who intended to develop the property or owned the property, even though the Initiative itself makes no reference to the entity.” “We do not find anything in the legislative history or the language of the statute that (the section) was intended to be this broadly interpreted,” the judges said in documents. As for what’s next, Brown told the Daily Press on Tuesday a petition for California Supreme Court review is available to both sides in the case.

REUTERS/Mike Blake | Caption Patrick Reilly Staff January 11, 2017 —Even the world’s largest retailer can’t avoid the challenges facing brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart will soon cut hundreds of jobs from its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and its regional offices, as The Wall Street Journal first reported this week. The announcement comes amid a downturn for some traditional retail stores. Macy’s and Sears are cutting back, as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week, as more consumers shop online or at discount-rack stores, although some segments, like fast fashion, have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart, which predicts flat earnings growth for its next fiscal year, is also feeling the pinch. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” spokesman Greg Hitt told Fortune, although he did not confirm job cuts. But unlike other troubled chains, which have closed stores and laid off retail staff, Wal-Mart is cutting costs at the corporate level. Meanwhile, it’s continuing an expensive – and controversial – effort to improve its stores by paying workers more. For years, labor groups criticized Wal-Mart for its treatment of retail staff, including its wages and a lack of unions. A 2011 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that its employees earned an estimated 12.4 percent less than retail workers as a whole, and 14.5 percent less than workers in large retail in general. Last year, the chain announced a "two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers," in which all employees hired before January 1st, 2016 would receive at least $10 per hour; new hires' wages would start at $9 per hour, but increase to $10 after they complete a training program. Ten companies with great starting wages Amid rising concerns about inequality and low minimum wages, this pay hike at the world’s largest retailer sparked debate. Some saw the wage hikes as a smart business decision that better motivated workers and reversed years of customer complaints about poor service. But others saw the wage increase as trouble for Wal-Mart’s bottom line, and dismissed some arguments in favor of it – such as the idea that better-paid employees would spend more in-store, helping to offset the losses of paying higher wages.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Other critics argued the wage hike didn't go far enough, as the Monitor reported in 2015: But advocates for low-wage workers, while supporting the wage boost, say the pay increases will have minimal effect on workers' lives without a full workweek. Companies like Wal-Mart have turned the scheduling of part-time workers into a science, says Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. Computer programs used by Wal-Mart and other large retail outlets piece together employee schedules and are frequently programmed to keep employees' hours below the threshold where benefits kick in, she says. “These are super-sophisticated programs that work in real time calculating to the minute based on customer traffic, calling people in to work and sending them home accordingly,” she says. “Working there makes it nearly impossible to plan a stable budget, have another job, or go to schools.” This week's job-cutting news comes as the latest of several Wal-Mart cost-cutting measures which have left white-collar employees in Bentonville uneasy. In September, the company announced it would cut 7,000 back-office positions; last October, it eliminated 450 positions at headquarters, a move it said would make Wal-Mart more "nimble." But unlike their counterparts at Sears or Macy’s, the sales associates at your local Wal-Mart are probably breathing a sigh of relief.

Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 14:18 EST, 11 January 2017 | Updated: 20:22 EST, 11 January 2017 e-mail 34 shares 1 View comments An eerie video of an Orlando man wanted for the deaths of his pregnant girlfriend and two police officers has surfaced showing his partner joking that he would kill her. Markeith Loyd is on the run in Florida after shooting veteran police officer Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton outside a Walmart on Monday.  Orange County Sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis died after being hit by a car while on his patrol motorcycle during search for Loyd on the same day.  The 41-year-old is believed to have killed his pregnant girlfriend Sade Dixon in December.  In videos on his Facebook page taken before her death, the seemingly loved-up pair joked in his car about how he would eventually kill her with his manic driving.  Scroll down for video  Markeith Loyd, who is wanted for killing his pregnant girlfriend Sade Dixon (right) in December, appeared with her in an eerie video weeks earlier where she predicted he would cause her death  In the footage, Dixon told the camera jokingly that she wouldn't live 'past 25' because of Loyd after the pair were pulled over by a traffic cop.  'Someone stop this man, someone stop him,' she laughed to the camera in one clip the pair filmed together.  'This man, he has to be stopped. He has to be stopped, somebody stop him! He has to be stopped. I'm not going to live past 25. 'I'm not going to make it. Not like this. I might as well pray every day and make sure I make it into heaven. Loyd , 41, went on the run after her death last year  'I don't know what I was getting myself in to or what I signed up for.'  Loyd received a warning from a police officer moments earlier for driving without a seat belt. His girlfriend also joked: 'Go ahead and kill him, babe, so we can get home faster.'   Dixon was shot dead outside her home on December 13, just over a month after the video was taken. She was three months pregnant at the time.   Officers wanted to speak with her boyfriend in connection with the killing but he evaded them.   On Monday, he is believed to have gunned down Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton outside a Walmart in Orlando. He fled the supermarket after the shooting, with witnesses describing how he fired into the 11-year police veteran's cruiser.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Utah repo man sobs as he's sentenced up to 15 years in...

Police say Loyd may face charges for his death once captured.    Dixon, 24, was gunned down outside her home in Pine Hills, Orlando, on December 14  Orlando Police Department Master Sgt. Debra Thomas Clayton (left) was shot dead outside of a Pine Hills Walmart store on Monday. During the early hours of the manhunt for Loyd, Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis (right)  was killed in a crash as authorities gave pursuit Police Chief John Mina stated that Loyd could face charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer in relation to Lewis' death (crash scene above) A boot lies on Pine Hills Road on Monday after Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was struck by a van while responding to the manhunt for Loyd The hunt for him entered its second day on Wednesday as police stumped up a $100,000 for information.  Zarghee Mayan was arrested on Tuesday for assisting Loyd escape arrest Zarghee Mayan was arrested on Tuesday for assisting Loyd escape arrest.  Police believe he was with the man as recently as Saturday and was helping him hide from authorities after Dixon's murder.  He told police Loyd had been wearing a bullet proof vest since his girlfriend's death, according to Click Orlando.  Loyd has served 10 years in prison and five years probation for conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine, according to federal court records. Back in 1999 he was sentenced to prison and was released from probation in 2014. A November post on his Facebook page says: 'Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted'. Orlando Police Chief John Mina vowed to use all of the department's resources to hunt the man on Tuesday.  Clayton's flag-draped coffin (above) was removed from Orlando Regional Medical Center and was provided a police escort from the hospital hours after her fatal shooting 'We will track him down to the ends of the earth,' he said during a press conference. 'Debra Clayton is a hero, and she gave her life to protect the community she loves,' 'She will be deeply missed,' he added.  Clayton, who was one of the first officers to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre on June 12, was married with a college-age son. She is described by colleagues and those who knew her as a person who always gave back to the community and loved helping others. A November post on his Facebook page says: 'Goals!!!! To be on Americas most wanted' Police are offering a $100,000 reward for information on Loyd's whereabouts. He is believed to be driving a hijacked car (not pictured)  A GoFundMe page has been created to raise funds for Clayton's funeral costs. In 17 hours, more than $16,600 has been donated towards the $20,000 goal. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was 'heartbroken and angered' over the loss of lives. Lewis played college football and earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Central Florida. The Monday morning shooting happened just after 7.15am, as police say Clayton had been shopping in the store and was outside putting bags in the trunk of her car when someone told her that Loyd, a suspect wanted in connection with the December murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, may have been inside the store. The 17-year veteran was heading back into the store alone and had radioed in at 7.17am 'to say that she was attempting to contact a murder suspect,' Mina said. She told the suspect to 'stop', but he immediately fired multiple shots at her before fleeing the scene, authorities said. At 7.19am, officers radioed in to say Clayton had been shot and the first responding officers on scene began CPR on Clayton. She was pronounced dead at 7.40am at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Loyd then carjacked a vehicle before getting out and running off, police said.  He is considered to be armed and dangerous and police are asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to please call 1-800-423-TIPS.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow She's falling for him?

 Walmart is poised for a digital shopping spree BI Intelligence Jan. 11, 2017, 12:43 PM 2,389 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart acquires ShoeBuy for $70M Here's how Walmart and Green Dot could incentivize prepaid use Walmart tightens grip on online grocery This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Last week, Walmart announced the acquisition of e-commerce pureplay ShoeBuy.com for $70 million in a deal that will bolster the footwear inventory on the retail giant's e-commerce subsidiary, Jet.com. Now, it seems that as Walmart attempts to grow online revenue, which accounts for only 3% of total sales, similar acquisitions could be in the pipeline. Walmart plans to spend $1.1 billion to bolster e-commerce operations in the year ahead, according to Motley Fool. Walmart is increasing inventory in niche categories. Marc Lore, Walmart’s head of e-commerce and Jet’s former CEO, indicated that categories with long-tail, high-margin products are top priority for acquisition targets. ShoeBuy fits this characteristic, and Walmart will likely target similar apparel-focused companies in the year ahead. Walmart still does not rank in the top 10 online retailers apparel retailers, and a buy-versus-build strategy better positions the company to increase inventory quickly.   But Walmart needs to invest in the customer experience, too. Jet.com struggles with customer loyalty, with 70% of total sales coming from new customers as of February 2016, according to Slice Intelligence. Although acquiring smaller companies to boost inventory is a step in the right direction, Walmart will have to refine the customer journey to compete with the likes of Amazon and other successful online retailers. These types of investments could help Walmart become a stronger e-commerce player. Walmart's online sales grew nearly 21% year-over-year (YoY) in Q3 2016, with gross merchandise volume (GMV) increasing over 28% YoY, excluding the recently sold Yihaodian division. This is a notable improvement from Q2 2016 when online sales and GMV grew 12% and 13%, respectively, YoY. As customers increasingly shift to digital, we expect Walmart to place more focus on increasing its inventory and merchant base for Walmart Marketplace, while scooping up online pureplays that can boost sales on Jet.com. Of course, none of this will matter if customers don't complete the purchase process. This is a major point of emphasis for online retailers that are trying to reduce shopping cart abandonment and get online shoppers to finish the transaction. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on shopping cart abandonment that explains what leads a shopper to abandon an online purchase and how retailers can begin to combat rising shopping cart abandonment rates. The report collects and analyzes data from top e-commerce companies, as well as thoughts from industry experts whose job it is to reduce abandonment rates and boost conversions, to come up with a number of solutions that can help retailers recover lost sales. Here are some key points from the report: Shopping cart abandonment is increasing, and it will continue to do so as more consumers shift to online and mobile shopping. In 2013, as many as 74% of online shopping carts were abandoned by shoppers, according to data shared with BI Intelligence by e-commerce data company, Barilliance. That abandonment rate is up from 72% in 2012, and 69% in 2011. An abandoned shopping cart does not automatically translate to a "lost sale," because three-fourths of shoppers who have abandoned shopping carts say they plan to return to the retailer's website or store to make a purchase, according to data from SeeWhy. Online-only retailers are at a disadvantage to "omnichannel" retailers in this respect because they have fewer channels through which to recover lost sales. Retailers can reduce the rate of abandonment and increase conversions by streamlining the checkout process and also by retargeting shoppers with emails after they've left a website. Initial emails, sent three hours after a consumer abandons a cart, average a 40% open rate and a 20% click-through rate, according to Listrak. More broadly, an abandoned shopping cart should be seen as part of the increasingly complex series of steps a consumer might take before finally making a purchase and a strong indicator of consumer interest in a product or a brand. Technology that helps retailers collect and leverage online shopping cart data is likely to be a worthwhile investment. In full, the report: Explains the complex relationship between consumers and retailers and outlines reasons why shoppers abandon a purchase. Includes interviews with executives from top retailers and marketing agencies who talk about what they are doing to reduce shopping cart abandonment. Proposes a list of solutions that are proven to reduce shopping cart abandonment for online retailers. Forecasts where this trend is going and how shopping cart abandonment will affect retailers — bricks-and-mortars and e-commerce companies alike — in the future.

Step two: Try to sell those gift cards online for millions of dollars without getting caught.  If there’s one way that criminals love to use your stolen credit card information, it’s to rush out and buy a pile of gift cards for popular retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon. Gift cards are easy to spend or sell and notoriously difficult to track. However, as it turns out, that anonymity goes out of the window when you pull out a computer to sell those gift cards online. In a recent scheme described in a previously unreported federal court case, some person or persons based in Florida bought 45,000 gift cards for Walmart and other stores with stolen card info and then sold them on gift card exchange site Raise.com. The gift cards’ face value ranged from $2 to $2,000 each and were sold for a total of $9 million on Raise. (A spokesperson for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida declined to comment on whether the fraudster was, indeed, a Florida man.) The wrinkle? Authorities got onto the scam while it was still ongoing. Raise was tipped off by federal prosecutors and asked to keep the fraudsters’ account open, Raise CEO George Bousis told Forbes, whose company has facilitated the sale of almost $1 billion in gift cards since it was founded in 2013. “It’s ridiculous. We have your social security number, IP address, all your bank information,” says Bousis, referencing some of the information you have to enter in order to sell gift cards in bulk on his site. “I’m not sure how some of these people think they’re going to get away with it.” In recent years, sites like Raise, Gift Card Granny and CardCash have popped up to facilitate the inevitable offloading of unwanted gift cards. (Some $91 billion will likely be added onto gift cards in the U.S. this year, according to Mercator Advisory Group.) To reduce fraud, Raise and other sites require extensive information from sellers and give a 100-day guarantee to buyers. This has helped keep criminals at bay, even as they are increasingly flocking to gift cards to launder money, drawn largely by their difficultly to track. The misuse of gift cards has escalated in the wake of high-profile hacks at Home Depot, Target and other retailers, which has put legions of credit card information in unsavory hands. The card data can be replicated on a physical credit card in a fashion that’s similar to creating fake IDs for underage drinkers. Then accomplices holding those fake cards march into stores, use them to scoop up gift cards and sell the ill-gotten cards at pawn shops or mall kiosks. “The real world of liquidating gift cards is face to face,” says T. Jack Williams, president of ERAD Group, which equips police with a device to read prepaid cards and freeze or seize the assets. “Criminals don’t like the online guys because they’re not getting cash and they’re leaving a trail.” The scheme out of Florida is a good example of what not to do. The investigation, spearheaded by the feds, ultimately relied on cooperation from some of the world’s biggest retailers, banks and media companies. Take Walmart, which sold $1.3 million in gift cards to the fraudster and was tasked with reviewing a sampling of them. It found that 200 cards were purchased at Walmart stores across the country. The majority of the credit and debit cards that were used, according to the banks, were ultimately closed due to fraudulent activity traced back to Walmart. Authorities were then able to go to Raise to see how the scheme generated $7.5 million in proceeds (down from $9 million after the company took its fees and commissions), which was funneled into bank accounts, including ones held at Citi and Wells Fargo. This money was withdrawn, in cash, within a matter of days. Raise provided the IP address associated with the account to help track down the fraudster. It was linked to Comcast, which, under subpoena, provided customer records that contained a street address. Prosecutors visited the address and seized $442,081 in cash. The defendant was seen making a getaway and “exiting that location with a black briefcase,” according to court documents. Unfortunately, it typically isn’t this easy to follow the money. Once a gift card leaves the store, that’s usually the end of the story, which poses a unique challenge to law enforcement. “Had the 9/11 terrorists used prepaid (stored-value) cards to cover their expenses, none of these financial footprints would have been available,” observed a U.S. Treasury Department report. The IRS has declared prepaid cards “the currency of criminals.” In order to prevent this type of fraud, many retailers are tightening their sales policies. At Walmart, you must show identification for gift card purchases of $5,000 or more, according to a spokesperson, and store managers have the authority to halt a transaction at any point. In 2014, drugstore chain CVS began requiring identification for $300 or more in gift card purchases; it also won’t let you walk out of the store with more than $2,000 in gift cards in a given day. “We have seen significant progress in this area over the years,” says Carol Van Cleef, a lawyer at BakerHostetler who specializes in anti-money laundering in the prepaid card space. The controls that have been put in place by Walmart and CVS go beyond what the law requires. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, a company that sells more than $10,000 in gift cards in a day to a single person paying in cash must file a suspicious activity report with the federal government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. However there are no requirements for reporting purchases made with a credit card, including those made online. Retailers, of course, want to sell as many gift cards as possible. They also want to keep regular customers happy. “There’s always going to be concern about how to keep the lines moving but adequately protect ourselves,” says Van Cleef. For now, banks are the ones that lose out when things head south. When you call your credit card issuer and tell them about fraudulent activity on your card, they are the ones to make you whole. The rules vary if you’re using a debit card, but if you report the fraud right away, you should be covered. “Issuers are losing billions of dollars,” says Williams. “It’s an epidemic.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Diehard Pokémon and Mario fans may disagree, but for me the most interesting of the three was without a doubt the tiny replica NES. Not only did it generate tons of buzz during the holidays due to how difficult it was to find in stores (not necessarily a good thing), but it sets the stage for what will hopefully be a series of nostalgia-inducing follow-ups modeled after Nintendo’s other popular consoles. But before getting to the pint-sized SNES, let's consider what Nintendo did and didn’t do well with its current retro offering. The NES Classic Edition: This generation’s ‘Tickle Me Elmo’ The NES Classic Edition was announced on mid-July to what seemed like a warm enough reception. By the time the system launched roughly four months later, demand had clearly exceeded expectations leading to inventory shortages across the country (in a few other markets we checked, like the UK, the situation was all but the same). Amazon’s supply was spoken for immediately. Similarly, brick and mortar stores including Best Buy, Target and Walmart went through their initial inventory at a breakneck pace. Nintendo promised a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday season and into the New Year. The company technically kept its word by seeding additional units to retailers – my family scored three systems from Walmart during the holiday season to be used as presents by using an inventory tracking website – but overall, Nintendo came nowhere close to meeting demand. Did Nintendo artificially limit stock? Some are steadfast in their belief that Nintendo intentionally withheld stock in order to drive up the perception of demand. While the tactic is certainly plausible, and we've seen it happen before with hot products like the Nintendo Wii, I don’t believe it to be true. Nintendo could make an educated guess that hardcore gamers would be interested in the system. What I suspect they underestimated, however, is the degree to which the NES Classic would resonate with those outside of the target demographic – for example, adults with fond memories of the NES from their childhood who no longer identify as gamers. Manufacturing millions of units without knowing that it’d be a hit would have been incredibly risky. I believe Nintendo was just as surprised by the popularity of the system as the rest of us. Had Nintendo artificially limited inventory, why would it still be doing so weeks after the holidays? With some prospective buyers no doubt giving up out of sheer frustration, I fail to see how the strategy makes any sense. Plus, Nintendo is not making any additional money beyond the wholesale price it charges retailers. Scalpers, on the other hand, have been making a killing by reselling systems on eBay. Leading up to Christmas Day, units were regularly commanding upwards of $240 – a 4x premium over Nintendo’s $59.99 MSRP. Genuine NES Classic controllers which carry a MSRP of $9.99 each were going for around $60 or so. For those still in the market for a NES Classic, you’ll either have to play the waiting game, get lucky, or shell out some big bucks on eBay or Craigslist. NES Classic Edition: Hits and Misses Nintendo got a lot of things right with the NES Classic. Aesthetically speaking, it nailed the physical design which is a near-perfect mini replica of the original NES save for the controller connectors and the rear I/O ports. Sadly, the cartridge lid isn’t functional, but I digress. Power delivery is handled via USB, while HDMI is used to connect to a display. Included with the system are an AC adapter and USB cable, HDMI cable, and a replica NES controller which brings us to the first major flaw. The controller looks and feels just like the original save for the ridiculously short 30.5-inch cable. Nintendo clearly cut corners here as the controller is borderline unusable if you’re playing on a large television, but there are a couple of workarounds. The first solution is to pick up an extension cable. There’s no shortage of options from third parties at various price points. What some people don’t realize is that you can also use a Wii Classic controller with the tiny console as it shares the same physical connector as the bundled controller. In the event you can’t find a genuine Nintendo controller, there are multiple third-party controllers readily available with lengthier cables. Optionally, you can ditch the cord entirely and go with a wireless solution. It seems to be hit or miss here, so do your research before splurging (I tried the Nyko MiniBoss wireless controller but found that it disconnected every few minutes). Nintendo wisely baked Suspend Points into the system, granting four slots per game to save your progress. While an excellent idea, you’ll quickly realize that there’s no way to exit a game, create a save point, or switch to another game from the included controller. Instead, you have to press the reset button on the console itself to return to the main menu. For most, this will involve getting up off the couch to do so. Depending on how often you play, this could become very annoying. Nintendo did a stellar job with the console’s UI, employing a carousel-style menu with original box art for game selection. In the display menu, you’ll find the option for standard 4:3 display, a “Pixel Perfect” mode that cleans up the visuals a bit and a “CRT filter” that emulates what games looked like on older CRT televisions. The best thing about Nintendo’s offering? The games (as it should be). Nintendo hand-picked 30 all-time top NES games including favorites like Super Mario Bros. 1-3, Excitebike, Dr. Mario, Double Dragon II: The Revenge and The Legend of Zelda, just to name a few which look amazing coming across the HDMI connection. I haven’t had time to play every game on offer yet, but the ones I have tried are spot-on recreations of the originals.. Ironically enough, the NES Classic's greatest strength is also its biggest weakness. Limiting the console to 30 games guarantees Nintendo will never make more than $60 per buyer (plus an additional controller). Even if I wanted to splurge on classic NES games to build my library with games I may never play -- Steam style -- I can't. That's a mistake. A “Super” Successor Even though it was outsold by 13 million units over its lifetime compared to the original, the Super Nintendo somehow felt like a bigger deal when it arrived in North America in 1991. Its 16-bit graphics were unprecedented with launch titles like F-Zero and Super Mario World becoming instant ambassadors and eventual classics. The next logical step for Nintendo at this point is to create a Classic Edition based on the Super Nintendo. A recent trademark filing suggests the Japanese gaming company is indeed hard at work on a follow-up. It’s not a matter of “if” we’ll see a SNES Classic Edition but rather, “when.” The SNES Classic Edition should be a miniature version of the iconic Super Nintendo just as the current entry mirrored the original – right down to functional power and reset sliders. Of course it won’t have a functional cartridge slot on top, but it should otherwise look just like the original. As for the controller, this, too should look and feel just like the original, right down to the functional bumpers. If Nintendo only implements one hardware change, it should be this: wire the controller with a lengthy cable. It would be awesome if the system used the same exact controllers (and thus, the same connector) as the original SNES but that’s not likely to happen. One small but important additional change I’d like to see is a power / home button on the controller, or at least some workaround, like holding down "Select" for 5+ seconds which could bring you back to Home. Surely any half-baked solution will beat getting up and down all the damn time. Expandability: An Online Marketplace Nintendo should have no problem selling a micro SNES replica with a fixed number of top-tier games, but why stop there? By limiting the NES version to 30 games, Nintendo is missing out on a huge opportunity to generate residual income. As a byproduct, many are either hacking the Classic or reconsidering the emulator path, though we understand that the average consumer would prefer not to bother with either. Granted, these mini systems aren’t actual game consoles, but stripping them of the ability to add new games feels like a mistake for both gamers and Nintendo. The obvious answer would be to integrate a wireless chip into the mini SNES that allows to connect to a digital marketplace. Nintendo already offers classic games via the Virtual Console for the Wii U. A quick check of the Nintendo Game Store reveals a whopping 450 SNES games that can be downloaded and played right now on the Wii U and other systems. For this model to work with a standalone device like the SNES Classic, Nintendo would need to drastically reduce its pricing structure however. Asking the casual, nostalgia-seeking gamer to cough up $9.99 per game (the average cost of a downloadable SNES title in Nintendo’s digital marketplace) isn’t going to fly. Image credit: Ryokai on Deviantart Would you pay, say, $0.99 per game or maybe even $5 for a curated bundle of three games, in order to play those rare or obscure titles that you absolutely loved but wouldn’t ever make the top 30 cut? I know I sure would. What I wouldn’t do, however, is pay any more than maybe $2.99 per game and even that price would force me to really think hard before pulling the trigger. Nintendo should know that hardcore gamers aren’t the primary demographic with these mini consoles; don’t price your games in a manner that’ll turn casual players away. In no particular order, games I'd love to see on the SNES Classic: Super Mario World, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, Secret of Mana, Super Mario Kart, Street Fighter II, Earthbound, Stunt Race FX, Star Fox, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Mortal Kombat II, F-Zero, Super Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Super Punch-Out!! Another possibility would be for Nintendo to include an SD or even a proprietary card slot on the console and sell physical “cartridges” made to look like SNES carts complete with original box art. It’d sure be neat but I doubt Nintendo will take this route as digital is much easier and can’t be resold. In the unlikely chance that Nintendo does offer the ability to add additional games via an online marketplace, the door would potentially be open to enable online multiplayer. This would be quite unlikely and frankly, a mistake. Part of what made console gaming in the ‘90s so great was local multiplayer. Inviting your friends over or challenging family members to an intense game of Street Fighter II or Super Mario Kart was genuinely fun. For some, multiplayer was as much about socializing as it was playing games. With online play, much of that interaction is lost. Don’t believe it can be done today? Rock Band says otherwise. A Golden Opportunity Nintendo hit a home run in its first at-bat despite some evident shortcomings. More importantly, the company now has the blueprint for success and put itself in a position to deliver a grand slam with its sophomore effort. At $60 with 30 games, the NES Classic Edition works out to two bucks per title. Is every game Nintendo selected appealing to me? No, but for the bundle and the system, it’s a fair price and would be a fair price for an SNES version. Nintendo was wise to announce its first mini system over the summer and launch it at the dawn of the holiday buying season. With the Nintendo Switch just around the corner, there’s no need to rush a SNES Classic to market even if the selfish me wants it ASAP. Stick with the same time frame… except this time, have enough stock to go around. Recycling existing IP is almost never a winning strategy, but Nintendo finds itself in the rare position of being the exception. Take the time to do it right and release follow-ups in chronological order. Save the N64 for the third act come 2018. I’ll gladly wait. 17 comments 83 interactions Share this article: User Comments: 17 Got something to say?

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE Job postings are shown outside a new Walmart Super Center as the company opens its first store in Compton, California, on January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake | Caption Patrick Reilly Staff January 11, 2017 —Even the world’s largest retailer can’t avoid the challenges facing brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart will soon cut hundreds of jobs from its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and its regional offices, as The Wall Street Journal first reported this week. The announcement comes amid a downturn for some traditional retail stores. Macy’s and Sears are cutting back, as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week, as more consumers shop online or at discount-rack stores, although some segments, like fast fashion, have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart, which predicts flat earnings growth for its next fiscal year, is also feeling the pinch. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” spokesman Greg Hitt told Fortune, although he did not confirm job cuts. But unlike other troubled chains, which have closed stores and laid off retail staff, Wal-Mart is cutting costs at the corporate level. Meanwhile, it’s continuing an expensive – and controversial – effort to improve its stores by paying workers more. For years, labor groups criticized Wal-Mart for its treatment of retail staff, including its wages and a lack of unions. A 2011 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that its employees earned an estimated 12.4 percent less than retail workers as a whole, and 14.5 percent less than workers in large retail in general. Last year, the chain announced a "two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers," in which all employees hired before January 1st, 2016 would receive at least $10 per hour; new hires' wages would start at $9 per hour, but increase to $10 after they complete a training program. Ten companies with great starting wages Amid rising concerns about inequality and low minimum wages, this pay hike at the world’s largest retailer sparked debate. Some saw the wage hikes as a smart business decision that better motivated workers and reversed years of customer complaints about poor service. But others saw the wage increase as trouble for Wal-Mart’s bottom line, and dismissed some arguments in favor of it – such as the idea that better-paid employees would spend more in-store, helping to offset the losses of paying higher wages.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Other critics argued the wage hike didn't go far enough, as the Monitor reported in 2015: But advocates for low-wage workers, while supporting the wage boost, say the pay increases will have minimal effect on workers' lives without a full workweek. Companies like Wal-Mart have turned the scheduling of part-time workers into a science, says Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. Computer programs used by Wal-Mart and other large retail outlets piece together employee schedules and are frequently programmed to keep employees' hours below the threshold where benefits kick in, she says. “These are super-sophisticated programs that work in real time calculating to the minute based on customer traffic, calling people in to work and sending them home accordingly,” she says. “Working there makes it nearly impossible to plan a stable budget, have another job, or go to schools.” This week's job-cutting news comes as the latest of several Wal-Mart cost-cutting measures which have left white-collar employees in Bentonville uneasy. In September, the company announced it would cut 7,000 back-office positions; last October, it eliminated 450 positions at headquarters, a move it said would make Wal-Mart more "nimble." But unlike their counterparts at Sears or Macy’s, the sales associates at your local Wal-Mart are probably breathing a sigh of relief.

(AP) — The Latest on the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer (all times local): 3:30 p.m. Authorities have arrested the niece of a fugitive wanted in two killings, including the shooting of an Orlando police officer. Candles and TV lights illuminate the crowd during a vigil at Wal-Mart store where an Orlando police sergeant was killed Monday and for an Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy killed during a manhunt of the suspect, in Orlando, Fla., Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) Online court records show that 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on a charge of accessory Wednesday, a day after the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant was arrested on a similar charge. Smith-Loyd's uncle, 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, is the focus of an intense manhunt that began Monday, when he allegedly shot Master Sgt. Debra Clayton as she approached him outside a Wal-Mart. Loyd had been wanted previously for the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in mid-December. An arrest affidavit for Loyd's supervisor, Zarghee Mayan, says that Smith-Loyd collected money from Mayan on behalf of her uncle just days after the slaying of the ex-girlfriend. ___ 12:15 p.m. Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies have arrested a man they say helped a fugitive now sought in two murders, including the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer. Zarghee Mayan faces a charge of accessory after the fact for allegedly helping 41-year-old Markeith Lloyd, his former co-worker at a fried chicken restaurant, by driving him around, giving him food and offering him money. The affidavit prepared for Tuesday night's arrest says Mayan met with Loyd at least two times after the slaying of Loyd's pregnant girlfriend in mid-December. Loyd remains the focus of an intense manhunt that began Monday, when he allegedly shot Master Sgt. Debra Clayton in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Deputies say Mayan has told conflicting stories, but at one point said that he met with Loyd two days before Clayton exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The affidavit says Mayan said he hugged Loyd on Saturday and could tell he was armed and wearing a bulletproof vest. ___ 11:25 a.m. Hundreds of deputies and officers in Florida are searching for a suspect wanted in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer, but authorities say a jumping off point for his capture may come from a call center staffed by five workers. Authorities in Orlando are hoping tips from the public into a Crimeline call center can help lead to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, the focus of a manhunt that entered its third day on Wednesday. Barb Bergin, Crimeline's executive director, says the $100,000 being offered as a reward for a tip that leads to Loyd's arrest is unprecedented for the local Crimeline. Authorities believe tips may be especially important in locating Loyd since they believe others are helping him hide. Bergin says all tips are being followed up. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store. Police Chief John Mina says federal, state and local authorities are taking part in the manhunt. Mina isn't giving any details about search tactics but he says law enforcement agencies in Florida and around the nation are on alert for Loyd. ___ 3:20 a.m. A suspect who's the focus of a manhunt following the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer has a lengthy criminal record dating back two decades. Authorities on Wednesday were starting a third day of the manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, who had been wanted in the weeks leading up to the sergeant's killing for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that deputies came close to catching Loyd but he had eluded them, and arrest warrants were being prepared for people who likely helped him. Authorities raised the reward for information leading to his arrest from $60,000 to $100,000. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando.

To help customers and members get back on track, Walmart and Sam’s Club have teamed up to offer free health screenings in more than 5,200 locations across the country on Jan. 14, and in 127 locations in Arizona. This joint effort will make it easier than ever for hundreds of thousands of Americans to learn critical information that will help them keep their health-focused intentions on track. “Knowing your numbers is critical to achieving your healthy resolutions and to maintaining a healthy lifestyle,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president, Walmart Health & Wellness. “That’s why Walmart and Sam’s Club have joined together for the very first time to kick off 2017 with the company’s largest free health screening event to-date.” In Arizona, where 30.7 percent of the population suffers from high blood pressure and 28.4 percent have obesity according to Arizona Health Matters, this program offers community members a free, simple way to get this information checked. Sam’s Club locations will provide body fat readings, and for the first time in Walmart stores, customers can test for both body fat and body mass index. Over the course of 2016, Walmart and Sam’s Club collectively provided nearly a half million free health screenings to people across the country. At Walmart alone, nearly 250,000 were conducted in October. Sam’s Club began offering free health screenings in 2010 and has conducted more than one million screenings since the program began. These events have helped countless individuals uncover existing health problems, including high blood pressure, signs of diabetes and other potential illness. Walmart Screening Information Walmart Wellness Day will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time on Saturday, Jan. 14, in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. Free screenings will include blood glucose, blood pressure, vision, and for the first time body fat and body mass index. Product samples and health insurance information will be available. More than 10,000 of Walmart’s licensed pharmacists will offer immunizations in select stores. Walmart continues to break company records at screening events. In October alone, nearly 52,000 immunizations were administered and more than 2 million free samples were distributed in a single event. Sam’s Club Screening Information Free screenings at Sam’s Club locations are open to members and the public and will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time in approximately 618 clubs across the country. Screenings*, which are valued at up to $150, will include free blood glucose, blood pressure, vision / hearing (where applicable), body fat, total cholesterol and HDL (good cholesterol). Sam’s Club licensed pharmacists will be on-hand to offer immunizations as well. “Sam’s Club and Walmart are committed to helping the communities we serve lead healthier lives,” said Jill Turner-Mitchael, senior vice president of Sam’s Club, Consumables and Health and Wellness. “We invite you to our locations this weekend to experience our health screenings to start or restart your healthy choices for the year.” Sam’s Club offers free health screenings the second Saturday of every month from January to October.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Walmart Swings Its Axe Again and Will Now Slash 1,000 Corporate Jobs Walmart is at it again on the cost-cutting front. Lindsay Rittenhouse Jan 11, 2017 2:15 PM EST Walmart (WMT) , the country's largest private employer, plans to eliminate roughly 1,000 corporate jobs as it looks to boost its e-commerce business and trim costs. The jobs, mainly in the human resources department, will be cut before Jan. 31, as a result of increased e-commerce spending and rising employee wages, an anonymous executive told the Wall Street Journal. When contacted by TheStreet, Walmart declined in an email to comment on the job cuts but said the company has "not made any announcements" on its current corporate structure, adding "... we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively."  The move comes after the Bentonville, Ark.-based company, which employs about 2.3 million worldwide, eliminated 7,000 positions in September. Walmart's job cuts also come during an increasingly difficult period for retailers. Last Wednesday, Macy's (M)  announced its plans to eliminate about 10,100 total positions as it moves to shutter 68 stores and restructure its operations, citing heightened e-commerce competition. Macy's, Kohl's (KSS) and Sears Holdings (SHLD) are among several pressured retailers that experienced a decline in same-store sales this holiday season. Macy's and Kohl's comparable store sales each fell 2.1% year-over-year in November and December, while Sears' same-store sales dipped about 12%. In a research note published Wednesday, Zacks' analysts reiterated the firm's "sell" rating on Walmart. "Increased competition from traditional and online players and slowdown in international operations along with a strong dollar are hindering sales," the analysts said in their note.

Update: Switch has been officially dated and priced at $299. The retail price of the Nintendo Switch is still a mystery. It’s a mystery that pundits and inside sources have more less pinned down, but nothing is ever confirmed until it’s official. A picture of a pre-order sticker for the Switch at US retailer Walmart made its way to Reddit earlier. It shows the price being $399, which is way higher than any of the previous estimates. The Reddit user who posted it said he works at the retailer, and although the sticker has yesterday’s date, the image is of a very low quality and could be a fake. Most recently, Japanese financial paper Nikkei said the console will sell for around $250. The magazine revealed accurate information about the Japanese games industry many times before, and the price is more in line with previous leaks. What’s likely to happen is that Nintendo will release different SKUs at different price points, depending on how many games are included or if other accessories will be part of the package. That said, $400 is too high a price for what the Switch is supposedly capable of, at least when it comes to raw power. There’s a near slim chance Nintendo will sell the console for more than what you can currently pay for PS4 and Xbox One, even if it comes with a couple of games.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 11, 2017 at 8:04AM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has no obligation to contribute to charitable causes or to give a single dime, any in-kind donations, or a even a minute of employee time to those in need. However, the world's biggest retailer does do those things. In 2016, it contributed more than $1.4 billion in cash and in-kind gifts (donations of goods and services) to various causes, according to the company's 2016 Giving Report (link open PDF). In addition, Wal-Mart employees ("associates," in company lingo) "contributed more than 1.25 million hours of their time outside of work to volunteer causes." Less than a third of the company's total giving actually comes in the form of cash (over $300 million), but Wal-Mart, which does not have the same reputation for being charitable as Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) or Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), perhaps deserves to be viewed differently. Of course, Wal-Mart does top the Global Fortune 500, which measures total revenue, with $482 billion in 2015. Wal-Mart donated over $300 million to charities in 2016. Image source: Wal-Mart. How does Wal-Mart stack up? In 2015, Wal-Mart placed second on Fortune's 20 Most Generous Companies on the Fortune 500 list (the 2016 list has not been released yet). In 2015, Wal-Mart gave just over $300 million in cash contributions to a variety of causes. That's more than Alphabet ($167.8 milion) and Starbucks put together since the coffee company did not make the top 20, which required beating out $62.5 million in cash donations. For perspective, Wal-Mart rival Target (NYSE: TGT) gave away $111.5 million in cash in 2015. That's a little less than a third of what its competitor handed out, but a higher percentage of the chain's nearly $75 billion in revenue. In-kind donations do take the Wal-Mart number much higher, but that's not a number every (or even many) companies report. Is Wal-Mart generous? While on a percentage-of-revenue basis Wal-Mart does not hand out as much as many rivals, its overall generosity depends upon how you view in-kind donations. On one hand, this type of charity, of which Wal-Mart takes credit for about $1.1 billion in 2016, could simply be the company donating items it has little use for. Some of that $1.1 billion likely comes from Wal-Mart moving dead inventory or donating food nearing its expiration date to local food banks. A cynic might consider that not actual charity, but in reality, it takes significant effort and cost to implement the programs that transfer items or food to charities once they are no longer saleable. It's also very likely that some, maybe a lot, of the company's in-kind donations are to meet needs with little or no concern to moving dead product off of shelves. Wal-Mart had $4.6 billion in profit in Q4 of fiscal 2016, and it made $9.88 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. That means that roughly, on a four-quarter basis, the company would have made about $14.5 billion. If you consider $1.1 billion an accurate value for its in-kind charitable contributions, that's about 7.5% of profits being donated. If you use the cash number, it's 2% of that profit number. Wal-Mart deserves recognition While it's easy to fault Wal-Mart for its wages or employment practices (though it has made some strides in those areas), it's not fair to not celebrate the company when it does something positive. The chain may have its problems, and it has not always make the choice that results in the greater good, but that's not its primary responsibility to shareholders. You can quibble about the accounting or argue what actually counts as charity, but if the company was not sincere, it's hard to see why it would go through these efforts. Kathleen McLaughlin, Wal-Mart's chief sustainability officer, wrote a letter to begin the report, and she clearly believes in what she's doing: Philanthropy enables Wal-Mart to go even further in addressing some of the world's toughest social and environmental challenges. Likewise, being able to draw on Walmart business strengths -- not just funding, but Walmart's reach, relationships, associates, logistics, technology, products and stores, to name a few -- enables our philanthropy to deliver greater societal impact. We believe this ability to bring private-sector capabilities to bear on social problems makes corporate philanthropists important collaborators in social change. Wal-Mart, on a cash basis, regularly gives more money than almost every other company on the planet. That may not be as much cash on a percentage of revenue or profit basis as some of its rivals, but it's still a lot of money, and the company should be saluted for what it does, even if you hope it will do more in the future.

Store positions, it seems, will be largely untouched. “As we’ve previously shared, we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,” Wal-Mart Stores spokesman Greg Hitt told Fortune in an email statement that stopped short of confirming the job cuts.“While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.” The cuts are comparably small, given that Walmart has 18,000 workers in its HQ alone and 1.4 million nationwide, making it the largest private U.S. employer. The move comes as Walmart is finding its profit margins increasingly under pressure — store workers have seen their wages increase $2.7 billion per year on average over the last two years, and Walmart has invested big and hard into bridging the gap into e-commerce. And this latest round of cuts is not a total outlier — 7,000 accounting and invoicing positions were cut within U.S. stores in September of last year so that workers were freed up for in-store customer service. In 2015, the company cut 450 jobs at its headquarters to become nimbler. Walmart is also not alone at the layoff party in progress — Macy’s is cutting 10,000 jobs and closing 68 stores this year, while The Limited this weekend laid off 4,000 workers as it closed all its stores but kept its web site active.

The cuts will come before Jan. 31, the end of the retailer's current fiscal year, the Wall Street Journal first reported. As many as 500 employees - some as high as vice president-level - could lose their jobs with other reductions planned for the human resources department. Walmart has not confirmed the cuts but told Fortune the retailer is "continually (looking) at our corporate structure." "We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively," Walmart Stores spokesman Greg Hitt said. In September, Walmart cut about 7,000 back-office jobs, mostly accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. locations. The cutbacks come as the retailer deals with higher employee costs and increased competition from online businesses such as Amazon. Walmart employs 1.4 million workers nationwide, about 18,000 at its Arkansas headquarters. It's the country's biggest retailer and the largest private U.S. employer.

The nearly 160,000-square-foot project is targeted for land off Route 145 and Birch Road, just south of Walnutport and several miles north of the bustling MacArthur Road commercial corridor in Whitehall Township. In April 2013, Wal-Mart first confirmed its intentions to build on the site. Plans were submitted to the township last August, but have yet to be approved by the township's board of supervisors, a move that would clear the way for construction to begin.   They last went before the Lehigh Township Planning Commission on Dec. 12, and planning commission members expressed concerns about the proposed traffic layout, Lehigh Township Manager Alice Rehrig said Tuesday. The plans currently call for a roundabout instead of a traditional traffic signal at the entrance to the supercenter's parking lot off Route 145. Rehrig said some planning commission members were "not happy about" the proposed configuration. The following site plan for a new Wal-Mart Supercenter off Route 145 in Lehigh Township has been submitted to the township. (Image via lehightownship.com)   Last month's meeting was only a discussion, and the planning commission has yet to give a recommendation to the board of supervisors on the project. As of Tuesday, Wal-Mart had not yet submitted revised plans addressing the concerns about the traffic layout. The site plan for the overall project shows a 158,559-square-foot store space that includes an express tire and lube center surrounded by a 661-space parking lot. A detached Wal-Mart convenience store and gas station with five pumps would front the property on Route 145, the site plan shows. Cops: Big-box stores eating manpower Rehrig said it's hard to give a timeline on the supercenter's development, citing there are a number of outside agencies also reviewing the plans. Among them are the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Northampton County Conservation District. She also said there has been some opposition to the project from township residents. The Lehigh Township site is not the only one Wal-Mart is targeting locally for a new supercenter. Plans for a similar-sized one off Route 412 in South Bethlehem went before the Bethlehem Planning Commission for the first time last summer. The commission, citing a number of concerns including the development not fitting the character of the neighborhood, sent developers back to the drawing board. Wal-Mart still remains committed to the project, a city official said Tuesday.   Nick Falsone may be reached at nfalsone@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow him on Twitter @nickfalsone.

On Friday, Hostess Brands released its new Deep Fried Twinkies – pre-fried, frozen snacks that can be made at home. The new Twinkies come coated in funnel cake batter and oil and are immediately frozen and packaged. The new Twinkies can be purchased in the frozen foods section at Wal-Mart exclusively, reported the Associated Press. After three months, the fried Twinkies will become available at other store locations. Vice president of marketing at Hostess Brands Ellen Copaken also revealed that the treats could even be marketed abroad eventually. A box of seven Twinkies will cost $4.76. Customers just have to bake the treats at 350 degrees for six to eight minutes, although they can also be prepared in a toaster oven. Related Stories Hostess Brands Goes Public In New Sale Walmart To Sell Twinkies Three Days Prior To National Release Date Twinkies were discontinued back in 2012 after Hostess filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The pastry cakes were brought back in 2013 after private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulous & Co. laid out a $410 million deal with the company. Since Twinkies’ comeback, Hostess has collaborated with major brands like Wal-Mart to create limited-edition Twinkies snacks. Previous limited-edition recipes for Wal-Mart included a mint chocolate-flavored cake, which debuted in December 2015, and a “Key Lime Slime” Twinkie for the new “Ghostbusters,” film which hit theaters last month. In honor of the Hostess Brand’s new deep-fried treat, we rounded up five of the most insane fried Twinkie recipes from the internet. From the Bourbon-infused to the bacon-wrapped, here are five recipes you can try ASAP (or attempt to try, as some of the listed are proprietary recipes). Bacon-wrapped Deep Fried Twinkies: A fail-safe party favorite, the bacon-wrapped Twinkie is for the bacon lovers. Check out The Wall Street Journal's recipe here. Bourbon-infused Deep Fried Twinkies: These Twinkies are drizzled in bourbon before they are deep fried. Thrillist reports the full recipe here.  Deep Fried Twinkie Bacon Burger: This particular delicacy was brought to you by Philadelphia-based restaurant PYT. Their Twinkie burger is comprised of a custom-blend pork belly patty topped with bacon and American cheese, all sandwiched between two deep fried Twinkie "buns."  Deep Fried Corn Flake Beer-battered Twinkies: For a little added crunch and extra flavor, try this beer-battered corn flake recipe from GardenFork.TV.  Twix-stuffed Fried Twinkie (The “Twinx”): The legendary "Twinx" (a deep fried Twinkie stuffed with a Twix bar), made its debut at the Great New York State Fair at food truck, Fried Specialties.  Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Debra Clayton was among the officers who responded to Pulse nightclub as shots rang out during the early morning hours of June 12, 2016. Forty-nine people at the club were killed by gunman Omar Mateen in what is now the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Clayton was killed Monday, and a manhunt continues as law enforcement officials search for the suspect. (AP Photo/John Raoux)  (The Associated Press) Previous Next ORLANDO, Fla. –  A suspect who is the focus of a manhunt following the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer has a lengthy criminal record dating back two decades, and authorities had been searching for him in the weeks leading up to the sergeant's killing for questioning in the slaying of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Deputies had come close to catching 41-year-old Markeith Loyd but he had eluded them, and arrest warrants were being prepared for people who likely helped him, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. "There have been times when we just missed him. He has been able to avoid capture," Demings said. As the third day of the manhunt for Loyd started Wednesday, authorities had raised the reward for information leading to his arrest from $60,000 to $100,000. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. More than 300 tips from the public have been made, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward and warns in notices that Loyd is "armed and extremely dangerous." "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. Court documents show Loyd's criminal record goes back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison. Federal records show he was released in July 2014. More recently, his wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies in metro Orlando had been looking for Loyd since his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, was killed last December. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. A vigil was held for Clayton on Tuesday night, and in the Wal-Mart parking lot, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

They don’t have to be, not according to Walmart. Not if you have its futuristic Scan & Go app. Sadly, while that app has actually been in existence since 2013, it only existed for iPhone users. That changes today with Walmart finally rolling it out to Android users to enjoy skipping lines. That is, if you live near the one and only Walmart branch it’s currently working in. The idea behind Scan & Go is genius in its simplicity and, at the same time, sounds too good to be true. You simple scan the UPC code of item you want to add to your (physical) shopping cart using your smartphone. Then when you’re all set, simply pay through the app as well. Before leaving the store, you show the receipt to the guard or authorized personnel and then you can wave those at the line goodbye, with a smug smile on your face. Thank you, technology! Ideal as that scenario may sound, it also sounds like it leaves a lot of room for errors, potential theft, and people gaming the system. So far, there doesn’t seem to be any massive outcry against Scan & Go, despite being on the iPhone for more than 3 years now. Either that speaks highly of the system or no one’s really using it that much. Either way, Android users can finally try it out themselves, whether it’s really a big deal or just a bigger hassle than a traditional checkout. The one huge caveat to Walmart’s Android release is that Scan & Go only works at Walmart #5260 in Rogers, Arkansas.

(AP) — Police leading a massive manhunt for the suspected killer of an Orlando officer on Wednesday collected hundreds of tips and announced the arrests of two people who allegedly aided the fugitive, promising to reward anyone who turns him in, and punish anyone who helps him hide. Court records show that Markeith Loyd's niece, 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested on an accessory charge Wednesday, a day after the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, Zarghee Mayan, was arrested on the same charge. Mayan's arrest affidavit said Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle in the days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in mid-December. Candles and TV lights illuminate the crowd during a vigil at Wal-Mart store where an Orlando police sergeant was killed Monday and for an Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy killed during a manhunt of the suspect, in Orlando, Fla., Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) Smith-Loyd's affidavit says she contacted deputies after the ex-girlfriend's murder and promised to help them find her uncle if they first told her whether a firearm had been recovered from the murder scene. Then she stopped cooperating even as she contacted others on her uncle's behalf, the affidavit said. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing he was wanted in the slaying his pregnant ex-girlfriend, the affidavit said. "Mayan did so with the intent that Markeith Demangzlo Loyd avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial or punishment," the arrest affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. During another encounter, right after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed at Mayan and said, "'Drive me or I will kill you, I just did something real bad,'" the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd's estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. The 41-year-old ex-convict has been the focus of a massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers and deputies since Monday's shooting. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, since others may be helping him hide. "If you know where he is at and you call us 3 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we will have people prepared to dispatch and go capture him," said Barb Bergin, executive director of the local Crimeline. Orlando Police Chief John Mina, meanwhile has warned that anyone helping Loyd "will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well." Mayan, 33, was arrested Tuesday by Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies on a charge of accessory after the fact. Jail records show no bond had been set, and court records showed no name of a defense attorney listed for him. Mina said federal, state and local authorities were taking part in the manhunt. Mina wouldn't give details about search tactics but he said law enforcement agencies in Florida and around the nation are on alert. "There are many things going on behind the scenes that our community is not aware of and that we are not at liberty to discuss," Mina said. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. FILE - This undated photo provided by the Orlando Police Department shows Markeith Loyd.

Woodburn city spokesman Jason Horton said police responded to Wal-Mart shortly after 10 p.m. Monday. They had been alerted a man was shattering glass cabinets and stealing ammunition. Witnesses told police that Alan Lee Brock ran through the store with the machete, swinging it at the Wal-Mart greeter as he was leaving and verbally threatening to kill him. “It came pretty close to him,” Horton said. Officers found the 29-year-old Brock parked outside the store in a car that had been reported stolen in Springfield, 80 miles south. Found on stairwell The suspect drove slowly before speeding up and getting away. Horton said he aimed the vehicle toward officers before quickly turning and driving over an embankment. Police were soon called to a nearby apartment complex, where they say Brock tried to rob a woman for her purse and car keys before breaking down an apartment door and slashing three men. He slashed one across the throat, one on the head and one on the arm. Horton said the three were taken to a hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening. Officers found Brock on a stairwell and he surrendered without further commotion, Horton said. Brock was jailed on three counts of attempted murder. Court records do not list an attorney to speak on his behalf. Brock’s arrest record stretches back to his teenage years, with charges including robbery, burglary, theft and felon in possession of a firearm. His most recent conviction was in October for heroin possession. He was sentenced to 10 days in the Lane County Jail along with probation and a suspension of his driving license.

The suspect is the son of Manchester Mayor Lonnie Norman. Police say they don’t plan to prosecute. The theft happened at Walmart in Manchester on Dec. 27. A woman’s wallet with credit cards and $300 inside were stolen from her shopping cart. Police arrived on the scene, took a report and looked at the surveillance video. The suspect was identified as Lonnie Norman Jr., a Walmart employee. Lonnie Norman Jr. was fired from Walmart. The police report says the surveillance video shows him “put the wallet in his vehicle” and return to work. Lonnie Norman Jr. was later called to the police station, where he returned the wallet “except the money.” The mayor’s son was never arrested, and police say he won’t be. Chief Investigator Jackie Matheny told Channel 4 he has seen the Walmart surveillance tape and it shows the mayor’s son taking the wallet. He said the victim doesn’t want to press charges. Matheny denies that the mayor’s involvement in the case influenced his decision in any way. Matheny said the mayor met with police the day after the incident. Matheny wasn’t sure whether the mayor also went to the police station the night it happened. No one from the police department would speak to Channel 4 on camera. No one answered the door at the address listed for Lonnie Norman Jr. Mayor Lonnie Norman did not return calls from Channel 4 regarding the incident at Walmart. Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcutt told Channel 4 it’s not unusual for police to make the decision not to pursue a case. He added the victim was sympathetic to the Walmart worker, who had worked at the store for more than a decade without incident. Copyright 2017 WSMV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

(AP) — Orlando’s law enforcement community is mourning the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police Department sergeant who was killed as she approached a fugitive outside a Wal-Mart store and an Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy who died in a traffic accident more than two hours later while responding to a manhunt for the suspect in the officer’s slaying. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was killed outside a Wal-Mart store in northwest Orlando early Monday, and Orange County Sheriff’s Office Deputy First Class Norman Lewis was killed in a crash while responding to a manhunt for 41-year-old Markeith Loyd.   Another Orlando police officer was involved in a crash while responding to the shooting but had only minor injuries. Authorities said Loyd previously was a suspect in the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. A massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers was conducted all day Monday as they searched for Loyd in dozens of homes, displacing some residents of a northwest Orlando apartment complex and tying up traffic. “He should be considered armed and dangerous,” Police Chief John Mina said. Later in the day, the chief said, “It doesn’t matter where he is. We will track him down to the ends of the Earth.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said deputies had been searching unsuccessfully for Loyd for several weeks since the fatal shooting of his ex-girlfriend and believe he was receiving help from someone. Mina lauded Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the force as a committed officer and a hero who gave her life to the community she loves. The Orlando Police Department said in a tweet that Clayton always had a smile and a high five for every child she came across. Clayton had grown up in the Orlando area and was active in programs that mentored young people. “She was always the first to step up and help kids,” Mina said. Clayton was a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighborhood where she was shot, and she previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer, Deputy Chief Orlando Rolon said. “She made a point, even outside her working hours, to do things for youth and do things for the community,” Rolon said. She was married and had a college-aged son. Police released a video of Clayton’s body being taken out of the hospital to a waiting van in a flag-covered stretcher. A line of officers saluted as the stretcher was wheeled out. The apartment complex that was the focus of the manhunt and shooting in northwest Orlando was nowhere near Orlando’s tourism corridor in the southern part of the metro area. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a day of mourning in the city. While at the Wal-Mart on Monday morning, Clayton was tipped off by someone that Loyd was in the area. When she approached him, he fired multiple shots at Clayton, who was wearing body armor, Mina said. Clayton returned fire but didn’t hit him, he said. Sheriff’s officials said a deputy spotted Loyd fleeing in a vehicle. The suspect pulled into a nearby apartment complex and then fired at a deputy, striking the deputy’s SUV twice. The deputy wasn’t harmed, the sheriff’s office said. Loyd then carjacked another vehicle, drove away and then abandoned the vehicle not far away, according to the sheriff’s office. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputy was killed more than two hours after the shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Lewis as “a gentle giant,” and the sheriff’s office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. https://www.mail.com/news/politics/4886432-orlando-mourns-deaths-2-law-enforcement-officers.html#.7518-stage-hero1-1 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

(Bloomberg/File) Topics Alibaba Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. pioneered shopping on the internet in China. Now it thinks it can teach old-school retailers a thing or two about real-world commerce. The online juggernaut that vanquished EBay and Amazon in China has set its sights on transforming the byzantine world of brick-and-mortar retail. In its biggest old-economy deal so far, Alibaba is leading a bid to buy out department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. for as much as $2.6 billion. That’s a premium for the privilege of owning a company with shrinking revenues and a minuscule footprint beyond its eastern home region. But by teaming up with retailers, billionaire founder Jack Ma hopes to develop a new model of online and offline retail. The idea is that Alibaba’s superior computing power, a decade of experience moving billions of dollars of goods and strong ties with government and big brands will help it succeed where others like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and even Amazon.com Inc. have failed. If it works, the tie-up may open the door to still more, helping Alibaba both extend its logistics network and gain invaluable consumer data. “No one has any solution or concrete answer, although everyone knows that this is the next page of the industry. Alibaba wants to be the one to develop the solution,” said Anson Chan, a Hong-Kong based Daiwa Capital Markets analyst. History has shown that online and offline businesses don’t play well together. Wal-Mart spent billions of dollars on growing its e-commerce operation at the expense of profits, yet Amazon still holds sway in the U.S. Amazon itself is now venturing into brick-and-mortar stores though that effort is still nascent. Alibaba however is dealing with a very different market, and is driven by a need to secure new sources of growth as e-commerce plateaus. Ma himself has confessed he sees “tremendous challenges” for one-dimensional e-commerce operators as the country’s economy slows. His goal is to try and up-end a splintered and bloated $4.5 trillion Chinese retail landscape, stripping out middlemen to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Apart from Intime, Alibaba has also bought into electronics players Suning Commerce Group Co. and Haier Electronics Group. Alibaba shares rose 2.1 percent in U.S. trading after the deal was announced, while Intime’s stock surged 36 percent in Hong Kong. Alibaba goes shopping (Bloomberg/Data) (Read also: Alibaba’s Ma meets with Trump to talk about creating jobs) Chinese retailers could use some help. They’ve struggled in past years to retain consumers frustrated with lackluster, poorly managed malls. Unlike in the U.S., which is controlled by a clutch of mega-chains, the Chinese retail experience is far more fragmented and inconsistent. Intime, one of the better-known players, operated and managed just 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls across the country as of end-June last year, mainly in eastern Zhejiang province. That’s a far cry from the U.S., where nationwide chains such as Wal-Mart and Macy’s Inc. dominate specific strata. More important than geographical reach however is simple store management. While Wal-Mart and Amazon’s logistical machines inspire college case studies, most Chinese retailers still operate in separate, walled-off regions. Management lacks incentive to innovate. Alibaba sees an opportunity in helping such retailers use technology to transform inventory management, while securing a physical network through which it can get goods to its own customers more efficiently, for instance by letting customers pick up orders from stores. “Physical retail in China is backwards compared to elsewhere,” said Catherine Lim, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in Singapore. “It’s going to be a root-and-branch effort to get the offline side up to standard, and that’s probably why Alibaba felt the need to take it over totally.” Lim cites a familiar example: You have to wait days to find out if there’s a size 10 dress in another branch of the same store. “The players have started to modernize, but it’s been very slow. The truth is that the technology and software is there, it’s whether the people were willing to adapt to it.” The logic of the Intime deal isn’t apparent to all. Alibaba may be counting on success in reviving the mall operator to encourage other retailers to adopt its online-to-offline or O2O model, Chan said. “What’s possible is that Alibaba wants to develop the O2O model and system through this partnership and, once it’s perfected, open up that system for others to use as a platform, like its cloud business,” Chan said. Also, neither Alibaba nor Intime own a lot of the inventory they sell -- Intime operates much like a bazaar where different brands run concessions. That means brands will need to be won over. “There is still the missing piece of the people who actually sell the items,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a Hong-Kong based senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “Intime is only in Zhejiang, so there won’t be a national reach. Maybe in the grand plan, Alibaba will buy other department stores, since sales of department stores have fallen through the floor.” But Alibaba’s certainly giving it a go. It’s already building a network that will allow physical stores -- and the brands they sell -- to monitor transactions as they happen. Like Amazon, Alibaba also owns a sprawling collection of online assets, from its budding cloud computing business to mobile search and video entertainment, that could conceivably by combined with physical retail. Shoppers might spot a dress they like on Youku Tudou, run a search via Alibaba’s photo-recognition technology and find 10 similar garments online. Its logistics affiliate, Cainiao, can help retailers identify vacant warehouses and available inventory and match goods with the company’s 450 million active buyers more efficiently. “What Alibaba might want to do is to crunch its marketing, logistics, cloud computing and search and entertainment services all into a package for brands to create value, something they won’t be able to do themselves,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian.

Ebenhack) The Orlando Police Department said Tuesday Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was among the officers who responded to Pulse nightclub as shots rang out during the early morning hours of June 12, 2016. Forty-nine people at the club were killed by gunman Omar Mateen in what is now the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Monday, Clayton was gunned down outside a Walmart as she approached a suspect who was wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend last December. Markeith Loyd (Twitter/Orange County Sheriff’s Office) Suspect Markeith Loyd fled the scene, and a $100,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to his arrest. Loyd, 41, has a criminal record that dates back two decades, including a murder charge in 1996 that was later dropped and battery on an officer in 1998. Records show he was released from prison in July 2014. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, leaves behind a husband and a son. A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money to help her family. Orlando police officer shooting View as list View as gallery Open Gallery Orlando Police Master Sgt.

(MEDIA GENERAL/AP) — The Orlando police sergeant who was shot and killed this week was one of the first responders to last summer’s mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city. Police cars surround the Pulse Orlando nightclub, the scene of a fatal shooting, in Orlando, Fla., Sunday, June 12, 2016. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) The Orlando Police Department said Tuesday Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was among the officers who responded to Pulse nightclub as shots rang out during the early morning hours of June 12, 2016. Forty-nine people at the club were killed by gunman Omar Mateen in what is now the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Monday, Clayton was gunned down outside a Walmart as she approached a suspect who was wanted for questioning in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend last December. Markeith Loyd (Twitter/Orange County Sheriff’s Office) Suspect Markeith Loyd fled the scene, and a $100,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to his arrest. Loyd, 41, has a criminal record that dates back two decades, including a murder charge in 1996 that was later dropped and battery on an officer in 1998. Records show he was released from prison in July 2014. Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, leaves behind a husband and a son. A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money to help her family. Orlando police officer shooting View as list View as gallery Open Gallery Orlando Police Master Sgt.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) By MIKE SCHNEIDER The Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. — A fugitive who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot an Orlando police sergeant earlier this week, Orlando's police chief said Thursday. Investigators found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd that suggests Master Sgt. Debra Clayton returned fire after she was shot, but that a bulletproof vest protected the suspect, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Clayton was killed Monday morning after approaching Loyd in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store. He was wanted at the time for the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in mid-December. The fugitive shot Clayton several times, even when she was on the ground, the chief said. Police arrested a former supervisor at the fried-chicken restaurant where Loyd worked, an ex-girlfriend and a niece on Tuesday and Wednesday on charges of helping him in the weeks after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was fatally shot. Mina said they haven't been cooperative in locating him. "If there is anyone who is harboring, aiding, abetting him in any way, they will be arrested as we've seen with the past three arrests," Mina said. Hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 800 tips. The searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's door-to-door search of an Orlando apartment complex, and searchers have cast a broader net in central Florida, Mina said. The crime-tip service Crimeline is offering a $100,000 reward for a tip that leads to Loyd's arrest. "Anybody who makes a phone call is valuable to us at this point," said Barb Bergin, the local Crimeline's executive director. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit. Among them was sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

Menu Home Local News Business Health Community Schools Sports Voices Bill Rauch Lee Scott What 2 Do Calendar Contact Full Issues Go Bringing Our Community Together City to annex golf course, Lady’s Island businesses Published on January 12, 2017 in Voices by The Island News By the Lady’s Island Business and Professional Association Just before Christmas, the city of Beaufort announced that it was annexing Secession Golf Course on Gibbs Island. The annexation consists of a club house, golf course, 15 member-owned cottages and 30 vacant residential lots. Also to be annexed are 10 businesses along Sea Island Parkway. The businesses include two banks (Wells Fargo and CBC National), the Filling Station, Butler Marine, a Shell gas station, the former movie theater adjacent to the high school, Zippy Lube, a dentist office, the Packing Shed (next to the Walmart site), and across the street, the property at the intersection of Lost Island Road and the Sea Island Parkway (the Dive Shop). These annexations will be open to public comment at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 24, in the Beaufort City Council chamber at Beaufort City Hall. Are these annexations good or bad for the Lady’s Island community or do they make any real difference? Before answering the question of how the proposed annexation affects Lady’s Island, a bit of history is in order. The city of Beaufort has been annexing property on Lady’s Island for a good number of years. For example, in 1999 it initiated annexation of Cane Island. It announced the proposed annexation on a Monday and on Tuesday the City Council took the first vote on the matter, causing a great deal of animosity between Beaufort County and the city. The annexation of Cane Island led to annexation of a portion of Distant Island and eventually the present Walmart site. Since the Cane Island annexation, Beaufort has annexed other properties in the Lady’s Island Village Center. In an effort to reduce animosity over annexation between the county and the northern municipalities, the Northern Regional Plan was developed. One of the key things the plan accomplished was the establishment of municipal growth boundaries in which annexation by municipalities was authorized. Lady’s Island is within the city of Beaufort’s growth boundary and thus annexation of property on the island is proper and legal. The present city administration prefers to annex only commercial property, but this could change with another administration. The recently announced annexations will increase the number of Lady’s Island businesses within the city of Beaufort. The relationship between the county, Lady’s Island and the city of Beaufort has significantly improved since 1999. Whether the proposed annexations are good or bad for Lady’s Island depends on the attitude of the city of Beaufort in regard to provision of services. If, in spite of not every business choosing to be in the city, the city takes the high road and cleans the streets and sidewalks, increases the level of police presence, considers traffic impacts of its actions and plans for a general upgrade of the commercial portion of Sea Island Parkway, it will be a very good thing. Beaufort County is not organized to provide municipal services of this type and is not going to provide them. If, on the other hand, Lady’s Island is looked at simply as a source of revenue for the city of Beaufort, there is no benefit to the community in general from the additional annexations. Time will tell. Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

(NYSE:WMT) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a report released on Wednesday morning. According to Zacks, “Though share price of Wal-Mart has been rising since past one year, the company is facing a number of headwinds currently. While Wal-Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter, top-line remains sluggish possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales. We are encouraged that the company is focusing on building its e-commerce capabilities, foraying into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementing innovative ways to drive traffic. The recent acquisition of ShoeBuy is in-line with the company’s efforts to grow its online activities. However, unfavorable currency and higher investments in wages and e-commerce activities are also taking a toll on the profits. Decline in international revenues, stiff competition from both brick & mortar and online retailers also poses concern.” A number of other research analysts have also weighed in on WMT. Robert W. Baird set a $80.00 price objective on Wal-Mart Stores and gave the company a buy rating in a report on Saturday, November 19th. Vetr upgraded Wal-Mart Stores from a hold rating to a buy rating and set a $74.70 price objective on the stock in a report on Monday, December 26th. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) set a $73.00 price objective on Wal-Mart Stores and gave the company a neutral rating in a report on Friday, November 18th. BMO Capital Markets restated a sell rating and issued a $63.00 price objective on shares of Wal-Mart Stores in a report on Friday, November 4th. Finally, Cowen and Company restated an outperform rating on shares of Wal-Mart Stores in a report on Wednesday, December 28th. Four investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eighteen have issued a hold rating and nine have issued a buy rating to the company. Wal-Mart Stores currently has an average rating of Hold and a consensus price target of $75.30.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Approximately half of Americans set goals for themselves at the beginning of each year. Sarah Priestley and Vincent Shen (TMFSarahp) Jan 12, 2017 at 12:20PM It is 2017 Resolutions week on Industry Focus, and in this episode, the consumer and retail team share their own goals for the new year. Hear about budgeting and decluttering from Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley, before they move on to discuss some surprising numbers behind resolutions in this country and the often challenging road to success, A full transcript follows the video. This episode was recorded on Jan. 10, 2017. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen, and it is Tuesday, January 10th. If you've been following along with Industry Focus the past week or so, you probably heard Gaby's wonderful episode yesterday, you'll know that we're in the middle of a theme week. This time, we can kick off 2017 properly. We're talking about our resolutions for the year, the whole cast is. Joining me today in studio is fellow Motley Fool analyst, Sarah Priestley. How are you, Sarah?  Sarah Priestley: I'm good, thank you very much for having me. Shen: Are you ready to riff on resolutions for this year? Disappointments, really? Priestley: Yeah, disappointments, (laughs) mostly disappointments. Shen: A few things -- is this your first podcast experience for the year? Priestley: It is. Yes. Shen: Score one for me. And, before we get into what our new resolutions are for 2017, I think it's only fair if we revisit our goals from 2016, and do a quick audit to see how well we fared, just to clear the air with our listeners. Mine are permanently recorded in the annals of Foolish history with the article we wrote when, I think it was Sean and I, we talked about it last year around this time. You had not joined The Motley Fool yet, so what were your 2016 resolutions and how did you do? Priestley: In 2015, I moved from the U.K. to here and I got married. So, 2015 was a bit of a mess. Shen: Sure, fair enough. Priestley: 2016, I resolved to declutter and organize my life. Our apartment is not huge, and when you bring together two people's amount of things, it creates a lot of stuff. The result of that was that I got a storage unit. The problem is, now, my apartment is really decluttered, but the storage unit, you open the door and you can't get in there. So, that will also be added to one of my resolutions for this year -- declutter the storage unit. Shen: OK. When you came to the U.S. from the U.K., are you the kind of person who, when you pack, you bring the kitchen sink? Or were you more organized and minimalist in your approach? Priestley: No, I did throw away a lot of stuff, because I do have hoarder tendencies. But, I brought everything. I was actually talking to somebody before doing this podcast, I'm a bad packer with everything. We went to a wedding just before Christmas, and I took a carry on case, but it was so heavy that I couldn't pick it up, and my husband had to carry it. So, you can see, I do have multiple issues. Shen: (laughs) OK. So, let's get into our new goals for 2017. What do you have in mind? You mentioned getting the storage unit cleaned up, but what about more finance, investing, or Foolishly related, what do you have envisioned for the year? Priestley: For me, it's definitely budgeting. I think that's an area where, as a household, we can probably be better. We're not bad. We don't spend more than we make, which is the principle of budgeting. We contribute to our 401(k)s, we have a retirement savings plan, all those kinds of things. But I do think -- and I think this is something that a lot of people can learn from -- when you have a degree of disposable income, without too much planning, things slip by the wayside. Shen: Oh, absolutely. Priestley: And it snowballs. I noticed, for ours, eating out and the treats, the occasional coffee, the occasional trip to the mall or the movies, they add up, the accumulate. For me, I really want to get a handle on what I'm spending my money on and where we can improve. And hopefully, by making incremental improvements, then we can generate a lot more savings. Shen: Sure. I'm curious if there's anything in particular that inspired you to want to tackle this issue. Was it something you noticed, like, "Wow, I had eight Starbucks coffees this week?"  Priestley: That would not be unusual. (laughs) Actually, it was Maurie Backman, a Fool contributor wrote an article called something like You Can Have Your Latte and Retire Comfortably or something. She was basically talking about how saving on, just like you just said, your daily coffee, won't help you if you're spending $500 too much on your rent. Shen: Yes, absolutely. Priestley: Which is 100% true. And we went through our finances, and honestly I don't think that's an issue for us. I mean, D.C. metro rent is expensive, but you have to compare it to what everybody else is paying. I think we're paying a decent amount. So, we went through our big expenses. Then you get to all of the other stuff. Shen: Yeah, you whittle down everything else. Priestley: Exactly. So, for me and my husband, where our problem area is is eating out and all those fun things that add up. Shen: So, let's say you're approaching the summer or the fall, getting through 2017, is there anything you have in terms of hard metrics or numbers that you'll be using to gauge or benchmark your success? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I have until the end of this month, this is my tracking period. I'm using an Intuit app called Mint. You link it to your bank. It solves a big problem for me, because previously, I'd tried to track spending using my beloved Excel spreadsheets, and you end up with all these sub-charts and extra pages, sub-categories of clothing, gifts, all that stupid stuff. What this does is, the app links up to your bank account, and it breaks down your spending for you, so you can really see, easily -- it's an incredibly user-friendly interface -- what you're spending your money on. Shen: Mint has been around for quite some time now. I remember hearing about it when I was still back in school. For anybody who's not aware, I have not had experience with it, but I've heard a lot of good testimonials from people, they generally say it eases that process, instead of checking your statement, tracking it down yourself in a spreadsheet or by hand, whatever you use, you give it access to the account information and it pools all that together. And it gives you, from what I remember and checking out the site, it has a lot of great visuals, charts, things that help you track this along the way, right? Priestley: Absolutely. And there's a lot of those out there, this isn't the only app available. But I like it because, as I said, I think it breaks it down really well, it's very easy to use. You can set a budget in there, and it gives you a monthly tracker of how close you are to your budget, which I think is excellent. Then, the other thing I think is great is that they obviously have access to a huge amount of people's financial information. From that, they have a lot of learnings, so they send you tips on, "This credit card may be better for you and your spending," things like that. Some people may not like that. I personally appreciate it. Even if you don't use it, it's good insight. For me, it's exactly as you commented, it's really reducing friction between creating a budget, monitoring that, do you do it monthly, that's a huge amount of information to go through. That's what we were doing. I was downloading our financial statement, putting it into an Excel spreadsheet, going through. It's a very time-consuming exercise. And for some people, that's a very stressful exercise, too. So, for me, this really helps to make that process so much easier. I joke with people about the fact that I'm always on my phone looking at social media or news anyway. This is just another app on my phone that I can look at. Shen: Sure. I will say, being someone that used to track it manually on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, if you miss one or two of those sessions, whatever time period you do, it becomes very daunting. If you were to miss a month, and you suddenly have two months to go back on, you can lose momentum very quickly that way. Last question: How much is your husband involved in this process? And does he share your view of this resolution, or does he have some of his own things to work on? Priestley: He definitely shares in the view that we need to budget. January is our testing month. We've both committed to each other that we're not going to spend $X on eating out. I bring my lunch to work but he doesn't, and I think his lunch budget was something ridiculous like $5 a day, so I'm interested in seeing if he can stick to it. Shen: That's tough, especially if you're eating out. Priestley: Absolutely. But yes, we're both in line with it. I know, after reading your article on your resolutions, that's an important thing, to make sure you're both aligned. Shen: Yeah. For myself for 2017, I think our resolutions are actually very similar. It comes down to focus, and where we're focusing our efforts. You mentioned decluttering. That's pretty much exactly how I would describe mine. I'm going to be trying to, at least for the first stage, clean the house. I've been describing to people decluttering my life, essentially. There's some different parts to that. I've moved around a lot in the last 10 years. When I actually thought about this, I realize I moved around almost once per year. I think, for some people, that's a really easy way for them to get rid of a lot of junk or stuff that they have around, because when you're packing up, it's easy to say, "I really don't need this anymore." I maybe was not quite so good about doing that. I may have organized a little bit better and called that an improvement, but in the end, I have a habit of saving receipts, packaging, tags for returns and warranty reasons. And the thing is, when it comes down to it, I don't end up using even 1% of what I save. It makes no sense at all, my wife complains about it quite often. I have gotten better about it, but I think one person who really inspired me to pursue this resolution was actually my brother. He has what I describe as a minimalist approach to things, especially with his wardrobe. We're about the same height and build, and a lot of times I'll say, "Hey, I have some clothes, are you interested? Otherwise I'm going to donate it," and every single time, he'll look at it and really think about, is this something I'm going to take? He doesn't just take it because it's there. He has a set number of clothing items that he can combine in different variations to build different outfits, but it's as small as it can be. I'm pretty sure he could pack his entire wardrobe into one OK-sized suitcase, which blows me away.  So, I started to pack up a lot of things that are going to either the trash, donation bin, or putting them for sale. The donation bin, obviously, I would like to be as sustainable as possible, let this stuff keep getting used. There's some tax benefits to it, too. You don't even really get into much paperwork or filing needs unless it's more than $500. But on the selling side, I was really surprised because I was letting some things sit around like an old bike, outdoor gear I had, some photography equipment. And when I tallied it all up, it was actually way more than I was expecting. The best part is, between things like Facebook, Craigslist, eBay, you basically have it, as a seller, easier than ever to match the supply and demand for this stuff. I have and old daypack. It's in very good condition. I may have gotten $20 to $30 for it at a garage sale if I'd had it out, but going online, you can put it in front of millions of people in these various marketplaces, and I'll probably get at least two or three times that. So, little things like that add up. I plan on putting a lot of that toward savings and longer-term goals. That is the first phase for me for 2017. I'm trying to approach this on a quarterly basis so I can keep myself accountable, and also realistically gauge my progress.  I think the problem I had last year in terms of 2016 resolutions, the big thing was getting married and staying on our budget, which we very happily did, but at the same time, that took up so much of our energy and time during the planning process. You were a very sympathetic ear last year for me when I was talking about this stuff. My partner and I kind of gave up on some of the other resolutions we had in terms of investing together, and me educating her more about stocks, investing, and what's out there. Taking this more phased approach is important for us to hold each other accountable, and also approach things a little bit more independently we're not tied to each other, so it's easier to plan around some of the complexities with our schedules and things like that. Wrapping things up, we got through some of our personal experience from last year, what we are looking forward to this year. I also thought it would be interesting to talk broadly for Americans about how they approach resolutions, and how successful, in general, they tend to be, what they tend to focus on. The numbers I have here from this survey says "Top 10 New Year's resolutions for 2017." The biggest category, about one in five people, is lose weight and healthier eating. Then, there's a second related category, which is work out more often, which is #7 at 5%. So, about one in four people are focused on health and wellness. No. 2 is very broad life self-improvements. Maybe that's where we would be categorized with ours. No. 3, better financial decisions, again somewhere where we fall. But, the health and wellness is obviously a very popular one. Not to discourage people who have resolutions, but to look at what some of the results look like -- percentage of Americans who usually make New Year's resolutions, only 40%. I was surprised. I thought that was something that most people did. But the survey says 40%. Then, the percentage of people who do it on occasion is about 17%. And the rest, who never do it, like our man behind the glass, Austin, not interested at all when we asked him before the show, he's part of the 42% or so from the survey that never makes any resolutions. The thing that really makes this process seem more daunting is that the percentage of people who felt they were successful in achieving their resolution was only 9.2%. So, that can be rough. But the percentage who have infrequent success, about 50%. The percentage who never succeed, and fail every year, 42%. But, I think some of the things we talked about, in terms of holding yourself accountable, having a system in place, using resources, whether it's an app or something else can definitely help with that.  You shared some really interesting information with me earlier, especially on the health and wellness front. I think both of us are pursuing that on the side, not as Fool-related, but we want to be healthier and work out more. What numbers did you pull about people and gym memberships in January? Priestley: It's such a cliché, but there are obviously millions of people who resolve to get to fit and lose weight, and I'm one of them. I found that 12% of gym members join in January, and what's more depressing from that is that 80% of people who join a gym quit within five months. Honestly, if you're a regular gym attender, you've already beat 80% of people who are joining in January. I think the takeaway from this is, you should really think about starting a gym membership before you do it. That's the position I'm in now. I'm trying a few classes, I'm trying to work out by myself and see if that will help me avoid falling into this trap. Shen: That is not surprising, that 12%. The way it should break out on a monthly basis, if every month were equal, it's like 8%. So, the 12% in January, I can't say I'm surprised. In terms of how your success goes, you mentioned that most people quit within five months, that survey had an interesting question with the length of your resolution -- how many people are able to maintain them throughout time. About three out of four people can maintain them through the first week. (laughs) About 60% of people manage to maintain them past the first month. But the good news is, that first month gauge is actually pretty solid. The drop off from one month at 60% to past six months, it drops off after six months to about 45%. So if you can make it past that first month, you are in great shape at potentially keeping this up. I do think that regarding the five-month gym membership thing, the people who can't make it, they might make it the first couple weeks, then stop, and after months of donating to the local gym, they realize that there might be better uses. Is there anything else that you'd like to share, Sarah, in terms of your approach, or any other lessons that you've learned in prior years with resolutions, before we wrap up here? Priestley: There was actually one sentence in your article that I thought was really insightful and good for people to learn. "Ultimately, when you have just months to coordinate your wedding and a few decades to worry about retirement, the near-term commitment takes priority." And, obviously, in your case, it was the wedding. But for everybody, we always have a near-term commitment that's coming up. For me, often, it's visiting family, going back home, which breaks up my year quite a lot, and often interrupts my best efforts with both financial planning and fitness goals. So, I think that everybody needs to keep this in mind. We really need to plan for both the near-term commitments and the long-term. Shen: Yeah. You brought up something for my article and I wanted to do the same thing from yours. I really like the way that you described prioritizing properly and staying busy. I think for me as well, during 2016, I was able to say, "Hey, I'm still needing meeting my goals," because I was busying myself with wedding planning stuff or something along those lines. But it really wasn't a very substantive step toward my actual end goal. For this year, I want to be a lot better in this decluttering my life process to make sure that whatever I'm doing is not just me filling my time trying to make me feel better about it, saying, "Oh, I spent a little bit of time on resolutions," but actually something substantive enough that's pushing me to progress forward. So, that was something that I'm probably guilty of quite often, so it really hit a nerve, when I read your article. Thanks a lot for joining the show. I hope Fools aren't too discouraged. I think 2017 is looking to be a good year for a lot of us, and despite what some of the stats might say it's up to you. Keep it up, hold yourself accountable.

Bryton Mellot, 22, was arrested on the 4th of July last year on flag burning charges after posting images of his act and a long rant on his Facebook page. Threats of violence against Mellot quickly appeared under his post, which also noted his place of employment. Bryton Mellot said he planned out his flag burning free speech protest carefully. He also maintains the Illinois flag desecration law banning him from lighting the American Flag on fire is unconstitutional. Here’s an excerpt from Mellot’s flag burning Facebook post: “I am not proud to be an American. In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis.” Police in Urbana, a Chicago suburb, arrested Mellot while he was working at Walmart at least, in part, for his own protection, they maintain. Law enforcement officers were concerned about the threats of violence which had been levied on social media being carried out, and Bryton Mellot or Walmart shoppers and employees getting hurt, Fox News notes. @Walmart if you love your country and troops fire him ASAP!! #brytonmellot pic.twitter.com/xl8uHhAPK0 — mrclutch212 (@gritzangravy212) July 4, 2016 “Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism,” Bryton Mellot said in a prepared statement after filing the lawsuit. “And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.” Hundreds of negative comments were posted to Mellot’s Facebook page after he shared the photos of him lighting the flag on fire. After Urbana police officers arrested the Chicago area man, he was detained for several hours and ultimately released without being charged with flag burning or any other crime, the News-Gazette reports. “I would like to one day feel a sense of pride toward my nationality again. But too little progress has been made. Too many people still suffer at the hands of politicians influenced by special interests,” Mellot also posted to Facebook, according to BizPacReview. “I do not have pride in my country. I am overwhelmingly ashamed, and I will demonstrate my feelings accordingly. #ArrestMe.” Champaign County State’s Attorney Julia Rietz told the press laws dealing with flag burning and constitutional rights are “extremely complex.” Rietz also states the Urbana Police Department recognizes the Bryton Mellot flag burning incident is a case where free speech rights might have “been in conflict” with the safety of innocent bystanders. “In this circumstance, our officers acted in good faith and in reliance on a state law that was passed by our legislature in an attempt to do just that. We respect the analysis of the State’s Attorney’s Office and their determination not to proceed with the prosecution in this matter,” the Champaign County State’s Attorney continued. The Bryont Mellot flag burning lawsuit names multiple Urbana police officers. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois is representing Mellot in the lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday. “It’s very clear that this law is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that in the future, Illinois law enforcement officers know that they cannot arrest people under this statute,” ACLU attorney Rebecca Glenberg said. #FreedomOfSpeech #BrytonMellot pic.twitter.com/nmg8aNzYYJ — Juxhin Çela???????? (@JuxhinCelaEU) July 6, 2016 The United States Supreme Court struck down flag burning laws in some states in separate rulings in both 1989 and 1990. The court ruled flag desecration is a constitutionally protected form of free speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment. Arrest for desecration of the flag is rare. The Supreme Court ruling struck down a flag burning law in Wisconsin in the 1990s. A Missouri flag desecration law was ultimately repealed after an extensive court battle and will no longer be effective after the end of this month. Despite the United States Supreme Court ruling, approximately 40 states still have flag burning laws on the books.

Ruben SantiagoSpringfield Police photo  "Ironic, I know, "said Springfield police spokesman Sgt. John Delaney. Ruben Santiago of Fort Pleasant St. was arrested just before noon and charged with larceny of more than $250. Delaney said Detective Gifford Jenkins was in the Walmart at 1105 Boston Road on an unrelated matter when store security approached to say they had spotted someone shoplifting. They showed him security footage of a man trying to steal a Night Owl Video Home Security DVR / Camera System. Gifford watched Santiago leave through a fire exit, and radioed his description to another detective in the area, Eric Ganley, who began to follow him. Santiago apparently realized he was being followed and started to run through yards in the area of Contessa Street and Grayson Drive, Delaney said. Police K-9 team of office George Flanagan and his dog Riko were called into track him. Santiago was quickly found him in a back yard and recovered the surveillance system. Santiago is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Springfield District Court.

(Gavin McIntyre | The Bay City Times) (Gavin McIntyre) Print Email Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com By Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com The Bay City Times Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 9:15 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 12:48 PM comments Andrew R. Abellard's LinkedIn profile photo  BAY CITY, MI -- A dreary gray sky hung over Bay City in the waning December days. Howling winds whipped through the streets, stinging one's skin and adding to the already bitter cold. As the white snow increasingly turned to slush, a monochromatic palette pervaded. In short, it was a fairly typical scene for the season. As many in the city shopped for presents, strung decorative lights, and planned on spending time with loved ones, Andrew R. Abellard made his home in a disused semi-trailer. On one of the year's last days, likely the same day children tore through wrapping paper in the warm houses surrounding him, Abellard prepared for sleep on the trailer's rotting wood floor. It was about 34 degrees outside, cold enough to see your breath, and the 30-year-old man was wearing layers -- a stocking hat, gray sweatpants and a matching sweatshirt. A frigid Michigan winter was a far cry from the environs of Abellard's Haitian homeland, where the average temperature in December ranges from 70 to 80 degrees. On Christmas, the temperature for the Caribbean nation's capital of Port-au-Prince was 82 degrees. About 15 feet from the trailer's doors, Abellard slid his meager frame inside a red sleeping bag. He lay with his head to the west and feet to the east. Around him he'd scattered personal items -- a backpack containing clothes, religious books, a notebook computer, and a cellphone, a Walmart bag holding a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a wristwatch, a pair of shoes and a pair of flip-flops, a suitcase, and small glass jars containing crystals. With his frail left hand, he grasped a 7-Eleven Big Gulp cup with a small amount of liquid inside it. He rolled onto his right side and curled up. And then, he slipped away. Abellard, a man who professed to hear the voice of God, died of hypothermia, likely on Christmas Day. A grim discovery Just past noon on Tuesday, Jan 3, a police officer responded to 308 State St. on Bay City's West Side after Bay County Central Dispatch received a call of some men having found a dead body. Several semi-trailers were parked on the property and the callers directed the officer to one parked east to west. The officer entered the trailer and saw an obviously deceased person inside. Paramedics arrived and officially declared the subject dead. According to police records obtained by The Bay City Times/MLive through a Freedom of Information Act request, three men had discovered the body, one of which had arrived there to potentially buy the trailer. On opening the back of the trailer to ensure its roof wasn't leaky, they saw a man lying in a sleeping bag, his mouth open. On realizing the man was deceased, the men called 911. 'Transient' man died of hypothermia in back of semi-trailer, police say The trailer had not been moved for about one year, witnesses told police. The trailer's owner arrived on scene shortly thereafter and told police that as far as he knew, the trailer hadn't been opened since June. More police responded to the scene. Inside the dead man's backpack, they found a wallet containing a Michigan driver's license, a Social Security card, and an immigration card showing he hailed from Haiti, according to police records. All three cards identified the deceased as Andrew Robert Abellard. Police wrote in their reports that there was no sign of a struggle. They described Abellard's body as "quite emaciated." Though he stood 5 feet 6 inches tall, he weighed 75 pounds. His normal weight should have been between 118 and 154 pounds, according to medical experts. Abellard had an Etsy account that said he moved from Haiti to Florida around 2002. He began painting 10 years later, the activity quickly becoming his "favorite hobby." His LinkedIn profile states he earned an associate degree in graphic design. Investigators contacted Abellard's 28-year-old wife, Kayla J. Abellard, with whom he had two children. She gave an account of her husband's bizarre behavior the last year of his life. The couple was living in Florida in January when Abellard began drinking salt water. Andrew R. Abellard's Facebook profile photo  "He told me that God was making him do it," she told police, according to their reports. "Andrew then wanted me to drink salt water. I refused to drink it. He told me that we did not have the same views and that he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with me." That same month, Kayla Abellard moved to Michigan. In April, her husband joined her and they resided in a Hampton Township apartment. But his peculiar behavior continued. "In May, Andrew began eating only flour tortillas," she told police. "He told me that God was telling him that was the only thing he should eat. He... became very thin. He looked sickly due to his low weight." Abellard left his family in May. His wife was thereafter unable to contact him via telephone or email, she said. She last saw him in August, walking out of the Bangor Township Walmart. "I questioned him why he would just leave his children like that," she told police. "He told me we had different views on life. He looked skinny at that time." The Times was unable to contact Kayla Abellard or Andrew Abellard's family in Haiti for comment. Death by hypothermia Forensic pathologist Dr. Kanu Virani conducted an autopsy on Abellard's remains on Jan. 4. He concluded Abellard died from "accidental hypothermia" about Dec. 25, an ignominious end for a man who left the Americas' poorest nation for its most affluent. Hypothermia is a condition when a person's body loses heat faster than it can produce it, resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. While a normal human body temperature is around 98.6 degrees, hypothermia sets in once it drops below 95 degrees. Exacerbating hypothermia in cold temperatures are factors like poor food intake, improper clothing and equipment, wetness, fatigue and exhaustion, dehydration, alcohol intake, and being unaware that one is suffering from the condition, according to a Princeton University report.  At 90 degrees, the body tries moving into a hibernation status, shutting down peripheral blood flow and reducing the breathing and heart rates. Four degrees colder, the body is in a "metabolic icebox" state, with the suffered looking dead while still being alive. Prior to death, the person's breathing becomes erratic and shallow. Cardiac arrhythmias develop and, eventually, the heart stops.  Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, 713 Ninth St.Tyler Sutherland | MLive.com  Homelessness and mental illness For his last few months, it appears Abellard was homeless. There's no record of him having stayed at the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission at 713 Ninth St. in Bay City. He was never booked in the Bay County Jail, either. His wife's statement to police that he repeatedly talked about receiving instructions from God indicates he was likely suffering from auditory hallucinations. Hearing voices is the most common hallucination experienced by people suffering from a psychosis such as schizophrenia, according to medical experts. Those afflicted with temporal lobe epilepsy have also been known to experience such hallucinations, particularly with a religious bent, according to a 2013 article by researchers at the University of Wollongong in Australia. "This may include hearing a voice telling the individual to kneel and worship God, hearing hallucinations of God's voice, hearing the repetition of a religious expression, or the (hallucination) may be regarded as a prophecy or deeper message being conveyed to the individual." Travis Pashak  Travis Pashak, assistant professor of psychology at Saginaw Valley State University, said that, broadly speaking, there is a strong link between homelessness and mental health disorders. "A few of the main pathways to homelessness include psychoses such as schizophrenia, drug addiction problems, and sometimes things like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). It sounds like (Abellard) was having delusions, which may imply more severe problems." Pashak said that prior to the 1950s, the country "had a pretty nice support system in place for when folks had more severe breakdowns." A process of deinstitutionalization then began. Pashak described the process as a political movement to put less funding in long-term chronic healthcare, the logic being that those benefiting from it were becoming too dependent on it and they needed to be reintegrated into society. "Looking back now, we kind of see that's a flawed logic," he said. "The number of beds (in mental health facilities) over the 40 years between '50 and '90 dropped significantly. Initially it was thought to be a success, then it was noticed there were more and more homeless folks." What resulted was a revolving door effect, wherein homeless individuals would spend time on the streets, check into an emergency room, get shelter for a few days, then be discharged and back on the streets with medical professionals being unable to refer them elsewhere, Pashak said. While resources are prevalent for those on the polar ends of mental disorders -- for example, those who are largely functional and see a therapist once or week and those who suffer from extreme, debilitating illnesses -- those in the middle who may largely maintain a degree of normality then suffer a breakdown often fall through the cracks, Pashak said. "In my opinion, that's one of our big deficiencies in the enterprise of mental health," he said. Executive Director Dan Streeter walks through the section of the mission that could be renovated Wednesday, July 30, 2015 at Good Samaritan Rescue Mission, 713 9th St. in Bay City.Yfat Yossifor | MLive.comm  Dan Streeter, the chief executive officer for the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission at 713 Ninth St. in Bay City, and the City Rescue Mission in Saginaw, said the agency has seen increasing rates of homeless suffering from some degree of mental disorder. "We've seen over the last several years a large increase in the number of those dealing with homelessness experiencing difficulties with mental illness," Streeter said. About 30 percent of shelter residents on any given night suffer from some sort of mental illness, he estimated. That figure is consistent with national trends. According to a September 2016 report from the Arlington, Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, an estimated one-third of the country's total homeless population is composed of people suffering from untreated serious mental illnesses. Such a high rate is a reason for the local shelter having a strong partnership with local mental health authorities, Streeter said. "When we identify there is a mental health issue, we'll be contacting and coordinating with mental health professionals for their care," he said. Getting help for an adult afflicted with a mental disorder is a challenging endeavor, however. Unless the person is willing to check him or herself in for treatment -- or displays intense destructive or violent tendencies -- there's not much others can do. Streeter said if they see behavior by a person that shows risk to themselves or others, they can try and work with the legal system to get the person committed to care, but those are "very extreme situations." "Until someone gets to that point, if they don't want care, our hands are kind of tied," he said. The Bay City shelter can house up to 110 residents and averaged 70 per night in 2016, Streeter said. While homelessness is a year-round problem, single men tend to check in to the shelter more often in the winter months. Residency for women and children tends to increase in August, Streeter said. No matter people's backgrounds or current predicaments, the shelter is always open to them, Streeter said. "It's open no matter what the situation is," he said. "They can come in out of the elements and we'll provide them a safe shelter. We're going to try to be that safety net for people in what we believe is one of the most difficult times of their lives. "For some experiencing homelessness," Streeter soberly added, "it is a life or death situation."

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement officers made good on promises to go after people they think aided a fugitive in the weeks before he became the focus of a manhunt in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant, arresting three people they say helped him after the killing of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Markeith Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested on an accessory charge Wednesday. Later the same day, authorities arrested an ex-girlfriend of Loyd's: Jameis Slaughter, who also faces a charge of accessory, according to online jail records. And a day earlier, Zarghee Mayan, the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge. A manhunt for Loyd after Monday's fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton entered its fourth day Thursday as authorities promised to reward anyone who turns him in and punish anyone who helps him hide. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, because others may be helping him hide. Orlando Police Chief John Mina had warned earlier this week that anyone helping Loyd "will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well." Mayan's arrest affidavit said Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle in the days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in mid-December. Smith-Loyd's affidavit says she contacted deputies after the ex-girlfriend's death and promised to help them find her uncle if they first told her whether a firearm had been recovered from the scene of the slaying. Then she stopped cooperating even as she contacted others on her uncle's behalf, the affidavit said. Slaughter is accused of collecting money for Loyd. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing that he was wanted, the affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. During another encounter, right after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed it at Mayan and said, "'Drive me or I will kill you. I just did something real bad,'" the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd's estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The arrests stem from the investigation into the shooting death of Sade Dixon, Markeith Loyd's pregnant girlfriend, in December. Authorities said the suspects aided Loyd's attempts to avoid apprehension after that killing. Loyd also is suspected of killing Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday when she tried to approach him at an Orlando-area Walmart. One of the people arrested Wednesday was Lakensha Smith Loyd, one of Loyd's nieces. Orange County deputies said in an arrest affidavit that she was contacting people on behalf of her uncle after Dixon was killed and indicated she was in contact with him after the shooting. They also believe she went to a restaurant where her uncle worked to pick up $200 as he tried to avoid arrest for Dixon's killing. It is unclear whether Smith Loyd has a lawyer. She could be charged with being an accessory after the fact, a felony. Also arrested Tuesday was Zarghee Mayan, who deputies said never contacted authorities after he met Markeith Loyd, who told him he had killed Dixon. Mayan appeared before a judge for a bond hearing Wednesday but was denied bail. He will be charged with being an accessory after the fact. CNN reached out to the public defender's office for comment but Melissa Vickers, the chief assistant public defender, said they do not discuss cases with the media. The third person arrested, Jameis Slaughter, is also accused of being an accessory after the fact. Authorities said she also collected money to give to Loyd, her former boyfriend, and lied to cops about her communication with the suspect. Slaughter said Loyd told her cops would have to kill him because he wasn't going back to prison, according to an affidavit from the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Authorities said the car of Jamesia Slaughter, Jameis's twin sister, was seen being driven around the Walmart 90 minutes after Clayton was killed. Jameis Slaughter is also charged with giving a false name to police when she was detained Wednesday after identifying herself initially as her twin. Clayton and other officer killed On Monday morning, Clayton received word that Loyd was near a Walmart and tried to confront him. "As soon as she said, 'Stop,' he basically opened fire on her," Orlando police Chief John Mina said. At a news conference Thursday, Mina said Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down. Mina added that Clayton apparently shot Loyd in the chest, but the bullet was stopped by a bulletproof vest. Later Loyd discarded his pants and his shirt, Mina said. The manhunt for Loyd led to several injuries and the death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, who died in a motorcycle crash while searching for him on the day of Clayton's death. Authorities have increased the reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest to $100,000. The pursuit After the shooting of Clayton, Loyd fled in a car and fired shots at another officer, police said. That officer was not seriously injured. The suspect then abandoned the first vehicle and carjacked another one. He ditched that second vehicle shortly afterward and ran into an apartment complex, Mina said. It is unclear where he is now. But a "be on the lookout" alert has been sent nationwide, which is standard procedure with Florida murder suspects, police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said. Mina said Loyd would be charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of the officer at whom he fired. The Orlando Police Department has received more than 800 tips about the case, officials said Thursday. Police have searched more than 100 locations, Mina added. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource.

So what Workday also noted it isn't updating its latest financial guidance, which incidentally caused Workday stock to plunge last month as the company warned a few larger deals with multinational customers had been delayed. More specifically, Workday told investors to expect fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $427 million to $430 million. That represented 32% to 33% year-over-year growth but fell below Wall Street's estimates at the time for fiscal Q4 revenue of $433.6 million. Now what Nonetheless, while Workday typically uses its quarterly conference calls to fill investors in on its latest customer additions, it's telling that this single deal merited its own SEC filing and caused today's big pop. With more than 2 million employees globally, Wal-Mart is easily Workday's biggest customer yet, and adds to the already enviable list of hundreds of industry leaders that trust its enterprise cloud solutions, ranging from Netflix to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, TripAdvisor, Panera Bread, Chiquita, and Zillow Group, to name only a few.

How to buy snow chains Print Email Rob Davis | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Rob Davis | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 11, 2017 at 6:05 PM, updated January 11, 2017 at 7:09 PM comments The temporary requirement for vehicles to be equipped with snow chains in Portland Wednesday sent retailers scrambling to keep up. Most stores in the region are sold out. But we found a few still have chains in stock. One key recommendation: Call first. Availability often depends on your tire size. Did we miss a store with chains? Let us know in the comments below. Walmart Tire chains are sold out at several stores around the metro area, said Leslee Wright, a Walmart spokeswoman. "Inventory is really low," she said. There are some stores that have chains in stock, Wright said, but she encouraged people looking for chains to call ahead. Employees are working to expedite new shipments, she said. Fred Meyer Location: 7404 N. Interstate, Portland. Hours: 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Selection: The store has a few styles of chains left, mostly for larger tires, according to an employee. --- Location: 3030 N.E. Weidler St., Portland Hours: 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Selection: The store has about a dozen sets of cable chains in stock, including styles for smaller cars and trucks and SUVs.

Source: Jac Bedrossian. FORREST COUNTY, MS (WDAM) - Mayor Johnny DuPree held a press conference about the homeless encampment clearing by Walmart on U.S. Hwy 49 in Hattiesburg Wednesday morning. He talked about his collaboration with the Mississippi United To End Homelessness organization and city homelessness coordinator, Kim Townsend on the project. Together, they were able to clear the wooded area and find housing for some of the homeless people living in the woods.  "It's a culture," DuPree said. "If you don't stop it where it is, you perpetuate it. It's not just adults, it's the children. The children grow up and it's all they know." DuPree also explained that because the wooded area was privately owned, it took several months to disband the camps.  While many in the community have applauded the move, some neighbors of the homeless community said it could not come soon enough. One resident who wanted to remain anonymous said that the camps have been going on for 10 years. In a Facebook message, he talked about the burden the camps brought on his community.  He said, "Protecting our property values is our upmost concern, and we are pleased with the efforts being done to make the area we pay to call home, just that." Out of the 16 people found at the camp site, eight have found housing and an additional four have signed initial paperwork to find housing. MUTEH offers medical, mental health and employment services in addition to helping the homeless find a permanent home.  The organization asks the Pine Belt to donate kitchen supplies.

Terrell made her announcement public in a LinkedIn post Tuesday (Jan. 10). In that post Terrell said she will take the next step in her career after leading technology for Walmart for the past six years. She noted to her friends and colleagues that it’s been a “wild ride and there is no bigger game.” Terrell credited Wal-Mart for its mission focused culture that puts customers first and its scale that is second to none. “The learning for me has been exponential. I leave my work family and my Arkansas friends with great reluctance but also with great anticipation as I step boldly into a new frontier. … Walmart, you will always have my heart … but as of March my mind and energy will be otherwise engaged,” Terrell noted in the post. She ended the post in typical true Walmart fashion citing the Walmart Cheer and thanking the retailer for teaching her the customer is always first. Terrell did not say where she is going, only that is somewhere outside of Arkansas. Terrell joined Walmart in December 2010 and was promoted to chief information officer in February 2012. For the past six years she has had the responsibility for the largest segments of the global Walmart Technology portfolio including Information Systems Division (ISD), Global Back Office Solutions, and Data and Analytics overseeing more than 5,000 technologist around the world. Terrell is an engineer who spent 4 years at Baxter International before joining Wal-Mart. Prior to that she worked for DaimlerChrysler Group for six year rising to the rank of chief information officer. She graduating from Purdue University with an electrical engineering master’s degree in 1988. She has been a vocal voice for STEM education and the need for more mentoring of girls and women in this area as part of the Million Women Mentors program. Two years ago Terrell was the keynote speaker at the first Northwest Arkansas Technology Conference. From that podium Terrell said she was proud to be an engineer in a family of teachers, but her parents never really understood what her job is. She challenged universities in Arkansas to put more emphasis on computer science graduates as just 1 in 17 technologies in the country graduated with a degree in computer science. She said Northwest Arkansas has got to do a better job fostering STEM education and put as much emphasis on STEM as seen in the Walton College entrepreneurship and other business degree programs. “If we don’t, we will miss an opportunity,” she said in 2014. Terrell’s last day at Walmart will be Feb. 24 and CEO Doug McMillon noted in an internal memo to employees that new leadership in technology is expected to be announced soon. The retail giant has been undergoing several top management changes in its IT division and elsewhere. Rosalind Brewer is stepping down as CEO of Sam’s Club at the end of January and Chris Sultemeier is retiring at the same time as CEO of Walmart Logistics. Since the acquisition of Jet, the Walmart Global e-Commerce CEO Neil Ashe has departed and Marc Lore, CEO and co-founder of Jet has taken over Walmart.com operations in addition to running Jet.com. McMillon applauded Terrell for her service saying that her “character was clear – modernize our technology team and power our store and club businesses by enabling a seamless shopping experience at scale.” Some of the work overseen by Terrell includes: geofencing around stores, Walmart Pay and the technology behind self check-out. She also helped to manage the retailers online grocery pickup platform.

It plans to eliminate the jobs before the end of its fiscal year on Jan 31, the person said. The cuts will fall broadly but are expected to focus on Walmart's US operations, including the human resources department, as well as the technology and e-commerce divisions. The plans mark one of Walmart's largest rounds of corporate job cuts as it works to preserve profits while making the company more efficient and responsive to fast-changing consumer behaviours. "We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively," said Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt. "While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements." Many of the cuts will affect Walmart's human resources department, a large team that some senior executives believe should be leaner or whose duties could be handled by outside consultants, say other people familiar with the plans. Walmart's chief information officer, Karenann Terrell, will leave the company on Feb 24, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a memo to staff Tuesday. The company didn't name a successor or Ms Terrell's future plans. In late 2015 Walmart laid off hundreds of workers at its Bentonville, Ark, headquarters. In September, it cut about 7,000 back-office jobs in its stores, automating some tasks by adding cash recyclers that count money. "We need to manage expenses even better, which includes changing how we do work inside the company," Mr McMillon said during an investor presentation in October. Walmart has predicted that per-share adjusted earnings in fiscal 2018 will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, then fall at the low end of its 2019 target of 5% to 10% growth. Other retailers have recently moved to slash jobs and close stores as they battle sluggish sales and try to save money to invest in their e-commerce efforts. Last week, Macy's Inc said it would close stores, cutting 10,000 jobs and streamlining operations. Walmart closed more than 150 US stores last January, then in October said new-store openings would slow, but hasn't announced plans for another round of large-scale closures. In late 2015, Walmart hired Jacqui Canney, an executive who had spent decades with Accenture Ltd, to lead its human resources department. Some employees in the department have been told to find other jobs internally or externally by the end of the month, said one of the people familiar with the situation. Walmart employees roughly 18,000 Bentonville-based staff. But the series of reductions show how the retailer is working to maintain profits at a time of change in the industry. Walmart has spent heavily over the past two years to fend off Amazon.com Inc and smaller, fast-growing discounters like Aldi. In the investor presentation last fall, executives said Walmart would steer more of its $11 billion in annual budget toward boosting e-commerce sales, technology used in stores and on customer services. In September, Walmart spent $3.3 billion to purchase Jet.com Inc, an unprofitable e-commerce start-up. "We have a plan to win with customers and drive growth. We will be disciplined with our cost and capital as we do it," said Mr McMillon during the presentation.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 11, 2017 at 5:01PM The stock market climbed Wednesday, with all three major market benchmarks finishing on the plus side. The Dow rose back to within 50 points of the 20,000 mark, and although negative comments from President-elect Donald Trump about drug pricing during his press conference caused poor performance in that sector, the general mood among investors remained positive as earnings season approaches. Also, good news on several fronts helped lift individual stocks, and Kornit Digital (NASDAQ:KRNT), Workday (NYSE:WDAY), and Atwood Oceanics (NYSE:ATW) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well. Image source: Kornit Digital. Kornit makes a deal with Amazon Kornit Digital soared 20% after the Israeli company said it had signed an agreement with online retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Under the deal, the digital textile printing technology company will deliver what it called "a large number" of its on-demand production systems to Amazon in order to back up the new Merch by Amazon initiative. Kornit CEO Gabi Seligsohn was excited about the agreement, arguing that the deal shows how Kornit "is at the forefront of the digital direct-to-garment market." Amazon will also receive warrants that give it the right to buy more than 2.9 million shares of Kornit stock at just over $13 per share, and today's move earned Amazon several million dollars just from the warrants alone. Workday celebrates on Wal-Mart news Workday shares finished up 10% in the wake of news that the HR cloud-computing specialist had signed up Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) as a customer for its software platform. The SEC filing that Workday submitted explained that Wal-Mart had purchased subscriptions to its Workday Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning, and Planning services. Yet even though investors were generally pleased with the move, Workday didn't take the opportunity to update its financial guidance for the current of coming fiscal year. Nevertheless, many believe the Wal-Mart agreement could be a game-changer for Workday, and at the very least, it will ease any concerns that competitors were leaving Workday behind. Atwood bounces back Finally, Atwood Oceanics gained 8%. The offshore drilling company recovered all the ground it had lost in recent days, with yesterday's completion of a secondary stock offering that involved the sale of 13.5 million shares at $12.20 per share. Atwood shares seemed to respond favorably to the lack of selling pressure following the offering, and after several days of poor performance from the energy markets, oil prices finally bounced higher today as well, finishing up about 2.5% to close near $53 per barrel. Looking forward, investors are more optimistic about the prospects for Atwood and its peers as crude rebounds from rock-bottom levels over the past couple of years. If the trend continues, Atwood should have further to run in the future. Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Chairman, co-founder and Co-CEO Aneel Bhusri (left) and co-founder and Co-CEO Dave Duffield (center) applaud their company's first trade with NYSE-Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer (center right) and traders after the IPO on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 12, 2012. Tech company Workday saw shares rise nearly 10 percent on Wednesday, after the announcement that Wal-Mart had purchased a subscription to its human resources platform. Trading of shares of Workday's stock were halted earlier on the New York Stock Exchange, pending release of material news. Shares of the enterprise software company were up more than 8.5 percent before the halt, after William Blair's Justin Furby wrote that the company had "recently signed an HR deal with one of the world's largest employers, with over 2 million employees globally." The California-based technology company said it would not update its fourth-quarter or fiscal-year financial guidance based on the announcement, according to an SEC filing. Over the past year, the company has also secured clients like Panera Bread. The contract comes just a day after a Wall Street Journal report that Wal-Mart is preparing to cut nearly 1,000 corporate jobs. Workday sells cloud-based applications for finance and human resources, such as programs for expenses, payroll and benefits management. While Workday programs have a reputation as being easy to use among its multinational customers, it faces growing competition from companies like Oracle and SAP, Nomura analyst Frederick Grieb wrote last month. The company had also seen big customers hesitate to make deals over the past year, CEO Aneel Bhusri said in a December earnings conference call. "I'd say there were a handful of large multinationals, a couple in the financial services space that are trying to figure out what Brexit means and now what our presidential election means to them," Bhusri said, according to a FactSet transcript. "And they just said, hey, we're going to hold off on making a final decision."

Newslook Walmart will lay off roughly 1,000 employees at its corporate Bentonville, Ark., headquarters in January. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart’s plan to lay off of hundreds of employees is the latest ripple in a wave of job cuts and store closures that are roiling the retail industry. The world’s largest retailer is cutting roughly 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about it. In a statement, Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt did not confirm the job cuts. “We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively,'' he said. "While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.  Like any organization, we make decisions based upon what’s best for our business and the customers we serve.” Unlike some other chains, Walmart has been on solid ground financially. In its most recent quarterly results, for the third quarter that ended Oct. 31, Walmart reported overall revenue of $118.2 billion, a slight uptick of 0.7% as compared to that three month period in the previous year. Sales at U.S. stores open at least 12 months rose 1.2% vs. the previous year. But net income was $3 billion, down 8.2% from that same three-month period a year earlier. In making its cuts, Walmart joins the many traditional retailers that are shutting stores and shedding employees to bolster their bottom lines or simply to survive in an environment in which consumers are increasingly bypassing stores and shopping with Amazon and other online retailers instead. The Limited has closed all of its stores in the U.S., though it maintains its online site.  Macy’s announced last week that it will shutter 68 locations. Sears announced a day later that it is closing 150 stores and selling its signature Craftsman tool brand in a bid to survive. Online retailing giant Amazon has been a particular thorn in the side of traditional chains that make most of their revenue through in-store sales. But big box giants like Walmart and Home Depot have also helped usurp once-dominant brands, like Sears. . Walmart has been taking  aggressive steps to hold onto and expand its vast market share, upgrading its grocery offerings, making its stores more efficient, and boosting its e-commerce presence. Last year, it purchased Jet.com for $3 billion, an acquisition that could help the chain draw more higher-income, online customers. Walmart shares closed at $68.63, up 30 cents or 0.4% Wednesday. 620 CONNECTTWEET 67 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jwazcv NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

The job cuts will be scattered, but are expected to concentrate on operations in the United States, the Journal reported after talking to an executive. Departments facing cuts include human resources and the technology and e-commerce divisions. However, a Walmart representative said the company has not made any announcements about upcoming restructuring affecting its 1.5 million US associates. The company released the following statement: “As we’ve previously shared, we are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. While we continually look at our corporate structure, we have not made any announcements.  Like any organization, we make decisions based upon what’s best for our business and the customers we serve.” More than 150 US Walmart Stores closed last January, following a round of layoffs in October 2015. Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO,  said the cuts were made to create a more agile company to fit customer demand. During a meeting with Walmart investors in Oct. 2016, McMillon said the company must manage expenses better moving forward, including changing the company’s internal work structure. “We must grow this company for Walmart to have a future, but we need to do it in an efficient way,” McMillon said during the October meeting. “It’s not a growth at all cost mindset. We need to manage expenses even better, which includes changing how we do work inside the company. We’ve got to manage capital strategically.”     Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

According to a Bloomberg report, the restaurant sector is engaged in a "full-on food fight" over workers. In fact, the scarcity of qualified workers is resulting in candidates being paid above the minimum wage — without the help of government lawmakers. For example, Eddie Rodriguez, who oversees 177 Wendys Co (NASDAQ: WEN) locations across three states, boosted the hourly pay by nearly one dollar to an average of $9.05, according to Bloomberg. In addition, employees are offered flexible schedules and a referral bonus of $250 to employees who found prospects. Even with the perks, Rodriguez can't keep up with demand during peak traffic at restaurants. Lower Unemployment, Higher Turnovers = Higher Demand The report further noted that while the unemployment rate in the United States sits near a nine-year low at 4.7 percent, the annual turnover for restaurant workers in September soared to 113 percent, marking the highest level ever since People Report began tracking the data in 1995. This makes sense when considering that demand for low-skill workers isn't unique to restaurants. Restaurants need to remain competitive with retail chains such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which raised the wages of more than one million employees to at least $10 an hour. "It's a hot job market," Michael Harms, the executive director of operations at Dallas-based TDn2K, People Report's parent told Bloomberg. "Every employee, whether they're 17 years old or 40 years old, has options."

(AP) — The niece and supervisor of a murder suspect were arrested for allegedly helping him evade capture before the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer. Online court records show that 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd was arrested on a charge of accessory Wednesday, a day after the fugitive’s supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, Zarghee Mayan, was arrested on the same charge. An arrest affidavit for Mayan said that Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle, 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, just days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing he was wanted in the slaying his pregnant ex-girlfriend, the affidavit said. “Mayan did so with the intent that Markeith Demangzlo Loyd avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial or punishment,” the arrest affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. A wreath and flowers surround Orlando police shooting victim, officer Debra Clayton’s patrol car, in front of police headquarters, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Orlando, Fla. Clayton was killed Monday, and a manhunt continues as law enforcement officials search for the suspect. (AP Photo/John Raoux) During another encounter, right after Loyd’s ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed at Mayan and said, “‘Drive me or I will kill you, I just did something real bad,'” the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd’s estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. The 41-year-old ex-convict has been the focus of a massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers and deputies since Monday’s shooting. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, since others may be helping him hide. Orlando Police Chief John Mina has warned that anyone helping Loyd will be prosecuted. “They will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well,” Mina said. Crimeline is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. “If you know where he is at and you call us 3 o’clock in the morning, 3 o’clock in the afternoon, we will have people prepared to dispatch and go capture him,” said Barb Bergin, executive director of the local Crimeline. Mayan, 33, was arrested Tuesday by Orange County Sheriff’s Office deputies on a charge of accessory after the fact. Jail records show no bond had been set, and court records showed no name of a defense attorney listed for him. Police Chief John Mina said federal, state and local authorities were taking part in the manhunt. Mina wouldn’t give details about search tactics but he said law enforcement agencies in Florida and around the nation are on alert. “There are many things going on behind the scenes that our community is not aware of and that we are not at liberty to discuss,” Mina said. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff’s Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

(NYSE: WMT) under which the retail giant will subscribe to Workday’s Human Capital Management, Recruiting, Learning and Planning solutions. In a regulatory filing, Workday also revealed it's not updating its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 or for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018. Earlier Wednesday, Benzinga reported on a William Blair note which said Workday recently signed a big human resources deal with one of the world’s biggest retailers, with over 2 million employees globally. “Though we are not privy to the size of the contract, it would represent by far the largest company Workday has ever signed—more than five times larger (on a headcount basis) than any of its existing HR customers,” analyst Justin Furby wrote. Furby said Workday trumped SAP SE (ADR) (NYSE: SAP) in getting the contract and the retailer will pursue a phased deployment of Workday over the next three to four years that would drive billings significantly. “[W]hen fully scaled, we believe a deal of this size could represent $30 million or more of annual subscription revenue (though it is very difficult to get a sense of true contract terms),” Furby highlighted. After being halted for a couple of hours, Workday traded recently at $79.96, up 7.5 percent. Posted-In: News Contracts Movers Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Expand / Contract Lakensha Smith-Loyd. The arrest of Lakensha Smith-Loyd came one day after police caught 33-year-old Zarghee Mayan, who's also accused of aiding the fugitive murder suspect in December, Fox 35 reported.  DETAILS EMERGE ON HANDCUFFED SUSPECT WHO SHOT HIMSELF IN PATROL CAR Expand / Contract Zarghee Mayan. Mayan told detectives he gave $200 to Loyd's niece so that she could hand it off to the suspect, who was wanted at the time in the Dec. 13 murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, according to the Orlando Sentinel. She picked up the money at the fried chicken restaurant where her uncle and Mayan worked, WFTV reported, describing the money as a paycheck. The manhunt escalated in a big way on Monday after police said Loyd, 41, shot and killed Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Walmart in Orlando. Police announced on Tuesday they hiked the reward for information on his whereabouts to $100,000. CAR CRASH VICTIM'S FAMILY TO SUE STATE BECAUSE DRIVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN PRISON "I just want him to do the right thing before this situation turns into something else," Smith-Loyd told WFTV in December. "I just want Markeith to know that he's got people that love him and will stand behind him." Mayan claimed he saw Loyd as recently as Saturday, when the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a pistol, the Sentinel added. "There have been times when we just missed him. He has been able to avoid capture," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told reporters. Clayton was shot and killed Monday morning after she approached Loyd in the parking lot of the Walmart in northwest Orlando. Many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's deputy who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in a crash. More than 300 tips from the public have poured in, said Barb Bergin, executive director of Crimeline, the tip-line service which is offering the reward and warns in notices that Loyd is "armed and extremely dangerous." "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he is so no one else is hurt," Bergin said in a plea for more tips. Court documents showed Loyd's criminal record went back two decades. He was arrested in 1996 on a murder charge that was later dropped. Loyd was arrested for battery on an officer in 1998 and sentenced to more than four years in prison. While behind bars, he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession from a prior case and was transferred to federal prison. Federal records showed he was released in July 2014. More recently, his wife, whom he was in the process of divorcing, had filed a request for a temporary injunction against him in 2015, and he followed with a similar request against her three days later. Both requests were eventually dismissed in court. He also had paternity suits from three different women filed against him. His Facebook profile had videos of him working out at a gym and hanging out at a nightclub. He said in a November post, "Goals!!!! To be on Americas (sic) most wanted," followed by a series of laughing-with-tears emojis. "Certainly it's upsetting he was out and about and killed Debra Clayton, our first homicide in the city of Orlando this year, one of the officers protecting our community," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Friends and relatives attended a vigil for Clayton on Tuesday night, and in the Walmart parking lot, shoppers laid more than two dozen bouquets of flowers, teddy bears and candles in a makeshift memorial. Some shoppers, like Hal Shore, stopped to say a prayer or take a photo. "It's important that the country is aware that there is a war against police officers," said Shore, a cabinet maker. An Orange County Sheriff's Office deputy was killed more than two hours after Monday's shooting when a van collided with his motorcycle as he responded to the manhunt. Demings described the 35-year-old Norman Lewis as "a gentle giant," and the sheriff's office said he had played football for the University of Central Florida before joining the agency 11 years ago. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday. Click for more from Fox 35. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

File photo The current Walmart store location on Route 7 in New Milford. File photo Photo: Scott Mullin / Scott Mullin New Milford Zoning Commission denies ‘Wal-Mart’ zoning change proposal 1 / 2 Back to Gallery NEW MILFORD — The Zoning Commission has denied an application to rezone 31.6 acres of land on Route 7, a proposal some residents opposed over fears that a Wal-Mart Supercenter would be built. The commission voted 5-0 Tuesday against changing the zoning designation from Restricted Industrial to Industrial, which would have allowed big retail uses on the so-called Docktor Brothers parcel, saying the change would not conform with the town’s 2010 Plan of Conservation and Development. “It goes back to the original argument from the Planning Commission,” said Sharon Ward, vice chair of the zoning board. “We really agreed that it was not consistent with the POCD.” That plan confines retail uses to land abutting Route 7, while the Docktor Brothers parcel is set back from Route 7, abutting Pickett District Road. Paul Szymanski, a Republican town councilor who was representing the lansowners, had told the board he could obtain access by leasing land on Route 7 from existing property owners, but Ward said state laws prohibit zoning based on conditional arrangements. Szymanski did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The commission was shown a land lease for a driveway that would connect the parcel to Route 7, but it was a 20-year deal while the resulting zone change would be indefinite, said board Chairman Bill Taylor. “We’re not allowed to make a decision based on a third-party condition,” Taylor said. ”John Kane, one of two Democrats on the Planning Commission, said he felt vindicated by the zoning board’s decision. Kane and planning Chairman Jon Seidman voted in October that the rezone proposal did not conform with the POCD. Outmatched by Republican planning commissioners who said the proposal did conform to the plan, Kane and Seidman became vocal critics of the proposal and offered the zoning board a “minority report,” urging the board to deny the rezone proposal at a hearing. Earlier public hearings on the proposal drew more than 100 residents and business or property owners. Almost all of them opposed the change, citing traffic worries and saturation of the retail market. Although Szymanski has never disclosed who the landowners he was representing are workign with in making the application, opponents repeatedly voiced suspicion that it was Wal-Mart. The town already has a Wal-Mart, they noted, and the town does not need a bigger one. Mayor David Gronbach, a Democrat, has criticized him for not disclosing who he’s working for, and Democratic Town Councilman Scott Chamberlain has questioned Szymanski’s ethics as a town councilor and consultant for such developments. “When your motto is ‘we’ get things done,’ that’s a thinly veiled solicitation for influence peddling,” Chamberlain said at a November hearing. Gronbach said business owners, property owners and residents all “breathed a sigh of relief” Wednesday after hearing of the board’s unanimous denial. “It’s good for New Milford,” said Chamberlain, “particularly for the [parcel’s] neighbors.” But some are still concerned. Willing Biddle, who owns several shopping centers in town, including the one where Wal-Mart now sits, said he was relieved by the zoning board’s decision, but is still cautious. Biddle says he’s sure Wal-Mart is behind the rezone push. And if they’re serious, they might reapply or appeal the decision after purchasing some adjacent land along Route 7, he said. “Was it defeated just because of that technicality?” Biddle asked. “That could be changed, right? They could just buy that property.” For the past three months, Biddle has argued against the rezoning with a group of lawyers and planners he’s hired to fight it. The planners have done traffic studies and market surveys to show the zoning board the town can’t handle more retail, and the lawyers have argued that the rezone doesn’t conform to the POCD. Biddle and other town shopping center owners, including Kristen Gizzi, of the Litchfield Crossings center, have attended several zoning meetings to voice concerns that the rezone on the property would create a “shell game” as businesses move from current storefronts to new Wal-Mart abutting ones which would leave a “blighted” commercial corridor. “I’ve spent a lot of money and I’ve spent a lot of time on this, and I just think it's critical that these issues be brought to the boards attention,” he said in an interview. If Szymanski were to appeal or reapply, Biddle would continue to fight the rezone, he added. Szymanski has long argued their calculations were faulty and the town could support another large retail-zoned parcel. Frank Ruiz, who has been at every zoning meeting where the rezoning proposal was heard, said he was happy with Tuesday’s denial. Ruiz said the zoning board listened to the dozens of town residents who criticized the proposal. “We were heard,” he said. “And I’m very thankful to [the zoning board], they’re all volunteers.” Ward, zoning vice chair, said public traffic concerns weighed heavily on the board‘s decision. “I’m proud of the commission,” she said. “We appreciated all the input from the public.” blytton@hearstmediact.com; 203-731-3411; @bglytton Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Jos.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Nintendo Switch Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC Rumor: Walmart Selling Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders For $400 By Boston Blake | 4 days ago  Redditor claiming to be a Walmart employee shares sticker price online that reveals the big-box retailer is selling Nintendo Switch pre-orders for $400. With Nintendo’s big Nintento Switch event lined up for tomorrow, gamers are anxiously awaiting the details about the newest Nintendo console. Among the information gamers expect to receive about the Nintendo Switch are price, specific release date, more details specs, and launch titles. However, it seems Walmart may have jumped the gun a little with one important bit of information: the price. According to a photo shard to Reddit, the big-box retail store is taking pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch at the cost of $399, which is much higher than both gamers and analysts expected for the Nintendo Switch. Of course, gamers need to take this with a grain of salt until the price is officially revealed by Nintendo, but the fact that Walmart is apparently preparing to sell the Switch for such a high price is concerning. At $400, the Nintendo Switch would cost the same as the PS4 Pro, and $100 more than Xbox One S. It’s already been rumored that Nintendo Switch is less powerful than the PlayStation 4, a console that is also available for $300. While gamers are hoping for a solid lineup of titles on Nintendo Switch, the potential $400 price tag is daunting and, if true, could seriously injure the console’s potential sales. As far as the sticker goes, the Redditor who shared it claims to work at the retailer and says the tag just dropped into their system. The tag has yesterday’s date, which aligns fairly well with this week’s event from Nintendo, but the low quality of the photo may also mean it’s been faked in an effort to create false fear among gamers. One of the biggest arguments against a $400 price tag are that the console likely isn’t powerful enough to handle many current-generation titles, which means any third-party titles coming to the console will need to be lower-quality ports from current-gen systems or games from years past. Additionally, industry analysts out of Japan claim the console will be available for less than $250. This seems to fit closer to the console-handheld hybrid’s potential considering its uniqueness and capabilities. Fortunately, gamers won’t have to wait too long to learn the truth about the Nintendo Switch’s price.

by Transparency Market Research Jan 11, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, January 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The leading names in the global ICT industry have bagged top honors in the global connectivity constraint computing market as well. For 2015, the global connectivity constraint computing market was dominated by the names Microsoft Corporation, Google, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. As per a research report published by Transparency Market Research, the global connectivity constraint computing market holds a higher concentration of players in North America than other regions. Asia Pacific, which was the smaller market in 2015, is expected to show a meteoric growth rate due to its booming IT industry and increasing scope of application for connectivity constraint computing due to high rate of urbanization. The demand for connectivity constraint computing is also expected to be high in regions that are planning for ecosystem management and wildlife corridor planning. The MEA region is likely to gain momentum in infrastructural development, spurring the demand for CCC modeling. The global connectivity constraint computing market is expected to expand at a meteoric CAGR of 58.4% within a forecast period from 2016 to 2024. While its expected evaluation for the end of 2016 is expected to be US$177.8 mn, the phenomenal growth rate is expected to have the market reach US$7.03 bn by the end of 2024. Download PDF brochure for this Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=18152 Elimination of Human Bias Attracts Several End Users to CCC Modeling  "The use of artificial computing introduces the highly sought after concept of error elimination and bias protection for computing systems. Human operators, regardless of skill, are still prone to a certain minimal level of errors, especially in the massive data sets that are being crunched in modern times. The dynamic nature of data structures calls for the use of connectivity constraint computing and other artificial computing methods, that essentially, minimize or even negate the scope of error, as well as the overall time taken for the processes, through fast and iterative computing. This is becoming a highly crucial need for end users when faced with the staggering data volumes that need to be processed without any bias, which thus forms the key driver for the global connectivity constraint computing market," states a TMR analyst. Other factors promoting the growth of the global connectivity constraint computing market include the growing need for process automation in terms of improvement of quality in data accumulation and maintenance functions, and the growing need for CCC for spatial analysis using data rich and large scale frameworks. Browse Regional Press Release: http://www.europlat.org/global-connectivity-constraint-computing-market.htm Data Accumulation Complications in CCC Need to be Resolved Soon  One of the key restrictions on the global connectivity constraint computing market currently, is the increasing complexity of computing due to the formation of high volume and multiple data sets. The CCC modeling techniques, while useful in solving several issues, itself required the use of multiple data sets. This can lead to the accumulation of data sets that are non-compatible and can seriously hinder the automation process. At the same time, the global connectivity constraint computing market is also hindered by the expensive nature of model implementation, as real time data crunching and CCC modeling is certainly a costly affair at the moment. "While these issues are likely to be resolved over the coming years, players in the global connectivity constraint computing market can also look forward to gaining several opportunities in terms of constraint inclusions. The inclusion of proper constraint programming approaches can help resolve the issues visible in the use of this modeling in connected wildlife corridors. Additionally, the global connectivity constraint computing market is also expected to benefit vastly from the increasing scope of application of CCC in urban planning," adds the analyst. The information presented in this review is based on a Transparency Market Research report, titled, "Connectivity Constraint Computing Market (Applications - Ecosystem and Healthcare Management System (Wildlife Corridor & Ecosystem Designing and Public Health Surveillance), Social Management (Biological Mapping, Social Media Analytics), Logistic and Other Network Designing, and Security) - Global Industry Analysis, Trend, Size, Share and Forecast, 2016 - 2024."

Wonderland Mall, originally named Wonderland Center, sat on Plymouth and Middlebelt (or Middle Belt) roads in Livonia, Michigan. The 74 acre site, dual level facility was opened in August 1959, designed by Louis G. Redstone. The 1959 mall roster included Zuieback's Suburban, Marianne's, Winkelman's, Lerner Shops, Kinney Shoes, Leib Brothers, Singer Sewing Center, Hughes & Hatcher apparel, Rafter's Restaurant, F.W. Woolworth and S.S. Kresge 5 & 10s and Wrigley's and Food Fair supermarkets. It was originally an outdoor mall, before being enclosed in 1986, and then being reopened as Wonderland Mall. An expansion of the mall started in 1989, when a 129,000 square foot, 1 level extension was built for a Target and a 6-screen movie theater. Over the next several years, many popular chains filled the mall, including Office Max, Old Navy, and Bath & Body Works. An entertainment wing was opened in 1997, which featured Jeepers!, a family restaurant and animated indoor amusement part. The mall's food court expanded and was renamed Boardwalk Cafes. After some of its main anchor stores vacated, Wonderland Mall closed in early 2003, with only Dunham's, Office Max and Target open, with exterior entrances.  By 2007, after much debate, a Wal-Mart SuperCenter was opened where Wonderland Mall once stood. The Wal-Mart became an anchor for the Wonderland Village, which opened in 2007, as a strip mall, including Chili's, Potbelly, LA Fitness and Target. You can actually still see the Wonderland Mall website (last updated in 2000, it seems) right here. Memories of Wonderland Mall There are many memories in forums and blogs online about Wonderland. For many who grew up in the area, it was a childhood haven. I used to live in the neighborhood right behind there. I remember when it was open and then when they closed it. You had to walk on boards (for what seemed like a year) from store to store while they enclosed it. I never understood why they didn't start w/ a floor first. In my teens I worked at the Foot Locker and Wilson's Leather. I'm glad they finally closed it, it had been going downhill for such a long time. - Anonymous Anyone remember the kiddie rides on the Plymouth Road side of the parking lot? I remember them being there all summer, with 10 cents rides on Wednesday's. My mom is claiming that to be a distorted childhood memory and that the rides were only there on select weekends. - Anonymous My Grandfather Joseph Thompson ran the kid rides at Wonderland mall!!! He also played Santa at Christmas time even though he was very skinny!!!!! - Steven Seiler I lived in Ypsilanti when Wonderland was in "full bloom" My family and I drove over to eat some kind of great corn beef meal. In the ensuing years, I lived in FL and recently moved to Livonia. The only thing recognizable is the sign saying it is Wonderland. I am glad it is being utilized but I still have great memories. - Anonymous I remember going to "the Shoe tree" ca. 1963 with my folks, getting fitted for shoes by the clerk. The centerpiece display was a three-dimensional tree, with shoe styles arranged on little shelves. and the Marshall Fredericks sculptures, before they enclosed the mall. My grandparents shopped at Monkey Wards there. - 56packman Wonderland Mall was prominent in my childhood. School clothes shopping at Wards was an annual event. My sister and I would distract my mom when we passed Winkelmans because they only had one chair near the dressing room! This is all when it was open air! - DetroitTeacher I spent a great deal of my childhood at Wonderland Mall. My dad owned the discount drug store (Mark Down) that was located in the Marketplace, and I worked there helping him out. We used to eat at Smart Alex and Big Boy, and yes, there was a Kresge there. The stores I remember: Wards, Kresge, K-B Toys, Baskin Robbins, an ophthalmologist''s office, a pet store, an art store (next to Mark Down), and a music store, among others. And I remember the monkeys. - Julie S. There was a Spaghetti Company restaurant at the Wonderland Mall from 1977 to about 1981, but it did not have a train motif. When it first opened, it was probably the most popular restaurant in the Detroit area for awhile. Every day of the week there was at least an hour wait to be seated, and this was a big restaurant. There were 3 different dining rooms and a bar with entertainment. The place had to seat at least 300 people. - Steve B. I grew up right near Wonderland Mall. I can assure you that the mall had both a Kresges AND a Woolworths. I believe that the Kresges closed first, probably around 1982, definitely before the mall was enclosed. The Kresges location, if my memory serves me correctly, became a Designer Depot. I went to Catholic schools and had to wear white blouses, and my mom stocked up on them at Designer Depot! As for the theaters, I am fairly certain that the existing location (which was the AMC theaters) is not the original location. - Shannon I saw a quite a few movies there as a teenager, I remember the mall vividly when it was open air and when it was later enclosed and a giant food court added along with the movie theatre. Yes there was a Kresge and Woolworth store, along with Montgomery Ward, and lots of smaller stores (I vaugely recall Federals, but was too young to really remember it well). I remember the mall fondly as a child going to the annual Livonia Jaycees Spring Carnival which was always held around Memorial Day weekend in the Plymouth Road parking area near Montgomery Ward. This carnival ran there until around 1984, then was moved to nearby Detroit Race Course at Middlebelt and I-96. - Chris H.

For 2015, the global connectivity constraint computing market was dominated by the names Microsoft Corporation, Google, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. As per a research report published by Transparency Market Research, the global connectivity constraint computing market holds a higher concentration of players in North America than other regions. Asia Pacific, which was the smaller market in 2015, is expected to show a meteoric growth rate due to its booming IT industry and increasing scope of application for connectivity constraint computing due to high rate of urbanization. The demand for connectivity constraint computing is also expected to be high in regions that are planning for ecosystem management and wildlife corridor planning. The MEA region is likely to gain momentum in infrastructural development, spurring the demand for CCC modeling. The global connectivity constraint computing market is expected to expand at a meteoric CAGR of 58.4% within a forecast period from 2016 to 2024. While its expected evaluation for the end of 2016 is expected to be US$177.8 mn, the phenomenal growth rate is expected to have the market reach US$7.03 bn by the end of 2024.

Human operators, regardless of skill, are still prone to a certain minimal level of errors, especially in the massive data sets that are being crunched in modern times. The dynamic nature of data structures calls for the use of connectivity constraint computing and other artificial computing methods, that essentially, minimize or even negate the scope of error, as well as the overall time taken for the processes, through fast and iterative computing. This is becoming a highly crucial need for end users when faced with the staggering data volumes that need to be processed without any bias, which thus forms the key driver for the global connectivity constraint computing market," states a TMR analyst. Other factors promoting the growth of the global connectivity constraint computing market include the growing need for process automation in terms of improvement of quality in data accumulation and maintenance functions, and the growing need for CCC for spatial analysis using data rich and large scale frameworks. Browse Regional Press Release: http://www.europlat.org/global-connectivity-constraint-computing-market.htm Data Accumulation Complications in CCC Need to be Resolved Soon  One of the key restrictions on the global connectivity constraint computing market currently, is the increasing complexity of computing due to the formation of high volume and multiple data sets. The CCC modeling techniques, while useful in solving several issues, itself required the use of multiple data sets. This can lead to the accumulation of data sets that are non-compatible and can seriously hinder the automation process. At the same time, the global connectivity constraint computing market is also hindered by the expensive nature of model implementation, as real time data crunching and CCC modeling is certainly a costly affair at the moment. "While these issues are likely to be resolved over the coming years, players in the global connectivity constraint computing market can also look forward to gaining several opportunities in terms of constraint inclusions. The inclusion of proper constraint programming approaches can help resolve the issues visible in the use of this modeling in connected wildlife corridors. Additionally, the global connectivity constraint computing market is also expected to benefit vastly from the increasing scope of application of CCC in urban planning," adds the analyst.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. Police leading a massive manhunt for the suspected killer of an Orlando officer on Wednesday collected hundreds of tips and announced the arrests of two people who allegedly aided the fugitive, promising to reward anyone who turns him in, and punish anyone who helps him hide. Court records show that Markeith Loyd's niece, 27-year-old Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested on an accessory charge Wednesday, a day after the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, Zarghee Mayan, was arrested on the same charge. Mayan's arrest affidavit said Smith-Loyd collected money from him to give to her uncle in the days after the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in mid-December. Smith-Loyd's affidavit says she contacted deputies after the ex-girlfriend's murder and promised to help them find her uncle if they first told her whether a firearm had been recovered from the murder scene. Then she stopped cooperating even as she contacted others on her uncle's behalf, the affidavit said. Mayan is accused of supplying restaurant food to his former co-worker, driving him around and offering him money, despite knowing he was wanted in the slaying his pregnant ex-girlfriend, the affidavit said. "Mayan did so with the intent that Markeith Demangzlo Loyd avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial or punishment," the arrest affidavit said. Mayan told authorities his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was fatally shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they embraced, according to his arrest affidavit. During another encounter, right after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed at Mayan and said, "'Drive me or I will kill you, I just did something real bad,'" the affidavit said. Mayan said he drove Loyd to several locations, including the home of Loyd's estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he only walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. The 41-year-old ex-convict has been the focus of a massive manhunt involving hundreds of officers and deputies since Monday's shooting. More than 500 tips have come in from the public, which authorities believe may be particularly important, since others may be helping him hide. "If you know where he is at and you call us 3 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we will have people prepared to dispatch and go capture him," said Barb Bergin, executive director of the local Crimeline. Orlando Police Chief John Mina, meanwhile has warned that anyone helping Loyd "will be put behind bars and brought to justice as well." Mayan, 33, was arrested Tuesday by Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies on a charge of accessory after the fact. Jail records show no bond had been set, and court records showed no name of a defense attorney listed for him. Mina said federal, state and local authorities were taking part in the manhunt. Mina wouldn't give details about search tactics but he said law enforcement agencies in Florida and around the nation are on alert. "There are many things going on behind the scenes that our community is not aware of and that we are not at liberty to discuss," Mina said. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit; among them was a sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

Having seen some of America's largest companies, including General Motors Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp, bluntly and publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter, many others are worried they may be his next target — especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have had US job cuts or price increases for consumers. “Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US without retribution or consequence is WRONG!” Trump, who assumes office on Jan 20, tweeted in December. Trump campaigned on an “America First”" anti-globalisation platform that promised the return of thousands of US manufacturing jobs to economically depressed areas. That nationalist rhetoric and Trump's willingness to use his Twitter account as a cudgel has so rattled some companies that they are putting on hold mergers and acquisitions that may involve significant job cuts or moving production or tax domicile abroad, out of fear that such deals could be seen as “unpatriotic,” several top Wall Street bankers said. Bermuda-based White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd had been in talks to sell itself in a transaction that would have been structured as an inversion — where a US-based buyer would move its tax domicile overseas. However, the deal fell apart after the November election partly because potential buyers worried that leaving the US tax home would be seen as “anti-American,” three people with knowledge of the matter said. Potential buyers also found the target less attractive because of the likelihood of lower US corporate taxes under the Trump administration, the people said. Representatives of the US$3.8 billion (RM16.99 billion) company declined to comment. At least two other insurance deals have also fallen apart since the election for similar reasons, said the people, who declined to elaborate and asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Trump's aggressive anti-China rhetoric has also given some companies pause. James Park, chief executive of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit Inc, said he expects all companies that have significant manufacturing operations in China, including his own firm, to prepare contingency plans. Trump has threatened to hit China and Mexico with high tariffs and named vocal China critic Peter Navarro to lead a new White House office overseeing US trade policy. “Whether it’s taking higher costs into account or operationally preparing for moving manufacturing (out of China), companies are thinking about what to do,” Park said in an interview. Watching Trump's tweets Companies are also beefing up their Twitter monitoring for any Trump tweets that could affect them and engaging public relations firms for advice on potential lines of attack and how to respond if they were to come, several US chief executives as well as half a dozen corporate advisers told Reuters. “Back in December the board was already asking questions: 'What’s the plan in terms of what happens if he comes after us, are we ready? The board is asking us if we have a PR firm at the ready, if we have a person monitoring his Twitter,” said a top executive at a large US defence contractor. “Our plan is to not get into a fight, and concede immediately. The reality is that we're trying to stay below the radar,” the executive said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Since his election in November, Trump has ramped up criticism of companies from Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and GM, to United Tech and Rexnord Corp over manufacturing in Mexico for US consumers or moving US jobs abroad. Trump also slammed Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co for what he called "out of control" costs on their weapons programmes. Both Lockheed and Boeing have said they will work to drive down costs of the programmes, while Ford scrapped plans to build a US$1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and United Tech's Carrier unit is keeping half of the 2,100 US jobs it was to shift to Mexico. Government relations and public relations advisers say they have received a number of calls from companies wanting help in assessing if they have any red flags that could draw Trump's ire. Advisers say these potentially include outsourcing of manufacturing, consumer price increases and lower tax rates than peer companies. “We have literally had about a dozen clients ask us how they should be thinking about this in the last few weeks,” said George Sard, chairman and CEO of strategic communications firm Sard Verbinnen & Co, adding that he is seeing concern from companies in a wide range of industries. “The week after the election it was non-stop meetings and conference calls and analysis,” said Kent Jarrell, crisis and litigation communication expert at APCO Worldwide. “It's almost like a whole new Trump practice is developing.” Corporate leaders, say the advisers, can no longer focus only on maximising shareholder value; they must now also weigh national interest. “CEOs are talking to their boards saying we've got to be viewed pro-America. If something is more on the margin — like layoffs, or moving manufacturing, then they are not going to do it,” said one Fortune 500 CEO, who said he had spoken with other US companies. Taking a page from Trump playbook Sard, of Sard Verbinnen & Co, said that while companies are well advised not to get into a Twitter war with Trump, his firm is advising clients to “learn from his playbook” and be prepared to communicate directly with shareholders, employees, and customers through blogs and social media. There is already evidence that companies are quickly adjusting to the new Trump era. Firms have been more vocal in publicising job creation and they have sometimes let Trump claim credit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the No. 3 automaker in the United States, announced plans on Sunday to create 2,000 US jobs. The timing was partly influenced by CEO Sergio Marchionne's desire to get the news out ahead of any possible criticism from Trump for the automaker's overseas manufacturing, a person familiar with the company's thinking said. Trump has in the past few weeks attacked FCA's two Detroit rivals, as well as Japan-based Toyota, for their manufacturing operations in Mexico and threatened to impose stiff border taxes on any imports. In December, SoftBank Group Corp, majority owner of Sprint Corp, unveiled a US$50 billion US investment at the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump and SoftBank head Masayoshi Son made the announcement together, and Trump later tweeted: “He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” “You never want to be against the president — especially not one as vocal as (Trump),” the Fortune 500 CEO said.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) By Stephanie Allen Staff Writer Suspect in cop killing remains elusive; funerals for victims planned. Privacy Policy The suspect in the fatal shooting of Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton remains elusive, even as hundreds of tips have come in and law enforcement from local, state and federal agencies work nonstop to find him. Officials are hoping a reward of $100,000 — increased from $60,000 on Monday — will be enough of a lure to help them capture Markeith Loyd, a felon who is accused of killing Clayton on Monday outside a Wal-Mart on Princeton Street at John Young Parkway. "We'll get him," Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Tuesday. "It's only a matter of time." PICTURE GALLERY: An Orlando police officer was shot on Princeton Street, just west of John Young Parkway. An Orange County deputy died in a traffic crash during the manhunt for the suspect. At a news conference with Mina and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings on Tuesday, Barb Bergin, the executive director of Crimeline, wanted to make one thing clear: If you provide information, you will not be identified, and anonymous callers are still eligible for the reward. "Please understand, when we say anonymous, they are truly anonymous," Bergin said. "We will not identify you. We just need to know where he's at so that no one else is hurt." More than 300 tips have come in since the Monday morning shooting, Bergin said. In a typical month, the crime line usually gets 1,000. Two tips led law-enforcement officers and SWAT members to south Lake County on Tuesday.

(David Harris) Orange County sheriff's deputies and SWAT members conducted a knock-and-talk early Tuesday at a residence in the Tradd's Landing neighborhood on U.S. 27, south of Clermont. The woman at the residence consented to a full search of her property with SWAT. Loyd was not there. "The neighborhood [was] saturated with undercover officers" for several hours, said Lt. John Herrell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's office. On Tuesday evening, law enforcement searched a house in the Groveland area, just west of Clermont, with that owner's consent. Again, there was no sign of Loyd. Funerals are being planned for Clayton and Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a crash just two hours after Clayton was shot while he was responding to the incident.

Clayton's funeral service is at 2 p.m. Saturday at the same church. A GoFundMe page has been set up for Clayton's family, police confirmed. By Tuesday evening, the fund had raised more than $20,000. Authorities have been searching for Loyd, 41, since Dec. 13, when his pregnant ex-girlfriend, 24-year-old Sade Dixon, was shot and killed on her doorstep. Loyd also is accused of shooting and injuring Dixon's brother when he ran to help her. "There have been times when we just missed him," Demings said.

I wouldn't have done anything differently myself." Loyd fled after the shooting but was soon spotted by an Orange County sheriff's deputy near Pine Hills Road and North Lane, officials said. Loyd fired at least once at the deputy, striking his cruiser, and then carjacked a woman and sped away, according to police. He eventually ditched the car at an apartment complex off Cinderlane Parkway in the Rosemont area of Orlando. That complex, where police focused their search efforts most of Monday, was mostly quiet and empty Tuesday afternoon. Maintenance crews were seen repairing boarded-up doors and windows that had been damaged by a SWAT team. An armed security guard was thwarting media attempts to get on the property.

He said he left home Monday shortly after the SWAT team descend on the complex and came back hours later to find his door was one of more than a handful that had been boarded up. The frame was busted and Orlando fire crews were called to his unit Tuesday morning after the gas smell made a maintenance man dizzy. Mike said he never gave police permission to go inside -- or break his door -- but found a copy of a search warrant inside that mentioned Loyd was seen walking past the door. "I don't know where this cat is," Mike said. "I just want my house fixed back up." Detectives also are looking for people who have helped Loyd elude law enforcement and they're "fairly certain" they've identified a few, Demings said. As the search for Loyd continues, Mina said that if anyone sees a large police presence, they should avoid it. He would not say what areas officers are focusing on or if investigators think Loyd is still in Central Florida. "We want the community to know it's safe to go about their day-to-day activities," Mina said at the news conference.

Along with thousands of other girls, she was sold through what amounts to an online brothel called Backpage. It dominates the online sex trade and is implicated in almost three-quarters of the reports of child trafficking in the United States. Yet this week offers a moment to celebrate. Under political and legal pressure, Backpage on Monday closed its “adult” advertising section, used to peddle women and children for sex. There’s also an overdue effort to hold its executives criminally and civilly liable. “There’s been a lot of progress,” notes Ms. Graves, who eventually escaped her pimp — but only after he gouged her face with a potato peeler and stomped on her, breaking her jaw. She was cheering this week as a Senate subcommittee held hearings on Backpage and discussed tightening the law on websites like it. I’ve been writing about sex trafficking since the 1990s, because at its worst it’s an echo of slavery. It’s also a topic rife with hypocrisy. We denounced the Catholic Church and Penn State for tolerating child sexual abuse, but we have collectively tolerated websites like Backpage that sell children for sex. That has steadily been changing. Some credit card companies have stopped processing payments for ads in Backpage, undermining its business model. Kamala Harris, then California’s attorney general and now its new senator, filed criminal charges in December against Backpage executives, with arraignment scheduled for this month. Civil suits in Washington state against Backpage are proceeding. A film about trafficking, “I Am Jane Doe,” opens in theaters next month and shines a light on Backpage as “the Walmart of human trafficking.” Most important, a Senate subcommittee, led by Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, has done outstanding work investigating Backpage and showing how it achieved a valuation of more than a half-billion dollars by working with human traffickers. A devastating new subcommittee report shows that the company even helps pimps by deleting hints that a girl is underage. If a pimp tries to post an ad for a “Lolita,” “little girl,” “schoolgirl” or “amber alert,” those terms are automatically stripped from the ad — but it is still posted, so the girl will still be sold for sex. One Backpage document indicated that by 2010, more than 70 percent of its ads in the adult section were being edited like that, suggesting that the company was far more involved in manipulating content than it ever let on. Sure, some people selling sex are adults acting on their own to make money, and that’s not a concern of mine. If Backpage carefully verified names and ages, I’d be fine with that. But Backpage has more stringent rules for selling a dog than for selling a kid. I’ve written repeatedly about Backpage over the years because the stories haunt me. My first column about Backpage involved a 13-year-old girl whom I called Baby Face. Her pimp had kicked her down a stairwell for trying to flee, and she was hurting and bleeding and couldn’t bear another rape, but her pimp sold her on Backpage anyway. He took her to an apartment building and waited outside after telling her which apartment to go to. Terrified and desperate, Baby Face instead pounded on the door of a different apartment. When a surprised woman answered, Baby Face asked for a phone and called her mom and then 911. Her pimp went to prison, but Backpage still profited from the sale, as it always does. Look, human trafficking is a complicated issue. If Backpage is put out of business, other websites may fill the void and, indeed, when Backpage closed its adult section, ads selling sex immediately moved over to the site’s dating section. We need Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act to clarify that companies such as Backpage aren’t protected when they permit pimps to sell kids on their websites. There is a mounting bipartisan effort to pass such an amendment, and I hope President-elect Donald Trump will show leadership on this as well. We also need local police departments and prosecutors to go after pimps and johns, rather than sometimes targeting the children who are the victims. One mom, Nacole, told me how her 15-year-old daughter was sold for more than three months on Backpage. “How could such a horrific, morally bankrupt business model find success in America?” she asked at the Senate hearing. She said her daughter had been advertised on the website as a ‘Weekend Special.’ ” It’s too late to protect that girl, who is still struggling to recuperate. But when children are sold for sex online as weekend specials, they’re not the ones who should be ashamed. We all should be. Nicholas Kristof is a columnist for The New York Times.

Many of the new jobs that Amazon will create in the next 18 months will be at fulfillment centers currently being built. (Steve Ringman/The Seattle Times) The announcement by the Seattle retail giant comes amid pressure on the private sector by the incoming Trump administration to create jobs. Share story By Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter Amazon.com said it plans to add 100,000 full-time U.S. employees to its ranks over the next 18 months, a move that comes amid pressure on the private sector by the incoming Trump administration to create jobs. Seattle-based Amazon said Thursday that by 2018 it plans to have more than 280,000 full-time U.S. employees, compared with 180,000 at the end of 2016. The jobs cover a wide range of disciplines, from developers and engineers who work on cloud computing to the burgeoning armies of lower-paid warehouse operators who handle millions of packages in states like Texas, California, Florida and the Midwest. The company also highlighted its role as a platform for third-party providers that use its online site to sell wares and also create jobs, as well as a revenue generator for contractors who sign up with the e-commerce giant to deliver packages. Marketplace, Amazon’s online platform for third-party merchants, supports 300,000 jobs in the U.S., the company said. Related stories Amazon’s robot army grows by 50 percent Amazon’s declining use of temps hurts staffing company TrueBlue Amazon to hire 3,000 seasonal workers in state, 120,000 nationwide   “Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it’s created hundreds of thousands of American jobs. These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley — they’re in our customer-service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “We plan to add another 100,000 new Amazonians across the company over the next 18 months as we open new fulfillment centers, and continue to invent in areas like cloud technology, machine learning and advanced logistics,” Bezos said. A hiring binge by Amazon is nothing new: The company has grown dramatically since its humble origins as an online bookstore, adding 150,000 U.S. jobs since 2011. It is well on its way to becoming the second-largest employer among the Fortune 500, after archrival Wal-Mart. As of last fall, Amazon had 306,800 workers around the world, not including temporary hires and contractors. The bulk of these jobs are in warehouses and other logistics activities, but highly paid tech and corporate jobs have been growing quickly too. According to a paper released Thursday by the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank, Amazon last year became the fastest among U.S. companies to reach the 300,000-worker milestone. What took General Motors 32 years, and AT&T 27 years, Amazon did in 20. In Seattle, where Thursday it advertised more than 9,000 jobs, the company has transformed not only the labor market but the urban landscape. Amazon said Thursday it had more than 40,000 employees in Washington. But the disclosure of its massive, near-term full-time job projections in the U.S. is novel for the e-commerce juggernaut. It seems to fit within the context in which President-elect Donald Trump lambastes, often via Twitter, companies that take jobs out of the U.S. and praises those companies that create them. Earlier this week, Trump met with Jack Ma, CEO of Alibaba, Amazon’s China-based rival.According to media reports, they discussed how Alibaba can help entrepreneurs in the U.S. create jobs by exporting products to Asia. In a news conference Wednesday, Trump — who has previously criticized Amazon and Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post — vowed to be the biggest job producer “God ever created.” Amazon’s growth contrasts with a big retrenchment among major brick-and-mortar-based retailers such as Macy’s, which have seen their business buffeted by the growth of the Seattle e-commerce giant. The job announcement didn’t appease some longtime critics of Amazon who drew a direct connection between Amazon’s gain and traditional retailers’ losses. (Amazon has sought to deflect such criticism by highlighting how its services allow “millions” of independent authors, merchants and software developers to make a living.) The nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance says the tech firm has destroyed more jobs in the wider retail sector than it has managed to create in its warehouses. “What Amazon’s announcement really shows is how fast the company is growing, and that’s bad news for U.S. workers, who stand to lose more than they gain as Amazon increasingly dominates commerce,” ILSR co-director Stacy Mitchell said in a statement. Amazon shares rose 1.83 percent after the announcement, closing at $813.64. Federal and state officials cheered Amazon’s news. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on Twitter that many Amazon jobs will come to the Lone Star State. The press team of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called it “great news” for Kentucky jobs via Twitter, too. Amazon, like other U.S. retailers, announces each year how many seasonal workers it hires during the holiday season. The shopping frenzy that concluded in December saw a surge of 120,000 temporary workers, a sizable fraction of whom were expected to stay on as full-timers. The company also talks about jobs at a local level when it’s opening fulfillment centers. Its most similar recent statement about American jobs came in July 2013, when the company said it was creating 5,000 new full-time jobs across its warehouse network in the U.S. Thursday’s announcement has more in common with how Amazon touts its job-creating potential in Europe, a region where the company is dealing with tax and antitrust investigations, suspicious governments and hostile unions. In early 2016, Amazon trumpeted its “new job creation record” of 10,000 permanent new jobs in the Old World the previous year, promising “several thousand” more across a wide range of operations. Amazon’s louder tune underscores how the new U.S. administration, led by a boss given to mercurial blasts, will bring new political-risk challenges to corporate America. Blazing tweets from the president-elect singling out companies from GM to Boeing have swung stocks and caused fretting in board rooms. Trump’s internet-conveyed wrath is particularly focused on companies he perceives as exporting U.S. jobs, a common theme during his presidential campaign. Trump, who is not scheduled to occupy the White House until the end of next week, hasn’t hesitated to take credit for some corporations’ job-creating moves. Last month, Trump claimed the CEO of Japan’s SoftBank told him the company’s plan to invest $50 billion in the U.S. wouldn’t have happened “had we (Trump) not won the election!” In Amazon’s case, the political waters of the Trump era are further muddied by public spats between Trump and Bezos, the CEO. During the campaign, Trump complained about Amazon having a “huge antitrust problem.” He also accused Bezos of buying The Washington Post, which aggressively covered Trump, to help Amazon avoid taxes. Moreover, Trump campaigned against globalization, the same phenomenon that helped Amazon quickly become a world empire. When Trump won, Amazon shares took a hit, while the wider market rallied. Things appear calmer now. Bezos and other tech leaders in December attended a meeting with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York. Bezos called the event “very productive.” In a statement, he said he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the country, in all sectors, not just tech — agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing — everywhere.” Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Baird, wrote in a note that Amazon’s announcement shows that the company will continue to invest aggressively in retail, media, technology and logistics rather than in padding its profits. While the timing and the details offered by Amazon may gain some “political capital” with the new administration, it’s unlikely that it means a shift of employment from Amazon’s international operations toward the U.S., Sebastian wrote. “We expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well,” he wrote.

The woman had accepted a ride from a stranger to go to Walmart. According to police, she became afraid when the male, later identified as Juan Aguilar, instead drove her down a deserted county road and began to attempt to kiss and fondle her chest.  The woman was able to text her family for help, who later called 911. Aguilar faces up to nine years in prison and will be required to register as a sex offender.  "The Curry County Sheriff's Office deserves a lot of credit for this one," said Chief Deputy District Attorney, Brian Stover. "If not for the quick response, this incident could have been a lot worse."  Copyright 2017 KFDA.

[Orlando Police Department] ORLANDO — A fugitive who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot an Orlando police sergeant earlier this week, Orlando's police chief said Thursday. Related News/Archive Slain officer's widow donates tougher body armor to protect St. Petersburg officers 5 Months Ago Manhunt ongoing in Orlando police officer's fatal shooting; deputy killed in crash during search 6 Days Ago Man, woman accused of aiding fugitive wanted in Orlando officer's killing 4 Days Ago Investigators found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd that suggests Master Sgt. Debra Clayton returned fire after she was shot, but that a bulletproof vest protected the suspect, Orlando police Chief John Mina said. Clayton was killed Monday morning after approaching Loyd in the parking lot of a Walmart store. He was wanted at the time for the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend in mid-December. The fugitive shot Clayton several times, even when she was on the ground, the chief said. Police arrested a former supervisor at the fried-chicken restaurant where Loyd worked, an ex-girlfriend and a niece on Tuesday and Wednesday on charges of helping him in the weeks after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was fatally shot. Mina said they haven't been cooperative in locating him. "If there is anyone who is harboring, aiding, abetting him in any way, they will be arrested as we've seen with the past three arrests," Mina said. Hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 800 tips. The searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's door-to-door search of an Orlando apartment complex, and searchers have cast a broader net in central Florida, Mina said. The crime-tip service Crimeline is offering a $100,000 reward for a tip that leads to Loyd's arrest. "Anybody who makes a phone call is valuable to us at this point," said Barb Bergin, the local Crimeline's executive director. After Clayton was shot, many of her colleagues immediately joined the pursuit. Among them was sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who died when he was thrown from his motorcycle in an accident. Funerals were planned for Lewis for Friday and Clayton for Saturday.

Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it’s doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon’s past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart — the world’s largest retailer — employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon’s hiring appears to be accelerating. “We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon’s businesses, as well as management’s confidence in the long-term outlook,” he said. “The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses.” TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was “pleased to play a role” in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird’s Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some “political capital” in the timing and details of its announcement. “We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.,” he said. “Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well.” MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week , the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy’s moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. “The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry,” said economist Diane Swonk. ___ AP Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.

Pat Sutphin / Post Register file By LINDSEY JOHNSON ljohnson@postregister.com REXBURG —Rexburg is growing by the minute, at least that’s how it seems to Mayor Jerry Merrill. As the City Council prepares for another year, they have addressed a number of Rexburg’s developments, plans and projects. New potential business developments are in the works on the north end of town, Merrill said. He said empty buildings that once housed Wal-Mart, Kmart and CAL Ranch have businesses that have expressed interest in occupying the spaces and beginning development this year. “We have a good, high-quality workforce here and they’re looking forward to taking advantage of it,” Merrill said. Merrill said some retail businesses, call centers and other types of businesses could potentially move into the empty buildings. Some business owners have expressed interest in locations on Main Street, which is walking distance from Brigham Young University-Idaho. “We’re really trying to be proactive and getting some downtown development on track and done so that we’ve got more downtown space,” he said. “A lot of the businesses that are inquiring about Rexburg want space in the downtown area.” The mayor said parking is always an issue when making plans for large developments, and that it will be at the forefront of any plans the council makes. He said soccer fields and other sports parks have been built recently, and he is also interested in potentially building another family park facility in the south end of town, similar to the city’s Porter and Smith parks. Emergency preparedness Merrill gave an emergency preparedness report at a recent City Council meeting that includes plans in the case of a large-scale power outage in subzero temperatures. He said if residents feel unsafe staying in their homes during a power outage, they can dial 911, take shelter at Madison Memorial Hospital, City Hall or certain areas of the BYU-Idaho campus. Merrill said he has encouraged city officials to do all they can to ensure citizen safety during emergencies. “We are actually working with our local emergency preparedness officials to try and make sure we are ready in case we have some kind of disaster,” Merrill said. August eclipse Rexburg is one of the cities that has prime viewing of the Aug. 21 eclipse, according to NASA. “We are excited about the eclipse coming up,” he said. “We don’t really know how many people are going to show up and we’re trying to figure that out and get some kind of handle on it so we can be prepared.” Merrill said City Council members are working on making parking areas available to be used as camping grounds for visitors during the eclipse. He said another important factor in preparing for the eclipse is making sure there are enough restroom facilities, police officers and emergency services personnel on duty for the number of people in attendance. Airbnb and student housing Merrill said the council has not come to an agreement in regard to the city permitting individuals to acquire lodging through Airbnb. “It’ll be something we’re discussing further,” he said. Merrill also met with the BYU-Idaho Housing & Student Living Office on Wednesday to discuss construction of new housing facilities for single and married students at the university. “Everywhere you look, you see more apartment housing going up, and yet the housing (department) up at the university says we have a housing shortage,” he said. He said city officials will work to keep up with the need for housing as close to the university as possible without encroaching upon single-family housing. The university announced Monday that campus enrollment last year hit a record high with 32,747 students — a 6.5 percent increase over the 2015 campus enrollment of 30,744 students. (In September 2002, after the school’s first full-year as a four-year institution, 10,703 students were enrolled for the fall semester.) “It seems people want to come to BYU-Idaho and Rexburg more and more,” he said.

Baird’s Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some “political capital” in the timing and details of its announcement. “We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.,” he said. “Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well.” Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers in the US. Last week, the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy’s moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) NEW YORK — Amazon plans to hire 100,000 full time workers over the next 18 months, highlighting its ambitious expansion plans — and the sharp contrast the e-commerce powerhouse strikes against traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, many of which are cutting jobs and closing stores. Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it’s doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon’s past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart — the world’s largest retailer — employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon’s hiring appears to be accelerating. “We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon’s businesses, as well as management’s confidence in the long-term outlook,” he said. “The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses.” TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was “pleased to play a role” in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird’s Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some “political capital” in the timing and details of its announcement. “We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.,” he said. “Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well.” MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week, the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy’s moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. “The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry,” said economist Diane Swonk.

Get the latest news from The Morning Call on the Amazon Echo ALERT Local News Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka dead at age 73 Entertainment 'American Idol' finalist Colton Dixon, playing Winter Jam tour, finds 'Identity' The Winter Jam Tour concert comes to Reading The Winter Jam Tour concert comes to reading's Santander Center Thursday evening. The Winter Jam Tour concert comes to reading's Santander Center Thursday evening. John J. MoserContact ReporterOf The Morning Call When Colton Dixon, the skunk-mohawked piano-rocking finalist on the 11th season of "American Idol," was working on his upcoming third album, he came up with an unusual idea: make the disc a concept album. Not one of those cheesy 1970s discs that told a hackneyed story with a forced narrative in its music, but a work in which all the songs held together thematically. "I kind of like to write with a concept in mind," Dixon says in a phone call from Myrtle Beach, S.C., before his final concert before joining Winter Jam, contemporary Christian music's largest annual tour, which plays at Reading's Santander Arena at 7 p.m. Jan. 19. "Concept albums they don't really exist a lot anymore, just because it's such a singles market. People don't go out to Walmart to buy a full record, but I still kind of like doing it that way. I think you're able to kind of focus your songs on a grand, central idea or theme. "And I don't know, it just allows me to do more with branding and kind of make everything more cohesive that way." The disc, "Identity," is set for March release. The album's original title was "Autopsy," but it "scared my label to death," Dixon says, laughing. "So we switched to 'Identity,' which is probably a good choice." Rock The Universe Concert At Universal Orlando JOHN PARRA/GETTY IMAGES Colton Dixon will perform Jan. 19 at the Winter Jam in Reading. Colton Dixon will perform Jan. 19 at the Winter Jam in Reading. (JOHN PARRA/GETTY IMAGES) Dixon will perform its first single, "All That Matters," set for release Friday, at Winter Jam shows. Dixon, 25, says he feels that he's approached every disc he's done with a concept in mind — except perhaps his 2013 debut disc "A Messenger," with its Top 10 Christian chart single "You Are." "Just because I was so discombobulated, coming off of the TV show," he says with a laugh. He says he's had the idea for "Identity" for about a year. "I really just wanted to dive into people — you know, why we do what we do, why we think what we think and where we find our identity. What we find our identity in," he says. "That just kind of led me on this journey of mind, body and spirit, kind of diving into each of those. And there are going to be three sections on the record that are mind, body and spirit. "It's probably the most cohesive record I've ever done, front to back. So I'm really proud of it. I'm excited to see what you guys think." Dixon says "All That Matters" comes from a verse in the biblical book of Isaiah, comparing people in the world with being like grass and flowers. "The grass fades, the flower wither, but the word of the Lord stands forever," Dixon says. "And man, just really in the grand scheme of things, none of this matters — none of it — unless you're doing it for the Kingdom. Unless you're pursuing a relationship with the Lord. "I knew that deep down, but just hearing that from a fresh perspective kind of just ignited me again. So I wrote that song." The concept approach isn't the only thing about "Identity" that's a change, Dixon says. Some of the songs also represent stylistic explorations, he says. Dixon was known as a singer-songwriter on "Idol": he performed Switchfoot's "Only Hope," Coldplay's "Fix You" and Billy Joel's "Piano Man" (his was the season won by another singer-songwriter, Phillip Phillips). He considers himself more of a power-ballad rocker. But he says the new disc is more pop — "but it's pretty edgy as well. It's just a lot of fun. It's a very fun, upbeat record." "What was so funny was when I started, musically, I kind of wanted it to lean more … pretty rock, ethereal as well," he says. "And the more and more I wrote, the more and more I realized, 'You know what? This stuff actually kind of lends itself to be this.'" There are even a couple songs with "pretty heavy funk guitars," Dixon says. "I never in a million years thought that I would be doing that, but my band loves that kind of music, so they were really excited when I played it for them," he says with a laugh. "But it's just more fun. It's not as dramatic. It's just fun — I don't know how else to describe it." Dixon says he's always approached writing by letting the song go where it wants. "One thing I've always been about is never denying a song in the direction it should go," he says. "I don't want to ever be selfish and make a song fit inside what I want. I think God inspires me in the writing sessions and when a song kind of gravitates toward a certain genre or a certain sound, I just want to go there — even if it's a completely new territory for me. And that's what we did." After his debut disc, Dixon in 2014 released his sophomore album, "Anchor," which, like his debut, hit No. 1 on the Christian chart and produced two Top 10 Christian hits — "More of You" and "Through All Of It." Dixon says that disc "explored a few more sounds and brought in some newer, fresher ideas. ... I think back to some of my favorite bands and how they evolved over the years. I think it's really important to bridge the gap." Even his 2015 remix album "The Calm Before the Storm" had more of a theme to it than the usual remix disc, he says. "We knew it was going to be a little bit before another album, and my label was like, 'Hey, how would you feel about a remix album?'" he says. "And honestly, it kind of made me roll my eyes a little bit. I feel like so many people do remix albums. ... let's try to come up with something else." So Dixon did two EPs — "The Calm," which featured newly recorded versions of his biggest songs, and "The Storm," which had remixes and even one new song — in one package. "I wouldn't have been as excited if it was just a remix album," he says. "It's hard for me to get behind something that doesn't have much thought or much idea put to it." Working on a new album wasn't the only big moment for Dixon in 2016. For one, he got married to girlfriend Annie Coggeshall. "Marriage is awesome," he says. "I think the thing we both love is not having to say goodbye as often. She gets to come out on the road with me pretty much all the time. ... I never understood what people meant when they said, 'You're gonna be learning new stuff every day.' Man, that's like the truest statement I've ever heard in my life. I learn something new every day. But it's awesome." The marriage got attention when the couple told People magazine they practiced abstinence during their three-year courtship. "Honestly, it was a little weird to have that part of your life kind of out there for people to see and read, but the way it came about was so innocent and it wasn't forced at all. And that's honestly how I knew God was in it," he says. He says it came out during a chat about how special their wedding night was, "and without thinking about it, I was kind of, 'Well, you know, we saved ourselves for marriage. And without getting into detail, we were excited to explore that,'" he says with a laugh. "They were very intrigued by that ... and wanted to do a separate piece on that. And I was like, You know what? If we can be an example for somebody ... I'm sure a lot of people read that and make fun of us or roll their eyes or whatever, but I know it was the right thing to do. ... I think God definitely opened those doors." The other big moment of 2016 was Colton returning to the "American Idol" stage for its finale in April. It's worth noting Dixon was invited to be among the 48 former contestants on stage from the show's 15 years, even though he finished only seventh on his season. "I have no idea how all that works; I never did understand it," he says. "But I was honored to be asked back. All I do is say 'Thank you.' It was truly an honor to be there. "You just try and set the pace or set the example. And even when I was on the show, it was, like, 'All right. I'm just going to do me and I'm going to stick to what I know is right and just kill everyone with kindness regardless. ... And even coming back, I just want to keep the same thing. "I think that goes a long way. I'm not saying that's why they asked me back, but I know that goes a long way in whatever you do. You always want to be remembered as that person, other than the contrary. And I'm sure there were days I wanted to be the contrary," he says with a laugh. jmoser@mcall.com Twitter @johnjmoser 610-820-6722 WINTER JAM •What: Largest annual Christian music tour, featuring Crowder, Colton Dixon, Britt Nicole, Tenth Avenue North, Andy Mineo, Thousand Foot Krutch, Newsong, OBB, Sarah Reeves and Steve Malcolm, with an appearance by "Duck Dynasty" TV star Sadie Robertson and a message from evangelist Tony Nolan. •When: 7 p.m. Jan. 19 •Where: Santander Arena, 700 Penn St., Reading •How much: $10 general admission at the door; $39.99 VIP with early admission, premium seating, T-shirt, discount merchandise and Q-and-A session with artists •Info: 610-898-7469, www.jamtour.com, www.santander-arena.com Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Colton Dixon American Idol Coldplay Breaking Popular Obits E-NEWSPAPER Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds 30°

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The Latest on the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer (all times local): 3:50 p.m. Authorities say they believe the suspect who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he shot an Orlando police sergeant. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Thursday that searchers found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd and that led them to believe he was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday. Mina says the sergeant apparently hit Loyd with return fire, but that the vest protected him. He also says Loyd shot Clayton repeatedly, even when she was on the ground. Mina says hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 750 tips. He says the searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's search of an Orlando apartment complex when officers went door-to-door. ___ 4 a.m. Authorities are making good on promises to go after people they think helped a fugitive in the weeks before he was wanted in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. Markeith Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested Wednesday on an accessory charge. Later the same day, authorities arrested an ex-girlfriend of Loyd's: Jameis Slaughter, who also faces an accessory charge. And a day earlier, Zarghee Mayan, the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge. A manhunt for Loyd after Monday's fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton entered its fourth day Thursday. Smith-Loyd is accused of collecting money from Mayan to give to her uncle as deputies searched for him in the days after the slaying of another ex-girlfriend in mid-December.

An Illinois corporate tax credit program suspended earlier this summer amid a state budget crisis has since been offered to Amazon because of a previous commitment to the online retailer. Amazon announced its plans in August for a Joliet warehouse that will create 1,000 full-time jobs when it opens. The 500,000-square-foot fulfillment center is its first in Illinois. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren,File) NEW YORK (AP) – Amazon plans to hire 100,000 full time workers over the next 18 months, highlighting its ambitious expansion plans – and the sharp contrast the e-commerce powerhouse strikes against traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, many of which are cutting jobs and closing stores. Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it’s doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon’s past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart – the world’s largest retailer – employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon’s hiring appears to be accelerating. “We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon’s businesses, as well as management’s confidence in the long-term outlook,” he said. “The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses.” TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was “pleased to play a role” in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird’s Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some “political capital” in the timing and details of its announcement. “We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.,” he said. “Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well.” MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week, the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy’s moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. “The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry,” said economist Diane Swonk.

(AP) — The Latest on the fatal shooting of an Orlando police officer (all times local): 3:50 p.m. Authorities say they believe the suspect who is the focus of a four-day manhunt was wearing a bulletproof vest when he shot an Orlando police sergeant. FILE - This undated photo provided by the Orlando Police Department shows Markeith Loyd. Loyd is wanted for killing an Orlando police officer outside a Wal-Mart in Orlando, Fla., Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. (Orlando Police Department via AP, File) Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Thursday that searchers found clothing belonging to 41-year-old Markeith Loyd and that led them to believe he was wearing a bulletproof vest when he fatally shot Master Sgt. Debra Clayton on Monday. Mina says the sergeant apparently hit Loyd with return fire, but that the vest protected him. He also says Loyd shot Clayton repeatedly, even when she was on the ground. Mina says hundreds of deputies and officers have searched almost 100 places since Monday, and they've received more than 750 tips. He says the searches have been lower-profile compared to Monday's search of an Orlando apartment complex when officers went door-to-door. ___ 4 a.m. Authorities are making good on promises to go after people they think helped a fugitive in the weeks before he was wanted in the fatal shooting of an Orlando police sergeant. Markeith Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested Wednesday on an accessory charge. Later the same day, authorities arrested an ex-girlfriend of Loyd's: Jameis Slaughter, who also faces an accessory charge. And a day earlier, Zarghee Mayan, the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge. A manhunt for Loyd after Monday's fatal shooting of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton entered its fourth day Thursday. Smith-Loyd is accused of collecting money from Mayan to give to her uncle as deputies searched for him in the days after the slaying of another ex-girlfriend in mid-December.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Central Illinois man sues over his July 4 flag-burning arrest Thursday Jan 12, 2017 at 3:04 PM Jan 12, 2017 at 4:49 PM By Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press   CHICAGO — A 22-year-old central Illinois man who was arrested and detained after posting online pictures of himself burning an American flag has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have the state's flag desecration law declared unconstitutional. Such state laws are already invalid after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled separately, in 1989 and 1990, that flag burning and other forms of damage are constitutionally protected free speech. However, dozens of states still have the laws. Police in Urbana used Illinois' flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott on July 4 of last year. He said he carefully planned his demonstration to protest racial discrimination, poverty and other injustices, and then posted six photographs of his actions on Facebook. The posts, which generated hundreds of comments, led police officers to arrest Mellott while he worked at Wal-Mart and detain him for several hours. He was released without being charged. Mellott, who is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, discussed the lawsuit at a news conference in Champaign on Thursday, a day after the lawsuit was filed. "Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism," Mellott said, according to a copy of his remarks. "And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty." Arrests for flag desecration are rare. Still, experts say states have been reluctant to repeal such laws either because it's politically unpalatable or it hasn't been a priority. About 40 states have flag desecration laws and only a handful have changed them. Wisconsin's flag desecration law was knocked down by the state Supreme Court in the 1990s and removed. Missouri's was repealed effective this month, after a long court battle prompted by a similar lawsuit. President-elect Donald Trump recently said that anyone who burns an American flag should face "consequences," such as jail or a loss of citizenship, despite the Supreme Court determinations. The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday, names several police officers. Urbana police have said they arrested Mellott to protect him from possible backlash from the online posts. An Urbana Police Department spokesman did not return a message seeking comment. An attorney for the ACLU said one of their main goals is to provide clarity for authorities. "It's very clear that this law is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that in the future, Illinois law enforcement officers know that they cannot arrest people under this statute," ACLU attorney Rebecca Glenberg said. Mellott also seeks unspecified damages.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Place an Ad Commenting Rules Archives Marketplace Cars Homes Classifieds Newspaper Ads Sections News State Government Sports The Voice Local Entertainment Information Social Media Directory E-edition Today's Front Page Text Alerts Calendar Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Designed to be a warning against the perils of capitalism, the board game Monopoly has proven to be a success instead. Its enduring popularity— and updated editions—have kept the game both living and profitable. What’s the secret to its success? If you’re playing by the rules so that the game doesn’t last forever, it’s about being the first to quickly corner the market in various neighborhoods throughout the board—and ideally controlling the whole thing. The ups and downs along the way create a thrill. But since the money is fake, those downturns don’t create the same fear that you might see watching your retirement account fluctuating in value. But that’s not the only way the real world is different. Despite the popularity of the board game, it’s impossible to create a monopoly in real life just from the private sector. It takes the government to get involved. Consider a utility company. You probably have one provider for electricity at your home. That’s by regulation. Government clamped down on utilities to prevent a coal plant in every neighborhood. That kind of top-down one-size-fits-all approach made sense with electricity generation. But there’s still more than one utility company in the country. There are several regional firms. There’s no single company delivering a product or service to everyone. There used to be one telephone company, but the government ordered its breakup. After all, if it takes a government to create a monopoly, it has the same power to destroy it. Even governments are split between federal, state and local. It’s impossible to create a monopoly on the free market because of competition. If one firm is dominating business and does something to draw the ire of customers, a competitor can step in with better service or better pricing to make a profit as well. If there’s only one company and it’s making money hand over fist, others will be attracted to the potential profits and set up shop. That’s capitalism at work. Yet despite this fact, investors are pricing Amazon (AMZN) as though it were already a monopoly. And as a result, Mr. Market is pricing retail stocks as though they were already going out of business. I get it. It’s hard to look at a company like Sears Holding (SHLD) and not see the inevitable bankruptcy and failure. But Sears shouldn’t have been driven into the ground by Amazon. It should have been driven into the ground by Target (TGT) or Wal-Mart (WMT). Sears has a long history, going back to a mail-order catalogue over 100 years ago, selling items to families across the country and offering everything from clothing to food to firearms and housing. It shifted that business to mall storefronts over time. It’s failed to move past the now-declining mall model. So it’s clear that some retailers are still on their way out—but most can continue to scrape along. On the flip side, Amazon is trading as though it has nowhere to go but up. An analyst recently posted a theoretical valuation for what the company would look like with a market cap of $1 trillion dollars. I don’t see that happening anytime soon. After all, a tree grows toward the sun but not to the sun. There are limits to growth. But here’s the thing: Amazon’s profits aren’t just low, they’re non-existent. Margins are thin, and while the company has pumped up the revenue with services like Amazon Prime, the company trades at 182 times earnings. That’s cheap when you consider that it’s traded as high as 700 times earnings. The biggest problem with Amazon isn’t its stock or its valuation. It’s the fact that shareholders don’t seem to have much of a say in what’s going on. Sure, they’ve had a great ride—shares are up nearly 8-fold since the end of the financial crisis. But it’s been a roller coaster that doesn’t provide the safety of dividends or the stability of a company that reports steady earnings. If investors were to suddenly want those things, the share price would drop like a rock. Finally, there’s a reason for all of Amazon’s side projects. They’ve done just about all they can do in the retail space. They’re a far cry from being a book reseller back in the early days of the Internet in the 1990’s. They can offer just about everything in that area. And while they don’t have the costs of brick-and-mortar stores, particularly rent, they do have to contend with the low margins of retail. If anything, they’re the reason why consumers are so price-conscious these days. So what does the future of retail look like? We’re in the stages where one specialty retailer will end up as the competitor to Amazon in that category. In the book space, for instance, that’s Barnes & Noble. Need a book but can’t wait for Prime delivery? Head to your local store. Barnes & Noble (BKS) outlasted competitor Borders, which went into bankruptcy following the financial recession. Last year, Sports Authority proved that it wasn’t an authority in the industry when it filed for bankruptcy. But there’s still Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), the brick-and-mortar alternative to buying your sporting goods on Amazon. And of course, there are things like groceries. While Amazon can compete there, if you’re not in a market with same-day shipping, if you want to eat today, you’ll have to go to a store today. Thanks to Amazon’s dominance, their share are sky-high. But many retailers are trading like value stocks. Following last week’s selloff, shares of Kohl’s (KSS) look particularly interesting. Shares trade at 12 times earnings—about half that of the average S&P 500 stock—and yield 4.8 percent. The company lost 20 percent of its value last week following a modest decline in same-store sales during the holiday season. I get it—for retail, the 4th quarter of the year is the big show. But on the other hand, clothing isn’t always appreciated as a holiday gift—especially when it needs to be tried on. The free market doesn’t create monopolies. While there are arguably too many brick-and-mortar retailers still competing in the Internet age, we’ll likely end up with a duopoly in every specialty retailer category. Those Amazon competitors will be able to hold their own—and at today’s prices provide a great value to boot. Andrew Packer is a Senior Financial Editor with Newsmax Media.

Many of the jobs will be at new fulfillment centers being built in several states, including California, Florida and Texas. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Amazon plans to hire 100,000 full time workers over the next 18 months, highlighting its ambitious expansion plans — and the sharp contrast the e-commerce powerhouse strikes against traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, many of which are cutting jobs and closing stores. Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it's doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon's past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. VIDEOS TOP JOBS AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart — the world's largest retailer — employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon's hiring appears to be accelerating. "We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon's businesses, as well as management's confidence in the long-term outlook," he said. "The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses." TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was "pleased to play a role" in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird's Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some "political capital" in the timing and details of its announcement. "We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.," he said. "Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well." MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week, the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy's moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. "The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry," said economist Diane Swonk.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it's doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon's past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart - the world's largest retailer - employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon's hiring appears to be accelerating. "We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon's businesses, as well as management's confidence in the long-term outlook," he said. "The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses." TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was "pleased to play a role" in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird's Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some "political capital" in the timing and details of its announcement. "We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.," he said. "Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well." MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week , the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy's moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. "The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry," said economist Diane Swonk. ___ AP Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.

Such state laws are already invalid after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled separately, in 1989 and 1990, that flag burning and other forms of damage are constitutionally protected free speech. However, dozens of states still have the laws. Police in Urbana used Illinois' flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott on July 4 of last year. He said he carefully planned his demonstration to protest racial discrimination, poverty and other injustices, and then posted six photographs of his actions on Facebook. The posts, which generated hundreds of comments, led police officers to arrest Mellott while he worked at Wal-Mart and detain him for several hours. He was released without being charged. Mellott, who is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, discussed the lawsuit at a news conference in Champaign on Thursday, a day after the lawsuit was filed. "Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism," Mellott said, according to a copy of his remarks. "And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty." Arrests for flag desecration are rare. Still, experts say states have been reluctant to repeal such laws either because it's politically unpalatable or it hasn't been a priority. About 40 states have flag desecration laws and only a handful have changed them. Wisconsin's flag desecration law was knocked down by the state Supreme Court in the 1990s and removed. Missouri's was repealed effective this month, after a long court battle prompted by a similar lawsuit. President-elect Donald Trump recently said that anyone who burns an American flag should face "consequences," such as jail or a loss of citizenship, despite the Supreme Court determinations. The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday, names several police officers. Urbana police have said they arrested Mellott to protect him from possible backlash from the online posts. An Urbana Police Department spokesman did not return a message seeking comment. More on this...

Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it's doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon's past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart - the world's largest retailer - employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon's hiring appears to be accelerating. "We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon's businesses, as well as management's confidence in the long-term outlook," he said. "The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses." TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was "pleased to play a role" in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird's Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some "political capital" in the timing and details of its announcement. "We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.," he said. "Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well." MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week , the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy's moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. "The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry," said economist Diane Swonk. ___ AP Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.

(KTRK) KTRK Thursday, January 12, 2017 02:47PM CONROE, TX (KTRK) -- A man who allegedly wanted to turn his van into a bomb to blow up the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office is under arrest after he tried to get someone to buy him supplies. It all went down outside of a Conroe Walmart. An eyewitness was walking into the store and stopped to talk to Danyal Arafat about his 70s Volkswagen van. The witness told deputies Arafat suddenly handed him a bag full of cash and asked him to buy shotgun shells and model rocket motors. According to the witness, Arafat said the materials would be used to finish making a bomb to blow up the sheriff's office. The witness refused to help and immediately contacted authorities. He continued to talk to Arafat until deputies arrived. SEE ALSO: Houston Joint Terrorism Task Force address security threats and challenges for the area Bomb sniffing dogs were used to search Arafat's van for any explosive materials but none were found. It was later determined that Arafat didn't pose any immediate danger to the public, however, police appreciated that the witness immediately reported the incident. "We can never be too careful," said Sheriff Henderson in a MCSO press release. Arafat now faces a charge of felony terroristic threat causing fear.

The source did not share the exact number of layoffs. Lowe's workforce totals more than 285,000. As part of the reshuffling, Lowe's is shifting the roles and responsibilities for some of its staff and eliminating some jobs, this person said. Some of the affected workers will be moved to new roles at the company, and others will be promoted. However, a portion will be laid off as Lowe's consolidates some positions, the person explained. The new staffing model will be implemented nationwide and is aimed at freeing up resources to boost face time with customers as the retailer adapts to evolving customer needs. In a statement, Lowe's said, "While we have no announcements to share, we continually evaluate our staffing model to ensure we have the resources in place to serve customers' evolving expectations and their home improvement needs." The layoffs are just the latest to hit the retail landscape. Earlier this week, Wal-Mart said it would be slashing hundreds of jobs with many of the cuts impacting its human resources department. In September, Wal-mart said it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs. Meanwhile last week, The Limited announced it would be closing all of its stores. In recent calls with investors, Lowe's has stressed its attempts to boost productivity — a goal the new model is aimed at meeting. As part of its efforts to improve customers' experience, Lowe's is doubling down on its strategy to cater to shoppers both in store and online. In December, the company detailed its plans for about $3.6 billion in capital expenditures from 2017 to 2019. About 45 percent of the spending will go toward this strategy, including new stores and technology investments. Lowe's also plans to add 15 to 20 stores per year across North America in the next three years. In the U.S., these new stores will result in 4,000 to 5,000 new jobs over the course of this period. Home improvement retail has been a bright spot for the struggling retail landscape as rising home prices and an improving consumer backdrop have prompted customers to spend more on home improvement projects. Overall retail though has struggled amid fierce competition from online retailers and cost-cutting measures as companies double down on other initiatives, such as e-commerce. Same-store sales at Lowe's have been positive for 14 straight quarters — a rare track record for a retailer. Still, the company's growth has lagged that of rival Home Depot's for six of the past eight quarters, according to FactSet data. During the past year, Lowe's shares have fallen 2.5 percent while Home Depot shares have risen 5.9 percent.

The leading firm in this opaque data trade is QuintilesIMS, a company founded as IMS in 1954 by an enigmatic German immigrant named Ludwig Wolfgang Frohlich. Today, the company that Frohlich founded is a titan in its field, worth nearly $20 billion. Yet for all his accomplishments, Frohlich‘s name appears on the company’s website only once. In a way, that’s quite fitting — a case of a founder’s secretive nature setting the tone for his creation’s corporate DNA. Frohlich, a closeted Jew and closeted gay man, obscured his background, just as the company today works hard to keep its operations hidden from the many millions on whom it gathers data. For decades, IMS has gathered copies of prescriptions to assemble reports on what medications individual doctors prescribe to patients. Such information enables sales reps from large brand-name pharmaceutical companies to visit key doctors and persuade them to favor their company’s drugs over those of rivals, not to mention over far cheaper generics. For many years, physicians had no idea an outside commercial company monitored their prescribing. But the practice is totally legal. When doctors began to catch on and protested, several New England states tried to curb this trade. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the laws in a 2011 landmark case that allowed the trafficking in medical data to continue. In the years since, QuintilesIMS has dramatically stepped up its collection of anonymized data on individual patients, buying anonymized copies of our electronic health records, insurance claims, prescriptions and lab tests. Such data allows them to create extensive dossiers on more than half a billion people. The names and addresses on the files that QuintilesIMS sell for profit are removed, but experts say re-identification of such files is increasingly possible, a threat that could undermine patient confidence in revealing sensitive details to their health care providers. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Could Donald Trump’s ‘Extreme Vetting’ for Immigrants Bar Orthodox Jews and Israelis? Nathan GuttmanAugust 15, 2016 Anonymized patient data is also matched with identified data broker profiles on people to profile groups most likely to suffer specific ailments. Drug companies can then target advertising to everyone in the group without violating HIPAA rules on medical data. Such details could also prompt life insurers to deny coverage — or other companies to favor or exclude certain groups. In short, though you may have never heard of QuintilesIMS, the company knows about you, if only indirectly. Even if you are in great health, you likely know someone who has mental health complications, or drinking problems, or any other myriad health-related issues that could cause them harm if the information were to become publicly known. For its part, QuintilesIMS is at pains to assure the public that it is a “global leader in protecting individual patient privacy.” “Through a wide variety of privacy-enhancing technologies and safeguards, QuintilesIMS protects individual privacy while managing information to drive health care forward,” it said in a statement last October. Still, QuintilesIMS reveals little about its inner workings, paralleling the reticence of its German emigrant founder, whose existence is mentioned a single time on its website, in its corporate history timeline. Imagine Ford telling its story without detailing Henry; McDonald’s without Ray Kroc, or Wal-Mart with little mention of Sam Walton. In the 1950s and 1960s, Frohlich embodied the sophistication and panache of Madison Avenue, where he was the founder of one of New York City’s leading medical advertising agencies. He also kept as many secrets as fictional adman Don Draper. Many corners of Frohlich’s life remained hidden for more than half a century – until now.

Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Master of His Universe A typical day at his L.W. Frohlich/Intercon advertising agency could easily be a scene in the television program “Mad Men.” It’s morning, and a chauffeur in an elegant fitted jacket and cap opens the sports car door for the boss. With a white handkerchief blooming from the pocket of his dark double-breasted suit, and The Wall Street Journal under his arm, Frohlich steps into the nine-story brick office building at 34 E. 51st Street that bears his name. He embodies the very image of the sophisticated executive. As he rides the elevator, an awestruck junior employee beams a smile and says, eagerly, “Good morning, Mr. Frohlich!” The entry level copy editor knows to limit the elevator conversation to banal pleasantries; before a recent staff meeting with Frohlich, his supervisor reminded the young Med Man not to say anything in the company founder’s presence. From an office dominated by a tall Asian wood panel of three Buddhist figures, the boss commands a medical advertising empire of 1,000 people in New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid and Tokyo. By the end of the 1960s, Frohlich’s medical marketing research company, IMS Health, was operating in more than two dozen countries, including much of Western Europe, Iran, Peru, the Philippines and Turkey. The two businesses complement each other nicely, as IMS reports help make the case for more medical advertising. After work Frohlich invites a top pharmaceutical executive to his Manhattan brownstone at 150 East 63rd Street for drinks in the basement bar before leading him upstairs where staff serves dinner on fine china and crystal under a chandelier. Later they repair to his box seats at the Metropolitan Opera, where he tells of his friendship with Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Edward Snowden Should Be Praised — Not Pilloried Leonard FeinNovember 9, 2013 He might also mention the time he met Aaron Copland. Frohlich owned several radio stations, and his popular New York City classical station, WNCN-FM, had convinced the composer of Fanfare for the Common Man to host 52 WNCN shows. It was a great coup, even for the then considerable fee of $10,000. In 1968, Frohlich held a gala lunch at his agency’s ornate, top-floor dining room to mark the launch of the series. The advertising executive arrived a few minutes late, so all eyes turned his way as he greeted Copland. “Mr. Copland, I can’t tell you how much I enjoy your ballet Fancy Free.” “Oh, I like it very much also,” the composer replied. Copland diplomatically failed to mention that his friend Leonard Bernstein actually wrote the score to Fancy Free, a story of three sailors on leave in New York City. Despite the occasional faux pas, Frohlich’s hobnobbing with high society, his dignified demeanor and his knowing aura impressed his employees. “I was inspired by him, his attitude about the company. I wanted to do really great work for him,” said Gerald Weinstein, who worked at the L.W. Frohlich agency between 1951 to 1959 with an interruption for military service. “I wanted to be L.W. when I grew up,” Joseph Iozzi, who joined the creative department in 1965, remembered half a century later. “Like Mad Men, it was very much like that,” said Gerald Busby, who worked there from 1960 to ‘63. “They were often very good-looking men acting circumspectly.” When Frohlich died, on September 28, 1971, hundreds of admirers attended the funeral service at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church on Park Avenue. But even in death, Frohlich did not reveal his religious roots. The Enigma For all his charms and commanding presence, Frohlich represented an enigma, even to his closest associates. No one knew the bachelor all that well. Certain topics remained off limits, including his origins in Germany, his private life and the financial reality behind his two firms. Frohlich’s reserve represented far more than Teutonic modesty. The executive, who used the first name Bill or L.W. in the United States, reinvented himself to make it in postwar America and hid key aspects of his identity. Frohlich (Fröhlich in the original German) was born in Giessen, 32 miles north of Frankfurt, a year before the outbreak of World War I. The town long had a Jewish minority, and one of its members, Sigmund Livingston, immigrated to the United States in the late 19th century and founded the Anti-Defamation League in 1913. Frohlich left for the United States in 1935, and applied for U.S. citizenship the following year. He prided himself on European manners and sophistication, yet associates knew nothing about his early life or how he came to the United States. Some thought that his authoritarian management style, fastidiousness and accent suggested a hidden Nazi past. At the height of World War II in 1943, the FBI investigated him for connections to the Third Reich – but found none. If he wasn’t a Nazi, maybe he was a Jew, others thought. But Frohlich did not want to discuss his youth or private life. To this day, some of Frohlich’s closest connections believe he had no personal connections to Judaism. “Having known him and known his sister and at one point met his mother — I would not have said that any of them is Jewish,” his attorney, Richard Leather, told me. Frohlich’s sister Ingrid Frohlich, who later took her husband’s surname, Burns, identified herself as Lutheran. She belonged to an exclusive Palm Beach, Florida, country club that did not welcome Jews, and she expressed disapproval when a granddaughter announced plans to marry a Jew. “Ingrid disliked everything that was Jewish,” said Lars Ericson, a distant relative who socialized with Frohlich and later became president of IMS. “She would say, ‘Those Jewish people, I can’t stand them.’” “His sister was adamant that she was not Jewish,” said Ericson. (Burns died in 2009 at age 95; her two daughters declined to comment for this article). Frohlich was himself a member of several elite clubs, including the Maidstone Club, which had a reputation for excluding blacks and Jews near his East Hampton weekend house. Yet in reality the Frohlich parents and ancestors were Jews, a fact he acknowledged in the very first sentence of his 1934 application to Goethe University in Frankfurt. “Although I am not of Aryan origin, I am hereby requesting permission to enroll,” he wrote. Courtesy Goethe Universitat Frankfurt Not Aryan: Frohlich, who belonged to several elite clubs that excluded Jews, refused to discuss his personal life. But his 1934 application to Goethe University under Hitler told the truth. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email With Adolf Hitler already purging Jews from German universities, Frohlich bolstered his political reliability by highlighting his parents’ service in WWI. He also filled out a supplemental questionnaire for “non-Aryan” students: Do you have a parent of Aryan origin? Nein Do you have a grandparent of Aryan origin? Nein Did your father fight on the front for the German Reich in the world war? Yes, and has a certificate of severe wounds from the war How long has your family been present in Germany? Since around the 15th century Has your family renounced the Jewish religion? No Frohlich had one more ace up his sleeve. In early 1933 he joined the Reichsarbeitsdienst, a youth work brigade whose members wore red Swastika armbands and Swastika pins on their caps, and had served in East Prussia. He was admitted, but completed just a year of college. In 1935, a typeface company offered him a year assignment at its New York subsidiary. After a trip home a year later, he returned to New York and dropped out of college. By 1938, Frohlich’s sister Ingrid, their mother and his maternal grandparents joined him in New York. Had Frohlich remained in Germany, he could have faced Nazi persecution not only because he was a Jew, but also because of his sexual orientation: He was gay. This fact, confirmed to me by multiple Frohlich agency and IMS executives who worked closely with Frohlich, was one more detail he masked in his professional life. To help him do so, he would often bring sophisticated women to dinners with pharmaceutical executives. The fate of his father, Leopold Frohlich — who had long before divorced his mother — provides a chilling example of what might have happened otherwise. On September 29, 1938— the very day Adolf Hitler met Neville Chamberlain to hammer out the Munich Agreement on the fate of the Sudetenland — the Gestapo arrested the elder Frohlich on charges of expressing political statements against the Sudeten Germans. On November 10, the day after the Kristallnacht pogrom, authorities sent him to Buchenwald. After trial and conviction, he was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin, where he died at age 63 on April 18, 1940. Courtesy Goethe Universitat Frankfurt Man of Mystery: Frohlich left Germany for America in 1935, after Hitler took power. His New York Times obituary said it was before then, in 1931. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email An Enigma in New York Well aware of anti-Jewish discrimination in America, Frohlich kept this background to himself. “You would sit at meetings where they would tell Jewish jokes, anti-Jewish jokes, and you had to sit there and swallow it, and laugh along with the boys,” said Michael Sonnenreich, the lawyer for Frohlich’s medical advertising rival Arthur Sackler, who was also Jewish. “That’s what you needed to do if you were going to make the business.” John Kallir, who worked for Sackler’s McAdams agency and knew Frohlich slightly, understood such sentiments. Born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, he left his native Austria in 1938 after the Nazi Anschluss with Austria. He became one of a number of Jewish or half-Jewish German or Austrian immigrants in the medical advertising industry. “It was certainly a very embarrassing subject,” he said in 2015 about his Jewish heritage. “I didn’t want to talk about it.” Not everyone felt that way. David Dubow, the New Yorker whom Frohlich entrusted with setting up IMS, embraced his Jewish heritage and had headed the Alpha Epsilon Pi Jewish fraternity while he was a New York University undergraduate. As sensitive as his heritage and sexual orientation were during that era, Frohlich had an even bigger secret: the true nature of his relationship with Arthur Sackler, his career-long competitor whose family name endures today from his arts patronage and philanthropy, including in the Sackler wing of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art housing the Egyptian Temple of Dendur. Despite their different temperaments and contrasting public profiles—and though one hailed from Germany and the other Brooklyn—the two men had much in common and became friends. Born within a few weeks of each other in 1913, they followed similar career paths. Sackler joined the William Douglas McAdams medical advertising agency in 1943, the same year Frohlich formed his agency. Sackler bought a majority stake in McAdams in 1947. By all logic, the two men would have competed vigorously. In reality, they met regularly to divvy up business and share information about potential clients. It was an arrangement to their mutual advantage that insiders admitted only many decades later. “It was very, very important at that time to divide up business to make sure you could get as much business as possible because you could not have competing products,” Sonnenreich, the Sackler attorney, told me. Leather, who served as Frohlich’s attorney starting in 1960, broadly confirmed this arrangement: “Those two agencies very much helped one another. They were very cooperative.” Sonnenreich also said Sackler had a financial stake in the L.W. Frohlich agency, something several former Frohlich agency executives suspected but Sackler denied during his lifetime. “If it was an automobile company it would have been an antitrust suit, for God’s sake,” L.W. Frohlich executive Bill Castagnoli said shortly before his death in 2015. Sackler’s attorney disagrees, calling the arrangement kosher. “It was not illegal. Two separate agencies, two separate reporting entities,” Sonnenreich said. Frohlich died at age 58 of a brain tumor in 1971. The obituary the next day in The New York Times followed a Frohlich tradition of omissions and inventions. It said his middle name was William (not Wolfgang); that he graduated from college in 1931 at age 18 (he dropped out after his freshman year in 1935), and that he came to the United States in 1931 (he arrived in 1935 and immigrated permanently in 1936). “That son of bitch won’t even admit he is Jewish,” Sackler once complained to a colleague. The biggest secret of the Frohlich-Sackler partnership came to light only the following year. As IMS officials prepared to take the company public in 1972, they discovered that Frohlich had a clandestine agreement in which Arthur Sackler’s two brothers inherited the overwhelming share of IMS. Arthur Sackler had been a secret power behind the IMS throne. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email We Can’t Make Healthcare Great Again Unless We Consider This Hidden Cost Seth J.

AP By MAE ANDERSON AP Technology Writer Thursday, January 12, 2017 03:24PM NEW YORK -- Amazon plans to hire 100,000 full time workers over the next 18 months, highlighting its ambitious expansion plans - and the sharp contrast the e-commerce powerhouse strikes against traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, many of which are cutting jobs and closing stores. Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, and it's doing that with a vengeance. The new hires will largely support new Amazon fulfillment centers in states such as Texas and California, expanded delivery capabilities and its money-minting Amazon Web Services cloud computing business. The numbers are generally in line with Amazon's past hiring plans. Amazon, which had a total of 306,800 full-time and part-time employees globally at the end of September, hired a total of 123,700 globally during the 15 months ended in September, according to quarterly filings. AMAZON HITS THE GAS Amazon said Thursday its U.S. workforce has grown from 30,000 in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. By comparison, Walmart - the world's largest retailer - employs about 2.4 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million workers in the U.S. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the announcement shows that Amazon's hiring appears to be accelerating. "We view this announcement positively in terms of the current trajectory of Amazon's businesses, as well as management's confidence in the long-term outlook," he said. "The hiring is consistent with our view that Amazon will continue to invest aggressively in its retail, media, technology and logistics businesses." TRUMP OR NO TRUMP? The news comes a month after President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Throughout the presidential election campaign Trump and Bezos clashed after Trump attacked Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But they appeared to make nice when Bezos attended the meeting in December. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted in a call with reporters on Thursday that Amazon made the announcement after the meeting, when Trump urged tech leaders to keep jobs in the U.S. Spicer said that Trump was "pleased to play a role" in the job gains. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what role, if any, Trump had in the jobs announcement. Baird's Sebastian downplayed the politics factor, noting only that the online retailer may have deployed some "political capital" in the timing and details of its announcement. "We suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U.S.," he said. "Moreover, we expect the pace of hiring internationally to accelerate as well." MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE STORE Things are much less rosy at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Last week, the Limited said it would close all its stores and Macy's moved forward with plans to close 68 stores and said it will cut more than 10,000 jobs. There have been unconfirmed reports Walmart is also planning layoffs. "The move from bricks to clicks is causing major disruption in the retail industry," said economist Diane Swonk.

Target, Amazon and Walmart are all still out of stock, and demand hasn’t sagged one bit. Best Buy had the NES Classic Edition in stock for online sales as of about 10.30 this morning. But don’t bother booting up your browser right now: it was out of stock within a matter of minutes, far too quick for even the shortest of blog posts. Don't Miss: Apple’s ‘boring’ iPhone 7 just stole a ton of market share from Android The point of this isn’t actually to make you jealous for the few hundred people who got their hands on a Best Buy console: it’s to help you get on the next sale. You see, in addition to selling through its official website, Best Buy was also selling consoles through its official eBay store. That gets less traffic and is generally not as well known, so if you set up an alert for the eBay Store, there’s a good chance you’ll get a console next time it’s in stock. You can use a service like Visualping or others to set up a custom alert for any significant change in Best Buy’s eBay page. The NES Classic Edition was the first thing listed on the page while it was in stock, so a simple alert should do. Then, you’ll want to make sure you have an eBay account set up and ready to go so you can spring on the stock as soon as it’s made available. If you don’t have any luck with the eBay page, or if you just want to hedge your bets, the NowInStock website has a Target stock checker, and a way to add yourself to a Google Group to be alerted (along with a lot of other people!) whenever the NES Classic Edition is in stock anywhere.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Linda Bean on Thursday defended her donations to President-elect Donald Trump and said the blacklisting campaign against the company founded by her grandfather is nothing more than "bullying." "I think it is very much a case of bullying," the L.L. Bean heiress said on Fox News' "Fox & Friends" morning show. "It is bullying me and bullying the companies I own and bullying the one I partly am on, the L.L. Bean company, since I owned when I was a child," Linda Bean said, stressing that she speaks for herself and is not representing the company. Bean said the pressure is for her to resign from the board, something she told the hosts she will not do. "I never back down. If I feel I'm right," Bean said. L.L. Bean is one of nearly 80 companies — including Walmart, Welch's, Bloomingdales and Hobby Lobby — that the organization "Grab Your Wallet" has launched a boycott campaign against due to varying levels of support for Trump. Bean said she donated $15,000 in August and $10,000 in October to Trump's Making Maine Great Again PAC. It was originally and incorrectly reported Bean contributed $60,000 to the PAC. Her support earned a shoutout from Trump on Thursday: Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Bean said her cousin and an L.L. Bean executive donated to President Barack Obama's campaign four years but he didn't have to endure any backlash. "Definitely a double standard," Linda Bean said. "Both these guys won. Obama won and Trump won. My cousin's candidate, my candidate but I'm the one being targeted and vilified, and asked to be taken off the board. They demanded, that is the demand I leave the board."

CBS affiliate WKMG reports that Jameis Slaughter, 25, was arrested and charged with accessory after the fact to first-degree murder on Wednesday.  Orlando shooting suspect Markeith Lloyd, whose police-released photograph is seen superimposed on the scene of the shooting of an Orlando police officer. Lloyd is the primary suspect in the shooting that took place on Jan. 9, 2017, outside an Orlando, Florida, Walmart. Orlando Police Department/WKMG/CBS News The station reports that Slaughter’s arrest marks the third in about 24 hours in connection with the search for Loyd, who police say fatally shot Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Walmart Monday, and who is still at large. Zarghee Mayan, 33, was arrested Tuesday night and Loyd’s niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, 27, was arrested Wednesday afternoon. WKMG reports that police say all three people arrested may know where Loyd is hiding. Deputies said Slaughter originally gave them the name of her twin sister when they apprehended her. She told them her real name as she was being taken to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, the affidavit said. In the hours after Sgt. Clayton’s shooting, Slaughter’s vehicle was seen circling the grocery store and the area where Loyd was believed to have escaped. Deputies said Slaughter also attempted to collect rent money from a woman on Loyd’s behalf on Dec. 17, days after police said Loyd fatally shot his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Orlando police officers salute as the body of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton (pictured in the inset image) is taken from a hospital after she was shot and killed on Monday, Jan. 9, 2016. Orlando Police Department Slaughter, Mayan and Smith-Loyd are all charged with accessory after the fact to first-degree murder.  Deputies said Mayan has seen Loyd multiple times since Dixon’s murder on Dec. 13. In one of those encounters, the two hugged and Mayan allegedly realized Loyd was wearing a bulletproof vest. Mayan gave Loyd money and food in the days after Dixon’s murder, according to an arrest affidavit. He also allegedly gave Smith-Loyd $200 to give to her uncle. Orlando police Chief John Mina said Tuesday that arrest warrants were being prepared for people who aided and abetted Loyd after Dixon’s December killing. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Such state laws are already invalid after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled separately, in 1989 and 1990, that flag burning and other forms of damage are constitutionally protected free speech. However, dozens of states still have the laws. Police in Urbana used Illinois’ flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott on July 4 of last year. He said he carefully planned his demonstration to protest racial discrimination, poverty and other injustices, and then posted six photographs of his actions on Facebook. The posts, which generated hundreds of comments, led police officers to arrest Mellott while he worked at Wal-Mart and detain him for several hours. He was released without being charged. Mellott, who is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, was expected to discuss the lawsuit at a Thursday news conference in Champaign. The suit was filed late Wednesday. Illinois police drop charges against flag-burning protester “Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism,” Mellott said in a statement. “And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.” Bryton Mellott posted photos of himself burning the American flag online. (Bryton Mellott via Facebook) Arrests for flag desecration are rare. Still, experts say states have been reluctant to repeal such laws either because it’s politically unpalatable or it hasn’t been a priority. About 40 states have flag desecration laws and only a handful have changed them. Wisconsin’s flag desecration law was knocked down by the state Supreme Court in the 1990s and removed. Missouri’s was repealed effective this month, after a long court battle prompted by a similar lawsuit. President-elect Donald Trump recently said that anyone who burns an American flag should face “consequences,” such as jail or a loss of citizenship, despite the Supreme Court determinations. The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday, names several police officers. Urbana police have said they arrested Mellott to protect him from possible backlash from the online posts. An Urbana Police Department spokesman did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday. Police used Illinois’ flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott, but he was later released. (AP) An attorney for the ACLU said one of their main goals is to provide clarity for authorities. “It’s very clear that this law is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that in the future, Illinois law enforcement officers know that they cannot arrest people under this statute,” ACLU attorney Rebecca Glenberg said. Mellott also seeks unspecified damages. Tags: illinois lawsuits Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jan 12, 2017 at 12:33PM High dividends are nice, but high dividends that are safe and have the potential to grow are the holy grail of dividend investing. When this type of dividend stock goes on sale, it's even better. With the poor performance of the real estate sector in 2016, there are good opportunities to get some of these excellent long-term dividend plays at a discount. Here are two great examples you could buy right now. Image Source: Getty Images. Retail can be a good defensive play Retail is not often thought of as a defensive investment, and with some high-profile retail bankruptcies in recent years, it's easy to understand why. However, the real estate side of retail can be a safe investment, especially if you choose a REIT like Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM), which currently pays a 4.2% dividend yield. Kimco invests in shopping center properties. The company owns 534 shopping center properties consisting of about 86 million rentable square feet. And the rental revenue stream is even more diverse than the stats make it sound: The company has 4,100 separate tenants, none of which makes up more than 3.4% of the revenue. The lease structure of retail is rather defensive. In Kimco's case, the tenants are on long-term leases (with initial terms of more than 10 years), which means that the income stream is mostly secure in recessions. Only about 8% of leases expire each year, which keeps turnover and vacancy risk to a minimum. And the supply-demand dynamics of shopping center retail are favorable for strong occupancy, as new supply is at a historic low and demand for new retail stores is rising. Image source: Kimco Realty. Finally, many of Kimco's tenants are in defensive retail businesses. For example, major tenants such as TJX Companies, Wal-Mart, and Dollar Tree actually tend to do better during tough economic times. Others, such as Whole Foods, are resistant to competition from online-based retailers, which has been a big reason for many of the retail bankruptcies of recent years. Not only does Kimco pay a rather high dividend, which it has raised at an 8% annualized rate so far this decade, but the company has produced some impressive share-price gains as well. In fact, the company has generated 13.4% average total returns since its 1991 IPO. To put this in perspective, a $10,000 investment in Kimco's IPO would be worth more than $260,000 today. While there's no guarantee of this performance replicating itself over the next 26 years, the potential is certainly there. Healthcare real estate is a defensive play with major upside potential One stock that looks particularly appealing in the healthcare real estate space right now is Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW), especially because of its 7.3% dividend yield. The REIT, which invest in hospital properties, trades at a rock-bottom valuation of just nine times its 2017 FFO (funds from operations) guidance. While there are some reasons for this, which I'll discuss in a bit, it's still a relatively safe investment and too cheap to ignore. I've highlighted the reasons for investing in healthcare real estate before, but here are some of the biggest ones. First, it's an inherently defensive type of property. Not only do tenants sign long-term leases, but healthcare is one expense people can't cut back on during a recession. Second, the market is growing. Healthcare spending is projected to rise, and the senior citizen population in the U.S. is expected to roughly double by 2050. Finally, the industry is highly fragmented and in the early stages of REIT consolidation, which means that there is ample opportunity to grow in the existing supply. It appears Medical Properties Trust is completely willing to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. During 2016 the company completed about $1.75 billion worth of acquisitions, a record-setting figure. And comments from the CEO from the third quarter of 2016 indicate that the company has no intentions of slowing down as it heads into 2017. One of the major risk factors is that most of the revenue of Medical Properties Trust's tenants comes from reimbursement programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance), as opposed to private-pay sources, which are generally more stable and predictable. Also, one of the company's major tenants (Adeptus Health) has been struggling financially, which has been a significant cause of concern for investors. Despite the risks, I feel that Medical Properties Trust is an extremely compelling dividend stock at its current low valuation. The company's projected normalized 2017 FFO of $1.35 to $1.40 per share is more than enough to cover the $0.92 annual dividend, and actually works out to a relatively low payout ratio for a REIT. Invest for the long haul One of the most important points I want to stress is that these stocks are good investment choices only if you have a long time frame to ride out any ups and downs. As you can see, both companies experienced share-price drops of 17% or more in 2016: KIM data by YCharts. This was mainly due to rising interest rates, and not problems with the businesses themselves. However, if interest rates continue to climb faster than the market expects, there could easily be further losses ahead. Nevertheless, over long periods of time, these companies have winning business models and could produce strong gains for your portfolio.

Such state laws are already invalid after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled separately, in 1989 and 1990, that flag burning and other forms of damage are constitutionally protected free speech. However, dozens of states still have the laws. Police in Urbana used Illinois’ flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott on July 4 of last year. He said he carefully planned his demonstration to protest racial discrimination, poverty and other injustices, and then posted six photographs of his actions on Facebook. The posts, which generated hundreds of comments, led police officers to arrest Mellott while he worked at Wal-Mart and detain him for several hours. He was released without being charged. Mellott, who is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, was expected to discuss the lawsuit at a Thursday news conference in Champaign. The suit was filed late Wednesday. Illinois police drop charges against flag-burning protester “Open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism,” Mellott said in a statement. “And it was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.” Bryton Mellott posted photos of himself burning the American flag online. (Bryton Mellott via Facebook) Arrests for flag desecration are rare. Still, experts say states have been reluctant to repeal such laws either because it’s politically unpalatable or it hasn’t been a priority. About 40 states have flag desecration laws and only a handful have changed them. Wisconsin’s flag desecration law was knocked down by the state Supreme Court in the 1990s and removed. Missouri’s was repealed effective this month, after a long court battle prompted by a similar lawsuit. President-elect Donald Trump recently said that anyone who burns an American flag should face “consequences,” such as jail or a loss of citizenship, despite the Supreme Court determinations. The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday, names several police officers. Urbana police have said they arrested Mellott to protect him from possible backlash from the online posts. An Urbana Police Department spokesman did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday. Police used Illinois’ flag desecration law to arrest local resident Bryton Mellott, but he was later released. (AP) An attorney for the ACLU said one of their main goals is to provide clarity for authorities. “It’s very clear that this law is unconstitutional and we want to make sure that in the future, Illinois law enforcement officers know that they cannot arrest people under this statute,” ACLU attorney Rebecca Glenberg said. Mellott also seeks unspecified damages. Tags: illinois lawsuits Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

According to campaign chairperson Chrisoula Kirk the amount is actually down from the previous year by about 10 per cent. “I think It’s a combination of things, a lot of people have moved out of the community to find work and I think people are just feeling the pressure of personal finances,” said Kirk.  “Our volunteer base this year got really old. Volunteers get older and they don’t have the ability to stand and take on as many shifts as they used to.” Related: Salvation Army volunteer rings in the giving season One gentleman who was not able to volunteer this year had in the past worked two to fours each day of the campaign at Walmart. “That was 50 per cent of the shifts for Walmart and we would need two to three people just to fill that time slot,” said Kirk. “But that (amount) is nothing to scoff at.” The money goes to a wide variety of Salvation Army projects including the food bank and to help pay for the more than 800 Christmas hampers given out. “We do from the bottom of our hearts appreciate every hour every volunteer puts in,” said Kirk. ”Even if it’s just one shift for the entire campaign we are grateful because every little bit helps.” Nationally the kettle campaign raised over $23.5 million, well above the $21 million goal.

That's what Jeremy Bowley, president of APC Forest Products of Muscle Shoals, says. Numbers bear that out. Wooden pallets are an $11.5 billion dollar a year industry in the U.S. Almost 3,000 businesses operating in all 50 states make the pallets, which are an integral part of commerce. Pallets help in stabilizing products in transit as well as protecting them and making them easier to move in bulk. They have to be cheap enough to use and reuse, and of late, recyclable. "If you see something going down the road on a truck, it's got a pallet," Bowley said. "Nothing moves without them, whether its sold in Walmart, a grocery store, a clothing store. If it got shipped out, it's on a pallet." APC Forest Products has been in business in north Alabama for more than 46 years, first in Town Creek as the Alabama Pallet Co. before moving to a five-acre site in Muscle Shoals in 2003. Bowley, 42, a native of Indiana, recently became president of APC after serving as general manager. The company's regular customers are mostly within a three-mile radius of the Shoals area, but the nature of business and transport means pallets go all over the world. The pallet industry's latest push has been to make all products green. Late last year, the pallet design system used by APC was designated as biopreferred by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That means all federal agencies and their contractors know the pallets are made with renewable materials. Those agencies have a sustainable product acquisition mandate to purchase bio-based products, which are certified as biopreferred. Once pallets have outlived their usefulness, they are ground into mulch and used as fertilizer.  "It's something new in the industry," Bowley said. "We're doing everything we can to be green."
