Ryan McQueeney ZacksAugust 17, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shares of Target TGT are down about 5.7% Wednesday following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings report. Target missed revenue expectations and slashed its guidance for the remainder of the year, which could be a sign of things to come for Walmart WMT, another giant in the value shopping sphere that is set to report this week. Target posted second-quarter earnings of $1.23 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. However, quarterly revenues of $16.169 billion declined 7.2% on a year-over-year basis and fell short of our consensus estimate of $16.245. Additionally, comparable-store sales fell 1.1%, while total transactions were down 2.2% (also read: Three Reasons For Target's Weak Q2 Sales). Target also lowered its outlook for fiscal 2016. The company now expects earnings to fall in the range of $4.80–$5.20 per share compared with its earlier-announced $5.20–$5.40 per share range. For the third quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 75–95 cents. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2016 stand at 98 cents and $5.16, respectively (also read: Target Q2 Earnings Beat, Sales Miss; Trims View). Some of Target’s results have to concern Walmart investors, as the two companies tend to operate in the same retail sphere and attract similar customers. Walmart is set to release its earnings report on Thursday morning, and those looking to make an earnings play on the stock should definitely check out Target's report first. To predict whether Target’s report foreshadows what’s to come for Walmart, we need to look at what caused Target’s sluggish sales. In the company’s conference call following the release of the report, CEO Brian Cornell highlighted several factors for the disappointing numbers, including a slow start to the company’s partnership with CVS CVS and improperly focused marketing, which wouldn’t necessarily apply to Walmart. However, Cornell did place a significant amount of blame on a decline in sales of Apple AAPL products. According to Target’s management, a 20% drop in Apple sales was to blame for a third of the company’s double digit plunge in electronics sales. Of course, Walmart stores also stock Apple products in their electronics departments, and it will be interesting to see whether or not Walmart mentions Apple at all tomorrow. Walmart investors might also be worried about Target’s guidance cut. Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a positive Earnings ESP, which suggests that an earnings beat is more likely, but that won’t matter if Walmart also posts lackluster guidance. While Target’s guidance cut could be a result of company-specific trends, it could also be a statement on the overall health of the retail sector. Throughout this earnings season, retail results have been mixed, but Target could be indicating that less shoppers will be hitting the stores throughout the remainder of the year. There’s a lot to consider heading into Walmart’s report tomorrow, and investors need to be fully prepared.

Target reports financial results Wednesday, Aug. 17. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) AA NEW YORK (AP) — Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter's second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 percent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 percent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. Target's shares fell $4.74, or 6 percent, to $70.74 in afternoon trading. Customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half as Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off. Other issues, both company-specific and industrywide, ranged from a lack of new electronics for sale and lingering disruptions caused by the sale last year of its pharmacy business to CVS. Sales by markets also varied, with weakness on the East Coast but pockets of strength in California. "Our No. 1 focus is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating business to our site," Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. Target joins retailers such as department store chain Macy's that are struggling with fewer customers coming in as shoppers buy more online. The bright spots in retail have been T.J. Maxx's parent company TJX Cos. and Home Depot as consumers look for clothing bargains and focus more on their homes. Under Cornell, Target has been trying to reinvigorate itself restore its cheap-chic status after a series of headline-grabbing setbacks such as a 2013 data breach. It's focusing on categories like fashion, home furnishings and wellness products, creating vignettes featuring home products and launching the children's line Cat & Jack. But striking the right balance between stylish clothing and bedspreads while offering toothpaste and detergent at good prices has been tricky. "Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant," said Cornell. "And we've got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that's the "Pay Less" side. And that's all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively." To boost sales and traffic, Target plans to increase marketing for its essentials and work with key vendors like Apple to push more innovation and to also improve presentations. Apple product sales were down 20 percent and the electronics department was a "significant drag," Cornell said. Target is still struggling, however, to reinvent its food section — an area where Wal-Mart is particularly strong. Grocery sales represent about 20 percent of Target's total business but it has seen disappointing results from perishables like fruits and vegetables. Its nonperishable items have been doing well, and it's marketing more organic, natural or gluten-free products. Yarbrough noted that Target faces stiff competition on the low end from Wal-Mart, which is focusing on lowering prices further, and at the high end from the likes of stores like Whole Foods and others. "Grocery is going to be more difficult to fix," said Brian P. Yarbrough, a senior analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm, which downgraded Target's stock to "hold" from a "buy" rating Wednesday. "They're not a destination for food. They don't offer a whole suite of products." While nowhere near the online volume of Amazon, Target is expanding its online services. It's doubling the number of stores that will be used to ship products directly to online shoppers' homes, which will result in speedier deliveries. Online sales rose 16 percent in the second quarter, lower than the 23 percent gain in the first quarter. Target also is spending to modify some stores after an outcry from some customers about its policy of allowing transgender customers and staff to use the bathrooms that identifies with their gender identity. Chief financial officer Cathy Smith said the backlash hasn't had a "material" impact on sales, but some customers are still upset. "We are listening to our guests," she said. Target is investing $20 million in building single-stall bathrooms in stores. Target reported net income for the quarter of $680 million, or $1.16 per share. That compares with $753 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.23, beating projections of $1.14 from Wall Street, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.2 billion. The company now expects earnings this year from $4.80 to $5.20 per share, lower than the $5.20 to $5.40 it had projected earlier. Same-stores sales could fall as much as 2 percent in the second half of the year, Target said. close News In Pictures Photos: Ski resorts show off their snow ahead of big winter storms this weekend 100-pound sturgeon rescued at Ballard Locks Beloved Seattle cafe closing its doors after more than a century of business Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle Trending 1   Gig Harbor community mourns the death of 20-year-old 2   Police: Seattle mom caught man raping her daughter on camera 3   Winter Storm Warnings in effect for Cascades as twin Thanksgiving storms approach 4   Schlitterbahn closing Verrückt after young boy killed on Kansas waterslide 5   Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with KOMO Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Gig Harbor community mourns the death of 20-year-old 2 Police: Seattle mom caught man raping her daughter on camera 3 Winter Storm Warnings in effect for Cascades as twin Thanksgiving storms approach 4 Schlitterbahn closing Verrückt after young boy killed on Kansas waterslide 5 Crash shuts down several lanes of I-5 in North Seattle 6 Rare thunderstorm asthma kills 4 people in Australian city 7 Local medic quits job to help injured protesters on front lines of Dakota Access pipeline 8 Bellevue's Snowflake Lane to get extra police, barricades 9 Winter Storm Watches, High Wind Watches hoisted as stormy pattern commences 10 Man flashes laser at King Co.

Published Aug 17th, 2016 4:48 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. –––––––––––––––– When retail giant Wal-Mart made headlines in June by saying “yes” to online access to nearly all the 450 suppliers who pitched products at the annual Open Call event in Bentonville, little did some suppliers know the challenges they would face in trying to get their products uploaded to Walmart.com. One supplier out of New York is still waiting to connect with an online buyer because of Wal-Mart personnel turnover. Without a vendor number the new supplier is in limbo. Suppliers already selling products online seek a review with the buyers they met in June, but a new phone system – with different phone extensions – at Wal-Mart corporate offices has complicated the process. This leaves only email connections, a cumbersome process given the hundreds of emails a buyer receives in a week. Consultants who represented clients to Wal-Mart have told Talk Business & Politics that in the exuberance of hearing “yes” there were many details that were not made clear to the first-timers. And once it became clear what would be required to sell online for Walmart.com, the cost became prohibitive for some of the suppliers offering salsa, mac and cheese and pet foods. The cost is high given the product is not in physical stores. Wal-Mart makes no secret of its requirements for suppliers which are published on the retailer’s website. All suppliers have to get a Dun & Bradstreet credit rating, and in many cases with foods and other consumables liability insurance is required should a customer get sick. The costs associated with being a Wal-Mart supplier are higher than in past years given the warehousing fees which were added this year and 90- to 120-day payment windows common in contracts. There also is a 2% damage fee which can be assessed by the retailer. Consultants said it doesn’t necessarily make sense to spend as much as $5,000 to get set up as an online supplier and then take a loss by individually shipping low-cost items. That is particularly true for suppliers that just have one item to sell. There is also a wealth of competition online for small mom and pop operations trying to sell general merchandise through Walmart.com. A search for a plumbing snake on Walmart.com indicated 54 items, 46 of which were offered by third-party markets such as Build.com and Affordable Tools. Consultants said small suppliers who have their hearts set on selling at Walmart.com often must be willing to ramp up production and then go as long as four or five months without payment. For the online sales there is also the cost of shipping single items like a jar of jelly or salsa, which is often cost prohibitive for mom and pop suppliers. Heavy items like a bag of pet food are also not economical to ship. While it can be expensive to ship single items, a search for salsa on Walmart.com indicated 1,261 items with Pace, Tostitos and Great Value brands popping up first. Local brands like My Brothers Salsa are sold on Walmart.com, but My Brothers Salsa also is sold in hundreds of stores. Supplier consultants say small suppliers can get through the first order using cash reserves, but it’s the second and third production run that can sink them given the 90- to 120-day payment terms from Wal-Mart. The experts said many small inventors and business owners are typically not finance people and managing cash flow is crucial for small suppliers. Navigating through item set up, shipments and then replenishments can be daunting, While there is no shortage of brokers scavenging the ranks to offer help, those services also come at a cost which can further erode supplier margins. It remains to be seen if Wal-Mart will continue to hold its Open Call for suppliers in the absence of Michelle Gloeckler, who oversaw the event for the past three years. Gloeckler will begin working at Academy Sports and Outdoors on Aug. 29. Wal-Mart’s commitment to source $250 billion in additional U.S. made products by 2023 remains on track, according to corporate spokesman Lorenzo Lopez. He said there will be another executive placed over the U.S. Manufacturing Initiative. While Wal-Mart made the verbal offer to suppliers to sell online in early June, the retailer has not said how many of the suppliers have done so in the past 75 days. Wal-Mart did have a team onsite in June to help suppliers begin the process. The retailer declined to share how many, if any, of the suppliers who presented at Open Call got an offer to sell inside physical stores. When pressed on the issue, the retailer said merely the focus of this year’s event was to say “yes” to the online sales.

The stores have reportedly become crime hotspots across the US since 2000, when new CEO Leo Scott started slashing budgets. 'The constant calls from Walmart are just draining,' Bill Ferguson, a police captain in Port Richey, Florida, told Bloomberg. 'They recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it.' Big shop of horrors: Walmart's US stores have suffered one violent crime a day this year. Cops say there aren't enough staff, so criminals and troublemakers aren't deterred Trouble: In June two women (left) were filmed fighting in a Florida Walmart; in July a thief (right) drove into an Arizona employee in his mobility scooter while fleeing Problems: Port Richey police captain Bill Ferguson told Fox News that Walmart 'recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it.' The company says it is trying to improve Scott left Walmart in 2009, but the drive to reduce costs has continued. Walmart has dropped its greeters, who acted as a theft deterrent, and replaced checkouts with customer-operated scanners.  That's meant increased profits: since 2006, sales per employee went up 23 per cent to $236,804. But the increase in profits has been matched by an increase in crime, critics say; for example, cops were called out to four Tulsa Walmarts a total of 2,000 times last year alone. The city's one Target store had 44 call-outs. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next EXCLUSIVE: Insurers battling Walmart over 'exorbitant' $90... Pet monkey in a diaper breaks free from its owner and goes... Share this article Share Police believe reduced staff numbers are to blame. It now has 524sqft of retail space for every one worker, a 19 per cent increase on 2006. 'It’s ridiculous - we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world,' said Tulsa police sergeant Robert Rohloff. 'I may have half my squad there for hours.' Cost-cutting: Walmart has been cutting costs since 2000, and now has 19 per cent more square feet of floor per staff member than in 2006. Cops say less staff means more crime And news reports of violent encounters, thefts and other problems at Walmart stores are only too common. In July a DVD thief died in a Florida Walmart while being restrained, and in June a Walmart employee in Texas took three people hostage before being shot by cops. Also from the past two months: an Arizona thief in a mobility scooter knocked over a staff member then fled, two men allegedly sold heroin in a Pennsylvania Walmart, and a meth lab was found in the sewer under a Walmart parking lot in New York. 'Dealers': Cops said in May these men sold drugs in a Pennsylvania Walmart. Walmart started an anti-crime campaign last year, but is using current staff rather than hiring many more Meth lab: Police investigate a meth lab under a New York Walmart's parking lot. Walmart would have to spend $3.25billion if it wanted to have as many staff-per-sqft as it had in 2006 But possibly most famous is a fight between two women in a Beech Grove, Indiana, Walmart that climaxed with one telling her six-year-old son to punch the other.  'Walmart Beech Grove is draining our police resources,' Dennis Buckley, mayor of Beech Grove, told Fox News shortly afterward. 'It's the string of terrible events that have been occurring down there over the past two months that have led me to instruct our police chief to declare the Walmart a public nuisance.' 'Nuisance': Dennis Buckley, mayor of Beech Grove, Florida, called Walmart a 'public nuisance' for its crime issues. Walmart says it 'understands' the need to 'do better' Police say they're being used to fill the holes left by Walmart's downsized staff. But estimates for hiring more security guards say it would cost the company half a billion dollars. And getting the employees-per-square-foot ratio back to 2006 levels would cost $3.25billion a year, around a quarter of Walmart's 2015 $14billion profit. Instead, the company says that it has all the staff it needs, and is focusing on retraining and redeploying them away from stock rooms and towards exits. It started a corporate campaign last year to reduce crime levels, and it says the campaign is working.  'We absolutely understand how important this is,' Judith McKenna, Walmart’s chief operating officer for the US, said.  'It is important for our associates, it is important for our customers and across the communities we serve. We can do better.'

As many Katrina survivors still note, Wal-Mart trucks arrived well before the Federal Emergency Management Agency did. Over the weekend, Wal-Mart was again among the large companies in Louisiana able to keep supply lines open and operations going despite catastrophe -- this time historic flooding that devastated whole communities and shut down major roadways. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Erica Jones said the corporation's emergency operations center in Bentonville, Ark., kicked into high gear late last week as forecast warnings of record rainfall started to roll in. Wal-Mart has about 30 locations in the affected area, including stores in the heavily flooded communities of Denham Springs and Baker. Jones said early planning included mapping alternate routes for trucks delivering to stores in and around Louisiana. Corporate meteorologists monitored the weather and helped inform plans. Preparations were made to ramp up shipments of essential supplies -- from bottled water to baby formula -- to the region as it became clear conditions would worsen. Jones said eight Wal-Mart stores were closed because of various levels of flooding and damage. As of Thursday (Aug. 18), five of those stores had re-opened. A key distribution center in Hammond also remained open. The Hammond center serves stores in Louisiana and south Mississippi. Jones said the current priority is ensuring Wal-Mart employees are healthy and taken care of and that trucks are safely re-routed to get to where they need to be. "We are shifting our resources to be able to work around the road closures and damage to facilities," Jones said. Big corporations have a clear motive in investing in disaster preparedness. Planning ahead minimizes the dent otherwise unpredictable natural disasters can make on revenues. And there's a sales advantage in being able to quickly get back to providing supplies and services to customers in a time of need. On the plus side, corporations can serve as a model for how disaster response should work. Experts point to Katrina. While FEMA's response was lethargic and inefficient, major companies ushered in needed supplies quickly. Last December, FEMA gathered public and private sector officials in New Orleans for its fifth annual Building Resilience conference, during which leaders swapped ideas to improve response measures. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate called businesses large and small an "essential member of the team" when it comes to disaster response. "The more resilient businesses are, the quicker they can recover and provide critical goods and services to help their communities rebuild," Fugate said in a release at the time. UPS, the world's largest logistics company, has more than 2,860 employees at 19 facilities in Louisiana handling small package business. UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said all UPS distribution centers were able to continue operations through the flooding, though there is now limited capacity at its facilities in four cities: Baton Rouge, Port Allen, Jeanerette and Gonzales. Like Wal-Mart, Rosenberg said UPS started planning to re-route trucks and packages scheduled to pass through south Louisiana late last week. Five company meteorologists track weather patterns all over the world from a UPS hub in Louisville, Ky. Distribution centers along the Gulf Coast have generators as a precaution for hurricane season. The company also has a phone hotline for employees in affected areas to call and check in. Rosenberg said packages that are delayed or can't be delivered because of flooding are being marked as such in the company's electronic tracking system. Packages will be held at distribution centers until delivery resumes or for a few days until they are claimed, she said. She noted UPS warehouses are typically slower this time of year, leaving enough room to store excess packages for the time being. As floodwaters recede, large companies shift to meeting customer needs. At UPS, the focus is getting delivery routes up and running as soon as possible and working with customers with high-priority deliveries -- for example, prescription drug orders, Rosenberg said. She added UPS is coordinating the transportation of trailers for the American Red Cross and for supply pickups at area shelters. After years of tracking disaster recovery, Jones said Wal-Mart supply managers can anticipate what a region needs as it moves from flood to recovery. In coming days, shipments will shift from diapers and water to cleanup items, including shovels, gloves and bleach. "Once it shifts from evacuation and immediate safety to more the recovery and cleanup, we know the supplies people are looking for," Jones said.

"At present, wholesale cash-and-carry companies account for around Rs 6,800 crore of FMCG sales in the country," said Vijay Udasi, senior VP at Nielsen India. "Not only that, the cash-and-carry business is growing at a faster clip than traditional wholesale business." Cash-and-carry or organised wholesale business is growing at 13%, compared to traditional wholesale businesses, which is expanding by around 7% annually. Cash-and-carry businesses in India are defined as mainly B2B (business-to-business) channels in which goods are sold from a wholesale warehouse such as Walmart's Best Price Modern Wholesale to kirana store owners, hotels, hospitals and canteens. The world's largest retailer Walmart, which runs a B2C (business-to-consumer) multi-brand retail business elsewhere, operates 21 cash-and-carry stores here because 100% FDI is not allowed in multi-brand retail. It plans to invest an additional $300 million to increase the number of its stores to 70 by 2020. Its rival Germany's Metro Cash & Carry has recently opened its 22nd store in Bengaluru and plans to set up another 28 over the next four years. There are others such as UK's cash-and-carry giant Booker, which operates around six stores in the country. Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail is the largest player in the space with over 40 stores under the Reliance Market brand name. However, French retailer Carrefour that operated five cash-and-carry stores here exited India, citing regulatory hurdles as the multi-brand retail segment remains shut for all practical purposes. "Several consumer goods manufacturers are also using the cash-and-carry model to supplement distribution, improve cost structure by leveraging trade margins," said Udasi. For instance, around 60% of the one million Walmart India members are kirana store owners. Interestingly, the product mix in the organised wholesale trade is led by non-food items such as toilet soaps, washing powders and refined oils, while the top moving items in traditional trade are biscuits, refined oils and salty snacks.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Aug 17, 2016 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images. The past decade hasn't been kind to retailers. Since the Great Recession, Amazon.com has taken a bigger and bigger slice of the merchandise pie, while brick-and-mortar players like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have seen their physical locations transform from assets to liabilities. All is not lost: Both companies remain solidly profitable and offer up significant and healthy dividends. But between Wal-Mart and Target, which is the better buy today? There's no definitive way to answer the question. But we can look at the two through three different lenses to get a feel for where they stand. Financial fortitude Investors often underappreciate the value of cash. While returning it to shareholders is more satisfying, keeping a substantial chunk of cash on hand is crucial for long-term survival, especially in retail. When you have cash, you have options in tough times -- you can outspend rivals, buy back shares on the cheap, and even make acquisitions. Debt does the opposite -- forcing you to limit your focus, potentially supply the market with more shares, and face the possibility of going bankrupt. Here's how Wal-Mart and Target stack up. It's important to note that Wal-Mart's $228 billion market cap is five times the size of Target's. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Wal-Mart $7.6 billion $50.6 billion $14.4 billion $17.7 billion Target $4.0 billion $14.2 billion $3.4 billion $3.1 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow are on a trailing twelve-month basis. While neither company has a debt or cash position to get excited about, both companies produce enough free cash flow to easily meet all of their debt obligations. But given that Target is valued at just one-fifth the size of Wal-Mart, its cash and debt positions are more advantageous than Wal-Mart's. While not a runaway winner, this tips the scales in Target's favor. Winner: Target. Sustainable competitive advantages Over a long enough time frame, no variable has a greater effect on the success of a company than its sustainable competitive advantages. Without them, competition eventually erodes the business until it becomes a simple commodity. Sadly for both of these companies, sustainable competitive advantages are hard to come by. In the past, Wal-Mart had unmatched pricing power. Today, more and more customers are doing their shopping from home, which means both Wal-Mart and Target are facing significant headwinds. In my opinion, neither of these two have moats worth writing home about, so they'll end in a tie. Winner: Tie. Valuation Finally, we come to probably the most difficult answer to pin down: How expensive is each stock? Here are four different ways to evaluate this. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Wal-Mart 16 13 0.47 5.2 Target 16 14 0.62 1.45 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, YCharts, E*Trade. P/E = price to earnings; P/FCF = price to free cash flow; P/S = price to sales; PEG = price/earnings to growth. On almost every metric, these two look equally valued -- though analysts clearly think Wal-Mart is facing more challenges in the future, given its elevated PEG ratio. Another variable worth considering is each company's dividend. Wal-Mart currently yields 2.7% while using 40% of its free cash flow to pay shareholders. Target, on the other hand, yields 3.2% while using 44% of its free cash flow to do so. Both of these dividends are healthy, but Target's is clearly more enticing. When we combine this with Wal-Mart's elevated PEG ratio, Target once again comes out on top. Winner: Target. I'm not excited about either Between these two, Target comes out ahead. But I would caution any investor about investing in these companies over the long haul. E-commerce is killing middle-of-the-road retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. Lower-end stores like Dollar General will likely continue to be prevalent, as well as high-end purveyors like Giorgio Armani, where clients simply like the shopping experience. But for convenience, Middle America is flocking to e-commerce. The result is that these companies are looking to fundamentally change the way they do business -- and that is a very difficult thing to do.

Walmart locations have been host to crimes from shoplifting to stabbing, manslaughter, and attempting kidnapping in 2016, report Shannon Pettypiece and David Voreacos at Bloomberg.  From housing meth labs to shootings, police stations across the country told Bloomberg that Walmart locations have become a hotbed for crime. "It’s ridiculous — we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world," Tulsa police sergeant, Robert Rohloff, told Bloomberg, saying that the retailer forces taxpayers to pay for the police to do work that Walmart should be paying security to do. Worse, Bloomberg argues that the crime is a result of corporate policies. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT It's a result that drove profits — the article states that sales per employee in the US grew 23% in the last decade, to $236,804. However, it has also contributed to lawsuits against the chain, with plaintiffs arguing that Walmart did not provide enough sufficient security to prevent crimes and should be held accountable. Walmart told Bloomberg that the company realizes it has a problem, and that it is taking action. However, until it does, the crime problem could be a huge issue for the budget retailer. © Provided by Business Insider walmart close 9 With the growth of e-commerce, many chains are focusing on making the in-person shopping experience more enjoyable to draw customers to their locations. If its shopping experience is not only not enjoyable, but also unsafe, Walmart is at serious risk of losing customers to online competitors as well as retailers focusing on improving their in-store experiences. Even ignoring the issue of lawsuits, Walmart's reputation as a hotbed for violent crime is a dangerous one that the retailer needs to shake — fast. To read the full Bloomberg story, click here.

Kim LaCapria Updated: Aug 17, 2016 Share - - Claim: A customer discovered a deceased and discarded baby in a Kentucky Walmart's discount DVD bin. false Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2016] Came across a news story about a dead baby found in a Walmart bin. Nothing else shows up regarding this story when searching online, not sure if this is true. Origin:On 13 August 2016, the web site Associated Media Coverage reported published a disturbing account of the purported discovery of a deceased and discarded newborn baby girl in a "discount DVD bin" at a Kentucky Walmart: 42-year old Diane Jessop received the surprise of her life while shopping at her local Roy County, Kentucky, Walmart Saturday morning. According to police statements, Mrs. Jessop was sorting through the store’s discount DVD bin in attempt to find a few movies to give her granddaughter on her upcoming birthday when she discovered a lifeless newborn buried in the middle of the bin. According to on-scene witnesses, several customers made their way to the DVD bin when they heard Mrs. Jessop scream and call for help. Jessop told police that as she was sorting through the DVD’s she saw what appeared to be a small foot. The bin was in close proximity to the store’s toy isle so Mrs. Jessop initially assumed that someone had placed a doll in the bin. It wasn’t until she grabbed the foot and pulled the body from the pile of DVD’s that she realized that it was not a baby doll, but the body of a lifeless newborn girl. Local police and responding paramedics confirmed that the child had been dead for approximately 48-hours and was estimated to be around 2-months old. If it seemed unlikely a legitimate news outlet would describe such a tragic and gruesome discovery as the "surprise of [someone's] life," that's because the claim was one of many hoax articles published by Associated Media Coverage. The problem of fatal newborn abandonment is tragically real, but the story as reported was entirely fabricated. Associated Media Coverage typically spreads false alarms about non-existent laws and statutes, including stories about a motorcycle curfew in March 2016, a motorcycle speed ban in August 2016, a looming FDA e-juice ban not long after, and a claim about several jurisdictions codifying a "two pet maximum" ordinance.  But Associated Media Coverage has expanded its scope into darker fabrications, promulgating upsetting falsehoods about a transgender bathroom controversy-related shooting (while the issue was a hot-button one nationwide) and falsely asserting Casey Anthony was opening a home daycare center. Although many fake news sites feature disclaimers informing readers their content is not to be taken as real news, Associated Media Coverage does not.  Last updated: 17 August 2016 Originally published: 17 August 2016 Tags: walmart abandoned newborn associated media coverage Kim LaCapria Kim LaCapria is a New York-based content manager and longtime snopes.com message board participant.

The Arkansas-based retailer is adding a free online grocery service to five local Walmart Supercenters. Similar to Kroger’s Clicklist, customers don’t even have to get out of the car for pickup. To place your order, customers can click here or download the Walmart Grocery mobile app. Once you enter your zip code, you can select the nearest store and choose a time for pick up. According to Walmart, highly-trained personal shoppers carefully select the produce, meats, and other items each customer requested. Once a customer arrives at the pickup location, there will be reserved parking spaces marked in orange, and a designated number to call to alert an associate when you arrive. “Our customers have told us that grocery pickup is a game changer. They are now able to complete their grocery shopping in a matter of minutes – between errands, or on their way home from an after school activity– without even unbuckling their seat belts,” said Robert Tomboli, Memphis area eCommerce Coach. Walmart’s grocery pickup service features 30,000 items. Walmart said more than 90 percent of customer are choosing to add fresh meat, dairy, or produce to their baskets. The other top items selected by grocery pickup shoppers include after school snacks, diapers, and large dog food bags. In the greater Memphis area, Walmart will also offer regional brands and items such as Charlie Vergos Memphis Original Hot Barbecue Sauce, Pringles Memphis BBQ Potato Crisps, and Corky’s Fudge Pie for pickup. Walmart says all the prices will be the same as if you went to the store. The stores where online grocery pickup is now available include: 8453 U.S. Hwy. 51 N., Millington, TN 38053 577 Germantown Pkwy., Memphis, TN 38018 798 W.

By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Published:August 18, 2016 1:42 am US retail giant Walmart and one of the world’s largest food companies based out of Brazil are interested in setting up stores in India following the government’s decision to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the marketing of locally-produced food items, food processing secretary Avinash Srivastava said on Wednesday. Walmart is interested in setting up its own retail stores, but the Brazilian company may go for a local partner, he said. Though Srivastava refused to name the Brazilian company, his statement came amid speculations BRF Brasil may tie up with the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group. However, the companies are yet to apply to the government for permission to set up their stores here. While Walmart is the world’s largest retailer, BRF is a global leader in exporting animal protein and on producing food items that are supplied to over 150 countries. BRF has more than 105,000 employees across 35 units in Brazil, 16 abroad and 40 distribution centres. Speaking on the occasion to highlight the achievements of the food processing sector under the Centre’s ‘Make in India’ programme, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) secretary Ramesh Abhishek said the sector has received FDI of $1.04 billion between April 2014 and March 2016. This has driven up the overall FDI in the sector to $6.82 billion between April 2000 and March 2016, accounting for 2.36 per cent of the total FDI received by the country across sectors during the period. At least 14 foreign firms have invested above $15 million each (in the range of $16.16-200 million) over the last two years, Abhishek said. Similarly, at least four domestic companies, including Patanjali Ayurved, are investing. He added that this was not an exhaustive list. Top investor Linde Group has invested $200 million in the seafood segment in Andhra Pradesh, while US food major Mondelez International has set up a manufacturing plant with an investment of $190 million, with a capacity of 2,50,000 tonnes in that state again. Mars International (India), one of the largest chocolate makers, has spent $114.63 million in its Pune plant. Among domestic companies, Patanjali is planning to invest Rs 500 crore in a food processing unit in Madhya Pradesh for which the state government has cleared 400 acres of land. Balaji Wafers, a snacks manufacturer, is investing Rs 414 crore in a manufacturing plant. In June, the DIPP notified that 100 per cent FDI will be permitted in trading — including through e-commerce — of food products produced or manufactured in India, subject to the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). The decision to allow it was part of the government’s announcement in the 2016-17 Budget. “This will benefit farmers, give impetus to food processing industry and create vast employment opportunities,” finance minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech.

The decision is important as food and farm items worth Rs 92,000 crore go waste annually in India due to a low level of processing and inadequate infrastructure for scientific storage. India is the world’s largest producer of milk and the second-largest grower of rice, wheat, fruit and vegetables, but the processing level of such items stands at just 10 per cent. Srivastava said with the setting up of additional cold chains, with a storage capacity of 3.2 million tonnes, the government expects to reduce farm wastage by 10 per cent a year.

And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her.” In the video, the monkey is seen accosting the unidentified employee near the shopping cart disposal area for a few seconds, as the monkey’s owner runs over. “Let her go, let her go!” the woman can be heard shouting. “Did she bite you?” READ MORE: IKEA monkey awaiting arrival of new roommates as Ontario sanctuary expands Woman and monkey then retreat to the woman’s nearby trailer.

The company had expressed interest in entering processed-food retailing after the government had allowed, in June, 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail trading of food products, also through e-commerce, provided the goods are made in India. The company will join a slew of other international firms such as confectionary chain Mondelez International, chocolate maker Mars Inc, and cereal food maker Kellogg Company, that have invested in processed-food retailing over the past two financial years. Accounting for about nine per cent of gross domestic product, the food-processing sector received foreign direct investment (FDI) of over $1 billion in FY15 and FY16, food processing secretary Avinash K Srivastava said. The largest Brazilian poultry producer has also expressed interest in joining hands with Kishore Biyani's Future group to sell their products in the country, he added. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, in 2007 entered a supermarket joint venture with Bharti Enterprises, only to see it split in 2013. Currently, Walmart India operates 21 wholesale stores under the brand Best Price in nine states. The company has plans to open 50 more such stores by 2020. "The government allowing 100 per cent FDI in food processing will benefit farmers and boost the sector," Krish Iyer, president, Walmart India, said. "We are evaluating the model in line with the guidelines announced," he added. "To incentivise greater foreign investments, the government has made significant strides in building back-end infrastructure like cold storage and mega food parks," Srivastava said. A total of 3.2-million-tonne capacity of cold storage has been added, with the completion of 51 cold-chain storage projects since June 2014. Constructed at a total expenditure of more than Rs 9,000 crore, the storage projects are expected to reduce domestic wastage of agricultural produce by 10 per cent. India is the largest milk producer and second-largest producer of fruit and vegetables in the world. However, it has very limited integrated cold- chain infrastructure and storage facilities, which cause up to 16 per cent of such produce to be wasted. The government is aiming to reduce wastage by up to 50 per cent within the next two years. Also, eight new mega food parks have been opened in the past two years, with 34 more sanctioned. Each facility is expected to generate total employment for up to 6,000 people and benefit 25,000 to 30,000 farmers. Fiscal benefits such as reduced excise duty of six per cent from the earlier 10 per cent on food processing and packaging machinery and 100 per cent income tax exemption on profits for the first five years to food processing units have also been introduced.

Twisted, blemished, mutated and deformed, to be specific. That’s because an increasing number of grocery chains and crop-sharing services have begun stocking and distributing fruits and vegetables once deemed unfit for sale based solely on appearance. To be clear, these goods aren’t damaged or rotten or distasteful. If a chef chopped them up and served them in a souffle, most would never know the difference. Their banishment from shelves was purely produce prejudice. In recent years, a small number of eco-conscious consumers have begun buying imperfect produce, often at discounted prices, in an effort to chip away at the planet’s staggering level of food waste. Now, the buy-ugly movement has been thrust into the mainstream. Walmart, the nation’s largest grocer with more than 4,000 produce-selling stores, announced in July it would sell less-than-pretty apples in 300 stores across Florida. This builds on an ugly-potato program the retail behemoth launched in Britain earlier this year. By virtue of its size, when Walmart makes a change, the broader retail sector notices. The company commands a massive and global supply chain and possesses tremendous purchasing power, a combination that allows it to disrupt traditional distribution channels and create demand for products where there once was none. And food is big business for Walmart. Groceries accounted for 56 percent of all sales in the company’s U.S. stores each of the past three years, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Walmart’s program “is a result of working with our suppliers to build the infrastructure and processes that create a new home for perfectly imperfect produce,” Shawn Baldwin, Walmart’s senior vice president for global food sourcing, produce and floral, wrote on the company’s blog. “Because ugly produce can occur unexpectedly in any growing season or crop, we want to have the systems in place to offer this type of produce whenever it may occur.” Walmart is hardly alone in its embrace of ugly fruits and vegetables. Whole Foods has sold similar goods in the past, but it does not have the mass market reach of Walmart. And getting U.S. consumers to buy flawed produce has not been easy. Shoppers, particularly Americans, have long fixated on food with visual appeal in addition to (or instead of) nutritional value. There’s a reason the food that appears in television and magazine advertisements look like modern still-life paintings, meticulously crafted by professional stagers to the point of defying reality. European shoppers, by contrast, have been pioneers in food conservation and buying ugly. Britain has conducted a “Love Food Hate Waste” campaign since at least 2007, and the European Union has pledged to cut its food waste in half over the next decade. Winning acceptance for ugly produce is just one tactic being pursued in Europe to meet that goal. Others see a moneymaking opportunity; a grocery store in Denmark called WeFood sells only discounted food that is either misshapen or past its stated expiration date. Our vanity contributes to America’s waste epidemic. No matter how you slice it, the United States throws away tons of edible food every year. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that 40 percent of food grown and produced in the United States each year goes uneaten. More fruit and vegetables are wasted than any other food category, with 52 percent being lost rather than consumed. There are many factors that lead to this waste. Some food may simply spoil before it’s sold or fail to meet standards set by the Agriculture Department for consumable goods sold in the United States. Retailers also have guidelines for produce they are willing to shelve, and those guidelines are often more stringent than the government regulations. For its part, the food industry has made efforts to eliminate some of this waste by selling misshapen produce as ingredients in other foods, said Kathy Means, vice president of industry relations at the Produce Marketing Association. Strawberries may be mashed into jam, for example. Baby-cut carrots were invented in 1986 as a way to repurpose full-size carrots that weren’t considered grocery-store caliber. “It still is a huge challenge to get people to understand that ugly fruits and vegetables are perfectly fine to eat, and that it’s good for our planet,” said Evan Lutz, the chief executive of Hungry Harvest. Founded in 2014, the company makes weekly shipments of store-rejected produce to homes around the Mid-Atlantic. And when the package arrives, the contents don’t always look like a middle-school science project. Sometimes perfectly normal produce can be rejected by stores for logistical reasons and could wind up in a landfill if not for alternative sellers such as Hungry Harvest. “People are really surprised often times when they get their box [of ugly produce]. It’s really the same stuff you would find in the grocery store,” Lutz said.

Li View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) August 17, 2016 | 2:44pm Modal Trigger Pasquale "Pat" Brocco before and after his dramatic weight loss. Photo: Facebook More On: weight loss Fitness guru who fat-shamed moms admits to weight gain My peanut butter addiction made me fat We used hip-hop to lose 160 pounds How I dropped 110 pounds for my wedding photos It’s the Walmart diet! Pasquale “Pat” BroccoPhoto: Facebook An Arizona man dropped more than 300 pounds — by walking a mile to Walmart to buy his food every time he got hungry. “You walk to Walmart three times a day and you end up walking six miles,” said 31-year-old Pasquale “Pat” Brocco, who three years ago, weighed a gargantuan 605 pounds. “It’s amazing because I never walked six miles in my life and I was doing it every day.” Suffering from high blood pressure and off the charts cholesterol, Brocco knew he needed to take charge of his waistline. “My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here,” Brocco told ABC News showing a photo he snapped of his massive self. “I was disgusted.” When doctors told Brocco he was on the fast track to a graveyard, he decided to make radical changes – such as throwing out junk food and dairy in favor of vegetables, brown rice, quinoa, steel cut oatmeal and lean meats. He decided he was going to work for his food — by schlepping on foot from his pad in Avondale, Ariz., to his local Walmart every time his stomach growled. Pasquale “Pat” BroccoPhoto: Facebook And back then, it growled quite a bit, he admitted. But he never gave in to the temptation to buy ready-made junk — instead loading up on the healthy grub, and cooking it up once he returned home. And the pounds melted away – about 200 less in the first two years. That initial weight loss opened new doors for the man once known as “Fat Pat” – doors to the gym. “I mean, at 600 pounds I couldn’t even go to the gym,” Brocco said. “I didn’t fit on the machines.” He incorporated uphill treadmill walks and weightlifting to his Walmart diet, leading to an overall drop of 330 pounds. “I’m setting an example for my son, so he can be ‘Possible Pat’ too (instead of `Fat Pat’),” said a tearful Brocco.

Food processing secretary A K Srivastava said over $1 billion FDI has come in food processing sector during the last two years and with the government now permitting 100 per cent foreign investment in marketing of processed food produced and manufactured in India, "Walmart is showing lot of interest". Also, a leading Brazilian poultry company has expressed keen interest in joining hands with Kishore Biyani's Future Group to sell their products in the country, he said but did not identify the company or give details. "The government this year announced 100 per cent FDI in the retail trading of food products produced and manufactured in India. Now this we hope will give a big boost to the food processing sector," he told reporters. Walmart, which previously had tied up with Bharti Group to enter retailing in India, "is already showing lot of interest, he said. "Now we are hoping that they will come on their own and they will add to the growth story of this country". "We recently had meetings with all the ambassadors of the important countries and we have asked them to give this message to their food processing players. We have meeting with industry associations. We have informed them about this initiative. We have asked them to bring players who can invest in India," he said. The official said a Brazilian company "claiming to be world's leading exporter in poultry sector met us yesterday. They want to tie up with Biyani's Future Group to use their retail outlets." However, when contacted, a Future Group spokesperson said there is no such development. The US-based Walmart is present in the cash-and-carry retail format in the country. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Linde Group investment of $200 million in seafood segment in Andhra Pradesh; US-based Mondelez International has inaugurated its new manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh. This plant has been set up with an investment of Rs 1,265 crore (Rs 12.65 billion) with an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes. Mars International India, a leading chocolate maker, has invested $114.63 million in Pune. With a total investment of $33.96 million, Kellogg's unit in Andhra Pradesh provides job to 500 persons. The company is also planning to set up an R&D facility and their third cereal facility in Mumbai. Major investments in the last two years by domestic companies include Patanjali Ayurveda. The company is planning to set up Rs 500 crore (Rs 5 billion) food processing unit in Madhya Pradesh. The state has cleared 400 acres of land for this. It is expected to provide jobs to about 700 people. Photographer: Finbarr O'Reilly/Reuters © Copyright 2016 PTI. All rights reserved.

The company already has single-stall bathrooms anyone can use at about 1,400 of its 1,800 stores, Target spokesperson Katie Boylan said. The report directly blamed the drop in shopper traffic at least partly on the retailer’s “transgender-friendly” bathroom policy, which the retailer does not intend to alter. Target shoppers will still be allowed to “use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.” However, Boylan said Target decided to add single-stall, lockable bathrooms in all of its stores “because we’re listening.” The transgender bathroom policy announced in April prompted hundreds of thousands of people to sign petitions and pledges to avoid the retailer. Company officials downplayed the impact of the customer reaction in May when the next quarter report revealed plunging numbers and again this week when the numbers fell further. Cathy Smith, the company’s chief financial officer, admitted in a media briefing this week “some of our guests like and some dislike our inclusive bathroom policy.” The company will work on the renovations until November then shut down work over the Christmas shopping period and resume after the holiday. Are you sick of all the bathroom bullies? Sign WND’s petition and say no to transgender bathroom and dressing room madness! Fortune reported that while Smith “did not say whether the backlash had cost it some business, the announcement of the bathroom policy came at a time pressure on Target was already building from a number of directions.” “For one thing, Target lost quite a bit of shopper traffic in the second quarter because of the disruption from the transition of the pharmacy business it sold last year to CVS Health …  (CVS has undertaken an aggressive marketing campaign to lure customers to its pharmacies within Target stores.) Target also got dinged by a 20 percent drop in Apple … products and customers not taking to its fresh grocery offering,” Fortune said. “So the last thing Target needed was to alienate any of customer base, given that it is a $75 billion-a-year retailer that caters to a wide swathe of America, including socially conservative shoppers.” At the American Thinker, Sierra Rayne pointed out that since April 19, Target “has massively underperformed its main competitors, including Costco, Walmart, Dollar General and Dollar Tree.” The report said Costco’s “market cap change is unchanged from April 19, Walmart is up 1 percent, Dollar General has increased 8.7 percent and Dollar Tree has seen as 11.2 percent rise in market cap over this period. In sharp contrast, Target’s market cap has seen a 20.8 percent decline. “With its pre-‘transgender’ policy stock trend best correlating with Walmart’s, Target’s market cap should currently be up at least one percent relative to the April 19 value, rather than 21 percent down.” The report said, “As a result, the direct costs of the boycott are now at $11 billion and growing.” USA Today notedy Target’s second-quarter earnings fell 9.7 percent to $680 million. Target cited a “difficult retail environment,” and the report said, “Shares of Target fell 6.7 percent in pre-market trading to $70.42.” The Daily Beast noted Smith “did not make the correlation” with the bathroom policy. However, it said, “analysts believe the slump is partially due to shoppers unhappy with the company’s declared ‘pro-inclusivity’ bathroom policy allowing transgender individuals to use the restrooms matching their gender identity.” WND reported in July that, fulfilling the fears of Target policy critics, a man named Sean Patrick Smith, who “identifies as a woman by the name of Shauna Patricia Smith,” was arrested after allegedly taking photographs of women inside a Target dressing room in Ammon, Idaho. The practice has been opposed by groups such as the American Family Association, which launched a petition signed by more than 1.3 million demanding a reversal of the open-door policy. And Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, issued a scathing criticism of Target over what he called a policy that “encourages sexual predators and puts women and children in danger,” as WND reported. WND tracked the alarming trend, reporting incidents of peeping toms at Targets in North Dakota, Massachusetts, Texas and Ohio. According to a 16-year-old girl who visited a Target in Bismarck, North Dakota, a man positioned a phone camera under her door. “When she walked out, the man entered a different dressing room,” reported reported WDAY in Fargo, North Dakota. Are you sick of all the bathroom bullies? Sign WND’s petition and say no to transgender bathroom and dressing room madness! Police looked for another peeping tom in Revere, Massachusetts, who reportedly spied on a 17-year-old girl changing in a Target dressing room. Police provided still photos of the suspect they said was a white male in his 30s with brown hair and a white button-down shirt. He drove a Toyota Prius. Also in May at a Frisco, Texas, Target, a 29-year-old man, Charles Sidney McKissack III, was caught by police after he reportedly used his cell phone to film an underage girl in the women’s dressing room. “Investigators say the suspect put his cell phone over the wall of a female changing room and shot video of the girl,” according to Fox 4 in Dallas. He ran off after the girl saw the camera, but police released footage of him captured by a store camera. And in April, Joshua Sheldon, 33, pleaded guilty to voyeurism in Miami Township, Ohio, after he reportedly looked under a women’s dressing room door in Target. Sheldon was sentenced to 90 days in jail and ordered to pay a $380 fine. He is required to register as a sex offender and stay away from Target stores for two years. Shortly after the new policy and petition, Target’s stock fell from $83.98 per share to $81.33, in just a few hours, as WND previously reported. It then took to even lower levels and has yet to recover.

Food Processing Secretary A K Srivastava said over USD 1 billion FDI has come in food processing sector during the last two years and with the government now permitting 100 per cent foreign investment in marketing of processed food produced and manufactured in India, "Walmart is showing lot of interest". Also, a leading Brazilian poultry company has expressed keen interest in joining hands with Kishore Biyani's Future Group to sell their products in the country, he said but did not identify the company or give details. "The government this year announced 100 per cent FDI in the retail trading of food products produced and manufactured in India. Now this we hope will give a big boost to the food processing sector," he told reporters here. Walmart, which previously had tied up with Bharti Group to enter retailing in India, "is already showing lot of interest, he said. "Now we are hoping that they will come on their own and they will add to the growth story of this country". "We recently had meetings with all the ambassadors of the important countries and we have asked them to give this message to their food processing players. We have meeting with industry associations. We have informed them about this initiative. We have asked them to bring players who can invest in India," he said. The official said a Brazilian company "claiming to be world's leading exporter in poultry sector met us yesterday. They want to tie up with Biyani's Future Group to use their retail outlets." However, when contacted, a Future Group spokesperson said there is no such development. The US-based Walmart is present in the cash-and-carry retail format in the country. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Linde Group investment of USD 200 million in seafood segment in Andhra Pradesh; US-based Mondelez International has inaugurated its new manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh. This plant has been set up with an investment of Rs 1,265 crore with an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes. Mars International India, a leading chocolate maker, has invested USD 114.63 million in Pune. With a total investment of USD 33.96 million, Kellogg's unit in Andhra Pradesh provides job to 500 persons. The company is also planning to set up an R&D facility and their third cereal facility in Mumbai. Major investments in the last two years by domestic companies include Patanjali Ayurveda. The company is planing to set up Rs 500 crore food processing unit in Madhya Pradesh. The state has cleared 400 acres of land for this. It is expected to provide jobs to about 700 people. (REOPENS DCM 106) "As we have said earlier, the decision by the government to allow 100 per cent FDI under government approval route, including through e-commerce in trading of food products manufactured and/or produced in India is very progressive and far reaching," said Krish Iyer, President and CEO, Walmart India. He said this step will help in reducing wastage, assist farm diversification and encourage industry to produce within the country. "This move will benefit farmers, give impetus to food processing industry and create vast employment opportunities in the country. We are evaluating the model as per the guidelines announced," Iyer added.

In fact, our newest Alibaba stock price prediction shows shares quadrupling from here. Before we share our latest BABA stock prediction, here's why the Alibaba stock price is outperforming the markets lately… Alibaba Group Holdings Inc. (NYSE: BABA) shares have been climbing since reporting strong Q2 2016 results on Aug. 11. The Alibaba stock price hit a 52-week high of $92.76 after posting much better than expected Q2 results. Earnings per share of $0.74 easily beat the expected $0.63. Revenue rose 59% to $4.84 billion. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), the amount of money spent over its platforms, climbed 24.4%. Mobile revenue in China surged 119.3% to 17.51 billion yuan ($2.6 billion). Monthly mobile active users soared 39%. The company achieved a major milestone during the quarter when it recorded higher monetization of mobile users than non-mobile users for the first time. In the week following earnings, the Alibaba stock price continued to climb, setting a new 52-week high of $98.86. And earnings aren't the only reason the Alibaba stock price is soaring. The company's global expansion plans have been another major catalyst… Urgent: This penny stock could double its current price – and also save a dying industry. Click here to learn more… In April, Alibaba purchased Singapore-based online retailer Lazada Group for about $1 billion to boost its presence in Southeast Asia. Last year, the company launched a Netflix-like streaming business. Alibaba has also been venturing into cloud computing and driverless vehicles. Paid users to Alibaba's cloud business increased to 577,000 in Q2 from 263,000 last year. Revenue in that segment jumped 156%. And we're not the only ones with huge Alibaba stock price predictions. The average 12-month price target among analysts is now $107.89. That would be a gain of 12.2% from today's opening price. But we think those Alibaba stock price predictions are much too conservative. Money Morning Executive Editor Bill Patalon is looking far past the next 12 months, and he sees BABA soaring… "I don't care what the stock does over the next six months, year, or even 18 months," Patalon said. "I'm gunning for much bigger gains." Here's why he sees the stock quadrupling from here… Why the Alibaba Stock Price Will Return Massive Long-Term Gains Join the conversation.

Food Processing Secretary A K Srivastava said over USD 1 billion FDI has come in food processing sector during the last two years and with the government now permitting 100 per cent foreign investment in marketing of processed food produced and manufactured in India, "Walmart is showing lot of interest". Also, a leading Brazilian poultry company has expressed keen interest in joining hands with Kishore Biyani's Future Group to sell their products in the country, he said but did not identify the company or give details. "The government this year announced 100 per cent FDI in the retail trading of food products produced and manufactured in India. Now this we hope will give a big boost to the food processing sector," he told reporters here. Walmart, which previously had tied up with Bharti Group to enter retailing in India, "is already showing lot of interest, he said. "Now we are hoping that they will come on their own and they will add to the growth story of this country". "We recently had meetings with all the ambassadors of the important countries and we have asked them to give this message to their food processing players. We have meeting with industry associations. We have informed them about this initiative. We have asked them to bring players who can invest in India," he said. The official said a Brazilian company "claiming to be world's leading exporter in poultry sector met us yesterday. They want to tie up with Biyani's Future Group to use their retail outlets." However, when contacted, a Future Group spokesperson said there is no such development. The US-based Walmart is present in the cash-and-carry retail format in the country. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Linde Group investment of USD 200 million in seafood segment in Andhra Pradesh; US-based Mondelez International has inaugurated its new manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh. This plant has been set up with an investment of Rs 1,265 crore with an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes. Mars International India, a leading chocolate maker, has invested USD 114.63 million in Pune. With a total investment of USD 33.96 million, Kellogg's unit in Andhra Pradesh provides job to 500 persons. The company is also planning to set up an R&D facility and their third cereal facility in Mumbai. Major investments in the last two years by domestic companies include Patanjali Ayurveda. The company is planing to set up Rs 500 crore food processing unit in Madhya Pradesh. The state has cleared 400 acres of land for this. It is expected to provide jobs to about 700 people.

Q2 Earnings Call May Offer Insight, Timeline The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} August 17, 2016 10:45am   Comments Share: When Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reports Q2 earnings ahead of the market open on Thursday, analysts and investors already will be braced for a decline in profit amid top-line sales that are expected to be relatively flat compared to last year. What they’ll really want to know about is the e-commerce strategy of the world’s largest retailer. That’s important in its own right, given the stiff and growing competition brick-and-mortar retailers face regularly with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). WMT analysts say they want to hear more color behind the recent announcement that WMT purchased Jet.com, which promotes itself as a lower-priced alternative to AMZN, for $3.3 billion. The cash-and-stock deal is an attempt to help WMT grow its e-commerce site, the company said in a press release. WMT’s online business generates about $14 billion in sales, large by most accounts but still much smaller than AMZN’s $100 billion enterprise. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," Chief Executive Doug McMillon, said in the release. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. “Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time,” he added. “Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But analysts say they want to know how WMT will integrate and position the business into its e-commerce platform even though the company said the two brands would stay distinct. Will the acquisition be accretive to or sap earnings? If a drain, what’s the timeline for profitability? How does WMT see itself competing against AMZN with this purchase? How quickly can it ramp up staff, cut overlap and integrate cultures, something some analysts suggest might be challenging given the startup’s looser ethos? Beyond that, analysts also want to know how WMT is dealing with its self-imposed rising labor costs. Last year, WMT upped its hourly wage to $10 an hour from $9 and instituted new training, moves its chief financial officer warned investors would subtract some $1.5 billion from profits this year. Do those projections still hold? Executives have said that Q2 same-store sales, a key growth measure in the retail industry, would rise for the eighth straight quarter, at around 1%. Are the store improvements paying off? At Thomson Reuters, the analyst consensus stands at $1.02 per-share profit, down roughly 6% from year-ago earnings. Revenues are projected to be flat, coming in at $120.37 billion from $120.22 billion last year. Short-term options traders have priced in a 3% potential share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform by TD Ameritrade.

By Shannon Pettypiece and David Voreacos | August 17, 2016 Photographs by Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek From Officer Ross: “I’ve got all my bad guys in one place.” Darrell Ross—Officer Walmart to his colleagues in the Tulsa Police Department—operates for up to 10 hours a day out of the security office of a Walmart Supercenter in the city’s northeast corner. It’s a small, windowless space with six flatscreen monitors mounted on a pale blue cinder-block wall, and on this hot summer day, the room is packed. Four Walmart employees watch the monitors, which toggle among the dozens of cameras covering the store and parking lot, while doing paperwork and snacking on Cheez Whiz and Club Crackers. In a corner of the room, an off-duty sheriff’s officer, hired by Walmart, makes small talk with the employees. As soon as Ross walks in the door, around 2 p.m., he’s presented with an 18-year-old who tried to leave the store with a microwave oven. Ross focuses his gaze and talks in a low voice to the young man, who just graduated from high school and plans to go into the military. He also attempts to calm the boy’s mother, who rushed to the store and is worried that her son won’t be able to enlist if he gets a criminal record. “You need to start taking responsibility for your actions,” Ross tells the teenager. “You’re a man now.” He tells the mother that because it was the boy’s first offense, he won’t be arrested—but if he messes up twice more, he’ll be charged with a felony. Ross slips a pair of reading glasses out of his bulletproof vest and writes the young man a summons to appear in court. Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, August 22-28, 2016. Subscribe now. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek Before he can finish the paperwork, Walmart security employees catch another shoplifter. They bring in a middle-aged woman with big sunken eyes and pale cheeks, her hair tied in a messy bun. Employees caught her using phony gift cards. She rattles off excuses: The cards were given to her by a friend, she’s just gotten out of the hospital, she’s dehydrated. At one point she pretends to vomit into a trash can. Picking up the odor of pot, Ross takes a look in her handbag and finds marijuana roaches, along with a small scale and a pill bottle full of baggies. A computer check reveals five outstanding warrants for her arrest. It’s not unusual for the department to send a van to transport all the criminals Ross arrests at this Walmart. The call log on the store stretches 126 pages, documenting more than 5,000 trips over the past five years. Last year police were called to the store and three other Tulsa Walmarts just under 2,000 times. By comparison, they were called to the city’s four Target stores about 300 times. Most of the calls to the northeast Supercenter were for shoplifting, but there’s no shortage of more serious crimes, including five armed robberies so far this year, a murder suspect who killed himself with a gunshot to the head in the parking lot last year, and, in 2014, a group of men who got into a parking lot shootout that killed one and seriously injured two others. Police reports from dozens of stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. But people dashing out the door with merchandise is the least troubling part of Walmart’s crime problem. More than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings, and murders, have occurred at the nation’s 4,500 Walmarts this year, or about one a day, according to an analysis of media reports. Sometimes they’re spectacular enough to get national attention. In June, a SWAT team killed a hostage taker at a Walmart in Amarillo, Texas. In July, three Walmart employees in Florida were charged with manslaughter after a shoplifter they chased and pinned down died of asphyxia. Other crimes are just bizarre. On Aug. 8, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y. “It’s ridiculous—we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world. I may have half my squad there for hours” All this is still happening more than a year into a corporate campaign to bring down crime—a campaign Walmart says is succeeding. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who took charge of the giant retailer in February 2014, has made reducing crime a top priority. The company’s new strategy primarily involves shifting employees within stores—moving them from the storeroom and aisles to store exits, where some of them spot-check receipts. It’s also stationing people at self-checkout areas, installing eye-level security cameras in high-theft areas (particularly electronics and cosmetics departments), and using data analytics to detect when people try to get credit for things they didn’t buy (thieves love to find discarded receipts in the parking lot, then go into the store, gather up items on the list, and “return” them for cash). To cut down on calls to police, Walmart has been rolling out a program where first-time offenders caught stealing merchandise below a certain value can avoid arrest if they agree to go through a theft-prevention program. At some higher-crime stores, the company is also hiring off-duty police and private security officers. According to Walmart Stores executives, it’s all starting to work. Police chiefs and their officers on the ground say that’s just not so. Ross likes to joke that the concentration of crime at Walmart makes his job easier. “I’ve got all my bad guys in one place,” he says, flashing a bright smile. His squad’s sergeant, Robert Rohloff, a 34-year police veteran who has to worry about staffing, budgets, and patrolling the busiest commercial district in Tulsa, says there’s nothing funny about Walmart’s impact on public safety. He can’t believe, he says, that a multibillion-dollar corporation isn’t doing more to stop crime. Instead, he says, it offloads the job to the police at taxpayers’ expense. “It’s ridiculous—we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world,” says Rohloff. “I may have half my squad there for hours.” An employee in the Beech Grove, Ind., parking lot. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso Walmart knows police departments are frustrated. “We absolutely understand how important this is. It is important for our associates, it is important for our customers and across the communities we serve,” says Judith McKenna, Walmart’s chief operating officer for the U.S. “We can do better.” But when? That’s what law enforcement around the country wants to know. “The constant calls from Walmart are just draining,” says Bill Ferguson, a police captain in Port Richey, Fla. “They recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it.” There’s nothing inevitable about the level of crime at Walmart. It’s the direct, if unintended, result of corporate policy. Beginning as far back as 2000, when former CEO Lee Scott took over, an aggressive cost-cutting crusade led many stores to deteriorate. The famed greeters were removed, taking away a deterrent to theft at the porous entrances and exits. Self-checkout scanners replaced many cashiers. Walmart added stores faster than it hired employees. The company has one worker for every 524 square feet of retail space, a 19 percent increase in space per employee from a decade ago. In terms of profit, all this has worked: Sales per employee in the U.S. have grown 23 percent in the past decade, to $236,804. For criminals, however, the cutbacks were like sending out a message that no one at Walmart cared, no one was watching, and no one was likely to catch you. Fixing the problem comes down to money. When McMillon became CEO, he established an ambitious program to fix up long-neglected stores, starting with making them cleaner and stocking them better. Then, in early 2015, came a push to crack down on shoplifting. Experts say that should have additional public safety benefits: Less petty crime typically means less violent crime. Outside the Supercenter in Beech Grove. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso Police departments inevitably compare their local Walmarts with Target stores. Target, Walmart’s largest competitor, is a different kind of retail business, with mostly smaller stores that tend to be located in somewhat more affluent neighborhoods. But there are other reasons Targets have less crime. Unlike most Walmarts, they’re not open 24 hours a day. Nor do they allow people to camp overnight in their parking lots, as Walmarts do. Like Walmart, Target relies heavily on video surveillance, but it employs sophisticated software that can alert the store security office when shoppers spend too much time in front of merchandise or linger for long periods outside after closing time. The biggest difference, police say, is simply that Targets have more staff visible in stores. “Target doesn’t have these problems,” says Ferguson. “Part of it may be the lower prices at Walmart or where Walmart is located, but when I walk into Target I see uniformed security or someone walking around up front. You see no one at Walmart. It just seems like an easy target.” A Target spokeswoman declined to comment on the two companies’ security policies. A more apt comparison may be shopping centers, which like Walmarts are sprawling and attract thousands of shoppers a day. Unlike Walmart, shopping centers tend to invest heavily in uniformed security patrols and off-duty police. “Shopping centers all have security; they know it’s an expense, but one they know pays dividends because people feel safer going to their stores,” says J.R. Roberts, an independent consultant and a former director for risk management at Valor Security Services, a provider of security to shopping centers. “It doesn’t make any sense why Walmart wouldn’t apply this the way every mall does in the U.S.” “They simply lack the retail business background to understand how important security is” Walmart developed its current anticrime measures with the help of Read Hayes, director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, a kind of think tank funded by big retailers. Hayes’s specialty is the shopping environment, the retail aisles; he’s now searching, he says, for the right mix of new electronic surveillance and visual cues to tell would-be thieves they might get caught. “They need to recognize it, believe it, and be threatened by it,” he says. “My mantra is: See it, get it, fear it.” Hayes says Walmart is serious about bringing down crime. “They aren’t ignoring it,” he says. “They are right in the thick of it. But it’s a titanic company. It’s going to take a while. Go hang out in a Walmart. It’s just amazing. Sometimes, what happens in a store like a Walmart can be scary.” No one disputes that. The question is whether Walmart is moving as fast as it can. Its executives “could clean it up in a matter of a year were they to be given the financial support from the board,” says Burt Flickinger, managing director of retailing consultant Strategic Resource Group. Eight of the nine nonfamily members of the Walmart board come from academia or nonretail companies, including former PepsiCo CEO Steven Reinemund and Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. Three officers are members of the Walton family, including the chairman of the board, Gregory Penner, a venture capitalist who is the son-in-law of fellow board member Rob Walton, a son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. “The board doesn’t want profits to fall,” says Flickinger. “They simply lack the retail business background to understand how important security is.” No board member agreed to be interviewed for this story, but the company disputes that it puts profit before people. “Safety and security is a priority of our leadership team,” says McKenna. She says the company has the right level of security at its stores and is always evaluating its strategy and staffing. Flickinger says getting dramatic results wouldn’t be complicated. It would just cost a lot. He, like many other Walmart watchers, thinks McMillon is heading in the right direction with the changes he’s making, including spending $2.7 billion on higher wages and training to boost morale and attract higher-caliber employees. It just isn’t nearly enough, he says. He estimates the number of crimes at Walmart’s U.S. stores could be halved with the addition of 250,000 part-time employees on top of the more than 1 million full-time and part-time retail workers the company already has. Even that much new hiring wouldn’t get the company to the number of employees per square foot it had in 2006. The cost would be about $3.25 billion a year, or about a quarter of Walmart’s profit last year of $14 billion. Flickinger argues that Walmart can’t afford not to invest heavily to expand its workforce if it wants cleaner, more orderly, better-performing, and ultimately safer stores. “It pays for itself,” he says. “To get back to that high-performing level of the late 1990s, it’s going to take a lot more money.” Walmart rejects this view, saying it has all the workers it needs and merely has to better train them and continue redeploying workers according to its plan. Security experts say there’s another way to reduce crime: Hire much more security, including more off-duty, uniformed police. At $35 an hour, a typical rate in many cities, 12 hours of police coverage a day would cost each store about $150,000 a year. Multiply that by the company’s 3,500 Supercenters—the largest stores and the sites of most of the serious crime—and it would cost half a billion dollars a year. Walmart decides on the security budget for each store based in part on a database of how much crime happens on its properties. The company doesn’t share those figures. It also works with an outside data analysis company, Cap Index, which assigns each store a risk score, based on a determination of the likelihood of different types of crimes occurring there. The index relies on data including neighborhood demographics, local housing values, national and local crime statistics, and internal company records of theft. These scores range from zero to 2,000, with 100 being the average for a given county or state. A score of 1,000, for instance, would mean a crime is 10 times more likely to occur at a particular store than at a statistically typical address in that county or state. Walmart says it performs regular crime audits of its security measures and adjusts spending for each store. It won’t reveal the risk score for any individual store. According to laws in every state in the U.S., Walmart has a duty to protect its customers from violent crime while they’re on store property. Under an area of the law known as premise liability, victims and their lawyers have argued in hundreds of lawsuits that Walmart failed to provide enough security. To prevail, plaintiffs must prove that a violent crime was reasonably foreseeable based on a history of violent crimes at a particular Walmart. “They’re not easy cases,” says Memphis attorney Bruce Kramer, who has sued Walmart multiple times on behalf of clients who were the victims of violent crimes occurring on company property. “Proving what the duty is and the foreseeability issue is always difficult. You have a certain mindset of jurors who say, ‘Why are you holding the business responsible for the acts of this criminal?’ ” Walmart’s lawyers typically argue that the company couldn’t have foreseen the crime in question and that it took reasonable steps to keep customers safe. It tries at every opportunity to keep its crime database secret. Even in litigation, when it must produce company records under court seal, its lawyers have wrangled for months or even years to limit access to its records, arguing the information is proprietary. “Nothing compares to the way Walmart litigates cases,” says attorney Christopher Marlowe. He fought Walmart for several years over a lawsuit he filed in 2010 on behalf of a woman who was abducted outside a store in DeFuniak Springs, Fla., and repeatedly raped. Marlowe said in a court filing that he learned only in 2013 of the database, which documented “precisely the sort of incidents” he sought for more than two years. Walmart’s lawyer, he said, “led everyone to believe that crime data retrieval was a great mystery—a query of inconceivable proportions.” Walmart denied liability in the case. The company eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. Mayor Buckley of Beech Grove Photographer: Johnathon Kelso Dennis Buckley found a way to get Walmart moving faster on crime: shaming and threats. A blunt former fire chief, Buckley is the mayor of Beech Grove, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb with a population of 14,000. He’d been swamped with complaints from his police chief about the daily calls to Walmart. He demanded action from Walmart’s local lawyer, as did the City Council. Nothing happened. Then, in June of last year, Buckley reached his limit. He received news that a local woman had been killed and her grandson seriously injured in a car crash caused by a Walmart shoplifter fleeing police. Later that day, he learned his town had become a laughingstock. A YouTube video of a fight at the Beech Grove Walmart was going viral. It showed two women, one riding a motorized scooter, the other accompanied by a 6-year-old boy, in a furious fistfight that turned into a profane wrestling match in the shampoo aisle. The video also contained glimpses of jeering bystanders recording the action on their phones. By the time Buckley saw the video, it had been viewed millions of times. Enraged by the circus atmosphere around the video, he denounced Walmart on Facebook and in the local media. “The Beech Grove Walmart is NOT a good corporate partner,” he posted. The YouTube video “was embarrassing to the City of Beech Grove and the people who live in our beautiful city. Walmart should be ashamed of itself once again for failing to control the people who enter their store.” Regional Walmart executives asked for a meeting with Buckley and Craig Wiley, the city attorney. “You could tell by their body language that they came to the meeting with a very conciliatory tone, and they were going to get their arms around the problem,” Wiley says. Walmart promised to hire security and extend a fence on the rear of its property, which barred an easy exit for shoplifters into a retirement community. It said it would skip calling the cops for first-time offenders shoplifting merchandise valued below $50 if the shoplifter completes the company’s theft-prevention program. Buckley was pleased. But in the weeks following the meeting, Walmart dragged its heels. Buckley went public again, this time appearing on national cable news. “Walmart Beech Grove is draining our police resources,” he told Fox Business Network. “It’s the string of terrible events that have been occurring down there over the past two months that have led me to instruct our police chief to declare the Walmart a public nuisance.” That meant the threat of a $2,500 fine for every call to the police. Walmart now pays for off-duty police to man the store, and the pressure on the local police has eased. A year later, Buckley is pleased, but it still irks him that he had to go to such measures to get Walmart to act. “Cities really need to put their thumb down and get them to the table,” he says. “It’s taken a long time, but they can really be good partners if they want to be.” Ross Photographer: Johnathon Kelso The Tulsa Supercenter hasn’t had its happy ending. The store has seen several changes mandated by Walmart headquarters, including more visible security monitors, greeters at the doors, and changes to the self-checkout section, but Officer Ross says it’s business as usual. The mentality hasn’t changed; criminals still think of this store as theirs. And Ross knows the answers aren’t always simple. Three hours into his shift, security employees bring in a young woman who’d been wandering around the store with an older man. They’d spotted her slipping on a pair of $15 gray sneakers, then attempting to leave without paying. The woman, in capri leggings and a hoodie, is brought to Ross. She turns her head and reveals an enormous black eye on the left side of her face. Ross moves toward her, and she instinctively flinches—a telltale sign of domestic abuse, he later says. He tucks his hands inside his bulletproof vest and relaxes his broad shoulders, making himself seem a bit smaller, a bit less intimidating. “Is he the one who did this to you?” he asks, motioning to her eye. She knows who he’s talking about. She says yes, and her eyes well with tears. The dingy office, filled with jokes and light banter seconds before, falls silent. This little corner of the giant store has turned into a counseling center. As mascara and tears streak down her red cheeks, the woman apologizes for stealing. She talks about how she’s been an alcoholic for most of her 29 years, how her three kids live with their dad because she knows she can’t care for them. She says her current partner beat her two days ago because she took her kids to the pool and had “too much fun.” She’s going to counseling for her alcoholism. She was planning to go cook dinner for her children at their father’s house after she left Walmart. The woman with the phony gift cards and marijuana quietly tells her that she too was in an abusive relationship. They talk in murmurs. Ross writes the younger woman a summons to appear in court. It’s her first offense. She walks out with no shoes, because no one can find the ones she left in the shoe department. That’s all right, she says, “I can deal with it.” As she leaves, Ross worries her abuser is waiting for her in the parking lot. Later that day, after the sun has set and the air has cooled, the store grows quiet. In the parking lot, a private security SUV with a flashing yellow light on top sits near the exit. Driving the car is a small, elderly man whose tufts of gray hair are barely visible over the steering wheel. Private security jobs like this tend to go for $10 an hour in Tulsa. The “T” on the Walmart sign has burnt out. Stray cats scrounge around. In the far reaches of the lot, people hunker down in their campers, vans, and U-Hauls for the night. It’s nearly midnight in Tulsa, and for a few hours it looks like the local cops may get a break from Walmart. (Corrects the number of Target stores and police calls in the fourth paragraph.)

That person was Jim Furyk, who shot that score and made golf history at the recent Travelers Championship. It was the best round of golf ever. And to think, he learned the game at the Uniontown Country Club in Fayette County, where his dad was the pro for many years. But that’s not the county’s only brush with the sports world. Former Pirates and Phillies pitcher Terry Muhlholland practiced his renowned pick-off move as a student at Laurel Highlands High School. Mulholland cashed a check in the majors for 20 years and even threw a no-hitter. He racked up 124 wins while changing uniforms 13 times. And let’s not forget football. Chuck Muncie, a three-time NFL Pro Bowler with the Saints and Chargers, was also a native of Fayette County. Despite these successful native sons, the county has an inferiority complex and a lot of troubles. It’s referred to on occasion as “Fayette-nam” because of its crime and drug problem. If the county is on the news, it’s usually for a drug bust, an altercation at a Walmart or a bomb scare at a Walmart. Still, the county is not without its positives. It has Ohiopyle State Park, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater, and Nemacolin Resort, all nestled within its confines. It’s also the birthplace of the Big Mac, and that alone should command respect. But its proudest export is George C. Marshall. Besides winning the Nobel Peace Prize and being named Secretary of Defense, president of the American Red Cross, Secretary of State and a general of the U.S. Army, Marshall really didn’t do much.  As for other contributions to the sports world: Ernie Davis, also known as the “Elmira Express,” called Fayette County home until age 12, which tragically was half his life. Davis became the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy. The Syracuse running back also won an NCAA title with his team as a sophomore, and took home the award for best college football player in the nation as a senior, in 1961. Davis never played in the pros; he was drafted by Washington in 1962 but, surprisingly, the owner of that team was a legendary racist. His name was George Preston Marshall (different than the George Marshall above), and he refused to draft anyone who wasn’t lily-white even years after the league had been desegregated. He drafted Davis only after being threatened with the loss of a stadium lease. Davis then refused to play for the bigot and was traded to the Cleveland Browns — making him the last player to be happy about a trade to Cleveland. Sadly, Davis would never play a down in the NFL. He was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1963. His life is highlighted in the 2008 film The Express. Johnny Lujack is another Heisman winner. Connellsville’s Lujack started the trend of Western Pennsylvania quarterbacks going to the NFL. He went from Notre Dame to the Chicago Bears. Lujack played only four years, but was a three-time All-Pro and led the league in passing yards and passing touchdowns in 1949. Today, at 91, he’s the oldest living Heisman winner. C. Vivian Stringer, the current head coach of the Rutgers women’s basketball team, has won nearly 1,000 games in her coaching career. The Slippery Rock grad is in the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the latter in 2009 along with Michael Jordan. Stringer also has an Olympic gold medal that she earned as an assistant coach at the 2004 Athens games. She is also the only coach in women’s basketball history to lead three teams to the NCAA Final Four — Cheyney State, Iowa and Rutgers. In fact, in all of women’s college basketball, only three coaches have won more games. Runner John Woodruff, a freshman at Pitt in 1936, won the gold medal in Berlin right in front of You Know Who. Another Connellsville native, he struck gold in the 800-meter run. Connellsville still pays tribute to its late champion with an annual 5K road race in his honor. So a county of about 130,000 people has given a lot to sports and history. Pick any random county in any state with a similar population and I bet you won’t find a Nobel Peace Prize, the greatest example of single-home architecture, two Heisman trophies, a no-hitter, a golf round of 58, a top-four college coach, a five-star resort, two gold medals, and the world’s most famous cheeseburger.

(Shutterstock) Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Email ROCKFORD, Ill. — A former Wal-Mart employee will receive $90,000 to settle a federal discrimination lawsuit he filed against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said. William Clark has intellectual disabilities, which were diagnosed in childhood, according to the EEOC. He began working for the company in 1994 and had worked there for 18 years before being fired from the store at 7219 Walton St. in Rockford. Clark needed a written list of daily tasks in order to accommodate his disability, which company staff provided to Clark for years before halting that practice, the EEOC states. He then was fired for failing to perform certain job duties, according to the EEOC. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The company’s conduct was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the EEOC sued on Clark’s behalf. Federal law requires businesses to provide employees with disabilities reasonable accommodations that enable them to perform their jobs. “Here, a simple written list would have provided Mr. Clark with the accommodation he needed, and he wouldn’t have been terminated,” Julianne Bowman, the EEOC’s district director in Chicago, said in announcing the recent settlement. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said via email that the company doesn’t condone or tolerate discrimination of any type. He said that Clark never requested “an accommodation and was terminated for legitimate business reasons related to workplace safety. While we deny that discrimination in any way played a part in Mr. Clark’s termination, we are glad we resolved the matter and will undertake additional ADA training at this individual store.” The “company has thousands of associates who regularly perform their jobs with reasonable accommodations which we have provided,” Hargrove said. Clark’s payout is part of a two-year consent decree requiring Wal-Mart to train employees on disability discrimination and reasonable accommodations. © 2016 Rockford Register Star Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Email Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Find a Job Assistant Program Director Care Coordinator/Case Manager AFC Care Manager CBDS Case Manager Behavior Analyst View all jobs Post a Job More in Money Comments DISABILITY SCOOP WELCOMES COMMENTS, THOUGH ONLY A SELECTION ARE PUBLISHED.

Poudre School District high school students go back to school Thursday, with the elementary and middle schools returning Monday. That means it’s time to brave the crowds and stock up on tissues, dry erase markers and those color-specific notebooks your student needs. For those of you who have held out until the last possible minute, I did some of the research for you to help make the back-to-school frenzy just a little bit less hectic. I put myself in the shoes of the parents of a Tavelli Elementary School fourth-grade student and compared prices for this year’s school supply list at three Fort Collins stores: Walmart, Target and Staples. Here's what I found: Walmart: $58.18 Walmart Supercenter, 1250 E. Magnolia St., scored the highest for me in terms of item availability and ease. I was able to find almost everything I needed at the front of the store. There were several things, like glue sticks and dry erase markers, that were prepackaged into numbers more than I needed. That was a common problem across the three stores, so keep in mind that prices listed are for the minimum amount I could buy to meet the requested number of items. Walmart also was the cheapest of my three locations, totaling $58.18 before taxes for all of the supplies (including wishlist items) on Tavelli’s list. ON THE BALLOT:  PSD to ask for $375M bond in November election I tried to pick comparable brands and quality items across the three stores. Walmart was most expensive for the fabric pencil pouch required by Tavelli — $3.97. It was least expensive for two plastic pocket folders ($3.94), two one-inch three-ring binders ($3.84), one dry erase marker eraser ($1.74), a pair of scissors (50 cents) and Astrobrights paper ($3.97). Target: $62.15 Putting myself in the shoes of someone trying to get school supply shopping done quickly, Target's setup was most difficult to navigate. I went to the Super Target, 2936 Council Tree Ave., and had to go to the back of the store to find the designated back-to-school section. Within that section, it wasn't as easy as the other two stores to find everything I needed. The hassle was good for my step count that day but wasn't stellar for my sanity. I was able to find more exact counts of some items, but not often at a cheaper price than larger packages at Walmart. The total supply cost at Target was $62.15. FAMILIES:  Home-based child care declining in Larimer County Target was most expensive for four composition notebooks ($3) in the requested colors (blue, green, red and yellow), two one-inch three ring binders ($4.98), two jumbo glue sticks ($7.94) and tissue boxes ($5.49 for three). Target was least expensive for a set of five-tab binder dividers ($1.49), Ziploc bags ($4.36), Clorox wipes ($2.41) and 48 pre-sharpened pencils ($7.36). Buy Photo Back-to-school season is beginning, and Poudre School District sixth and ninth graders returned to school Wednesday.  (Photo: Sarah Jane Kyle/The Coloradoan) Staples: $73.75 Staples, 4333 Corbett Drive, was by far the most expensive location for the comparable brands available at Walmart and Target. However, the store has several deals on different markers, folders and more that could make it a more affordable destination for some items. More expensive items receive more display attention, so you have to look for the deals. SCHOOL SAFTEY:  Ault district hiring gun-toting security officer Staples was most expensive for binder dividers ($2.99), pre-sharpened pencils ($15), eight Expo dry erase markers ($8, and only available in fine point when I was shopping), the dry erase marker eraser ($8 because I could only find it in a prepackaged kit that included markers), black Sharpies ($4 for a pack of four), scissors ($2 for a pack of two), a package of comparable markers ($3 for washable markers), Astrobrights paper ($4), Ziploc bags ($4.79) and Clorox wipes ($2.49). It was least expensive for the fabric pencil pouch ($2.49), jumbo glue sticks ($3) and tissue boxes ($3.99). Staples did not have a yellow composition notebook when I shopped, making it impossible to complete my entire list at the store. The total supply cost was $73.75. My take If you want to save money and time, Walmart seems to be your best bet. If you want the best deal, use our interactive database in this story online to see prices for each set of items at each store on the day I shopped. Check out each location's advertisements to see if there are any special deals. For example, Target offers 5 percent off your total purchase with their credit or debit card and additional deals with the Cartwheel app. Staples could be a great resource for some items if you take advantage of their deals. Whatever route you choose, I salute you.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK (AP) — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Walmart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 per cent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Walmart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Walmart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 per cent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy, and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global. It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 per cent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Walmart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) Print Email Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com By Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Follow on Twitter on August 16, 2016 at 4:10 PM, updated August 16, 2016 at 4:14 PM comments A new poll from Zogby Analytics shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leading Democrat Hillary Clinton among two unusual demographics: NASCAR fans and Wal-Mart shoppers. The poll, released Tuesday afternoon, shows Clinton with a two-point lead over Trump in a sample of 1,277 likely voters. But the unusual measure from Zogby was a look at NASCAR fans and Wal-Mart shoppers. According to Zogby: Another interesting development is over the years we have tracked voting habits among NASCAR fans and Weekly WalMart shoppers. Ten years ago these groups tended to slant conservative and Republican. That trend has been reversed during the Obama Presidency, and these consumers tend to be more liberal and supporters of Democrats today. Trump has reversed this trend. Both NASCAR fans and WalMart shoppers favor Trump over Clinton. Donald Trump is winning NASCAR fans (44% to 36%) and weekly WalMart shoppers 41% to 36%. Clinton served as director of Wal-Mart's board from 1986 to 1992 while her husband was governor of Arkansas (where Wal-Mart is based).   The Zogby poll also shows Trump leading among groups like Independents, men and voters older than 50. Clinton has a commanding lead among Hispanics and African Americans. She leads among millennials, but the poll claims Trump is closing the gap among 25- to 34-year-olds. The poll is a bright spot in a slew of bad numbers for Trump this week. A handful of major polls show Clinton with large leads over Trump in key battleground states. In New York, a poll released Monday shows Clinton with a 30-point advantage. Zogby Analytics was founded by John Zogby, a native of Utica, N.Y.

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            A Look At Wal-Mart's Food Lab, Aimed At Developing New Items by Anne D'Innocenzio, Associated Press Posted: Tuesday, August 16, 2016 at 3:40PM EDT NEW YORK — Wal-Mart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation center at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The center has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Wal-Mart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Wal-Mart derives 56 percent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 percent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Wal-Mart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Wal-Mart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves.

The company said Friday it is considering the sale of 212 gas bars. (Ryan Remiorz/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Loblaw bucks trend by mulling sale of gas-bar business Add to ... Jacqueline Nelson The Globe and Mail Published Friday, May 27, 2016 8:31AM EDT Last updated Friday, May 27, 2016 5:50PM EDT Comments Print / License AA Loblaw Cos. Ltd. is mulling the sale of its gas station business, bucking the trend of large retailers doubling down at the pumps. The Brampton, Ont.-based grocery and pharmacy giant said Friday that it had started a process to talk to potential buyers about the sale of its 212 gas stations, which have been established alongside 20 per cent of the company’s locations, such as Real Canadian Superstore, No Frills and Independent grocers across most provinces. Loblaw’s move to siphon off its fuel business would be at odds with competitors who are increasing their focus on their gas bars in Canada and south of the border. Michael Medline, chief executive officer of Canadian Tire, has said he wants to bolster the company’s gas business because it helps drive customers to the retail and financial services divisions of the company. “We really like this business,” Mr. Medline told analysts earlier this month. “Our plan is to ensconce the petroleum division even stronger into our group of businesses.” In the U.S., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to build and run more of its own gas stations, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The company’s long-time partner operator Murphy USA Inc. will be left to tend the more than 1,000 stores it has partnered with Wal-Mart on so far. On both sides of the border, Costco Wholesale Corp. has become an aggressive competitor in the gas business, offering discounts that customers will travel further to get and line up for on weekends. These stations typically exceed the industry average litres pumped per year by a wide margin. Grocers, Canadian Tire and Costco have grown their presence in the retail gas-fuelling business significantly in the past decade, contributing to an overall decline of the number of locations in Canada as smaller competitors are squeezed out. While there were about 21,000 gas stations across the country 25 years ago, now there are about 12,000, said petroleum industry consultant Michael Ervin, who monitors the retail gasoline industry. Loblaw gas stations are branded under various names that respond to their adjacent stores, such as Gas Bar, At The Pumps and A Plein Gaz. The gas bars have loyalty systems that allow customers to earn rewards through the company’s PC Points cards, as well as a legacy rewards program called Superbucks. When it comes to buyers, Canadian convenience giant Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. has been acquisitive in recent months. But Peter Sklar, an analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns, says he isn’t sure whether the company “would have an interest due to the relatively small square footage of the store footprint versus the average Couche-Tard store.” Other major Canadian gas station owners include 7-Eleven Canada Inc. and Parkland Fuel Corp., which have both been expanding. Very few oil refining businesses still have retail gas stations integrated into their businesses, with the notable exception of Suncor Energy Inc.’s Petro-Canada brand. In March, Imperial Oil Ltd. struck a $2.8-billion deal to sell 497 Esso-brand retail gas stations to five fuel distributors in a sale process that garnered interest from U.S. buyers as well as Canadian businesses. Loblaw says that whether it sells the gas stations or not, it intends to keep the loyalty systems and locations intact for customers, which will be a consideration for any potential buyer. “Customers appreciate the convenience of on-site fuel and the benefits of a loyalty program that links gas bar and grocery purchases. We anticipate that these benefits will continue regardless of whether the business is sold,” Grant Froese, chief operating officer of Loblaw, said in a statement. The company said it had gone public with its proposal to sell the business to generate a “competitive and transparent” bidding process. The fact that Loblaw wants to cling to this rewards program comes as no surprise to Mr. Ervin, who said the opportunity to “cross-merchandise,” or create incentives at the pump that encourage shopping in the grocery store, has been one of the big strengths of non-traditional gas station operators such as the grocers and Canadian Tire. But the partnership model hasn’t been foolproof in Canada. In 2002, Wal-Mart attempted to expand its gas station partnership agreement with Murphy into Canada. Murphy built eight gas stations in the country, with plans to grow and aggressively compete on price. But by 2007, Murphy had quietly exited the Canadian market altogether. The gas business can also be volatile from quarter to quarter. At Canadian Tire, gas sales were down a little in the first quarter because of unseasonable weather and economic weakness in Alberta. But CEO Mr. Medline said he was not too concerned about sales volumes in the long term. “They will remain steady or probably in the long term a tiny bit up, but they don’t move that much.” With files by reporter Marina Strauss.

Walmart customer Richelle Stewart capture the confrontation on video. She posted it to Facebook where it has been viewed more than 300,000 times. Stewart told NBC 4 in Columbus that she and her husband spotted the monkey attacking an employee in the parking lot as they were arriving. "All of a sudden, the monkey jumps on him and she pushes him out of the way," Stewart said, according to NBC 4. A Walmart spokesman told the station the employee was not bitten. The animal, clad in a diaper, apparently escaped from a nearby camper. The employee grabbed the monkey's leash and returned it to its owner, who was "grateful," according to NBC 4. The Ohio Department of Agriculture is trying to track down the animal's owner to determine if the monkey is registered in the state, according to the station. The monkey was only on the loose for a matter of minutes before being returned to its owner, the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette said. The monkey escaped the camper when a door was opened. No criminal charges were filed against the animal's owners.

Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, by 27% to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Walmart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple.

Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Walmart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7% one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake.

Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc , and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc . It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14% stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 . Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co .

Christine Ann Davis, 45, of the 1300 block of Fritz Drive, on July 10 found the credit card in the parking lot of Wal-Mart, 3926 Nazareth Pike, Bethlehem Township. A female victim on July 10 reported to police she was shopping at 9:15 a.m. at Wal-Mart when she realized she was missing $100 in cash and a credit card from her purse. The victim told police she suspected the items fell out of her wallet and went to cancel the credit card. The victim then learned from her creditor an unauthorized purchase for $80 was made at Holiday Hair, which is located in the same shopping center as Wal-Mart. Police contacted the manager of Holiday Hair and was provided a description of Davis. Police nabbed Davis when she returned to the store to return the hair products. She allegedly provided a false name when signing the return slip, but gave police an identification card revealing her true identity. In an interview with police at the station, Davis allegedly admitted to the crime, saying she used a credit card she found to pay for the hair products because she didn't have enough of her own money. Davis is charged with unauthorized use of an access device, theft (two counts), forgery and receiving stolen property. She was arraigned Saturday before District Judge Jacqueline Taschner, who set bail at $5,000. In lieu of bail, Davis was taken to Northampton County Prison.

Gwinnett County police suspect the two used $1,000 worth of fake bills to buy lawn equipment in Buford, Georgia, last month. The woman reportedly returned one of the purchases at another Walmart store in exchange for real cash. SEE MORE: 50 Cent Says He Posed With Fake Money To Protect His Brand Investigators say the cashier who accepted the fake money quit her job. "She quit her job shortly after being questioned about this transaction," Cpl. Michele Pihera told WAGA. "So it could have been an inside job?" reporter George Franco asked. "It might have been," Pihera replied. Apparently, the illegal use of prop money is a problem across the nation, even though businesses that make and supply it have to follow strict guidlines. Atlanta-based movie prop warehouse owner RJ Rappaport said the fake bills believed to be used in the Walmart scam appear to skirt federal guidelines. "What they did is they took real money, and they copied it on a copier. And then they put this (pointing to the phrase 'For Motion Picture Use Only') — this tiny disclaimer that says, 'prop money,' so they say it's legal. It's not," he explained to WXIA. Rappaport told WAGA none of the fake bills he makes have any elements copied from real cash. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports movie prop money was also used in at least one other recent incident in Athens, Georgia.

In video footage of the incident, the monkey appears to be scuffling with an employee collecting shopping carts when the animal's owner barrels toward him to pull them apart. Footage of the bizarre moment was caught on camera by Richelle Stewart, who posted the clip to Facebook.  'I just video tapped a monkey attacking a guy at Walmart in Lancaster Ohio!' Stewart wrote on the video.  Going bananas: A monkey scuffling with an Ohio Walmart employee was caught on camera The monkey can be heard squeaking and hooting as it holds on to the arm of the Walmart employee, before its owner runs over to push them apart  Since she posted it on Sunday it has received more than 280,000 views.  The clip begins with the monkey standing on top of a metal beam on the cart collection area. The monkey can be heard squeaking and hooting as it holds on to the arm of the Walmart employee, who was trying to grab the animal's leash after it ran from its owner, according to KSN.com.  As the man and monkey scuffle, the owner barrels toward the two shouting: 'Let him go, let him go, let him go!' She breaks them apart, holding the monkey by the hand as if it were a toddler and says to the employee: 'If he bites you, they'll put him down.' As they walk away the unidentified woman says to the employee: 'No, I'm not mad at you.' She then can be seen walking hand-in-hand with the monkey back to the trailer that it had previously escaped from.   As the man and monkey scuffle, the owner barrels toward the two shouting: 'Let him go, let him go, let him go!' The woman says to the employee, 'If he bites you, they'll put him down', before walking away 'I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts,' Stewart told 'The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her. 'All of sudden the monkey jumps on him and she pushed him out of the way,' Stewart told the New York Daily News. The Ohio Department of Agriculture is now trying to find the woman to figure out if the monkey is registered or not.

Share this article Share In a statement to DailyMail.com, a spokeswoman said the Department of Agriculture hasn't identified the woman and said they are investigating. 'While I cannot speculate on what would happen if the owner is identified, I can say that most monkeys are considered "dangerous wild animals" under an Ohio law passed in 2012 and are prohibited without a valid permit from the state.  'Under Ohio law it is also illegal to allow a dangerous wild animal to escape from its enclosure or to allow one to come into contact with the public,' Communications Director Erica Hawkins said in an email.  After the incident, a call was placed to 911 and reported that a person had been bitten by the monkey, according to CBS 6.  The employee was uninjured and the woman walked back to her trailer hand-in-hand with the monkey The Lancaster Eagle-Gazette reported that the caller said the monkey was bigger than her two-year-old child.  When Lancaster Police responded to the scene they determined the monkey only grabbed the man and he was not in need of medical attention.  Since he was unharmed, no report was filed by officers.   Read more: Monkey gets loose in Walmart parking lot | KSN-TV Diaper-wearing monkey gets loose, scuffles with Wal-Mart employee in parking lot | WTVR.com Monkey reported loose in Wal-Mart parking lot www.nydailynews....

Here's Why Wal-Mart Insurers Don’t Think Tracy Morgan Deserved His Accident Settlement Share facebook twitter whatsapp tumblr pinterest email SOUL TRAIN AWARDS LOVE & HAPPINESS, AN OBAMA CELEBRATION SOUL TRAIN WEEKEND Disgusting! Here's Why Wal-Mart Insurers Don’t Think Tracy Morgan Deserved His Accident Settlement The situation continues to get uglier. Published August 16th While the horrific car crash that left Tracy Morgan severely injured and another passenger dead has seen a sliver of positivity in the comedian's recovery, the situation has recently taken another ugly turn with the legal battle between Wal-Mart and its insurers. While Wal-Mart paid up a rumored $90 million after one of their drivers crashed into the limo which was carrying the 30 Rock actor and several other passengers, the insurers are now claiming that the retail giant overpaid to save face. According the Daily Mail, the documents filed by the insurers state that the "exorbitant" settlements should not be covered by them, because there is "no coverage to the extent which these settlements were paid to avoid adverse publicity." Continuing to allege that Wal-Mart's excessive payment was a ploy to avoid bad publicity, they added that the amount the chain paid to both Morgan and his co-passengers was excessive in comparison to the actual injuries he experienced. They also claim that Wal-Mart failed to sufficiently assess investigations into Morgan's health before settling. "Within weeks of Wal-Mart settling with Morgan, Morgan was seen driving one of the most powerful sports cars in midtown Manhattan, driving without any difficulty and clearly showing he was enjoying himself," the documents read. "Wal-Mart would have learned that Morgan was capable of doing these things had it done an adequate and reasonable investigation before settling." The horrific crash, which took the life of Morgan's friend James McNair and injured three others, caused the star to suffer a traumatic brain injury and several fractures. Watch Tracy talk about surviving the crash in the video above.  Written by Moriba Cummings (Photo: Robert O'neil/Splash News) COMMENTS Get More!

Sure, we were thrilled to hear that Jet.com had successfully executed a highly profitable exit. Walmart paid $3.3 billion, even more than some observers expected. But Jet.com was growing fast, adding some 400,000 customers a month. It recently moved into a very cool new space in Hoboken. We loved its culture, admired what it had already accomplished, and deeply respected Jet.com CEO Marc Lore's long-time commitment to our community (we just honored the company at last November's Awards Celebration). Some of us may have been nursing visions of our own Amazon.com: an independent e-commerce company that might have grown into a $50 billion mammoth right here in our Garden State. That wasn't to be. But there's plenty of good news associated with Jet.com's buyout. First, Jet.com found a great U.S. buyer. In many ways, Walmart is a technology leader: You merely need to look at the amazing things it has done (and continues to do) on the supply chain side of its business. And it does seem that Walmart is looking east to New Jersey, both for a big shot of entrepreneurial spirit and for access to the extraordinary team that Jet.com brought together. This is clearly a strategic acquisition for Walmart, which hasn't been satisfied with its own growth online. For now, at least, Lore will be running both Jet.com and the homegrown Walmart.com operation, and Walmart's CEO promised to be “thoughtful” about how it merges these. In the short term, the stated plan is to build both brands. I'm hopeful Jet.com will ultimately become Walmart's East Coast hub for technology innovation, drawing talent from throughout New Jersey — and into New Jersey from the entire East Coast. I'm also hopeful that Walmart will learn lessons from other successful buyouts, where successful companies have been permitted to keep their culture and operate as independently as possible, while still offering compelling synergies with the parent company. One example immediately comes to mind: the way Walmart's key competitor, Amazon, purchased Audible — and then empowered it to transform the audiobook industry from its home right here in Newark. Even if all goes well for Jet.com within Walmart, it's likely that some of Jet.com's extraordinary team will gradually move on to new ventures. That's the way of the world, and that, too, can only be good news for the New Jersey technology ecosystem. We've certainly seen this virtuous cycle before. Marc Lore did it himself, first selling Diapers.com and its parent company Quidsi to Amazon.com, years before launching Jet.com. Think about the groups of "alumni" emanating from organizations like PayPal after it was sold for $1.5 billion to eBay in 2002. They are referred to commonly as the PayPal Mafia, and they have taken all they've learned into new ventures, including Tesla, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, SpaceX and others. Now imagine that happening again here in New Jersey, as Jet.com "graduates" leverage everything they've learned on Lore's team, creating new startups that build our technological ecosystem and contribute to our communities, just as Jet.com has. At the New Jersey Tech Council, I see these positive dynamics playing out firsthand and close up. We work closely with new and fast-growing ventures like Jet.com to help them make the most of New Jersey's remarkable technological, business and research resources. We see every new generation of buyouts and mergers spawning another new generation of startups. We meet these emerging companies at our venture conferences and networking events; they're the companies we're constantly connecting to partners, funders (including our Jumpstart Angels Network and Venture Fund) and customers.  We see pioneers like Greg Olsen, who sold Sensors Unlimited and with the proceeds invested in and advised many local entrepreneurs over the years. More recently, Navneet Puri, who sold Innopharma to Pfizer and is now growing his new venture, Nevakar. Or Francois Nader, who sold NPS Pharma to Shire and is now investing in new ventures and mentoring/advising both startups and growth companies. Or Gerard Adams, who sold his Elite Daily millennial site to The Daily Mail and is now working to catalyze entrepreneurship in Newark and beyond. These are just a few. This is how it's supposed to work — and in New Jersey, this is how it does work. Even if we were dreaming of big things for Jet.com as an independent company, we can now dream of even bigger things for Jet.com and its mob of enriched and experienced alumni — both inside and outside Walmart.  James Barrood is CEO of the New Jersey Tech Council.

Monkey Gets Loose In Walmart Parking Lot, Throws Down With Employee Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Monkey Gets Loose In Walmart Parking Lot, Throws Down With Employee Image courtesy of Richelle Stewart August 16, 2016 10:00 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk literal monkey business walmart wildlife monkeys retail shopping What happens when a monkey gets loose in a Walmart parking lot and jumps a store employee? Someone catches the whole thing on video, that’s what happens, and the Internet goes crazy. The rumble far from the jungle happened in Lancaster, OH on Sunday night, and was filmed by a shopper who was arriving at Walmart, reports NBC-4. She noticed something a bit odd — a monkey standing on a bunch of carts, apparently in a showdown with an employee trying to help its owner catch it. It had escaped from a woman’s nearby camper. In the video, the monkey’s owner can be seen running towards the worker yelling, “Let her go, let her go! Did she bite you?” “All of a sudden the monkey jumps on him and she pushes him out the way,” the eyewitness told the news station. A Walmart spokesperson told NBC4 the monkey didn’t bite the worker. After it escaped from its camper, the employee took its leash and returned the monkey to its owner, who was “grateful,” Walmart says. The Department of Agriculture is now interested in speaking with the woman out of concern that the monkey might not be registered.

A video posted to Facebook by Richelle Stewart shows the monkey struggling with a Walmart employee by the cart return station in the Lancaster store's parking lot Sunday evening. A woman, apparently the monkey's owner, runs up and pulls the two apart. "Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down," the woman says. The woman and monkey then return to a nearby camper, which the primate apparently escaped from earlier. A Walmart representative told KSN-TV the monkey did not bite the employee and the woman was "grateful" to the worker for catching her unusual pet. The Ohio Department of Agriculture said it is working to identify the woman to determine whether she is an Ohio resident and, if so, whether her monkey is properly registered.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Aug 16th 2016 5:58AM Public enemy No. 1 in the retail industry today is Amazon, but the biggest threat as we know it didn't begin with the internet. It began with Walmart. "Walmart destroyed retail," retail consultant Jan Kniffen said on Monday on CNBC. "They wrecked every other form of retailing because it was a race to the lowest price, and they were the lowest price." As Walmart beat out other discount retailers like Gold Circle in 1988 and Venture Stores in 1998, the company expanded rapidly across the country. Today, there are more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam's Club locations in the US alone. Walmart's dominance has created an environment where it's difficult for retailers to compete in an overcrowded market. The issue is complicated by recent changes in the retail industry, with more shopping being done online — another factor that is creating more competition for retailers. According to job-placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retailers have cut almost 44,000 positions so far this year.

Weather officials changed their outlook on the system Wednesday after seeing it get a little stronger, giving it enough oomph to stay a hurricane as it reaches landfall.

(AP Photo/Nick Ut) Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Just last week, Macy's announced that would it shut down 100 locations early next year, as mall traffic across the US slows. And Walmart closed 269 locations earlier this year. The root of the problem, according to Kniffen, is that there are simply too many physical retail stores in the US. Kniffen isn't alone. Last week, Macy's CFO, Karen Hoguet, said in an earnings call that"this country is over-stored, given evolving customer shopping habits." Physical shopping locations can provide incentives for consumers to visit in the form of coffee shops, hair salons, and other things that boost the quality of the experience — but, ultimately, there is a surplus of subpar stores and malls that consultants like Kniffen believe won't be open in a few years. "We've never been this over-stored before," Kniffen said. Walmart did not reply to a request for comment.

A shopper captured the bizarre moment a pet monkey wearing a diaper escaped and 'attacked' a man in a Wal-Mart car park. Richelle Stewart recorded the incident and posted it on Facebook, explaining: "I just [recorded] a monkey attacking a guy at Walmart in Lancaster Ohio!! ‪#‎crazy." The monkey reportedly escaped from a camper van parked outside the Wal-Mart store on August 14 at around 7:50pm when the door was left open. Ms Stewart believes the Wal-Mart employee was attempting to help the woman in the video retrieve the runaway primate when it turned on him. The woman in the video, believed to bet the monkey's owner, is heard shouting at the employee: "Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down." She then grabs the animal's leash and leads it away. Ms Stewart's husband then tells the Wal-Mart employee: "You could have got hurt ... you could have got sick with that." She told NBC4i.com: "I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts, and this lady was trying to come over and get him. "The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her. "When we posted it on Facebook, we did it for fun. We go to Wal-Mart, we moved to Lancaster and there's a monkey." Continued below.

X Warren Buffett’s Berkshire takes bigger bite of Apple Move comes as other investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn have sold their shares Tue, Aug 16, 2016, 08:20 Updated: Tue, Aug 16, 2016, 11:08 Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes         Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has increased its stake in Apple by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30th, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31st, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 per cent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30th. Mr Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. ‘Technophobe’ Warren Buffett takes a $1bn stake in Apple Apple’s difficulty could be rival Samsung’s opportunity Investor Carl Icahn sells entire Apple stake on China woes “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Berkshire boost Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 per cent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. ADVERTISEMENT Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Mr Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy, and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global. It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 per cent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Mr Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30th, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.       Topics: Carl Icahn Edward Jones George Soros Jim Shanahan John Malone Leon Cooperman Ted Weschler Todd Combs Warren Buffett Apple Berkshire Hathaway ConocoPhillips Dairy Queen Deere & Co Duracell Fruit of the Loom Kraft Heinz Liberty Global Precision Castparts Soros Fund Management Suncor WalMart Wells Fargo Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 18:11 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 17:35 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 17:23 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 15:38 Organisations set to increase IT spend, survey shows 15:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Tech Tools: projector for use with smartphones Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 3 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 4 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 5 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 6 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 7 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 8 Michael Noonan says ‘brass-plate operations’ will not be welcome 9 WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 10 Organisations set to increase IT spend, survey shows Never miss a story.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 16 August 2016 | MYT 2:21 PM Berkshire takes bigger bite of Apple, pares Wal-Mart More Apple: Buffet's Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth US$1.46bil (RM5.83bil) as of June 30, up from US9.81mil (RM39.7mil) shares. — Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc by 55%, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth US$1.46bil (RM5.83bil) as of June 30, up from US$9.81mil (RM39.7mil) shares  The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, by 27% to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than US$133bil (RM531bil) of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid US$32.1bil (RM128.7bil) in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7% one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes.

According to the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette, police say the monkey got loose at about 7:50 p.m., escaping the trailer after a woman opened the door. "I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts, and this lady was trying to come over and get him," Richelle Stewart, who recorded the incident, tells nbc4i.com. "The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her." The monkey jumped on a Walmart employee attempting to help the woman retrieve the animal. The employee was not injured. The employee managed to grab the monkey's leash and the woman ran up and took control of it. Stewart posted her video of the encounter on Facebook. (See the video below.) "When we posted it on Facebook, we did it for fun. We go to Walmart, we moved to Lancaster and there's a monkey," she tells nbc4i.com. Reports say the Ohio Department of Agriculture is trying to locate the woman with the monkey over concerns that the monkey might not be registered.

All Rights Reserved Newspaper web site content management software and services 2016-08-18 / Police Blotter Tweet Print Man drives with license suspended in 2005 Lancaster Friday, Aug. 5 • Police were called to Wal-Mart for a report of employee theft. They spoke with the store’s loss prevention manager and were told an employee was stealing money while working as a cashier on three separate occasions. The employee allegedly stole a total of $350. There is video evidence. The woman was taken to the station but released, and is due back in court later this month. Saturday, Aug. 6 • A patrol officer saw a vehicle driving south on Transit Road without headlights and conducted a traffic stop. The driver’s license had actually been revoked since 2005, and the man was operating without insurance. The driver also was the subject of an outstanding warrant in the City of Buffalo and was turned over to Buffalo police. His vehicle was towed. • While patrolling the area around the Taste of Lancaster, an officer noticed a blue 2002 Ford pickup. The officer had previous police contact with the driver and was aware the driver’s license was suspended in January 2016 for pending prosecution by courts on a blood alcohol count. The officer initiated a traffic stop, and the driver is due back in court in September for alleged aggravated unlicensed operation in the second degree. Tuesday, Aug. 9 • At around 11:15 p.m., an officer observed a man pumping gas whom he recognized from a previous encounter. The man has a suspended license and after confirming his suspended status with a DMV check, the officer issued him a ticket and the vehicle was towed. Depew Tuesday, Aug. 9 • Officers responded to a report of theft regarding iPhones inside a vehicle parked at the DMV on George Urban Boulevard. The two occupants of the car said one of their phones was on the center console and the other was in a purse in the back seat. Upon returning to the car, one of the occupants said her purse had been dumped out on the back seat but nothing else was missing. The women had an idea of who could have done it, but police did not have enough evidence to press charges. The alleged suspects denied everything and allowed police to search their belongings. Detectives are now involved. Wednesday, Aug. 10 • At around 10:30 p.m., an officer responded to a 911 call. The caller said his wife and daughter allegedly saw a man going through the inside of one of their vehicles at their home on Houston Street. The only thing missing from the car was a notable amount of spare change. Another witness reported seeing the same man going up and down people’s driveways looking inside vehicles. The man rode off on a bicycle. Thursday, Aug. 11 • Two cars were broken into on Main Street. The first complainant had his wallet, $200 in cash, cigarettes and change stolen from the car. The second complainant said her car was locked at night but she noticed her passenger door open without forcible entry. Her TomTom GPS was stolen. Police suspect this could be the same person linked to the Houston Street break-in. Friday, Aug. 12 • Police were notified about a possibly intoxicated driver. The call came from Zimmerman Street from a man stating that the driver was his grandfather. Police located the driver, and he was reportedly unable to complete the alphabet or walk a straight line during sobriety tests. He claimed to have had only one beer at his residence. When returned to the station, the man allegedly registered a 0.17 percent blood alcohol level. He was issued a ticket for operating a vehicle with a BAC higher than 0.10 percent and is due back in court later this month. Saturday, Aug. 13 • Police responded to a call from a resident on Rossiter Street in regard to criminal mischief. He said someone cut the ground wire to the central air conditioning condenser unit. He had no reason to believe this is not just a random act of vandalism. Police checked other air conditioning units in the area and noticed no damage. The case has been closed until further information develops. Sunday, Aug. 14 • When police arrived on the scene of a noise complaint on Olanta Street, they discovered two individuals who were the subjects of outstanding warrants in Buffalo. The woman reportedly barricaded herself against the bedroom door, and police had to forcefully enter it. Police alleged that there were numerous used needles spread around the room and a plastic container in plain sight with a white substance that tested positive for cocaine. Both people were turned over to Buffalo police. (Editor’s note: The Bee’s police blotter is a sampling of unusual calls received by the police department.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Retail firm Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has shown interest in opening retail food chains in India after the government allowed 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector, food processing industries secretary Avinash Srivastava said on Wednesday. The government in June notified 100% FDI under the so-called approval route for trading, including through e-commerce, for food products manufactured or produced in India which it had proposed in this year’s budget in February. Srivastava said he hopes this will give a big boost to the food processing sector, farmers’ incomes and to the employment generation in the country. “Walmart has already shown a lot of interest. They are already here in India. They will come of their own and add to the growth story of the country,” he added. Krish Iyer, president and chief executive officer of Walmart India, said the company is evaluating the model as per the guidelines announced by the government. “As we have said earlier, the decision by the government to allow 100% FDI under government approval route, including through e-commerce in trading of food products manufactured and/or produced in India, is very progressive and far reaching. This step will help in reducing wastage, farm diversification and encourage industry to produce locally within the country. This move will benefit farmers, give impetus to the food processing industry and create vast employment opportunities in the country,” he said. Walmart has a presence in the cash-and-carry wholesale format in the country. However, an industry representative requesting anonymity said industry bodies had urged the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to allow some non-food items along with food items to be sold in such stores which the department has not accepted so far. “Food retailing is a low-margin business. So the current government policy makes such businesses less viable,” he added. Srivastava said a leading Brazilian poultry company had expressed keen interest in joining hands with Kishore Biyani’s Future Group to sell its products in the country. “A Brazilian company claiming to be the world’s leading exporter in the poultry sector met us yesterday. They want to tie up with Biyani’s Future Group to use their retail outlets,” he added. When contacted, Biyani said talks are on with many companies. “I don’t want to comment on specifics,” he added. Srivastava said DIPP secretary Ramesh Abhishek and food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal recently met with the ambassadors of important countries to convey the message to their food processing companies about the attractiveness of the sector in India. Abhishek said his department is holding meetings with various departments on the progress of ‘Make In India’ initiatives for the last three months. Fifty-one cold chain projects have been completed and six mega food parks operationalized since June 2014, Abhishek said. Each mega food park is expected to create direct and indirect employment for 5,000-6,000 people and benefit 25,000-30,000 farmers, he said. The food processing industry contributes around 9% of India’s manufacturing GDP. Evaluated at $39.71 billion in 2013, the food industry is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate of 11% to reach $65.4 billion by 2018, according to a report released jointly by the commerce and industry ministry and ministry of food processing. Between April 2014 and March 2016, the sector attracted $1.04 billion of FDI. Both ministries claimed 3.2 million tonnes capacity of cold storage has been created with an expenditure of Rs.9,000 crore in the last two years which is expected to reduce wastage of food by 10% annually, or Rs.9,200 crore, every year.

She said a girl came to her home around 5 p.m. and asked to use her phone to call somebody for a ride. The girl told her she was upset and her father had locked her out of her house. The woman allowed the girl to come into her house and use the phone and believes she stole the keys without her knowledge when she went to get her a bottle of water. The girl left a short time later. The woman later decided a family member would park a vehicle behind their two vehicles in case the girl came back to steal them. Around 6:30 p.m., another resident on the street reported a vehicle was stolen out of her driveway. She told police a girl, matching the same description of the girl at the other home, was at her home two days earlier and asked to use the phone to call her dad. The girl was invited into the home and stayed about 30 minutes. Since that day, the woman had been unable to find the spare key to the vehicle that was stolen. Officers recognized the circumstances of the incidents from similar reports in the past, where the suspect was a 14-year-old Cleveland Heights girl, who is also suspected in both these incidents and had been arrested for at least one vehicle theft. The detective bureau is investigating. Theft, Monticello Boulevard: A 7-Eleven employee said Aug. 9 a man stole eight cans of an alcoholic beverage from the store by placing them into a backpack. He left the area in a vehicle being driven by a woman. The vehicle was registered to a woman, who resided on Linnell Road. Officers checked at the home, but the vehicle was not there and nobody responded to the door. Surveillance video confirmed the identity of the suspect as a 46-year-old East Cleveland man, who has been arrested in the city on multiple occasions for theft. That man was also the suspect in a theft of energy drinks from Speedway the previous day and on Aug. 3. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 23, was arrested at Walmart Aug. 11 for the suspected theft of several electronic items, valued at $374.94. A loss prevention worker said the man concealed the items in a tool box and used a cable tie on the toolbox clamps to keep it shut. He then purchased just the tool box before being apprehended by the staff. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Maple Heights man, 48, was arrested at Walmart Aug. 11 for the suspected theft of a power drill, valued at $148. He was found in possession of two driver's licenses and a credit card, belonging to other people. He said he was part of an organized theft ring and the cards were given to him to use, by people involved in it. He said he was being coerced to take place in criminal activity with threats of violence against him. Counterfeiting, Mayfield Road: A Dairy King employee said Aug. 6 a man exchanged a counterfeit $100 bill at the store for five $20 bills. He said the man dropped the bill on the counter, took the $20 bills and quickly left the area. The employee then inspected the bill and saw that it read "for motion picture use only." Another employee recognized the suspect and said he had taken a class with him at Cuyahoga Community College in 2015. He said he worked on a class project with him and would try to look it up to find his name. He was certain it was that man because he said the man waved to him while he was at the store's window. Recovered property, Belvoir Mews: Officers ran a registration check on a vehicle Aug. 7 as it left the Giant Eagle parking lot and learned it was entered as stolen out of Cleveland. It had been rented and not returned. After assisting another officer on a traffic stop, the officer went to the home of the man who was the suspected renter and driver and located the vehicle in the driveway. He came to the door and identified himself, but said he had not been driving the vehicle. The man, 45, was taken into custody for receiving stolen property. Theft, Mayfield Road: Management at Marc's suspected an employee of theft Aug. 8 after seeing two Marc's tote bags inside his vehicle. He said he did not know about the bags and another employee had his keys. He allowed managers to check the bags and they found several still cold meat products inside of them, along with other grocery items. The other employee was questioned and admitted he took the items and the other man had nothing to do with the theft. The East Cleveland man, 20, was subsequently arrested for theft and both men were fired from their jobs. The total value of theft was $152.95. Theft, Winston Road: A man and woman reported Aug. 3 a bike was stolen from their garage and they suspected one of several kids at a neighboring home stole it. They said they saw a boy riding away on it and then found it in front of the home where the kids were. Officers questioned the kids and one boy said he found the bike in the bushes several homes away. The bike was returned to the owners, who asked for no further police action. Their description of the boy they saw riding the bike did not match that of the boy who said he found it. However, officers later learned that boy, 13, has charges pending against him for a recent theft at Giant Eagle in the city. Fraud, Elmwood Road: A woman, 18, reported July 28 she was the victim of a scam by someone who contacted her through email about a possible job. She said the woman hired her to deliver packages for her business and sent her a check for $1,995. The woman was instructed to deposit the check and then wire $1,440 to Kenya, which she did. The following day, her bank notified her the check was fictitious and the funds were reversed. The incident is under investigation. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights woman, 20, was arrested at Walmart July 26 for the theft of $34.83 worth of merchandise she concealed in her purse. She was also charged with endangering children, as reports state she had her 14-year-old cousin help her conceal the items. See more South Euclid news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In Why You Should Save All Your Deep Fried Twinkie Gorging For The Fair Jason Tabrys 08.14.16 3 months ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL Sony/Shutterstock Who doesn’t love a fair or a carnival? It’s as American as apple pie, which you can deep-fry and cover in powdered sugar and also maybe Oreo crumbles and some whip cream with strawberry sauce. Man, fairs are great. And so is frying stuff. Hostess knows that you like the fried version of their stuff and they’re clearly tired of being played as a sucker by the carnies in the Twinkie aftermarket who are making money hand over fist by slinging deep-fried Twinkies for fun-loving fair-goers. That’s why Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart to try and bring the magic of crisp, golden, cream-stuffed cake-things into their stores (hopefully within sight of the diabetic testing kits and test strips) and your home. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. (Via The AP) What’s this “finished” sh*t? If Dominos can concoct a driving pizza oven and the Pizza-Bot 9000 (suggested title), why can’t Hostess innovate some kind of fry oil incubator to keep these bad boys ever-crisp and ready? What’s the value of this great leap forward in what-we-want-when-we-want-it-ness if there’s a DIY element? The injustice. And even more seriously, doesn’t this whole thing defeat the purpose of what fair food like fried twinkies is supposed to be? A treat and part of a larger experience. A fair is about escape and joy and giving yourself a treat like a simple deep-fried twinkie. You’re chucking balls at bottles to win plush things. You’re riding a piece of carpet down a slide that’s been polished slick by thousands of butts before you. You’re eating food passed to you by a dead-eye high schooler who’s been wearing the same latex gloves for three days straight WHICH TOTALLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE! More than anything, the fair is about adventure and risk, is what I’m saying. At home, you are sensible Jim with an intimate knowledge of what low-fat salad dressing pairs best with kale (all of them). At the fair, you are a wild motherf*cker with abundant faith in your cholesterol medication and a deep desire to wrap cotton candy around a corn dog while keeping an eye trained on the turkey leg that the guy across the aisle has his hands on. A culinary rumspringa! That’s what you’re on. And that’s fine because it’s a rare thing. But once you try to bring the fair home in a box from Wal-Mart it becomes too easy, too common, and far less adventurous. Do you think the deep-fried twinkie will taste as good as you sit on your couch after popping it out of the toaster absent the youth-restoring sounds of laughter and the sights of flashing neon? Absent the total fair experience? For $4.76, you can find out seven times, but the fact is you’re going to be disappointed, even if a delicious Twinkie is just a scrumptious Twinkie at the end of the day.

F/T Entrepreneur: Yes You Can. August 17, 2016 by Staff   Filed under Business, News, Opinion, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) In this article I am going to tell you how to become a full time entrepreneur, pure and simple. Have I done it? Yes, I have owned a full time business for over 13 years which has also included training thousands of new entrepreneurs when I was a business development specialist. It is not as hard as you may think to own a successful full time business if you listen to the right people and follow the right examples such as the Black Wallstreet of the 1920s. And if you don’t know about the original Black Wallstreet, boy do you have a lot to learn. That being said, let’s get started and consider this your free consultation. When I provided business consulting, my rate was $100 to $20 an hour on a sliding scale and I got it, so this article is quite a deal for you. You have to control your own income and create this cycle for your children. What kind of business should you start? Well what are you good at? What is there a definite need for? What are you trained in? What do you have an interest in? What will people pay to have done for them? What is needed in an industry that is not there now? This is called a niche. Metro PCS found one. Wendy’s found one. Chik-fil-a found one. Wal-Mart found one. Apple found one. You can find one too. The first thing you have to do is change your thinking if you have been an employee, as most of us once were. Real entrepreneurs do not think like employees or they would in fact be employees. The mind of an entrepreneur is the mind of a person willing to take risks – good risks, smart risks, calculated and well-informed risks. The mind of an entrepreneur does not think about how much something will cost, but rather how much he/she will make from it. The mind of a real entrepreneur is focused and self-motivated when there is nobody around to encourage you. The mind of an entrepreneur is resourceful and he/she finds ways to accomplish the tasks when there seems to be no possible way to do so. Real entrepreneurs are too busy making things happen to complain, be afraid, get distracted or become hindered by obstacles. There is a lot more inside the mind of a full time entrepreneur but I want to leave some things for you to research on your own . Some of us naturally have what it takes but those who don’t can learn if they are willing to change their thinking. How you see things impacts how you approach them and thus impacts the results of your efforts. Many people strive to have their own business, but not their own successful business. There is a huge difference. The second step is to realistically identify and recognize what a real entrepreneur is. I know you may want to jump into the market with your ideas, but first your mind has to be trained and possible de-programmed or re-programmed or you will crash and burn fast. So let’s clear up some misconceptions about real entrepreneurship. First of all, being a real entrepreneur is not working as an independent contractor for a multi-level marketing company like Legal Shield, Amway, Mary Kay, Pri-America etc. – though these companies can make money and can also be a step towards real entrepreneurship. Second of all, being a full time entrepreneur means you will work hard, work on holidays that employees have off, burn the candle at both ends and in the middle. Entrepreneurship is hard work but it is working for yourself and paying yourself what you are worth. While identifying what real entrepreneurship is, you need to know it does not include getting up at noon, working a few hours when you feel like it, passing out cheap Vista Print cards with your name as “CEO” on them and simply telling everyone you have a business. The third step is to do your homework – your research. You have to know and define your market from both a demographic and psychographic standpoint. Look up these terms. Do your primary and secondary customer profile. Make sure to complete your SWATs analysis, overstand what this is and why it is absolutely necessary. Research suppliers, competitors and your potential clients or customers thoroughly. Look at examples of business that are working, winning, expanding and succeeding. But do not make the mistake many small business owners make of thinking you can run your business whatever way you want while ignoring recognized and proven industry standards. Sometimes it’s good to start a business with another person so each of you can hold the other accountable and keep the other motivated. Just put the agreement and terms in writing. You must know how your customers think, where they go, what they spend, how much they spend, when they spend, what attracts them and why. There are at least 7 key things that make people buy and you need to know all of them. How many of them do you know off the top of your head? I can guarantee you that Wal-Mart knows all 7 and then maybe a dozen more. Also research how to price your products and services. And I will give you a hint when it comes to pricing, there are several elements to consider – not just market rate and desired profit margin. You also need to know the true uniqueness of your product or service and be able to share both the features and benefits. To reach me, send an email to brainstormonline@yahoo.com SHARE THIS ARTICLE WITH EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW – YOUNG AND OLD! Never assume potential customers know what you mean or that they automatically see the value in what you have just because you do. They are not you. Here is the billion dollar question. Why should someone buy from you instead of some other business? You need to answer that question in your advertising and in the mind of your potential customers with as many valid reasons as possible. I say “valid reasons” because non-sense reasons do not count for much. Most small businesses do not fail because of lack of money. They fail because of lack of dedication and failure to do your homework regarding every aspect of your business. The fourth step is to do an agenda – a comprehensive “to do” list. This agenda needs to have a timetable which means dates and times or deadlines for every task listed. An good agenda is your most important document and much more valuable than a business plan or prospectus (investment proposal). Why? Because your agenda will be a list of every single thing you have to complete in order to get the business up and running, keep the business moving forward and expand the business. The agenda should have your short term, intermediate term and long term goals. Your agenda should also a have your minimum, realistic and ideal monthly financial goal. Do a basic business plan because it requires you to pull thoughts and visions out of your head, get organized and develop a roadmap others can follow. Will your business be a corporation, an S-corporation a sole proprietorship, a non-profit or a legal partnership? Why or why not? Will you have staff, independent contractors, employees? Why or why not? This fourth step is also your planning stage so make your you have a Plan A and a Plan B. You don’t have to jump out there and leave your job tomorrow. But you should have the objective of leaving your job, when and under what conditions that should happen. As for benefits like 401(k) and insurance, you can buy into plans as an entrepreneur so don’t worry. The fifth step is to develop a marketing plan and a marketing budget. Even if you only have $100 a month to spend, you must advertise, brand your company name, product or service and be consistent with it. In corporate American I was a marketing expert (above a specialist) so I will share this with you. Marketing is not just branding. Marketing involves sales, research, advertising, pricing, packaging, promotions / special promotions, referral programs, feedback assessment, sales tracking, and other key areas that I will let you discover for yourself in your research. Over the last few years a lot of people have popped up who claim to be “branding” specialists, but branding is only one part of marketing and not even the most important part at that. So when meeting with a marketing consultant, be careful of one trick ponies. In marketing we know that it does not matter how good the product or service you offer if nobody knows about it. We also know if your image and presentation looks cheap, your products and services will be perceived as having little value. Some industries lose credibility if they distribute flyers and flyers in fact can yield a small return because they are often perceived as junk mail. I also do not recommend Vista Print business cards because cheap cards say you have a cheap business. And please, if you are not a graphic designer or desktop publisher, do NOT try to design your own advertising. It may look really bad and you may not even know it. Let the experts do what they do and just as you will readily ask others to spend money with you, be ready to do the same. Bootleg marketing is never good. Remember, image is everything when it comes to marketing and reaching your potential clients. There is a reason you will not find major fortune 100 company executives using cheap Vista Print business cards. Generate the image of how you want your potential customers or clients to perceive you. One thousand nice, coated, two-sided heavyweight business cards can cost as little as $100. Invest the money. The sixth step is acquire the proper licenses and permits that are required. Do not hesitate. This stage can include industry licenses, insurance, business licensing, incorporating, tax paperwork, fire safety inspections, environmental health department inspections, surety bonding, building occupancy permits and a host of other requirements specific to your industry. Doing your homework should have yielded a list of what permits you will need. I could tell you much, much more but this article is simply to lay the groundwork and I am not about to do all of your work for you, especially not for free. There are specialists out there who can help you but be careful. There are also people out there who masquerade as specialist and they have only read a book on how to be a consultant, but they have never been full time entrepreneurs. All that being said, I want to tell you that you can do it. You don’t have to wait years to make a profit. It can be done, in many cases, in the first 30 days. You don’t have to have a lot of money or a loan to get started. Start where you can, but just start. You must control your income and get off the corporate plantation because whomever controls your finances, also controls your status in life. Furthermore, a business provides several benefits including tax dedications that you probably are not getting now. You are capable so do not sell yourself short. Out of the 5 children my parents had, I am the only entrepreneur. Yet I have done more and made more than any two of them put together. That is not to brag, but rather to say my siblings had the potential as well. Yet they never acted on it. You may say “but I don’t want or need my own business“. And to that I say, if you are comfortable with someone else controlling your income, short-changing your value and paying you far below what you are worth, stay on the plantation while the rest of us escape. But don’t ever look at those who live the life you have dreamed of when you could be one of them instead. There is no age limitation. And even when it comes to college education, did you know many of the top richest people in this country neither got that way working for someone else nor because of a college degree? I am not putting down a college education and yes I have one. But I am saying college produces middle class worker bees, for the most part – not wealthy entrepreneurs. Pull up a list of those successful entrepreneurs who did not make it there because of a college education and you will be shocked. Anyway, here is to your success which begins as soon as you want it to.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 17, 2016 1:46pm   Comments Share: Related TJX 8 Stocks You Should Be Watching Today Earnings Scheduled For November 15, 2016 The Vetr community has downgraded $TJX to 2.5-Stars (Vetr) On Tuesday, TJX Companies Inc (NYSE: TJX) reported Q2 earnings per share and revenues above analyst consensus, however, management reported forecasts for Q3 were below analyst estimates. In addition, same-store sales came up short sending shares down after the report. BMO Capital’s John Morris remained optimistic on TJX despite the market’s recent negative reaction. Among the reasoning behind Morris’ hopeful outlook was a lean inventory leading to future gross margin expansion and TJX’s strategic positioning amidst Macy’s 100 store closings. Related Link: TJX's 'Underlying Sales Momentum Is Humming,' According To Goldman Macy’s Store Closings Present Opportunity “TJX is a key beneficiary from Macy's (NYSE: M) decision to close 100 stores. The customer that typically shops these lower-tier Macy's is far more likely to pivot to a TJX offering than another full price channel,” stated Morris. Additionally, vendors including TJX can buy inventory from Macy’s closed stores that are priced for exposure. The store closings will also position TJX companies better to bolster vendor relationships as competition declines according to the analyst. Lean Inventory “Based on recent inventory-to-sales data points, which we confirmed with our department store analyst, Wayne Hood, we believe that department store inventory is lean heading into the fall season,” stated the BMO analyst. Lean inventory will lead the store channel to pull back on promotions while widening the value differential resulting in gross margin expansion, according to Morris. Morris maintained his Outperform Rating and $85 price target.

Believe it or not, Google is not the next Big Brother By Greg Gambone, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 17, 2016, 12:18 pm EST     Popular Posts: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Get a Boost From IBM Recent Posts: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Get a Boost From IBM Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock’s New Backbone: Artificial Intelligence Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) Alliances Won’t Help Android Pay Take Down PayPal (PYPL) View All Posts Since before its existence as a publicly traded company, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) has had to fend off waves of antitrust accusations and charges of intellectual property violations, invasion of privacy and a myriad of other issues. GOOGL’s legal department expanded to nearly 100 lawyers in its first five years, and by 2014 had around 400 lawyers. Source: Travis Wise via Flickr The question, though, is why does the world seem to hunt Google? Obviously, a company as large as Google, which has a hand in countless aspects of the technology arena across the globe, is more likely to be the target of lawsuits simply because of its involvement there. That’s the easy explanation, but is there something more? Don’t Be Evil From early 2000 to late 2015 (when Google officially became Alphabet), the company’s corporate motto was simple: Don’t be evil. 8 Retail Stocks That Will Make You Richer Now, there are sure to be hoards of people who will — quite vehemently no doubt — argue that Google is evil, and cite evidence to defend that claim. But, if you were to exclude all the people who claim Google is evil simply because they didn’t get what they wanted from a product or service, or didn’t receive customer support that was as comprehensive as they wanted, or those people who are just plain crazy, what would you really have left? How many viable, plausible instances could there be where evidence exists demonstrating that Google acted with blatant malicious intent to harm a person? You know … actual evil. Personally, I don’t think Google is evil. I’m not saying the company has never behaved in a manner that’s morally questionable, or never made decisions that (in hindsight) were probably not the wisest choices. But, overall as a corporation, Google has demonstrated significantly more benevolence than malevolence. GOOGL Is Not Big Brother I think there’s a semi-unconscious global social resistance to, and fear of, extremely large corporations, particularly those that handle personal information. Think of George Orwell’s 1984 in modern times, or the movie Equilibrium with Christian Bale. People are, quite understandably, frightened of companies or organizations that possess enormous amounts of confidential data. In today’s day and age, Google is equated with Big Brother, a metaphor strengthened by discoveries of Google’s interactions with our own government’s secret agencies. While Orwellian scenarios are perhaps a bit extreme, I think they accurately represent society’s innate distrust and apprehension. Just think about it — in a worst-case scenario, 50 years from now Google could be the world’s Big Brother equivalent. Even though there’s no indisputable evidence suggesting that such intentions exist, the mere possibility is frightening to the average person. Couple that with the Snowden-esque whistleblowers and WikiLeaks reveals showing how our government, and others, has been invading citizens’ privacy, it’s only natural for people to want to limit the power of companies like Google. Surviving Within a Society Built on Distrust We, as Americans, enjoy a plethora of civil liberties that citizens in many other countries cannot. Some Asian and Middle Eastern nations are prime examples of limited freedoms, as government oversight has a stranglehold on the populace. Consider the socio-cultural history of those regions and their track record of extreme censorship and information control. For example, Chinese and North Korean people have been suffering under the stifling grip of absurdly tyrannical leadership determined to maintain total control over the dissemination of information. Companies like Google have endeavored to increase freedom of, and access to, information across the globe, which is why there’s such a firm resistance from the governments of those Asian nations. Google represents freedom, education and independent opinions, which is completely opposite what the leadership there wants. Target Corporation (TGT) Clubbed on Another Sickly Quarter This, specifically, is why Google is perceived as dangerous, and is the basis for blocking or restricting access in those parts of the world. Leaders there continually target GOOGL because the company’s American values are ingrained into its products and services, and those values must not be allowed to reach the general public for fear of inciting anti-government sentiment. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Walmart, other foreign firms keen to invest in food retail Our Bureau   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Avinash Srivastava, Secretary, Food Processing Ministry FDI worth $1.04 b have come into food processing in last two years: Secretary New Delhi, August 17:   US-based retail giant Walmart and some other foreign food retail companies have “shown interest’’ in bringing in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the food retail sector in India following the relaxation in investment rules. “We have met the ambassadors and industry organisations of various countries to brief them on the new FDI rules in the food retail sector so that they can spread the word amongst their industry,” said Avinash Srivastava, Secretary, Food Processing Ministry, at a press conference on achievements of the sector under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. Srivastava said that Walmart and some other big multinationals, including a Brazilian food company, had shown interest in bringing in FDI in the food retail sector, but had not applied officially. The government, recently, allowed 100 per cent FDI under government approval route for retail, including through e-commerce, of food products manufactured or produced in India. The BJP-led government, however, continues to disfavour FDI in the multi-brand retail. “We hope that the FDI that will flow into the sector following this decision will reduce food wastage as well as generate employment,” Srivastava said. The Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), in its achievement report for the food processing sector under the ‘Make in India’ programme, pointed out that the sector attracted FDI worth $1.04 billion from April 2014 to March 2016. Food wastage was expected to come down by 10 per cent of ₹9,200 crore every year because of the 32 lakh tonne capacity of cold storage created with an expenditure of ₹9,000 crore in the the last two years.

Richelle Stewart told WCMH that she was visiting the Lancaster, Ohio-area store on Sunday evening when she noticed the monkey attacking the employee and began to video the confrontation. "I saw the monkey, and he was just standing on the carts, and this lady was trying to come over and get him," Stewart said. "The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her." >> Read more trending stories   The video shows the monkey's owner yelling to "let her go" with the animal jumping on the employee and the owner pushing him out of the way. WCMH reported the employee was not bitten by the animal and was able to grab its leash and take it back to its owner, who "was grateful." WCMH added that the Department of Agriculture is attempting to track down the woman because the animal might not be registered. Read more at WCMH.

(NYSE: WMT) is scheduled to release its most recent earnings report before the markets open on Thursday. So far in 2016, this company is one of the top five performing Dow stocks, and investors may be expecting this momentum to carry over into the earnings report. Here are a few things to keep in mind ahead of the report. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters call for $1.02 in earnings per share (EPS) on $120.16 billion in revenue. In the same period of last year, the world’s largest retailer posted EPS of $1.08 and $120.23 billion in revenue. Earlier this month, the company announced that it would acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and stock. Reports of a possible acquisition had became public, so the announcement was expected. Although this data will not be reflected in this earnings report, we might expect some mention in the guidance about how Wal-Mart expects to tackle its e-commerce competition. The Jet.com deal leads to the obvious question: How does this acquisition help Wal-Mart put a bigger dent in Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce? Wal-Mart said that the combined company will “leverage innovative technology solutions from both companies to develop new offerings to help customers save time and money.” It’s really anybody’s guess as to what that means. A few analysts weighed in on Wal-Mart ahead of the earnings report: MKM Partners reiterated a Neutral rating with a $71 price target. Jefferies reiterated a Buy rating with an $85 price target. Goldman Sachs has a Neutral rating with a $71 price target. Morgan Stanley has a Neutral rating with a $73 price target. Deutsche Bank reiterated a Hold rating with a $77 price target. Northcoast Research has a Neutral rating. Merrill Lynch has a Neutral rating with a $72 price target. Credit Suisse reiterated a Hold rating. Excluding Wednesday’s move, Wal-Mart has outperformed the broad markets, with the stock up 21.5% year to date. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock is only up about 4.5%. Shares were trading down 0.8% at $72.34 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $70.19 and a 52-week trading range of $56.30 to $74.80.

The center has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Wal-Mart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage.  Click here for the full article, "A look at Wal-Mart's food lab, aimed at developing new items."

In its last earnings report, the discount retailing giant had turned in higher-than-expected sales at stores open more than a year, a key retailing metric. But Wal-Mart has been struggling to bolster its online sales, and its planned acquisition of the fast-growing e-commerce company Jet.com will take a while to bear fruit. And Wal-Mart may still feel a drag from higher labor costs, the result of investments in training and higher wages. Click the above audio player to hear the full report.

Macy’s thrilled investors Thursday and Nordstrom wowed the Street the following day. True, you could easily argue that expectations for this subsector were so low that earnings beats were quite likely. The charts, though, don’t care about why stocks break out, and right now a good number of retail stocks are indeed doing just that. To be sure, these are short-term...

Why? Because the so-called Clean Trucks program will save fuel and operating expenses for corporate owners and provide new revenue streams for manufacturers, which stand to benefit financially from developing more efficient engines and vehicle technologies. Fuel is the largest single cost for trucking fleets. It’s also a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is the second biggest contributor to US carbon dioxide emissions, and heavy-duty vehicles account for about 20 percent of these emissions and oil use in the US transportation sector — representing the biggest increase in the sector’s emissions. “PepsiCo believes strong phase two standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles will further enhance our efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet, while meeting environmental and business goals,” Frito-Lay North America supply chain senior director Michael O’Connell said in an email. “In our opinion, the phase two standards are balanced, with the EPA and NHTSA having done an excellent job of incorporating feedback from multiple stakeholders including manufacturers, fleet operators, private operators and environmental NGOs.” Eaton said the new standards would deliver “significant” fuel and emissions reductions — and added that it would play a role in helping fleets achieve these benefits. “As a leading supplier of advanced transmissions, engine and powertrain components, Eaton is committed to delivering cost effective technologies that will help our customers achieve significant operational savings,” said Craig Arnold, Eaton chairman and CEO. “These new standards ensure that we both satisfy customers and protect the environment.” The final standards are the second round of federal regulations to improve fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions from trucks and buses. They will require emissions be reduced by 25 percent by 2027 and apply to semi-trucks, large pickup trucks and vans, and all types and sizes of buses and work trucks. The EPA expects the rules will lower carbon emissions by about 1.1 billion metric tons. And while they will add $27 billion in upfront costs, the agency says they will save vehicle owners fuel costs of about $170 billion, and reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles sold under the program. “These standards will not only benefit our climate, but also modernize America’s trucking fleet, cut costs for truckers, and help ensure the US trucking industry is a global leader in fuel efficient heavy duty vehicle technology,” EPA administrator Gina McCarthy and DOT secretary Anthony Foxx wrote in a blog post. The Clean Trucks program also includes provisions that the agencies say reduce the burden on small-businesses, such as a one-year delay in initial standards for small businesses and simplified certification requirements. On a call with reporters, McCarthy and Foxx said fleet owners can achieve these emissions reductions through existing technologies such as improved engines and tires, better aerodynamics and vehicle weight reductions achieved by using lighter materials. “Truck owner will recoup their investment in less than years through fuel savings,” Foxx said. Compared to the proposed standards, released last year, the final clean truck rules achieve 10 percent more GHG and fuel consumption reductions, the agencies said. The second-phase Clean Truck standards build on the first-ever first phase of GHG reduction and fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles finalized in in 2011. These standards apply to model years 2014-2018; the agencies say they will result in emissions reductions of 270 million metric tons and save vehicle owners more than $50 billion in fuel costs. The American Trucking Association said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the phase two rules and hoped the 10-year phase-in period for the regulation would not be unduly disruptive to fleets and manufacturers. “While today’s fuel prices are more than 50 percent lower than those we experienced in 2008, fuel is still one of the top two operating expenses for most trucking companies,” said ATA president and CEO Chris Spear in a statement. “That’s why our industry has worked closely with both the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the past three-and-a-half years to ensure these fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards took into account the wide diversity of equipment and operations across the trucking sector.” More than 300 companies called for strong final standards during the rulemaking process, including PepsiCo and Walmart, two of the nation’s largest fleets. “We support a strong Phase 2 rule that will drive innovation in truck technologies to viable solutions at a pace that ensures the technologies will have the intended triple bottom line outcomes without unintended consequences,” said Walmart senior VP in comments to the agencies. UPS director of advanced engineering Mike Britt called the standards “forward looking and feasible” and said the concerns that fuel-efficiency technologies won’t be reliable enough by 2027 can be avoided. “We know technologies validated in programs like Super Truck and in labs across the country are ready for market introductions,” Britt said in a letter to the EPA. “We call on the truck and engine makers to speed the validating and deploying of higher efficiency systems and technologies. And we call on the Department of Energy and other federal and state agencies to work with the manufacturers and suppliers to provide critical funding for the development and testing of advanced truck technologies and components.” Also yesterday, the Energy Department announced it will invest up to $137 million to develop efficiency technologies for heavy duty trucks and passenger cars. This includes $57 million for technologies that will more than double the freight efficiency of 18-wheelers. It follows an earlier $80 million in funding for the SuperTruck II, which aims to bring to market technologies to increase tractor-trailer fuel, engine and drivetrain efficiency for 18-wheelers.

Christopher Alston, 29, of 149 Chipper Road, Waterbury, was arrested on Monday and charged with criminal attempt to commit first-degree robbery, criminal attempt to commit sixth-degree larceny and breach of peace. On May 27 around 8 a.m., a man, later identified by police as Alston, walked into Wal-Mart, 235 Queen St., and went to the register with an iced tea. When the clerk started ringing up the purchase, Alston lifted his shirt to reveal a handgun and demanded money, said police spokesman Lt. Michael Baribault. Alston fled without any cash after the clerk yelled. From this section: Finance board concerned about cash handling at Southington High School Witnesses gave police license plate information for a light blue Scion that Alston got into in the store parking lot, Baribault said. On May 31, Shelton police stopped a similar car in the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Shelton, Baribault said. The driver was identified as Alston and he was taken into custody after police found a BB gun in the car. Alston turned himself in to Southington police on Monday.

Published Aug 16th, 2016 6:13 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart’s international division continues to streamline operations with its latest move to sell its Suburbia clothing chain owned by its Mexican business unit in a deal reportedly valued at $852 million. The deal sheds Wal-Mart of 119 store locations and the associated debt. The retail giant sold the business to El Puerto De Liverpool, which already runs more than 100 retail outlets in Mexico. Walmart International CEO Dave Cheesewright told the media in June that the company would look for opportunities to sell assets that don’t fit the new streamlined retail focus, which in most places is centered on grocery. In June, he said the first round of bids on the Suburbia business were underway. “Any business that is either not performing or we don’t see a way of turning it around and we don’t believe it’s core to our operations we will look for ways to dispose of it,” Cheesewright said. Since 2013 Wal-Mart sold its Vips restaurant chain for $626 million and last year Wal-Mart parted ways with its banking unit garnering about $247 million for those assets. Walmart also sold a shopping center chain in Chile and joint real estate venture in Canada. He said Mexico’s business unit is profitable and running high comps under the executive direction of Enrique Ostale who took over the Latin America leadership about 18 months ago. In the first quarter of this year Mexico delivered 9% comp sales and solid performance behind momentum in its effort to double the business of Walmex, which includes Mexico and Central America over the next five years. Cheesewright said growth will come from expanding the bodega grocery formats, adding a few supercenters and larger grocery formats in places like Nicaragua and Guatemala with a much of the expansion taking place in Mexico. He said a major reason why Walmart operates abroad is to take advantage of growth opportunities. In the 28 countries where Walmart operates, Cheesewright said the retailer has access to about 60% of the all the global growth that will occur in the next 10 years. He said a lion’s share of growth (80%) is global. “It’s very simple logic that if International can’t grow over the U.S. that makes it very hard for our total corporation to grow against global competitors. As a business whose goal is to sell for less, if you are not growing life is pretty tough,” he said. “We are very proud that for nine quarters now Walmart International has seen increased comp sales growth.” He said when Mexico and Canada’s markets are performing well his job gets easier because those two countries make up the bulk of the nearly $480 billion annual sales. Cheesewright said the international division is big and diverse in part because through acquisition the retail giant picked up smaller sideline businesses that were also owned by the parent company. Walmex reports that Suburbia is a profitable apparel business that stretches across 46 urban areas. Walmart International has owned Suburbia since 1997 with it acquired the supermarket chain Cifra, which was also the parent of Suburbia. Analysts do not expect this sell of Suburbia to have a material impact on earnings. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) closed Tuesday (Aug. 16) at $72.89, down 43 cents. Wal-Mart will report its fiscal second quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday (Aug. 18).

The Renaissance Center in Detroit  —  HQ of General Motors. Strategic prerogatives motivated both deals. For 108-year-old GM, the Cruise deal instantly makes it a contender in autonomous transportation — not an insignificant move for an automaker with little software DNA. For 86-year-old Unilever, the DSC deal allows it to compete more effectively on a direct-to-consumer basis with its nemesis, Procter & Gamble, which owns the shaving giant Gillette. Unilever HQ in Rotterdam, Netherlands. If the buyers had been Silicon Valley companies, these deals would be less remarkable. Instead, we find two “traditional” consumer product companies paying Silicon Valley prices for startups. And, of course, the buying streak continued with the purchase of Jet.com by Walmart for $3.3 billion, of which $3 billion is cash consideration. Will we see more old-line consumer businesses buying their way into innovation in the coming years? I think so. Examining the resources of those companies, it becomes evident that more deals of this type are possible, and, in fact, quite likely. I pulled public company data from the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the U.S. and filtered for categories like consumer goods, services and logistics. I then removed any companies with less than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, because startups are unlikely to take public company stock in a slower growing business in lieu of cold, hard cash. The chart below shows the cash balance and growth rate of the 31 remaining companies: Source: Public company filings via Sentieo and Yahoo Finance (7/30/2016). These companies have $133 billion of cash in total, with a median of $2.4 billion. Nine of these have greater than $5 billion of cash on hand:  Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Pepsi (PEP), Walmart (WMT), UPS (UPS), Costco (COST), Nike (NKE) Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA). To buy a company for $1 billion, these companies would spend less than 20 percent of their cash on hand. (Walmart spent more than one-third of its $8.7 billion of cash to buy Jet, so perhaps the list should be even longer!) Furthermore, their growth rates are anemic. The group’s median growth rate is 2.6 percent annually, which is a little more than double the rate of inflation and roughly one-seventh that of the “five tech horsemen”: Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Nearly all the growth in the consumer space is therefore being fueled by software. It stands to reason that many of these 31 companies are thinking about what their software strategy is, or how they can use the internet to form more direct relationships with their customers. In the future, there may be a fuzzier line between a “consumer products” company and a “consumer technology” company. Related Articles What this year's M&A activity tells us about media and entertainment Why did Unilever pay $1B for Dollar Shave Club?   GM buys self-driving car kit startup Cruise, plans to use tech to make driverless cars Making that transition should be a scary proposition to many of these old-line businesses. It requires new products, fresh talent and the willingness to take risks and make big investments. Yet, the cash is there  —  $133 billion of it, to be precise. Using it to buy one’s way into the future doesn’t seem like a crazy idea. Of course, the cynical finance student in me knows that these deals are notoriously difficult to execute for large, slow-growing companies. GM trades at 0.66x its $158 billion in annual revenues, so it has two problems. First, almost any tech acquisition will be dilutive to its share price , which Wall Street hates. Second, to add even a percentage point to GM’s growth rate would require it to contribute $1.6 billion of new revenue from its target. Both of these problems seem intractable to a finance wonk analyzing the deal, and yet GM was able to pull off the Cruise deal. No doubt some very senior managers at GM had to put significant credibility on the line to get this deal done. Not every legacy consumer company will have the conviction that GM, Unilever or Walmart had in recent months, but some will. If you’re considering the M&A path for your company, my advice would be to start developing senior relationships at a number of these non-traditional acquirers today. You might be educating them about what the future could be like, but in a more capital-constrained environment like 2016, these players have the cash and motivation to make a deal happen. And, now a precedent exists.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot Deal Professor By STEVEN DAVIDOFF SOLOMON AUG. 16, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Credit Harry Campbell Walmart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com can be expected to sail through antitrust review, eliciting barely a peep of objection from the federal government. Like Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant. This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few. Jet.com was created to take on the dominant force in internet sales, Amazon.com. Although traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Sears are dying slowly, unable to adapt to the internet, Jet.com — founded by Marc Lore, who sold the parent company of Diapers.com and other sites to Amazon for $545 million — has been different. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Opening for business just about a year ago, Jet.com was able to achieve scale remarkably quickly, reportedly increasing revenue to more than $1 billion, with more than 3.5 million registered shoppers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, Jet.com has been losing money on every shipment, but remember that Amazon went years without turning a significant profit. Jet.com is still a minnow — Amazon clocks in $100 billion in annual revenue — but it is, as Investor’s Business Daily put it, “one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that’s openly challenging Amazon’s dominance.” And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart. This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside. The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town. This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off. Antonio García Martínez’s recent book about Silicon Valley, “Chaos Monkeys,” tells how Facebook operates on the model of “we might die any day.” Mr. García Martínez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction. Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day. Video Walmart’s New E-Commerce Strategy Marc Lore, left, the chief executive of Jet.com, and Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, are teaming up against Amazon. By CNBC on Publish Date August 9, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed If you don’t believe this, there is a poignant passage in “Chaos Monkeys” where Mr. García Martínez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with “hockey stick growth” that matched Facebook’s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million. This is par for the course in Silicon Valley. Google bought Waze for $1 billion in part to prevent Facebook from getting it and in part to buttress its own dominant map technology. The result is that Google remains dominant with only Apple as its main competitor. For a time, the only other competitor to these two was Nokia’s Here maps, which was sold to a group of car companies in 2015 for use in driverless cars and has disappeared as a competitor. The result is a duopoly in map technology. Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet’s user growth. Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft. Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would “lessen competition.” Under the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition. This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing. The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost. The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus’s destruction. If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.

Bangladesh exported more than 800 tonnes of mangos, mainly to the European markets, last year, but the amount fell to 300 tonnes this season. The first shipment of 500 boxes of mangos (625 kilograms) was sent in May last year. Exporters have to obtain phytosanitary or quarantine certificates -- relating to the health of plants, especially with respect to the requirements of international trade -- from the department concerned. “Last year I exported more than 100 tonnes, mainly to different stores of Walamrt in London, but this year I sent only 35 tonnes, not to my previous customers, as the agreement with Walmart has been scrapped this year,” said Paritosh Chandra Das, proprietor of Dip International. This year, he sent mangos mainly to the non-resident Bangladeshis. “I could not send mangos to Walmart this year despite a rise in order,” he said. Mango export became difficult this year as the quarantine department asked exporters to pack the mangos in the garden, not in warehouses or elsewhere, so that the produce remains free of health hazardous elements. But packing the mangos in the garden is not possible now, he said. The traders cannot also go for contract farming immediately as the process for such farming is lengthy, Das said. “So, the entire system for exporting mangos has to be revisited,” Das said. The EU last year cancelled 15 consignments of vegetables and mangos as those failed to maintain the health standards of the EU, he said. Some consignments were abandoned this year as well because of the same reasons, he added. Khaledur Rahman, proprietor of Khaled Trade Syndicate, said: “I exported a small quantity of mangos as the authorities asked us to export through contract farming.” Traders and officials from the agriculture and commerce ministries already visited some mango gardens in different districts to get an idea how contract farming can be done, Rahman said. Not only England, some other European countries such as Germany, France and Italy also became a major destination, he added. Muhammad Anwar Hossain Khan, deputy director (export) of the plant protection wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension, said the European Union gave some suggestions on how to improve packaging standards. “We have already contacted some mango growers in 13 districts to encourage them to do contract farming,” Khan said. Farmers and exporters will get higher prices if they follow the European standards, he added. He said they have prepared a national action plan on safe and pesticide-free mango export. “We will submit the action plan to the agriculture ministry this week,” he said. Farmers and traders will have to follow guidelines of the action plan as mango has potential for becoming a major export item, he said. Zahir Uddin Ahmed, additional secretary (export) of the commerce ministry, said: “We are working with different ministries to resolve the problem in mango export. We will soon be able to start export in bulk.” Japan is also a major market for Bangladeshi mangos, he said, adding that traders will have to follow the standards to raise exports.

Game Plan For The Week - Cramer's Mad Money (11/18/16) (Seeking Alpha) The importance of e-commerce sales in the retail world has hit an all-time high. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s high profile purchase of jet.com to take on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) $111 billion e-commerce empire highlights how key an online strategy is for a brick-and-mortar business. Many established stores are struggling to keep up with the new online retail environment, but they acknowledge that it is essential for survival. It may come to pass that companies, which have been around for decades, will cease to exist if they don't alter their e-commerce strategy.

Additionally, Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) has announced it will be closing 100 stores to regroup and redevelop their omnichannel approach. E-commerce retail sales grew 4.5 percent overall in Q2, and it is likely this figure will continue to increase. "We operate in a fast-changing world, and our company is moving forward decisively," said Macy's CEO Terry J. Lundgren in a news release. "This involves doing things differently and making tough decisions as we position ourselves to serve customers who have high expectations." The change can be made successfully, as Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) displayed with their recent Q2 results. Nordstrom.com sales grew 9.4 percent year-over-year to $683 million, just a few months after the company announced heavy mobile investments to boost its e-commerce business. It appears to be working; Nordstrom's stock is up 30 percent in the last month. With e-commerce retail sales now accounting for 8.1 percent of total sales, an online presence and strategy has been more important than ever.

"That crash turned me into an emotional wreck," Morgan said.  "Anybody out there listening, you try to get hit by a truck going that fast with 85,000 pounds of frozen food in the back, watch what it do to you." Morgan said. "It's going to turn you into a wreck." Tracy Morgan thanks his N.J. caregivers, 'You are the people who saved my life'. Morgan was traveling in a limousine bus with his friend and mentor, Jimmy McNair, and three others when they were struck from behind by a Wal-Mart truck. McNair, who was known as Jimmy Mack, died in the crash. When Morgan woke up from a coma two weeks after the crash, he said he was blind, struggling to speak and unable to walk.  "I thought about suicide man," Morgan told Stern. "I was that damaged in the hospital man. I didn't want to live." After he returned home from the hospital, Morgan said he and his wife didn't leave the house for months. "We stayed indoors for five months and then I just said, I got angry, I said, 'F*** that,'" he said. "After seven, eight, 10 months I started to take my life back. I need my life back. I got to live." Kevin Roper, the driver of the Wal-Mart truck, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash, according to authorities. Roper pleaded not guilty in February to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and eight counts of aggravated assault. Stern asked Morgan — who settled a lawsuit against Wal-Mart last year for an undisclosed sum — whether he could ever forgive Roper. "One day, I pray to God all the time, for the strength to do that, just the strength, I don't ask for nothing else, just the strength" Morgan said. Morgan also addressed the settlement he received from Wal-Mart, saying "it was more than money." "It was justice for Jimmy, for all those involved. It was just justice I was seeking. I wanted justice for the families." he said. Morgan said he's been overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support he has received since the crash and now is focused on "giving the love back." "It was bad. It was a bad accident," he said, but "I'm here. I'm a different person." Erin O'Neill may be reached at eoneill@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @LedgerErin.

(Facebook / Richelle Stewart) Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca @joshelliott14 Published Tuesday, August 16, 2016 12:50PM EDT A Walmart employee out to move a few shopping carts around found himself on the wrong end of a bizarre encounter with a diaper-wearing monkey, in an incident captured on video. The video, which was shared on Facebook Sunday, shows the monkey grabbing at the employee while perched on a cart return corral in the parking lot of a Walmart in Lancaster, Ohio. The monkey can be heard screeching during the short battle. Moments after the scuffle begins, a blonde-haired woman runs in to separate the monkey and the man, screaming: "Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!" She then takes the animal by the hand and leads it away, but not before scolding the employee for putting her pugnacious primate at risk. "If he bites you they'll put him down," she snaps at the man in the video. The woman does not apologize or look back as she walks off with the monkey, which can be seen toddling along beside her. The video was shot from inside a vehicle in the parking lot. After the encounter, a man in the vehicle can be heard telling the bewildered employee: "Man, you could've gotten hurt." It's not the first monkey-and-retail incident to make headlines in recent years. Back in 2012, a baby monkey in a faux shearling coat was photographed at an Ikea in Toronto. The animal, named Darwin, did not harm anyone in the incident, which spawned countless memes online. The Walmart monkey does not have Darwin's fashion sense, as it appears to only be wearing a diaper. Judging by the way it was reaching for the Walmart employee's reflective poncho, however, it may have been looking to accessorize.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Is Your Brand Trusted? Here's What Happens When It Is—and Isn't by Josh Zywien  |   August 16, 2016  |  2,173 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Think back to the days before Amazon grew into the retail behemoth it is today. Back then, if you went shopping at a mall or a big box store, such as Wal-Mart, you did so knowing that those stores—despite their massive inventory—might not have the exact item you needed. The growth of e-commerce in the mid-2000s helped to eradicate that issue, but it also introduced a new one: Even if you found what you needed online, you often had to pay hefty shipping fees and wait a week (or more) to receive it. Now, compare those experiences with the one Amazon offers its customers today. With a couple clicks, people now have access to a seemingly infinite number of items in virtually every color, variation, and size. And if they're Amazon Prime members, they know that whatever they buy will arrive on their doorstep within 48 hours (and without additional shipping fees). In short, the entire experience is absurdly convenient and consistent—two factors that have contributed to Amazon Prime's now reaching nearly half of US households. The Immense Value of Earning Customers' Trust Not that Amazon is without flaws. To the contrary, it has a track record of extraordinary failures. Its Fire phone was one of the most notable flops in tech history. The unique thing about Amazon, however, is that it's managed to emerge from those mistakes relatively unscathed. So, what separates Amazon from other retail brands—allowing it to survive major errors and grow faster than any retailer in history? One word: Trust. Very simply, because Amazon's customer experience is so consistent and convenient, it allows customers to build a relationship with the brand that's deeply rooted in reliability and conviction. When customers come to Amazon, they do so knowing the company will meet their needs, solve their problems, and conserve their resources (time, money, etc.). Naturally, this relationship generates... Higher senses of empowerment and confidence, leading to more frequent buying patterns Reduced mental and physical anguish, removing the friction associated with purchases Elevated feelings of security and reliability, leading to stronger brand loyalty and commitment These feelings don't only apply to customers' relationships with B2C brands like Amazon. Two sterling examples of brand trust in action are Salesforce and IBM—B2B companies with reputations personified by characteristics such as reliability, quality, and performance. Salesforce and IBM, like Amazon, have a track record of simplifying customers' lives, preserving their resources, and removing the risks typically associated with purchases. And, like Amazon, those companies' track records allow both brands to forge trust-based customer relationships that yield loyalty and advocacy. Four Questions to Assess Your Level of Brand Trust The concept of brand trust is explored in depth in a forthcoming book by marketing researchers C. Whan Park, Deborah J. MacInnis, and Andreas B. Eisingerich: Brand Admiration: Building a Business People Love. I've also written previously about how trust, love, and respect all serve as foundational pillars for the authors' broader concept of brand admiration. But let's refocus just on the idea of trust by answering these questions: Do customers know exactly what they'll get when they come to your brand? Are they willing to almost instinctively buy into your new ideas and forgive your mistakes? Do they exhibit higher rates of loyalty and stronger repeat purchase patterns? What gaps exist in your business that could hurt your ability to build trust? If you're unsure about any of those questions, you'd be wise to invest time and resources into identifying areas where you can better cultivate and foster feelings of trust with your customers. The benefits of doing so can be enormous, and that investment can go a long way toward mitigating the risks and costs associated with adversarial customer relationships. Just ask Comcast, BP, and Bank of America—all of which have spent billions over the last few years to improve their brand's perception and rebuild trust with their stakeholders, with mixed results. If you cultivate and foster brand trust correctly, your company won't need to constantly throw piles of money at rebuilding and repairing trust with customers. Instead, that trust will be part and parcel with who you are as a business, and it will become one of the driving forces behind why people choose to associate with your brand. If you'd like to learn more about brand admiration and the framework that Park, MacInnis, and Eisengerich have developed, check out their brand admiration website, full of helpful information and resources to help you assess your company's level of brand admiration.

Microsoft, Apple, Intel and Salesforce have joined the likes of Walmart and Unilever in ponying up hundreds of millions — or even billions — to buy technology companies in recent months in what can only be described as a feeding frenzy. The list of names scooped up by these buyers reads like a who’s who of high-profile Internet services: LinkedIn, Yahoo, Dollar Shave Club, Jet.com. Others like Twitter, Pandora and Lyft are said to be acquisition targets too. The spree comes as public companies such as LinkedIn and Twitter get hammered for failing to meet Wall Street’s demands for growth, and startups face a volatile market for going public with increased pressure from investors to be profitable. All of the sudden, some public and private tech companies are more interested in ditching Wall Street for the lucrative embrace of a bigger company. And the big companies, once skittish about sky high valuations in tech, are now all too happy to swoop in. “2016 will go down as the year of the lack of the tech IPO and a market of incredibly robust M&A activity,” says Daniel O’Keefe, general partner at Technology Crossover Ventures, an investor in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for close to $1 billion. Not a single tech company went public in the first quarter of 2016 and just nine have had IPOs so far this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, are soaring. Deals to buy private tech companies have totaled $318 billion for the year so far, significantly outpacing the $250 billion spent on tech M&A through the first three full quarters of 2015, according to data from PitchBook. And according to O’Keefe, “I don’t think we’re done yet.” Venture capitalists and analysts point to a combination of factors setting the stage for more acquisitions: deflated valuations at certain private and public tech companies; low interest rates that make borrowing to finance deals easier; and corporations with loads of cash on hand. “You’ve got a lot of the large tech companies that have been doing well. They have a lot of cash and they have a lot of shareholder pressure to do something with that cash,” says James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, an independent research firm. At the same time, the pool of potential buyers increasingly includes tech and non-tech companies whose interests converge in areas like online shopping and self-driving cars. Some of the biggest startup acquisitions of the year came from outside traditional tech companies: General Motors spent a reported $1 billion buying Cruise Automation for autonomous vehicles; Unilever spent about as much on Dollar Shave Club; and Walmart agreed to buy shopping site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. “You have gone through an environment where neither side was buying. Now both the technology companies and the industrial companies are competing for assets,” says Harry Weller, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, one of the largest investors in Jet. That, Weller says, should only continue as more and more companies look to tap into technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing and robotics. Two years ago, some of these same companies might have refused to sell, or simply been too pricey for buyers to justify, thanks to a flood of private capital pouring into startups at high valuations from VCs and mutual funds. “I think we can all say with certainty that it was a robust pricing environment,” says O’Keefe. “I sensed corporates pulling back a bit in that environment.” Fast forward two years — through a turbulent global market, a clogged IPO pipeline and prominent companies like Square forced to go public at lower valuations — and startups finally start to lower their expectations for how much they’re worth. As Jeff Epstein, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, an early investor in LinkedIn, puts it, “Sometimes it takes two or three years for people to psychologically adjust to the new pricing levels.” This German bank is charging customers to hold their deposits Global central banks dump U.S. debt at record pace Related Posts Is this app the call center of the future?

Then it went bankrupt. Here's the exclusive inside story of what happened. By Lindsay Blakely & Burt Helm Lindsay Blakely is Inc.'s Los Angeles Bureau Chief. Burt Helm is Inc.'s senior contributing writer. 21 COMMENTS CREDIT: Tomer Hanuka Advertisement Jim Mitchell's morning ritual was as consistent as the Southern California sunshine. After fruit, bacon, and a blueberry muffin at Martha's 22nd Street Grill in Hermosa Beach, the CEO would cruise in his Porsche up Highway 1, to El Segundo. On this particular day in the fall of 2015, Mitchell had settled into his office at children's tablet maker Fuhu and was in the midst of his morning conference calls when a panicked employee from the finance department barged in. "You are not going to believe this," the staffer said. They turned to Mitchell's computer and logged into Fuhu's Wells Fargo account. The balance the day before: $4,512,662.53. The balance now? $0.00. Even before all of Fuhu's money disappeared, Mitchell was having a doozy of a month. Three weeks before, he and his co-founder, Robb Fujioka--Fuhu's mastermind and headstrong president--had been contacted by attorneys representing the company's primary manufacturer, Foxconn. The Chinese giant was more than just a vendor. It was an investor and patron that had been instrumental in launching Fuhu on its meteoric rise. With gross revenue of $196 million and a three-year growth rate of 158,957 percent, Fuhu had earned the top spot on the Inc. 500 list of the fastest- growing American private companies in both 2013 and 2014. But behind the scenes, the company was falling apart. In recent months, it had racked up unpaid bills from just about everyone it did business with. And Foxconn--to which Fuhu owed between $60 million and $110 million, depending on who was counting--had finally reached its breaking point. The lawyers told Fujioka and Mitchell that until they paid their tab, their company would be cut off. Fujioka insisted this was just a negotiating ploy. "There is no concept of bankruptcy or contract law in Asia," claims Fujioka, who considers himself well versed in the Chinese way. Within 48 hours, Fuhu's partners were on a plane to Hong Kong, where they hoped to strike a deal with Foxconn execu­tives. But Foxconn wouldn't budge. To Fujioka, it was all part of the dance. He sent his CEO back to El Segundo, assuming he understood that they would eventually work out a deal. But Mitchell, a former Accenture consultant, wasn't so sure. When he returned home, he phoned up Walmart, Target, and Best Buy to warn them that Fuhu might not be able to fill their Christmas orders. Then he called Christian Donohue, a managing director of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, an L.A. private equity firm that operates a special situations fund for distressed companies. Five months earlier, Mitchell and Fujioka had persuaded Tennenbaum to give them a $10 mil­lion loan to provide much needed cash flow. Once Donohue was on the line, he seemed sympathetic. "Christian's response was, 'This is unfortunate. This is a big surprise to all of us. I feel bad for you, but we will figure out a way to work through it,'" Mitchell later recalled. But by the morning of October 30, Tennenbaum had declared Fuhu in default of its loan agree­ment. Mitchell tried to negotiate, but it was no use. A few days later, Tennenbaum froze the assets in Fuhu's warehouse--then swept all of the cash from its bank account. When Mitchell saw the drained account, he tracked down Fujioka. "Can they fricking do this?" exclaimed Fujioka. Indeed, their lawyers soon explained, they fricking could. The consequences of losing their supplier were laid out in a thick stack of a Tennenbaum loan agreement that the Fuhu bosses had never bothered to read. By December, Fuhu would find itself filing for Chapter 11, concluding a ride neither Fujioka nor Mitchell had imag­ined would end so soon. In January, Mattel bought Fuhu's assets in a fire sale for $21.5 million. Now Fuhu's remaining creditors, which number more than a hundred and collec­tively are owed almost $110 million ($565 million if you count the estimated damages of a class-action lawsuit), have hired forensic accountants to sift through Fuhu's books to see where the money went, what can be clawed back, and whether any funds were misappropriated. How did Fuhu go from 158,957 percent growth to bankruptcy in three years? What happened--according to revenue. VIEW FULL VERSION What happened? When Fujioka and Mitchell volunteered to tell Inc. their story, we leapt at the chance to illustrate, up close and unsparingly, the risks inherent in rocket-fueled growth. We spent hours with the partners, interviewed 15 current and former employees, and reviewed hundreds of court documents, emails, and meeting notes. The rise and fall of Fuhu is a cautionary tale about the seductions of early success and the overconfidence it can breed. But most of all, it's the story of two entrepreneurs who pushed too hard to go big--one whose personal drive led him to take oversize risks against the advice of those around him, and one who failed to stop him. Everything changed for Fujioka the day he saw the five Ferraris parked inside John Hui's 10-car garage. By 2000, the 30-year-old had ascended from assis­tant sales manager at Cort Furniture Rental in Southern California to small-time dot-com entrepreneur. Fujioka had established a formula for hatching discrete tech marketing com­panies--graphic design, Web advertis­ing, email marketing--running a business for a couple of years, and then flipping it for a million bucks or so. Adopted from Korea, he had grown up in suburban Denver among a tight-knit group of second-generation Japanese families whose grandparents had invested in one another's local businesses. Now he was revitalizing their entrepreneurial roots, recruiting his childhood friends to work for their old pal, who, in their eyes, had become the brilliant kingpin of a burgeoning mini empire. "This guy is probably the smartest guy I know," says John Sagara, a buddy hired at Fujioka's ad firm Jump Communications who would go on to work at Fuhu. One of Fujioka's outfits was hired by electronics company Korea Data Systems to run an email campaign. Fujioka quickly realized that John Hui, its owner, was more than just a suit--the Chinese-American entrepreneur was a self-made multi­millionaire. Hui and his brother Steve were co-founders of the PC maker eMachines, which they had sold to Gateway for almost $290 million. It didn't take long for Fujioka to persuade Hui to take him on as his protégé. Fujioka's entrepreneurial enlightenment happened while he was traveling in Asia with the Huis, getting schooled in building fast-growth consumer electronics companies. "How they ran the business versus how I ran businesses was night and day," says Fujioka, noting their commitment to efficiency and cost-cutting. Fujioka also got a glimpse of mogulhood. There was the Huis' high-rolling social circle, which included Foxconn execs. Steve Hui, he was told, had purchased his own private island, while John Hui had that sprawling garage filled with Ferraris. "Two or three million dollars wasn't small where I come from," recalls Fujioka. "But I turned to John and said, 'I'm at this point in my career where I need to stop messing around with this small money.'" The idea for Fuhu, which launched in 2008, was Steve Hui's. The concept was to develop nifty software and license it to hardware manufacturers in the Huis' network. The company would be a partnership between the brothers and Fujioka (the name Fuhu combines the first two letters of their last names). Since Fujioka was admittedly impatient and blunt, they agreed to hire a CEO--a polished salesman who was at ease on country club golf courses. That's when Jim Mitchell's name surfaced. They logged into Fuhu's Wells Fargo account. The balance the day before: $4,512,662,53. The balance now? $0.00. If Fujioka got his grit from hustling, Mitchell got his finesse on a more conventional track. The 40-something from Indiana had spent nearly two decades at management consulting firm Accenture. He'd frequently jet between L.A. and Silicon Valley, catering to clients like HP and Intel, until 2008, when he cashed in his stock options with a plan to travel for a couple of years. But his wanderlust was interrupted by a call from John Hui, whom he'd helped advise at Accenture. Hui pitched Mitchell the Fuhu CEO gig, and then introduced him to his partner-to-be, Fujioka. While it seemed like an odd marriage, Fujioka and Mitchell's dynamic quickly fell into place. Mitchell liked deal making, while Fujioka preferred developing products. The co-founders came to an agreement: The Huis would put up the initial capital, help Fujioka and Mitchell with connections, and then step back and advise as needed. Mitchell would be the face of the business as CEO, while Fujioka would be president and run operations. Fuhu's earliest products were software--a kid-safe Web browser and customizable MP3-player apps. Early on, the relationship with Foxconn would shape both Fuhu and how its co-founders ran it. In 2010, after John Hui had made introductions, Foxconn invested $10 million in Fuhu. This granted Fujioka entry into one of the most powerful Asian companies in the world. "China has relationships that go from generation to generation, and they are based on a code of conduct," Fujioka says he learned quickly. "What you rely on is relationship and honor and ceremony." In 2011, Fujioka spotted an opportunity to do more business with his new investor. Foxconn had a few thousand Android tablets it wanted to offload; Fujioka decided to take the tablets off its hands. The Huis had warned the Fuhu execs to stay away from hardware, a tough business with huge overhead and slim margins, but they ignored the advice. The gamble paid off: Fuhu bundled the tablets with a child-friendly user interface, a playful red bumper, and kids' marketing. This became an early prototype for the first Nabi, which Mitchell persuaded Toys "R" Us to carry. By Christmas, the retailer had sold all of the 10,000 units it had and Fuhu was pioneering an entirely new market: mobile devices for children. Fuhu decided to go all in on kids' tablets, and watched sales soar. In 2012, it introduced three more versions of the Nabi. Mimicking the Apple model, there was an entire Nabi universe--educational software, a specialized user interface, and an expansive line of accessories. By the end of 2012, Fuhu's revenue had reached $118 million--more than 420 times what it had rung up as a software company. Building what they believed would be America's next great consumer electronics company, Fujioka and Mitchell decided to raise more cash. They sought a $65 million fundraising round at a $280 million valuation. Mitchell signed licensing deals with Disney and DreamWorks Animation, persuading the latter to invest $10 million. Fuhu added regularly catered lunches and flew some 200 employees to Las Vegas for a company retreat, where they partied in the Hard Rock Hotel's presidential suite. As Fuhu swelled to over 300 workers in 2013, Fujioka began telling his young staffers he was going to make them rich. Sometimes, he'd award them with fat raises and lofty new titles on the spot. Working there was an adrenaline rush. "I felt like I'd landed on a gold mine," says one former employee. By late 2013, sales had rocketed to $196 million. Visions of an IPO danced in the partners' heads. But Fuhu was hardly prepared to go public. The company's finance department consisted of an accountant, a bookkeeper, and no for­mal budget. So Fujioka and Mitchell started hiring CPAs and financial ana­lysts and began IPO discussions with Goldman Sachs. It was Fuhu's new number crunchers who would warn of the coming trouble. They took issue with the massive revenue projections that Fujioka and Mitchell had sent to the invest­ment bank. An early model had Fuhu going from $200 million in revenue in 2013 to as much as $800 million a year later. However, actual sales never kept pace with the company's ambitions, and the finance department had to keep revising the forecasts downward. By July, Fujioka was telling staff to expect roughly $350 million in annual revenue. Even that felt aggressive to the bean counters. Meanwhile, the nascent children's tablet market was get­ting crowded. In the coming year, Amazon launched a kids' version of its Fire tablet. Sprout, Comcast's children's cable network, introduced its own tablet, which sold through Walmart. Sales of Fuhu's two workhorse products, the Nabi 2 and the Nabi Jr., began to level off. If Fuhu was going to achieve its lofty growth targets--or even keep sales flat--it needed another hit. Fujioka tended to respond to most problems by launching new products, and he wasn't going to get slowed down by market research. Between early 2013 and mid-2014, Fuhu rolled out a bunch of kids' tech toys: a GoPro-style action camera, headphones, and special-edition Nabis. Then came an idea that would put the Nabi brand squarely in the center of the kids' entertainment business, opening the door for content deals and a Netflix-like subscription service. The DreamTab, as it was called, was an upmarket tablet released in partner­ship with Fuhu's new investor, DreamWorks, that would come packed with cartoons and movies. With his eye on doubling revenue, Fujioka persuaded Foxconn to manufacture more than 150,000 DreamTabs. But by the summer of 2014, instead of a hot new product, what Fuhu had was a dud. Consumers shied away from the high price of $269. Reviewers criticized the cross-promotional DreamWorks marketing, calling it crass. Fuhu now had a growing tab with Foxconn and had stuck its distributor with a glut of unsold DreamTabs. Meanwhile, slowing sales scared off investors and the company raised less than half of its $65 million goal. Bankers declined to back a public offering anytime soon. Then, Fuhu was slapped with a class-action law­suit. Allegedly, Nabi 2's batteries were faulty--in some cases, they were literally catching fire. The brewing financial crisis would have tested even the best-led com­pany, but Fuhu was not that. By 2014, CEO Mitchell had slipped further into a supporting role as a one-man sales and investor-relations team, while Fujioka had become the com­pany's leader. And from moment to moment, employees rarely knew which version of Fujioka they would get--the nurturing mentor or the dictator. As Fujioka had done at his prior companies, at Fuhu he hired childhood pals to populate many of the company's senior posi­tions. He also cherry-picked a group called the Partnership, some 30 employees who committed themselves to the collective good of the company. With that honor came the promise of equity, special access to Fujioka himself, and a walkie-talkie--which Fujioka's assistant could use to send for his staff. "It was another form of knowing he could get anybody to drop every­thing at a moment's notice," says one former senior executive. The Partnership provided a powerful incentive for employee motivation, but it also created an organizational caste system. "Just imagine you're in a high school, and all the cool kids get to sit at this cool table," says one former nonpartner employee. "If you're not part of that circle, you don't get looked at and you don't get talked to." In this atmosphere, rumors flew of special perks for Partnership members. Fujioka denies there was any­thing improper about any of the favors he doled out. "We negotiated [auto] leases, and I'm pretty sure there were times when we helped people with their payments," says Fujioka, noting that he gave one pregnant partner three bonus months of paid maternity leave. Jealousy and gossip from nonpartners, he says, were disheartening. "Maybe what they don't understand is that the person [who received extra maternity leave] had two mis­carriages, and it's probably because she was working 13 hours a day. Those kinds of things," he says. "And did it ever come out of pocket? A lot. That's why I hesitate--was that Fuhu or was that me? Because I think 80 percent of it was me." "Maybe there's such thing as $20 million or $30 million between friends. But $100 million? I don't think they're friends any longer." Meanwhile, loyalty was best proved to Fujioka by self-sacrifice. He expected employees to work as doggedly for him as he had for the Huis, who, he says, once made him pull several consecutive all-nighters to write a business plan. John Hui's exercises "were very painful," says Fujioka. "It was really about obligation, responsibility, and servitude." Signs of disloyalty, real or perceived, could flare Fujioka's temper. In one instance, after a junior staffer privately asked the head of HR when he could collect overtime and take vacation, he was dragged before Fujioka and a roomful of partners for a vote on whether he should be fired. The meeting, the staffer later alleged in a wrongful-termination suit that was settled, "was done with oppression and malice" and resulted in "depression, anxiety, humiliation, and emotional distress." Employees say they even­tually learned not to challenge the views of their micromanager boss. "He wasn't listening to the smart, talented people that he had hired," says one former staffer. "Instead, he'd listen to the group that really consisted only of yes-men." The more frustrated Fujioka grew with Fuhu's lagging sales, the more he'd take it out on the staff. At weekly Partnership meetings, he'd sometimes play therapist, encouraging employ­ees to open up in the name of self-improvement. "If you look at anybody great--Steve Jobs, John Hui--they all have this incred­ible strength that has led to their success, but they are very aware of how that translates to weakness," Fujioka explains. Employees' self-described weaknesses--like "not wanting to fight with people I love for fear of losing them," confessed one staffer--would be logged along with a behavior-improving action item, and a consequence if the desired result was not achieved. (This particular individual's punishment: She was not allowed to wear makeup except "for days with meetings with clients/vendors, eye makeup only.") As former Partnership members tell it, Fujioka would then surface these details when they made mistakes. "Initially, it made us feel as though he cared," says one. "What I didn't realize was that, because he knew our flaws, he knew exactly how to manipulate us." Meanwhile, Fujioka and Mitchell kept on spending despite warnings from the finance department. Fuhu grossed only $5 to $10 per tablet, which left little room for extravagance. Yet as tight as the money was, the co-founders opened a posh company gym with personal trainers. Requests for at least $5,000 in petty cash for a trip were not uncommon, according to three executives familiar with the matter. (Fujioka and Mitchell insist that all petty cash requests were appropriate.) Fujioka flew groups of employees--sometimes 10 or more--to Hong Kong for Foxconn meetings, with everyone staying in the five-star InterContinental Hotel. "I did two meetings in 15 days," recalls one former Fuhu man­ager. "My memory is lots of great meals." When finance shared its concerns with Fujioka and Mitch­ell, neither could be bothered. "We didn't really care for how they thought through the numbers," says Fujioka. "It was kind of like, 'Can you go do the stuff that needs to be done for the IPO, and leave us alone?'" By the summer of 2014, the company was burning through cash at an alarming rate. With time run­ning out for an IPO, Fujioka decided to try pulling one last rabbit out of his hat. He called it the Big Tab. The vision of a gigantic mobile tablet had been simmering in Fujioka's mind for more than a year. He and his young son had been playing with a Microsoft touchscreen coffee table, a sort of interactive television mounted on four legs. Parents had always bemoaned screens, yet here were a father and son gleefully tapping and swiping together. What if Fuhu could create a tablet big enough for the whole family to gather around? It might change how families interacted, he thought. It might change the world. With the Big Tab, Fujioka had finally conceived a more profitable tablet. Its roughly $500 price tag could push toward a 20 percent margin on every unit sold. But everything about the Big Tab was risky. Just to keep sales flat from the previous year, Fuhu would have to commit up front to another massive order. If the Big Tab didn't sell, the company would owe Foxconn tens of millions of dollars in addi­tion to what it already owed for the DreamTab. Fuhu's finance team was already concerned, and expressed that to Fujioka. When they told him that their best-case projection for 2014 was $65 million in losses, he was incredulous: "There has to be something seriously wrong with your model," Fujioka replied. The Big Tab was a dou­ble-or-nothing bet--"one of those things where it would either make us or break us," Fujioka says. While he maintains that Fuhu's board members likely knew about his Big Tab plans, he can't recall whether he explicitly sought their approval. (None of Fuhu's board members re­turned calls seeking comment.) Fujioka reassured his em­ployees that Big Tab sales would take care of themselves. "Someone gave him this idea of the 'Tech 250,' which means that the first 250,000 of anything 'cool' just sells," says a former senior executive in finance. "It was the most bizarre notion I had ever heard." As the holiday shopping season approached, it became clear the Big Tab was flawed. The tablet was too clunky for a child to hold, and had less than an hour of battery life. Tech critics scratched their heads--"Wonderfully absurd" wrote PCMag.com. Meanwhile, retailers couldn't figure out where to display the product. Most stores simply wouldn't carry it, leaving Fuhu stuck selling them on its website. By Christmas, fewer than 4,000 units had been sold. "It was a disaster launch," concedes Fujioka. By January 2015, Fuhu's business was in free fall: Annual revenue had plunged by more than half from the year before, to less than $70 million. The finance department was a revolv­ing door: The CFO had left, soon followed by several key fi­nance employees. Then there were the debts. In the fall, Fuhu had stopped remitting payments to its distributor, D&H. The distributor then sued Fuhu for breach of contract, saying it owed D&H $49 million. Meanwhile, Fuhu owed Foxconn tens of millions, at least, for the DreamTabs and Big Tabs. Soon, Foxconn sent finance executives to investigate. Fujioka, confident he understood Chinese business code, insisted the visit wasn't a sign of trouble, but rather a mere for­mality. "They weren't happy with us, but that didn't mean they were going to let us die," Fujioka says. "Apple squeezes them [Foxconn] to a point of almost nonexistence, but they still work together." But Fuhu's finance team didn't buy the spin. As a former senior finance executive puts it: "Maybe there's such a thing as $20 million or $30 million between friends. But $100 million or more? I don't think they're friends any longer." "It was kind of like taking on a credit card. You sign this huge document, you have no idea what it says inside, you are looking at your lawyers, your lawyers are saying it is risky and it is expensive, and you go, 'OK.'" As the company hemorrhaged cash, Fujioka and Mitchell went hunting for more capital. But with declining revenue, Fuhu was no longer appealing to investors. That spring, the co-founders got the $10 million loan from Tennenbaum Capital Partners, along with another $10 million loan from factoring company LSQ Funding Group. Both were secured against Fuhu's assets, but Fujioka and Mitchell didn't worry about the details. Tennenbaum sent over a stack of paper with lots of fine print. "The lawyers were like, 'Do you want to read this now?' and I was like, 'Are you crazy?'" Fujioka says. "It was kind of like taking on a credit card. You sign this huge document, you have no idea what it says inside, you are looking at your lawyers, your lawyers are saying it is risky and it is expensive, and you go,'OK.'" Fujioka and Mitchell continued churning out products and plotting more ambitious ones, like kids' wearables and a line of internet-of-things devices. Nothing took hold. That summer, the co-founders managed to secure a $27 million investment from LG, the Korean technology company that manufactured the glass panels for Fuhu's tablets. But at the company's cur­rent burn rate, the cash would be gone by year's end. Unpaid creditors, including an autism nonprofit to which Fuhu had pledged $500,000 in 2013, continued lining up. Foxconn was running out of patience. In the fall of 2015, it ordered Fuhu to reduce operating expenses. Fuhu hired a restructuring specialist and laid off support staff. Then came that letter from Foxconn's counsel and the abrupt trip to Hong Kong, which ended with Foxconn's cutting off Fuhu's supply and seizing the 522,000 Nabis in its warehouse, followed by Tennenbaum's freezing of the assets in Fuhu's warehouse and its clean sweep of Fuhu's bank account. By December 2015, Fujioka and Mitchell had run out of options. They approached Mattel, which agreed to make a stalking-horse bid as part of Fuhu's Chapter 11 filing. On January 19, after a two-day auction, Mattel emerged as the owner of the failed company with a final bid of $21.5 million. Six months later, Fujioka and Mitchell sit down in Fuhu's conference room, now employees of Mattel. On the table is a folder with a copy of Mitchell's official declaration to the bankruptcy court. He needs to be careful to not stray from his official written statement. "We got read the riot act from our lawyers," Fujioka says later. Fujioka says he wants to come clean about where he went wrong. Eventually he speaks to Inc. for eight hours over three conversations. He owns up to his tendency to cause bottlenecks by micro­managing, and to being too tough as a boss. "It's like father­hood," he says. "If you come from a strict family, you're strict." Later, on the phone, he disputes the rumors about favoritism and overspending. But eventually he admits there was an organizational problem that stemmed from him. "There was a bankruptcy of the business, but there was also a bankruptcy of the corporate culture," he concedes. Fujioka also blames his employees--or rather, he faults himself for not hiring different ones. "There were a lot of partners who just couldn't fulfill what they needed to fulfill," he says. But his self-critique doesn't extend much further. Fuhu's biggest failure, he believes, was being victim to bad timing. The Nabi 2 came at the perfect moment, he says, but the Big Tab was before its time, while the Nabi Pass was too late. He still believes that, were it not for Tennenbaum's sweep of Fuhu's bank account, his company would have bounced back. "I think success is a combination of timing, humility, and timing, right?" he says with a laugh. Perhaps. But many of the sins that spurred Fuhu's demise were timeless: Fujioka developed products in profusion and failed to find new hits, and yet he still bet his entire company on an ill-conceived product he'd never market tested. Mitchell, as CEO, failed to intervene. Together, the two ran a business with slim profit margins that couldn't cover overhead, and a strategic plan based on little more than inherited connections, smooth talk, and misplaced hope in new products. Sitting catty-corner from Fujioka in the conference room, Mitchell is quiet, staring down at the table, his face so flush it's almost purple. Throughout the conversation, he chimes in with an odd fact or observation--the technical advantages of the Big Tab Slim, the 2014 IPO climate--but mostly he sits silent. In the coming weeks, the forensic auditors hired by the unsecured-creditors' committee will pore over Fuhu's books to find out where the money went. In coming months, the remaining credi­tors--more than 100 of them, claiming $110 million in liabili­ties--may go after Fujioka and Mitchell personally to get more money. Already, one IT vendor has sued Mitchell for intentional and negligent misrepresentation and fraud. Fujioka dismisses such inquiries as a witch-hunt. "Total bullshit," he says. The experience has left Fujioka, unlike Mitchell, feeling wilier, savvier, more dangerous. He frames his company's downfall more like a personal rite of passage than a profes­sional disaster. All of his idols--including the Huis, he says--have gone though a major bankruptcy in their careers. "It's a fact of life when you go into the hardware business that you are going to fail, and it's going to be a massive fail," he says, noting that the Huis have continued to be supportive. (Neither returned calls seeking comment.) But in El Segundo, Fujioka's faithful circle is shrinking. More than 200 employees have left or been laid off from the company, including most of his department heads. He shrugs off the notion that partners might be justifiably angry that the equity they were promised has nearly evaporated. He says his mentors had warned him that this, too, would happen. "They said the most heartbreaking thing was watching people they thought of as family walk away," he reflects. In fact, Fujioka says he would pursue the same strategy again--only next time, he'd do it faster. He's not the type to settle for a commodity hardware company or a straightforward software developer, he says. He wants it all. It's his nature. "If you look at Apple's history, it didn't start as a high-margin company," he points out. "It was 15 years in the making before Apple really hit its stride." Fujioka is convinced he still has that Jobsian potential lurking within him. A former Fuhu senior executive credits that confidence to Fujioka's ability to adapt himself toward anything he wants, bringing people along with him. "He sees something, and then he embodies that pursuit," he says. "He can read how to get people to do things for him. For me, it wasn't so much greed around money, but greed around changing the world." By the end of the conversation, the Fuhu offices are mostly vacant. A queasy-looking Mitchell excuses himself to meet his wife and kids for dinner back in Redondo Beach. Fujioka, who has filed for divorce and is dating Fuhu's senior marketing manager, stays behind. He has no plans to go home just yet. He has projects he must plan. Calls to Asia he must make. His glass-walled office looks out onto empty cubicle after empty cubicle. Soon, sitting there, he'll call out for what staff and friends remain. But the office is so empty, it's hushed. From the September 2016 issue of Inc. magazine Advertisement

Lyle Bunn STRATACACHE operates over 1.5 million software and appliance installations for more than 425 end user organizations including Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Lowes, AT&T, H&M, Huntington Bank and many others. It has acquired and integrated other businesses such as PRN, Optika, Carmanah Signs and most recently intellectual property from VertiGo and Civiq into its increasing capabilities, and has been strengthened by the addition of deeply knowledgeable personnel. STRATACACHE has 18 corporate locations in North America with others in Europe, Asia and Australia. It has 5 development, 4 hosting sites and 3 network operations centers. STRATACACHE has served end users in direct supply and operates with a comprehensive support model. Scala has a similar 25-year longevity, working with more than 500 partners in 100 countries to operate more than 500,000 displays. Scala’s strength has been in working with channel partners including integrators and distributors while assuring no channel conflict on situations where it would work directly with the end user. STRATACACHE’s corporate health, deep engineering, operating, analytics and client service in its direct sales model and its experience in serving generally larger deployments of place-based media, is an excellent compliment for Scala with its channel strategy and a base of installations that can reasonably be expected to expand based on astute application of the media and ongoing developments. This consolidation of capabilities enables better service of needs on the global stage through the combined strengths of these preeminent suppliers, each of which has been central to digital place-based media application and advancement. In STRATACACHE’s augmenting of its direct supply model with supply through channel partners and integrators as used by Scala, STRATACACHE will move the industry's supply capacities to new levels. Current users of Scala will benefit from a deeper knowledge base and improved corporate stability. In past acquisitions, STRATACACHE has empowered the acquired business unit while allowing them to operate entrepreneurially bringing subject matter expertise and active support to vertical market clients. It could reasonably be expected that Scala operations will be treated in the same way. Innovation is a demonstrated priority of STRATACACHE as indicated by its ongoing developments in areas such as content strategy and composition, analytics, omni-channel, hardware price/performance improvement, display enclosures, tablet and mobile interactivity, anonymous audience detection and identification, traffic tracking, gestural interaction, augmented reality, human vision replication and other areas of digital media areas. So, end users seeking location-based media innovation and the engineering and customer support teams of the two providers will benefit from the merging of innovation programs. And it could be entirely expected that innovation partners of Scala will be welcomed into the bigger sandbox. Dot2Dot Communications of Toronto for example, acts as Scala Canada. As an independently owned and operated partner Dot2Dot has developed the Ad Manager overlay for Scala. It only operates with the Scala CMS and Dot2Dot’s ad management capabilities are introduced to end users by Scala and other partners where third party advertising or sponsor revenues are an element of the digital signage business model. The combination of STRATACACHE’s system capabilities to handle in-store promotional spending and campaigns in large retailers (like Wal-Mart) and the Dot2Dot/Scala partnership bodes well for network operators and end users. The integration of Scala into STRATACACHE operations offers end users an improved entry and migration path in their use of digital place-based messaging and engagement capabilities. The acquisition of Scala by STRATACACHE provides a substantially stronger base of supply from the standpoint of functionality options, alternatives and scalability. Consolidation of supply reflects the next natural stage of organic digital signage industry growth and positions the sector for greater contributions media commerce and the economic success of enterprises, industries, countries, regions and countries. As the pace of technology application accelerates for benefits "in the now,” strength of supply, as reflected in this acquisition agreement is a critical success factor. The accelerated application of digital signage and overall industry development will benefit all. In short; End users will gain a broader and stronger supply option from the expanded STRATACACHE family of providers. The harmonizing and consolidation of research, development, innovation and best practices will accelerate use cases and standards of practice. The struggle of provider sourcing can be streamlined allowing end users to get on with the gaining the benefits of the media. Firms competing with STRATACACHE and Scala will “up their game” in the face of this combined supply capability. This acquisition puts me in mind of The Jungle Book story that many parents have read to their children and is the subject of another recent movie version. It's a jungle out there for retailers, brands and others. But like Mowgli (the jungle boy) who is protected, developed and supported by the panther Bagheera, (representative of the fiercely competitive but somewhat private and elusive STRATACACHE) and a big bear named Baloo (representative of Scala), end users have been in good hands. Their combined contributions equip Mowgli to stand against King Louie who wants to be all-powerful (let’s call this online commerce). The Jungle becomes a better place, just as place-based media through capable champions can do. Integrators and other channel providers will have access to broader capabilities and a growing market for the medium. Scala partners and proponents will benefit from the broader feature set and stability of supply offered by this acquisition. Consolidation has not been expected as a needed feature of and for industry expansion. Sales (for suppliers) and acquisition (for end users) costs have hampered industry growth, detracting from investment on innovations that can significantly advance the use of place-based customer experience and engagement technologies. Technology providers such as IBM, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Harris Corp, 3M and Google have made splashes in the digital signage lake, but without the significant, long-term implication or impact that large and institutional investors seek. This acquisition of Scala by STRATACACHE is a giant step forward for digital signage and place-based media. More consolidation and expansion can be expected, on the basis that the medium simply makes business and economic sense through the enterprise and value that it delivers. John F. Kennedy said “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,” as a reminder that value in service is the only basis on which progress can occur. In the 1600’s Martin Luther launched the reformation by challenging “indulges” and institutional authority.

Sort Notes Newest First Oldest First Show 15 Newer Notes Chris Bodenner 12:15 PM / August 17, 2016 America by Air: Country Album Edition Matt Kollasch Reader Matt sends a piece of Americana a couple times over: This photo was made in 2005 between Waterloo, Iowa, and the Minnesota border. That trip took me Japan and Korea to take photographs for Camp Adventure (youth camps/programs) sites on U.S. military bases. I recall Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) flew Saabs then. The plane looks to be a turbo prop Saab 340A [photo here]. The 340A’s engine is above the wing and the shape of the rear of the engine seems to match the one in my photo. I enjoyed these short rides to Minneapolis. The turbo-props gained altitude quickly and you seldom lost sight of earth, which was always interesting to watch. My photo was used for the cover of a Brother Trucker album called The Flyover. [“Des Moines-based roots-rockers Brother Trucker finally present another heaping helping of their literate, soulful and cinematic brand of earthy, ‘pan-Americana’ music.”] When I took the photo, Joni Mitchell’s “Amelia” came to mind: “I dreamed of 747s / Over geometric farms.” Chris Bodenner 10:45 AM / August 15, 2016 America by Air: The Continental Divide Jimmy Rollison One of our best reader contributors to our series, Jimmy Rollison, sends another great view: Looking north after passing Colorado’s Great Sand Dunes National Monument [captured by an earlier reader photographer], one cannot miss seeing the “Continental Divide” that has been the inspiration for many many artists. [French poet and aviator] Antoine St. Exupery’s famous quote is best applied here on this delivery flight: “I fly because it releases my mind from the tyranny of petty things.” Jimmy adds, “Did you ever wonder why the terminal at Denver Airport looks like it does?” He’s referring to this striking structure, the Jeppesen Terminal: The first commercial flight at the new Denver International Airport lands shortly after 6 a.m. on February 28, 1995. (Reuters) Here’s how the terminal’s creator, Fentress Architects, describes it: The form evokes the majestic snow-capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado’s international signature. Sustainably, the fabric roof provides considerable daylighting, and low heat absorption reduces build-up due to sunlight radiation. A survey by the American Institute of Architects ranked the terminal as #4 on its list of favorite American architectural landmarks, while Business Traveler magazine readers voted DIA the “Best Airport in North America” every year from, 2005-2010. As the largest structurally integrated tensile-membrane roof in the world, DIA is a memorable threshold welcoming all to Colorado and the West. Chris Bodenner 3:00 PM / August 11, 2016 America by Air: Burning Man Below Jimmy Hamilton Jimmy Hamilton, the Reno-based reader who sent the AbA photo over Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada, responds to me mentioning that I’m headed to nearby Black Rock Desert to camp out for a week soon: Hello again, Chris. I just happen to have an aerial photo of Burning Man, taken in the C180 from about a mile away looking down (from about 5500 AGL / 10,000 MSL) on the half circle that is Black Rock City. The scale of it is hard to imagine, but the diameter of the half circle is well over a mile. I hope you have a great time at Burning Man this year, but be prepared for everything—heat, cold, dust storms, rain and mud—all in the same week. Then again, on some occasions it can be clear and mild! If you’ve been out to Black Rock City and have any good advice for a first-timer, or just a good story to share, please drop me an email. As I was reading up on Black Rock Desert just now, I came upon this eerie and captivating sight: Jeremy C. Munns / public domain That vision of a mushroom trip is called Fly Geyser, and it was created by accident more than 50 years ago. From the Atlas Obscura entry on the natural-ish wonder: In 1964 a geothermic energy company drilled a test well at the same site [of a nearby geyser]. The water they struck was that same 200 degrees. Hot, but not hot enough for their purposes. The well was supposedly re-sealed, but apparently it did not hold. The new geyser, a few hundred feet north of the original, robbed the first of its water pressure and the cone now lays dry. This second geyser, known as Fly Geyser, has grown substantially in the last 40 years as minerals from the geothermal water pocket deposit on the desert surface. Because there are multiple geyser spouts, this geyser has not created a cone as large as the first, but an ever growing alien looking mound. The geyser is covered with thermophilic algae, which flourishes in moist, hot environments, resulting in the multiple hues of green and red that add to its out-of-this-world appearance. Here’s a video of the geyser in action: The 3,800-acre Fly Ranch upon which the geyser sits was actually just bought by the Burning Man Project in June. From the group’s news release: Here’s the gist of it: Those who have been deeply affected by a Burning Man event or experience have often asked, “How can we bring this beyond the event?” “How can we make this really matter?” [...] As a year-round site, Fly Ranch has the potential to expand Burning Man Project’s activities and existing programs, as well as amplify Burning Man’s cultural impact into the wider world beyond Black Rock City. Not if Cthulhu gets to them first: Chris Bodenner 6:25 PM / August 10, 2016 America by Air: Pyramid Lake Jimmy Hamilton Another reader with another amazing view adds another state to the series: I see on your site that you don’t have a photo taken in Nevada. This is Pyramid Lake, about 30 miles north of Reno. The lake is out in the middle of the desert.  I took the photo from a 1955 Cessna 180. (Sorry about the reflections in the window.) Coincidentally I’m headed out to that part of the Nevada desert in less than a month, to attend Burning Man for the first time. If you happen to have a good aerial photo above Black Rock City, please send it our way. Another funny coincidence: The only two photos of Pyramid Lake available in the Atlantic archives are this one from 1867 and the one seen to the right, which was captured by an Atlantic reader and posted by a friend I’m going to Burning Man with—in a blog post about the spirituality of shrooms. Here’s a bit more about the lake: Pyramid Lake is fed by the Truckee River, which is mostly the outflow from Lake Tahoe. The Truckee River enters Pyramid Lake at its southern end. Pyramid Lake has no outlet, with water leaving only by evaporation, or sub-surface seepage (an endorheic lake). The lake has about 10% of the area of the Great Salt Lake, but it has about 25% more volume. The salinity is approximately 1/6 that of sea water. … Pyramid Lake was used as a stand-in for the Sea of Galilee in the 1965 biblical film, The Greatest Story Ever Told. Also, in 1961, part of The Misfits was filmed nearby. If you’re one of the misfits who’s attended Burning Man and have any good anecdotes or advice to share, please drop me a note. Update from reader Jim, who has tons of helpful advice: Reserve a cheap bike at the Walmart in Reno and leave it with someone when Burning Man is over. Continue Reading Take some white vinegar to mix with your water to counteract the alkali when washing your feet, or anything that’s covered with the lake bed dust. Take foot cream or you may crack. Wash feet frequently.  Get a medium quality dust mask (one not too hot). I use swim goggles because they seal the best. Wear them around your neck at all times in case a dust storm blows, which happens all the time.  Your vehicle will likely never quite yield the dust no matter how you try to clean.  Alkali sticks to oil, and frankly the entire world seems to be coated with a film of oil even if you don’t notice. I took a tent, and I brought it back to the Ozarks and put it in a clear flowing stream for hours, but it was still coated with dust when it dried. I took a garden sprayer, the kind you pump up to spray. I used that to shower off (you must have a tarp to catch the water or you will violate a rule not to drain water in the desert). Although I sometimes raced naked to the water truck with soap in hand. Your wet feet will cake up like a baked potato when you walk back, but it peels off.  Don’t be ashamed to pee in a wide mouth jug at night and walk it to a porta-potty naked in the morning. No one cares. If you are in the front row during a big temple or “man” burn, it will get hot and you may feel trapped at the front. The spiraling hot white tornadoes that come out of the big burns will not reach you although they seem to be coming out toward the crowd. People swept through and stole bicycles on the last night, so beware there are sociopaths who will take your bike if you don’t lock it.  I felt embarrassed to keep locking my bike the second time I went, but I kept mine while others lost theirs.    If you want to stay in touch with friends, bring walkie talkies. With all the people there, the channels are pretty crowded, but you can always take a radio with different bandwidth than family radio channels. Try buying some cheap marine radios or radios used on industrial worksites with UHF. Hell, CB might work too. Take a hand drum of some sort so you can participate in drum circles. Irish tams are like big tambourines and travel well. Bring gifts—any kind. I took gallons of mixed nuts and little paper bowls which I filled and left (a few) at all the bars from which I drank. All drinks are free, so you want something to give back. Carry a pen and little spiral notebook. You may meet people you want to look up later. You may never see them again at the Burn.  Video cams are frowned up.  You are there to make art, not to collect pics of naked people.  I think of Burning Man as a combo of a circus, Fellini movie, and a gay parade.  You’ll never forget it. I will be at Lake Powell starting Labor Day weekend on a houseboat—the perfect experience after the Burn (although I am not going this year). Diving into deep clean water will never feel so exquisite. Chris Bodenner 4:59 PM / August 9, 2016 America by Air: Fork in the River JP Robinson A reader and pilot, JP, sends a scenic view “from the cockpit of a Bell 206 Jetranger Helicopter, flying southeast bound along Clark Fork River heading back to Missoula, MT.” Here’s a little about the waterway: The largest river by volume in Montana, the Clark Fork drains an extensive region of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and northern Idaho in the watershed of the Columbia River. The river flows northwest through a long valley at the base of the Cabinet Mountains and empties into Lake Pend Oreille in the Idaho Panhandle. The Clark Fork is a Class I river for recreational purposes in Montana from Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border.  The Clark Fork should not be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, which is located in Montana and Wyoming. That striking photo from JP checks another state, Montana, off our list of 50. We still need aerial views from CT, GA, ID, IN, IA, ME, MS, NV, NM, ND, RI, TN, VT, and WV if you can help: hello@theatlantic.com. Chris Bodenner 2:00 PM / August 7, 2016 America by Air: 'Pure Heaven, Accessible Only by Air' Anne Woods Anne Woods, the reader who sent the crisp, cerulean view of Puako Reef, sends a second photo from the air, this time above Northern California’s Sonoma County on an afternoon in late November: It was taken while bundled up in an open-cockpit 1932 Waco UBF-2. Off the wingtip is Tomales Bay, under which runs the San Andreas Fault. Point Reyes National Seashore is just on its other side, under the fog. When the sun swings south in the fall, it bathes the earth and the Waco’s wings in a soft, glowing light. The sky flushes orange, the summer-brown grass greens, the air stills, and on this day, I could smell the gap between the temperature and dew point closing. Pure heaven, accessible only by air. Here’s a heavenly view of Point Reyes under the fog: Wikimedia Chris Bodenner 1:15 PM / August 5, 2016 America by Air: Reef Relief in Hawaii From a newcomer to the series, Anne Woods: I love America by Air! Here’s a submission above Puako Reef, on the Big Island of Hawaii, taken from a Piper PA-18 Super Cub. Anne Woods The healthy and beauty of the reef is precarious right now. From the North Hawaii News early this year: The Puako coral reef has provided food, recreation and beauty for many generations. So when residents began to see the coral degrade — a loss of 50 percent between 1970 and 2010 and several studies showed dangerously high bacteria count — they decided it was time to care for the reef. The community came together and launched the Clean Water for Reefs project in Puako in Sept. 2014. It soon became apparent that the major culprit was outdated waste water treatment such as cesspools, and that upgrading to a septic tank, given the porous volcanic rock and high ground water, was not a viable option.  … [T]he final recommendation was for an on-site waste water treatment plant. A big advantage to the on-site waste water treatment plant is that the water coming out of it would be safe to use for irrigation, making a “community orchard” a real possibility. For an underwater tour of Puako, check out this vivid video: Chris Bodenner 2:55 PM / August 3, 2016 America by Air: A Bleeding River Among the Dinosaurs Jimmy Rollison, the reader who sent the incredible shot over Monument Valley, doubles down with another set of beauties, this time from Dinosaur National Monument. First a bit of background: Lizard petroglyphs at D.N.M. (Wikipedia) This park contains over 800 paleontological sites and has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus, Deinonychus, Abydosaurus ... and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. It was declared a National Monument on October 4, 1915. … Though lesser-known than the fossil beds, the petroglyphs in Dinosaur National Monument are another treasure the monument holds. Due to problems with vandals, many of the sites are not listed on area maps. Here’s Jimmy: An enrollee from California to Denver one should NEVER pass the opportunity to fly over Dinosaur National Monument [located on the border between Colorado and Utah] and especially Jenny Lind Rock [on-the-ground photos here]. Jimmy Rollison This is where the Green River meets the Yampa River to flow west. After a late winter rain, the Green River appears to be bleeding, and this view is only available to those who fly. To those who say, “If God had intended man to fly, he would have given him wings,” I say no; if he didn’t want me to fly, he’d have given me roots. Jimmy Rollison This one is just east of Vernal, Utah, where the Green River exits the Canyon, after a heavy rain. The colors are vividly alive with minerals, displayed only for those looking down. Go Fly! Chris Bodenner 5:09 PM / August 2, 2016 America by Air: A Monumental Scene Just wow: Jimmy Rollison The photographer, Jimmy, also has few words for this spectacular scene over Monument Valley: All I can say about this photo is: As only can be seen from a small airplane. Update: Monument Valley straddles Utah and Arizona, so I asked Jimmy which side he was on: Utah. I had departed Cortez, Colorado, heading for Page, Arizona. He sends another stunning photo from that trip: Jimmy Rollison I always wanted to view Lake Powell from above but not the 36,000’ view of my normal work. Only Lake Powell! [This America by Air series is a] GREAT IDEA!!!  I have never shared a photo, as I thought no one would appreciate what I see. Thank you again for bringing this into the eyes of the public. Our eyes are smiling. Chris Bodenner 10:00 AM / August 1, 2016 America by Air: Passing Through Colorado Pete Howell A fantastic set of photos from reader Pete: Here are a few pics from our recent trip to Colorado in the little airplane I built in my garage 10 years ago! We flew over Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and visited on the ground a few hours later. My wife and I were on vacation from St Paul. Story here. Pete Howell A bit about its past: Mosca Pass was named for Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, whose scouting parties may have reached this area about 1542. He was a Spanish explorer and conquistador credited as the first European to reach Texas. I asked Pete if he could share a good photo of his plane—“a Van’s RV-9A”—and he definitely delivered: 👋 Chris Bodenner 12:45 PM / July 28, 2016 America by Air: Delaware's Cape Daniel Watkins A helpful reader, Daniel, gets us one step closer to 50 states: “I saw in the Notes section that you don’t have a photo from Delaware, so I’m happy to lend a hand with a photo from the first state.” That bit of trivia I didn’t know. Here’s more about Daniel and his photo: I’m a Brit, my wife is a Delawarean. We live abroad but travel back to the States for friends and family about once a year. My wife’s family is in Sussex county, DE, and when I first visited, I was struck by the sheer number of place names stolen from my native land: Sussex, Lewes, Seaford, Dover, Kent, Camden—all places I’ve lived in or near. It’s like a little home from home. Two winters ago, right before one of the major snow storms, we were on our way to see friends and had a connecting flight in Philly. The easiest way for us to get there from Sussex was on a tiny propeller plane from Salisbury, MD. The plane was small enough for either me or my wife to be guaranteed a window seat. She is a better person than me, and so I spent the flight gawking out the window, happily snapping away on my iPhone. This photo is taken from right above Lewes, DE, where we have family (and of the Cape May ferry fame). The sandy part jutting out, and the adjacent woodland, is Cape Henlopen State Park, a piece of land set aside for public use in the 1680s—which has to make it one of the first. I hadn’t visited it at the time I took the photo, but I’ve been belatedly learning to drive there since, so I’ve also taken in the trails and ocean front. It has to rank as one of the most idyllic places I’ve ever seen: beach and forest, sand and soil, shell and pine cone, with a thick salt marsh right in the middle. It’s become an almost-sacred place, and so this photo serves as a reminder while we’re away from homes, old and new. Chris Bodenner 10:26 AM / July 26, 2016 America by Air: River of Mist Katy McDevitt A long-time reader, Paul, checks another state off our list of 50: I mostly grew up in Lexington, Kentucky, so I am very used to the view of mist rising from the water in the early morning. But in all my years of flying, I guess I’d never headed out until later in the day. When my wife, Katy, recently peeled off to Montreal with our daughter really really early in the morning, and she showed me the photos she’d taken after takeoff, I was really amazed to see what my riverine memories looked like from the air. Her iPhone geo-located the photo at Nicholasville—a bit south of Lexington. The source of the mist is the Kentucky River, deep in its gorge at this point, and the shape of the river is recognizable from the map. The river is about 500 feet below the bluegrass plateau and the gorge is a quarter-mile wide or so. That is a lot of water vapor! If you have a great aerial photo of your own to share, especially from one of the states we haven’t covered yet—CT, DE, GA, ID, IN, IA, ME, MS, MT, NV, NM, ND, RI, TN, VT, WV—please send our way, ideally with a part of the plane showing: hello@theatlantic.com.

Your Thoughts Nov 21, 2016 Notes Home Most Popular On The Atlantic Daniel Lombroso / The Atlantic 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Video of an alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes. “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” That’s how Richard B. Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Your Thoughts More Most Popular On The Atlantic Daniel Lombroso / The Atlantic 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Video of an alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes. “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” That’s how Richard B. Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.)

The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by the Milwaukee County Sheriff shows Sylville K. Smith. Smith was killed in Milwaukee on Saturday, Aug. 13, 2016, in a police shooting that sparked two nights of violence. (Milwaukee County Sheriff via AP, File) Sylville K. Smith had a lengthy criminal past, but was just trying to survive in the inner city, William Brookins told The Associated Press. “In this city, there’s a lot of killings going on in the street,” said Brookins, who detailed Smith’s problems in a letter to a judge last year seeking mercy for his grandson. “He was afraid for his life. He was concerned about his safety and surviving.” Smith, 23, was shot and killed Saturday after a brief foot chase that followed a traffic stop. Police say Smith was fleeing, and officials have said the officer’s body camera shows him being shot after he turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand. The officer, who has not been identified, is black, as was Smith. A few hours after the shooting, violence erupted on the city’s largely black north side, with protesters hurling rocks at police and burning six businesses. A lighter night of protests followed Sunday. Monday was calm, though 10 people were arrested. There were no reports of protesters gathering on Tuesday night. Smith had several run-ins with the law dating to 2013, including speeding, driving without insurance, driving with a suspended license and having open alcohol in a vehicle. In 2013, he was charged with felony retail theft for allegedly stealing $1,600 worth of DVDs from a Milwaukee Wal-Mart. According to a criminal complaint, Smith and another man were seen removing fans from their boxes and putting the DVDs in the boxes. Prosecutors later dismissed the charge. A year later, he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, a misdemeanor. According to court documents, two officers on bike patrol approached Smith and his friends after smelling marijuana in their vehicle and found a loaded .45-caliber pistol under Smith’s shirt. Smith pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one day in jail. In early 2015, Smith was charged with reckless endangerment, a felony. Investigators alleged he opened fire on a man in retaliation for the man’s role in a fight between some girls weeks earlier. According to a complaint, Smith and the man got into a car chase before the man finally stopped and ran on foot. Smith chased after the man and shot at him. He eluded Smith by hiding behind a house, according to the complaint. As that case was pending, Smith was charged with felony intimidation of a witness — the man he was accused of shooting at. Prosecutors said he had his girlfriend call the man and pressure him to recant. The man did, according to prosecutors, who dropped both cases that year. Brookins said his grandson’s criminal record was “nothing in comparison to other people.” He said Smith had never been convicted of a felony. “That’s the law, OK,” Brookins said. “He’s not guilty.” He described Smith as a good kid with a “beautiful personality.” Smith was known for his hip-hop dance moves and trained in gymnastics when he was in middle school, Brookins said. He also suffered from mental health issues, Brookins said. He declined to go into detail, saying only that Smith had problems with “comprehension and understanding” and spent time in special classes in elementary and middle school. In a letter to the judge in the reckless endangerment case, Brookins wrote that Smith was receiving Social Security payments because of his mental health problems. Smith had been shot on more than one occasion, Brookins said. The last time was “a few years ago” when he was hit six times in front of his mother’s house. His grandfather did not have any information on what precipitated the shooting but said Smith still carried bullet fragments in his body. Smith started carrying a gun after that incident. “That really had a great effect on him and his fear of being hurt and the need to protect himself from people trying to do him harm,” Brookins said. Milwaukee police could not immediately confirm Brookins’ account. A spokesman told The Associated Press to file a records request. Smith’s mother, Mildred Haynes, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that her son had recently received his concealed-carry license because he had been shot twice and robbed four times, including a robbery in which he was stripped of all his clothes. He leaves behind a 2-year-old son. “I’m not going to say he was an angel. He was out here living his life,” Smith’s godmother, Katherine Mahmoud, told the newspaper. “It’s hard to grasp he’s no longer here,” Brookins said. “Oh, my God. This is terrible.”   Tags:  Wisconsin Todd Richmond / Associated Press You can help us improve our commenting space. Take our survey and follow our terms of use. WeekendThinker Surviving does not include facing an officer with a fully loaded gun, while the cop is telling you to put it down and get on the ground. He may have actually ended up getting the help that’s being claimed he needed. Maybe, just maybe the cops that were there were protecting themselves and others in the area. Maybe this guys family should have stepped up to the plate and helped in the first place, and he may not have ended up where he is today. How many other people of color got shot in Milwaukee this past week? How many people are rioting about them? RobbinBri Don’t these people ever run out of excuses?…..never mind, answered my own question. Jacob He’s a good kid because none of his multiple crimes were felonies? Such high standards. WeekendThinker It’s Milwaukee. What do you expect? Antileftist The excuse mongering by this guy’s grandpa is ridiculous, yet seemingly commonplace, and probably a small part of the reason he ended up the way he did. Not to mention that he might be alive today if the judges and prosecutors had done their jobs early on by coming down on him. He got break after break, only to escalate his law breaking activities. WeekendThinker I agree. There are a lot of people with problems in this country. They don’t all go around breaking the laws, and then use “he didn’t understand” when a cop told him to put the weapon down and get on the ground. This guy did play with fire. And this guy got burned. AshHswrs And he now burns in hell for eternity. WeekendThinker Well, he made the choice. Patricia Yes, he did….. Patricia Exactly!!! Gagmewaspoon The man’s dead because the judges refused to put him in jail several times when they had the chance. One day sentence for carrying a gun without a license? Charges dropped after stealing $1600 worth of CDs? His mama and grandfather should sue the court system for not doing their job. Azeez Onifide Yes he was a wonderful grand son with a bright future and awesome artwork on his neck and then this S*IT happened! md what is the penalty for running away from a police officer? i guess its summary execution. James Dawson It wasn’t the running part that proved to be his fatal error. It was pointing and raising the gun at the officer. That just was his last in a long series of serious errors. WeekendThinker And of course getting shot in the chest, not the back, would validate that. But poor, poor guy. Wasn’t his fault the gun he was carrying would have most likely killed someone else that night. He couldn’t help it the only things he could understand and comprehend was how to break the law and hurt others while having whatever he wanted. And he was turning his life around. Well, he shouldn’t have turned his body around and pointed a gun at the cops. Oh well. Can’t fix stupid. Wanye Kest Actually, it has been fixed. md how do you know he did that, did the runner admit it??? did he do it in a threatening manner or the way your arms move naturally when you are running for your life like a sprinter?? how did he accomplish doing that when he was running in the opposite direction from the cop presumably with his back to the cop?? were you there in a lawnchair with a beer being a spectator to this event too?? Linda Domek Why do you just assume that the officer’s story is slanted? How do you know he didn’t do that? Were you there? Runner admit it? HA! No one guilty admits anything these days. md i read and reread my comment and i didn’t see where i said the cops story is slanted. i do not know what happened because i was not there to witness it. its true no one guilty admits things these days, in fact they even make up stories to try to get away with being guilty. Linda Domek I apologize for misunderstanding your comment. It read to me like a lot of other comments I have read on similar stories. We know from the Jamar Clark tragedy that even eyewitnesses don’t relate the details honestly. Thanks for your reply. I appreciate it. I will try to not be so hot-headed next time 😉 md no worries. im just glad there are so many people who are interested in important topics and like to discuss them. thanks for the reply, not many around here have the courage to come back and admit they made a mistake. you are a good person 🙂 KP possibly try reading the story MD instead of letting your personal narrative take over…directly from the story. officer’s body camera shows him being shot after he turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand. James Dawson 1st of all md you’re really not too bright. When you say “did the runner admit it???” you seem to have forgotten that the runner is the dead man and everyone knows dead men don’t talk. 2nd point: the police officer was wearing a body camera so the dead man who ran then turn and raised his gun at the officer was being videoed. And no, I wasn’t there in my lawn chair drinking beer. I don’t like lawn chairs. md now you sound like tony soprano. the runner sleeps with the fishes. well have luca brazzi pay him a visit. James Dawson The running man is now still. Encased in a cheap box from a funeral home and buried 6 feet under. No more pasta for him. James Dawson He also suffered from mental health issues, Brookins said. He declined to go into detail, saying only that Smith had problems with “comprehension and understanding” Apparently the law was on that list of his problem subjects. Wanye Kest Heck, we’re all just trying to survive. Except some of us choose to do it without posting pictures of ourselves online holding stolen guns and drug money. Or pointing a pistol at a Po-Leece officer. Guess he should have tried harder. WeekendThinker Got that right. But at least he won’t have to try any more. Rob Bauman Maybe Grandfather and others should have done more when he was younger to direct him. Point a gun at anyone and they should do the same, PROTECT THEMSELVES! Starts at home! Adam23 They can’t help it. Both are products of generations of liberal policies. Patricia I agree, it starts in the home….. http://www.rudyreyes.com/ Andrew Hank Henry “Grandfather: Man killed by Milwaukee police was just trying to survive” So was the cop, that’s why he shot the gun who had a gun. Patricia Excellent point!!! Patski Smith got what he deserved. Buster What a POS. A Tad Moore Sorry Grandpa…Pointing a gun at a police office (allegedly) is actually the opposite of trying to survive. Ray Sovrano Expect an influx of Milwaukee’s best to the TC. It goes this way, Chicago to Milwaukee to Saint Paul- Minneapolis. Patricia The mind set of the Grandfathers is why people can’t take accountability for their actions. He sounds to me like he is in denial about how serious his grandsons life and decisions were. Bobby Loomis He also suffered from mental health issues, Brookins said. He declined to go into detail, saying only that Smith had problems with “comprehension and understanding” and spent time in special classes in elementary and middle school. And he carries and then wouldn’t drop the weapon? Great excuse for a riot knuckleheads. Only in sconi! Chris why does the local and syndicated news print the babbling of derilecks as tho it were valid news? why did you print this, Pioneer Press editors, why?? May the trouble and chaos that you wished to bring to our community come back on your own heads a hundred fold:-) inappropriatescreenname Well as he found out, trying to survive by being a criminal and pointing a stolen gun at cops doesnt work out very well. blog comments powered by Disqus More in Crime & Police Man with restraining order charged with killing Coon Rapids woman November 23, 2016, 8:07 am An Anoka County man was charged Monday with the August slaying of a Coon Rapids woman at her apartment.

NBC helps them hear it STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — Two people deep inside a Connecticut office park are helping millions of blind Americans enjoy the Olympics like never before. For the first time in the U.S., NBC is airing the Olympics in prime time with additional narrators who simply report what’s happening on screen — a sort of closed captioning for the visually impaired. Most viewers won’t even know the additional narrators are there; to hear them, you need to turn on special cable-box or TV settings to activate their audio track. But their running blow-by-blow can open things up for the blind, who at best get an incomplete picture from traditional sportscasting. ___ US stocks get modest lift from Federal Reserve comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks closed barely higher Wednesday as big gains for utilities balanced out losses for retailers like Lowe’s, Target and Staples. Stocks fell in morning trading as a recent slump in phone company and utility stocks continued. But the indexes reversed directions after noon as those stocks turned higher, as did banks and household goods makers. Investors scrutinized the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s late July meeting and found no suggestion the central bank’s in any hurry to raise interest rates. ___ Fed minutes: Conditions could ‘soon warrant’ a rate hike WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials believed last month that near-term risks to the U.S. economy had subsided and that an interest rate increase could soon be warranted. But they did not indicate when they would likely raise rates. The minutes of their July 26-27 meeting show that officials were encouraged by a rebound in job growth. They also took note of a stabilization of financial markets after a bout of turbulence triggered by Britain’s June 23 vote to leave the European Union. But a key factor holding the Fed officials back was the stubbornly slow rate of inflation. ___ Jury finds investment banker guilty of insider trading NEW YORK (AP) — An investment banker was convicted of insider trading charges Wednesday after a jury concluded he gave tips about mergers and acquisitions to his father, enabling over $1 million in illegal profits. Sean Stewart, 35, testified during the two-week federal court trial, insisting he had no idea his father was sharing secrets with a broker to make trades ahead of public announcements on five separate deals that he oversaw while working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Perella Weinberg partners LP. Sentencing was set for Feb. 17 for the Manhattan resident. ___ Target cuts outlook as it sees fewer customers in stores NEW YORK (AP) — Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter’s second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 per cent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 per cent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. ___ Lowe’s cashes in on housing rally, just not as much as rival MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — The nation’s biggest home improvement stores may sell many of the same goods, but the benefits of a sustained U.S. housing recovery seems to be streaming mostly toward one of them. Lowe’s reported disappointing sales growth at existing stores, its second-quarter profit was short of most expectations and the company cut its profit expectations for the year. The quarter looked even more lacklustre because it came one day after U.S. data revealed a housing sector in full rebound mode and a quarterly earnings report from Home Depot, which posted record second-quarter sales and profits. The contrast sent shares of Lowe’s tumbling. ___ In June, airlines improved on-time performance from 2015 WASHINGTON (AP) — Airlines were running on time more often in June than they did last summer and travellers seemed to be finding less to complain about. But that was before computer outages this month at Delta and last month at Southwest led to more than 4,000 flight cancellations, widespread delays and travel nightmares. The Transportation Department said Wednesday that 78 per cent of flights on major U.S. airlines arrived on time in June, up from 74.8 per cent in June 2015. Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines had the best on-time ratings. American Airlines had the worst. ___ Cisco laying off 5,500 employees, or 7 per cent of workforce SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Cisco Systems says it will lay off 5,500 employees as the internet gear maker scrambles to adapt to technology changes that have reduced demand for its main products. The shake-up announced Wednesday means about 7 per cent of Cisco’s roughly 74,000 workers will lose their jobs beginning this summer. The purge is the latest example of the upheaval that has rocked some of the world’s oldest and biggest technology companies as the relentless march of innovation forces them to head in new directions in search of revenue growth. ___ AT&T hikes prices for some plans, but raises data caps NEW YORK (AP) — AT&T is joining Verizon in raising the prices of some of its data plans. As with Verizon, AT&T is going to great lengths to avoid calling the changes a price hike, as the higher prices come with more data, reducing the cost per gigabyte for many customers. Indeed many customers will benefit, and those who won’t can keep their existing plans. The price increase underscores how wireless companies see data as a way to boost revenue. Most plans now come with unlimited calls and texts. The new rates take effect Sunday. ___ Railroads show little progress on key safety technology WASHINGTON (AP) — Many commuter and freight railroads have made little progress installing safety technology designed to prevent deadly collisions and derailments despite a mandate from Congress, according to a government report released Wednesday. The technology, called positive train control or PTC, uses digital radio communications, GPS and signals alongside tracks to monitor train positions. It can automatically stop or slow trains to prevent them from disobeying signals, derailing due to excessive speed, colliding with another train or entering track that is off-limits. The Federal Railroad Administration report shows that while some railroads have made substantial progress, others have yet to equip a single locomotive or track segment with the technology, or install a single radio tower. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.92 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 18,573.94. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 4.07 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,182.22. The Nasdaq composite inched up 1.55 points to 5,228.66. Benchmark U.S. crude added 21 cents to $46.79 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, inched up 62 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $49.85 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 3 cents to $1.45 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas held steady a $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

The July minutes Wednesday afternoon showed a divided Fed, worried about inflation and split over the strength of the economy. That now makes December its best and probably only chance for a rate hike this year, strategists said. It also points markets back to the economic data, and on Thursday there are weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. EDT and the Philadelphia Fed survey on mid-Atlantic business activity. Leading indicators are reported at 10 a.m. Jobless claims have been a particularly strong series for the economy, which has also seen a pickup in hiring since an unusually soft employment report in May. But other data is less consistent recently, including consumption after unexpectedly flat July retail sales. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters Janet Yellen "We're going to have to learn a lot more [about the economy]. And are we going to learn it before the election? Doubtful," said John Briggs, head of strategy at RBS. Briggs said RBS' reading of market expectations on Fed rate hikes showed a swing back to about a 50/50 chance for December, after a sudden pop to a 64 percent chance ahead of the Fed minutes Wednesday. The market was setting up for a hawkish statement, after New York Fed President William Dudley said in a Fox interview Tuesday that the Fed could raise rates soon, even in September. That sent short-end Treasury yields higher, and the two-year was rising even into the 2 p.m. announcement. The two-year yield is the most Fed sensitive, and it hit 0.77 percent before the minutes' release before falling back to 0.72 percent in afternoon trading. Dudley has another chance to explain the Fed's position Thursday, when he speaks at 10 a.m. along with other New York Fed officials on its regional economy and Puerto Rico. Wal-Mart also releases earnings Thursday morning, and it is sometimes seen as a bellwether of sorts for the economy and consumer. Briggs said the Fed in its minutes seemed to raise the bar for the economy's performance. The FOMC noted that some participants thought the Fed should wait until the economic data provided a "greater level of confidence," but also added a new twist in that the economy should be strong enough "to withstand a possible downward shock." One possible shock the Fed was concerned about this summer was the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, and Fed officials had said they held off from hiking rates in June because of it. There are other Fed speakers besides Dudley on Thursday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams speaks in Anchorage, Alaska, at 4 p.m. EDT, and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan speaks at 8 p.m. at the joint meeting of Dallas and Fort Worth chapters of Association for Financial Professionals. But it's the Fed minutes that are likely to drive the market view on the Fed until next week when Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "It seems to me like it's still sufficiently noncommittal, that September does not look likely," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, of the minutes. "I do think December is becoming more likely, but I also do not think they will make a commitment to that or start laying the groundwork until at least the November FOMC meeting. They've been burned by trying to set the stage too soon," he said. McCarthy said the Fed members' views are very scattered and that also confirms inaction for September. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said his biggest takeaway from the minutes is the division on the Fed. "The hawks are every bit as hawkish as they have been at any point this year. 'Some' felt that the economy has essentially achieved full employment and that 'another increase in the federal funds rate was or would soon be warranted, with a couple of them advocating an increase at this meeting.' However, for the FOMC to actually raise rates, the dovish contingent will have to warm up to a move," he wrote. Dudley is in that dovish camp, along with Yellen. The minutes also show that some Fed members thought it would be appropriate to wait for more information on inflation. "As I have emphasized, with the employment box checked, the key impediment to further normalization of rates is inflation, which remains well below the Fed's 2 percent target," Stanley wrote. The S&P 500, down several points earlier in the day, turned around after the minutes and closed higher Wednesday. The S&P rose 4 to 2,182, and the Dow was up 21 at 18,573. The dollar index ended the day flat. Other early earnings Thursday include Nestle, Hormel Foods, Toro and Canadian Solar. Applied Materials, Gap, Ross Stores and Mentor Graphics report after the close.

STRATEGY There's 1 Marketing Mistake That Even the Smartest Leaders Can't Stop Making placeholderThey're doing it over and over and over. By Quora Quora is a website where you can post any question and get real answers from people with firsthand experience. WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement What was the biggest mistake you made in marketing? originally appeared on Quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. Answer by Jonathan Brodsky, SVP of Chicken Soup for the Soul, on Quora: I constantly make the same mistake in marketing, over and over and over. I know that I'm making this mistake, and I try to correct for it, but I still slip up. Often. The mistake? I think that I'm the customer. I think, "What would I do if I was approached with this ad/content/UX/product/whatever." Yes, UX, product, packaging, ads, content, and about a dozen other things are all the same to the customer; they're your marketing message. I read a quote the other day from Invision's blog that succinctly sums up what (most) consumers think: "Y'all talk about UX like it's just another feature. For a user, it literally is the product. Full stop. Everything else is inside [the] baseball." -Startup L. Jackson Twitter account UX stands for User Experience, and is often (and mistakenly) thought of as a way for graphic designers to optimize how a page or an app looks for a customer. But what it really should be is your customer's entire experience with your company, from their first interaction (whether it's an ad, content, seeing you on the shelves of Walmart, or whatever), right through to whether or not they actually like your product. All of that is marketing, because all of that ties into your brand, and marketing is about delivering your brand message to your customers. In a big company, lots and lots of people have a say in all of those ingredients, and so it's really tempting to narrow a job description to 'tracking success in this ad' or 'UX designer.' But, at the end of the day, it's all UX to your customers. This is true in small companies, too, although at least it's easier to talk to everyone else on the team when you're in a small company. That is a hard lesson to learn, but it's one that becomes obvious the second you think of how you interact with pretty much any product. It's really unlikely that you care about how Google's map reduce algorithms work. You just care that it works. All of that other stuff that's under the hood? It's the inside of the baseball. The next lesson that you learn as a marketer is that it's way, way easier to keep an existing customer happy than to get a new one. This turns out to be a lesson in basic math, and pretty easy to get. Acquiring a customer for a commerce site that sells a $60 - $100 product will cost somewhere between $12 - $25, depending on the time of year, competition, and tons of other factors. Sending out an email to that person after they've bought something costs about $0.002 - $0.006 per email (again, depending on the service you use, and this is fully-loaded including editorial staff). So if you send that person who bought from you an email 365 days per year and they buy one more time, it cost you $0.73 - $2.19 to re-acquire that customer. An email program will pay for itself even if only 10% of your customers are repeat buyers each year, and I hope that your product works well enough that people will want to use it more than once per year. Once you get through these two marketing lessons, you hit the one I keep hitting, the one where I keep marketing to myself. This is why, when you're sitting in rooms with other marketers, they're constantly focused on the pronouns that they use. They say, "What does she want?" They never say, "What does a 35-year-old mother of two want?" "She" is their shorthand for a 35-year-old mother of two or whoever else they are designing a marketing message for. It makes it real, like you're talking about a real person. You're not, you're talking about a theoretical construct, which is why I've seen some teams go further and find people who look a lot like their idealized profile customer so that they can market to 'Jane.' You run into this massive problem, though, because the things that make Jane tick aren't the same things that make Sally tick, and they're not necessarily buying your product for the same reason. Your marketing devolves into an exercise in appeasing focus groups, and you come up with 50,000 iterations of the same basic message that you can target to just the right person at just the right time. Then you tweak that message, and you keep going. This kind of hyper-targeted advertising has its place within a broader marketing campaign, but marketing is also an exercise in brand-building. And a brand is, essentially, a community of people who share similar beliefs in your product and company. You might take issue with that last sentence. You might think that a brand is an amalgamation of statements (and the techniques to deliver those statements) that you make about yourself, but I don't think those statements are worth anything without belief among your customers; once your customers start to believe and are willing to talk to each other about your products, you've got a community. Using hyper-targeting to drive purchases can work to drive people into your fold. But, for most products, you touch your consumer in more places than in just a single ad or a single piece of content. You might go to McDonalds because you saw an ad they had, but you're buying because of the entire promise that McDonald's makes you: cheap food that will fill you up and tastes good. No, I don't believe in McDonald's brand message on any front, but that's a different issue. It's all of those other touch points -- your website, your packaging, your product -- that are your ultimate marketing tools, and are the things that will build your brand. For those tools, you're kind of stuck taking a mass-market approach. If your product is physical, you're really stuck, because re-tooling and making customized versions of a physical product is really hard and really expensive (too expensive, in my experience). If your product is purely digital, you've still got guardrails on how customizable the experience can be. For example, Twitter's product is purely digital; it's just a feed of tweets. And those tweets are all things you're interested in, so that's personalized just for you. But the overall format of those tweets, and how they're displayed? That's the same for (almost) everyone. That is where I fall into the trap, over and over and over, because you're making these products, and you're asking everyone you possibly can their opinion (at least, I hope you are), and that gets you partway there. Then there are always things that everyone will disagree on, and you've just got to make a call about how it should look, feel, or act. You've got to figure out whether it continues to make sense for a tweet to be 140 characters. When that decision comes, I am constantly deferring to my own preferences. But, well, I'm not the customer. I've thought about this product way, way more than the average customer has or ever will. Even if I'm a customer, I'm not the customer. I've gotten that last one confused too many times to count. The problem is that, in marketing, your job is to pander to the lowest common denominator among your fan base, and that is always lower than I think it is. Think about this for a second, because this lesson is incredibly hard to internalize. Well, at least it is for me. If you want to have a broad-based, successful marketing message, you need all of those things that make up your UX to pander to the thing that the largest number of your customers have in common. You can try to get to this with targeted messaging, landing pages, and whatever other tools you have at your disposal. The problem with all of those tools is that, while they tell you what will cause someone to take action, they won't tell you much about that person's underlying beliefs. You're left to assume, survey or interview your way to that, and even then you might not get very far. I've found more than once that people aren't entirely sure what all of their beliefs are. So asking them gets you nowhere (or worse) fast. This is a mathematical problem in many ways. You've got all of this information coming at you, and you need to concentrate it into a single focal point. It's like finding the center of a spiral when all you have is a few data points that describe that spiral. If that's too mathematical of a description for you, just think about it this way: instead of a line connecting all of the dots of a spiral, you've just got fifteen dots on a page, you've got to figure out how they connect to get to the center, and you've got no guarantees that the pattern you're supposed to draw is symmetrical. The only thing that I've found that actually tells you this answer is iteration combined with near-constant data collection, which has its own problems (if you don't believe me, just look at this paper on iterating to find the center of a pattern in nature with incomplete data, and then realize that your consumer information is way less complete than the data set in this paper). But you still have to pick a starting point, and for that starting point, I still trust my gut. And, it turns out, my gut is always way off the center. In general, so is the gut instinct of people around me, people I ask in focus groups, people I survey, and pretty much everyone else I ask. I haven't found the way to figure out who is close to the center of the spiral right from the start. Then we get to the second-to-last problem, which is actually doing that iteration, because doing that iteration means that you change everything about your UX as you try to get closer and closer to the inside of that spiral and find that common belief, that belief that, when communicated properly to your customers, makes you the market leader in your category very, very quickly. The belief that obviates so much of the heavy blocking and tackling of advertising. The belief that changes your brand from an RC Cola to a Coke and opens all sorts of new doors for you. But that process is expensive and time-consuming. That process is why start-ups can and do usurp big companies. It's not that expensive for a start-up to reimagine everything. It's really, really expensive for Proctor & Gamble to reimagine everything about one of their brands, and to do that over and over and over? Ha. There are no annual, "What should we change about everything we do" meetings in most big companies. The last problem is that start-ups don't have the data or the reach of their big competitors. So even though they're willing to iterate, they're doing it with far fewer data points, and once they start to get enough data points, they start to be big and slow and that's why confusing yourself with your customer becomes a huge problem, because you can't actually afford to keep iterating after your first 'best guess.' Your UX when you start is just an educated guess, but if it turns out to be misinformed, you don't get a chance to iterate and fix it. But, well, what are you to do? You've got to start somewhere.

She gave him the user names and passwords for her bank accounts and the man deposited money into them, but every deposit was reversed at a later date. She also wired money to the man on several occasions, including $300 to Indiana and $400 to Canada. She said the man claimed to be an international marketer, who worked all around the world. He also told her various stories about personal health problems and his occupation. Officers told the woman to contact the fraud departments of each of her banks and credit cards and to see if her homeowner's insurance covers the incident in any way. Ambulance run, Maplewood Road: A man, 33, said Aug. 8 he had an increased heartbeat and believed he overdosed on marijuana. He said he ate a gummy bear he felt might have had marijuana in it. Paramedics confirmed he was OK and he declined any further medical attention. He was told to call 911 if he had any further issues. Suspicious vehicle, SOM Center Road: Officers watched Aug. 6 as a man parked at the Target parking lot and entered a second vehicle that pulled in behind him. The man then left the vehicle and entered the store. Officers stopped the vehicle and identified the driver as a 25-year-old Beachwood man. He said he met with the man, who owed his $3,500 for a debt but he would not say what the debt was for. He had a loaded gun in the vehicle and was issued a warning because he did not have a permit with him for the weapon. The other man returned from the store and officers spoke with him. The Maple Heights man, 21, said there was no transaction between him and the man. He was subsequently cited for possession of drugs after a small amount of marijuana was found inside his vehicle. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Walmart employee was arrested Aug. 5 for the suspected theft of $2,600 from the store. She was responsible for transferring cash to the registers when they were low and suspected of shorting them on several occasions. Managers said the cashiers often would not count the money she put in the drawer, but one employee did July 17 and found it was $600 short. The Euclid woman, 38, was then seen returning $600 to the register after she was questioned about it. She admitted to theft and said she wanted to make restitution. Drug abuse, Hansford Road: A Mayfield Heights man, 20, was arrested for possession of a controlled substance after suspected Xanax and Adderall pills were found in his vehicle around 4:30 a.m. Aug. 5. Officers located him in the vehicle in front of a parked house. He said he was meeting a friend who told him to meet him there for a party. There was no indication there was a party anywhere in the area. He said one of the pills must have been dropped in the vehicle by a friend and the other pill belonged to his brother. His mother later told an officer he does not have a prescription for either medication, but his brother does take Adderall. Harassment, Dunfield Drive: A real estate agent said Aug. 4 the fiancé of a client harassed him over the phone in regards to a property in Twinsburg. He said the man said "you better give me my money back or we're going to have a serious problem." Officers contacted the 60-year-old Twinsburg man and told him to have no further contact with the man. He agreed to stop and said he was mad because the man defrauded him out of $1,500. Officers told him to handle the incident in civil court. Harassment, Mayfield Road: A woman said she was confronted while working at Manor Care July 31 by three co-workers, who were upset because she spoke to a supervisor about their work in a negative way. She said they yelled at her and threatened to fight her. That situation was handled internally and one of the women had since resigned from the business. However, Aug. 4, the woman said the three women followed her in a car in Cleveland and one of them got out and threatened her. Officers spoke with two of the women, who said they saw her, but denied any confrontation. They were told to avoid contact with the woman in the future. Theft from building, Marsol Road: A woman said Aug. 2 someone stole approximately $3,400 worth of jewelry during a party at her apartment July 20. She said the jewelry was on her bedroom dresser in plain sight and there were several people at the party she did not know. She said she discovered it missing the following day but did not initially report it because she works a lot and was tired. Traffic offense, Mayfield Road: A man was cited Aug. 3 for turning left in a construction zone at the Lander Road intersection. Officers told him there were four unobstructed signs indicating a left turn was prohibited. The man said, "I know. I've been turning here all week."

(WIVB) — Chautauqua County District Attorney Patrick Swanson is not happy with the Village of Fredonia Court. On Sunday night, a 13-year-old boy with autism went missing from a Walmart he was at with his parents. He was found later that night in the village, and charges were brought against 38-year-old Samuel Saeli. Saeli was accused of kidnapping the boy from the store. After being jailed on $10,000 bail, Saeli made bail and was released. The law states that the Village of Fredonia Court was supposed to offer the chance for Swanson to be heard on bail, but he was not given that opportunity, he said in a statement. “My office learned of the defendant’s capture and arraignment Tuesday morning after the arraignment took place,” Swanson said. “Why the court did not notify my office is beyond me.” Swanson told News 4 that his bail recommendation for Saeli would have been “significantly higher,” had he been given the opportunity to recommend an amount. It was later revealed that Saeli was on probation for a felony charge at the time of his capture. “My primary concern is the safety of this county,” Swanson said. “As the father of five and three-year-olds, I am extremely unhappy with the action taken by the Village of Fredonia court.” There is currently a warrant out for Saeli’s arrest.

Many of those employees reached out to elaborate on their experience with us, and today one said the window without pay was even longer, writing, “I can confirm that the last paycheck we received was Feb 29.” This week, 10 of those staff members joined a class action suit against the company and its founder/CEO Don Coleman. The suit, officially filed on August 15th in Manhattan federal court by the Filosa Law Firm, accuses Coleman and his company of violating these employees’ individual contracts as well as the minimum wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the New York Labor Law’s wage payment requirements. In addition to the suit, we also hear that GlobalHue will soon close its New York office after losing its last client, Walmart. That company recently consolidated its accounts with Publicis, and multiple sources have told us that the multicultural portion of the business was part of that move. For our June post, Coleman claimed that his company would pay all of its debts, adding, “We have over a million dollars that has been held up by my bank over a dispute.” These promised payments never arrived. Today Coleman told us that he is “evaluating [the] situation and will comment upon conclusion.” The suit makes various claims beyond what we reported earlier this summer in seeking “declaratory, injunctive and equitable relief, as well as monetary damages” for the employees involved. * Those parties range from executive creative director Ola Kudu Green and account director Sean Creighton to SVP Angela Spencer Ford, who has been an employee since 2007. The documents filed by Filosa specifically reference our post, noting that Coleman “repeatedly assured employees that they would be paid for the work that they performed” and that he doubled down on those promises in his June email exchange with AgencySpy. The suit reads, “Despite this and other assurances, Plaintiffs have not received any compensation from Defendants for the work that they performed from March 16, 2016 through the present.” It also notes that Coleman has continued to assign work to these staffers despite his repeated failure to pay them and that they have, in some capacity, served as GlobalHue employees up to the present day. The suit also refers to the Walmart account in the past tense, thereby confirming sources’ claims that the company recently ended its relationship with GlobalHue after more than a decade. * Two separate legal complaints have also been filed against Coleman and GlobalHue in recent weeks. In June, Leonard C. Howard filed suit claiming that Coleman had failed to pay him for his duties as driver for Kelli Coleman, the CEO’s daughter. That suit claims that Howard’s assignment was to drive Ms. Coleman to work, to wait for her outside the office during the day, and to take her to “any business and social activities she attended in the evenings.” He “typically worked about 75 hours per week,” and the suit also claims that Coleman “frequently spent long evenings in various clubs in New York City, not emerging until the early hours of the morning.” Howard would then be tasked with driving her home and picking her up to take her to the gym at 8 AM the following morning. According to the documents, this “grueling pace” lasted until Kelli Coleman left the agency in July 2015. At that time, Howard began driving her father, who “did not have the same social activities.” Like the other employees, Howard continued working after receiving his last paycheck on March 15. The real estate company that owns the agency’s headquarters at 123 Williams Street in Manhattan has also sued Coleman for breaking the lease. According to The New York Post, the company seeks $1.24 million from the former NFL linebacker.

(File photo: Bill Klotz) Target cuts its outlook as stores see fewer customers By: The Associated Press August 17, 2016 3:22 pm 0 NEW YORK — Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter’s second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 percent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 percent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. Customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half as Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off. Other issues, both company-specific and industrywide, ranged from a lack of new electronics for sale and lingering disruptions caused by the sale last year of its pharmacy business to CVS. Sales by markets also varied, with weakness on the East Coast but pockets of strength in California. “Our No. 1 focus is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating business to our site,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. Target joins retailers such as department store chain Macy’s that are struggling with fewer customers coming in as shoppers buy more online. The bright spots in retail have been T.J. Maxx’s parent company TJX Cos. and Home Depot as consumers look for clothing bargains and focus more on their homes. Under Cornell, Target has been trying to reinvigorate itself and restore its cheap-chic status after a series of headline-grabbing setbacks such as a 2013 data breach. It’s focusing on categories like fashion, home furnishings and wellness products, creating vignettes featuring home products and launching the children’s line Cat & Jack. But striking the right balance between stylish clothing and bedspreads while offering toothpaste and detergent at good prices has been tricky. “Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant,” said Cornell. “And we’ve got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that’s the “Pay Less” side. And that’s all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively.” To boost sales and traffic, Target plans to increase marketing for its essentials and work with key vendors like Apple to push more innovation and to also improve presentations. Apple product sales were down 20 percent and the electronics department was a “significant drag,” Cornell said.

Crime 60 0 0 August 14, 2016 27th Child Has Died In A Hot Car This Year, Is Preventing Children From Being In The Front Seat To Blame? Trisha Faulkner According to Dallas Morning News, a seven-month-old baby from Texas has become the 27th child to die from being left in a hot car. This seven-month-old baby from Texas was forgotten in his SUV on Friday in the parking lot of a suburban San Antonio Wal-Mart while his father worked his nine-hour shift at the Helotes store. The father told Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess he forgot to drop his son off at daycare before driving to work for his nine-hour shift. The baby was forgotten in the back of his father’s SUV from 6:15 a.m. to 3:09 p.m., which was when the father came out of his work and discovered he had forgotten the child in the back seat of his vehicle. The police and fire department responded to the Texas father’s frantic plea for help. Emergency responders did report the father appeared to be in distress over learning he had forgotten his son in the vehicle, the Daily Mail reports. [Image via ThinkStock] The father of the Texas baby who died in the hot car was taken to a hospital after he was reported to have chest pain and trouble breathing. Officials on the scene claim the father was cooperating with the police up until the point where he locked up. Officials believe this was due to the shock of what had happened to his baby. At this time, there have not been any charges filed against the father who forgot his baby in the back of the SUV for 9-hours. The identity of the Texas father and child have also yet to be released. According to Daily Mail, temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees for a large portion of the afternoon. As stated previously, the death of this baby from Texas brings the total of children who have died in the U.S. in a hot car to at least 27. This is also the sixth child to die from being left in a hot car in the state of Texas. By comparison, there were 25 children who died while left in hot cars last year. Just ten days ago, on August 4, there were twin 15-month-old girls who died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV that was parked in front of a duplex in Georgia. When emergency responders arrived to the devastating scene in Georgia, they discovered people holding the bodies of the twin girls in water with ice packs in order to try to cool them off and revive them. [Image via ThinkStock] It was in the 1990s when the number of children died from being left in a vehicle took a sharp increase. It was around the same time laws were passed requiring parents to place young children in the back seat in order to prevent children being injured or killed when the airbag deploys. The theory behind the increase is simple. Before the law was passed, it was impossible to forget your child was in the car if he/she was in the front passenger seat. According to Janette Fennell, founder and president of Kids And Cars, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia, drivers became less aware of their children being in the vehicle when they started strapping them into the backseat instead of the front. Daily Mail reports the temperature inside of a parked vehicle can reach 119 degrees after sitting in the sun on a 90-degree day. In an hour, that same car will reach 133 degrees. Do you think parents should be punished when they forget their child in a hot car and the child dies? What do you think about some trying to place blame on the law which prevents parents from putting their children in the front seat? Are parents really that forgetful while driving?

Matika. Zoey Bartenope, 19, of Palmerton, pleaded to two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia and three counts of retail theft. The three retail thefts all occurred at the Walmart store in Mahoning Township on Jan. 27, and Feb. 1 and 2. The Feb. 2 count followed a traffic stop after police responded to a retail theft incident. At the stop, Bartenope was found with drug paraphernalia. The other paraphernalia count stems from an Oct. 30, 2015, vehicle stop along Route 443 by Lehighton police. Bartenope was a passenger in the vehicle and found to have the paraphernalia. Bartenope, who is in prison on the charges and a pending probation revocation proceeding, told the court, “I’m into hard drugs. I need help.” She added, “Heroin is nothing to fool around with. I want help, I don’t want to be an addict anymore.” Matika, noting he had Bartenope before him in juvenile court, told her, “You let me down. I gave you another chance and you let me down.” Matika said Bartenope went down the “drug road” fast and into heavy use of heroin. He added, “If you don’t get help now, it will kill you.” On all the counts Matika sentenced her to a total of six to 12 months in prison followed by one year of probation. She was given credit for 180 days spent to date on the charges, which is close to his minimum. However, with the pending probation revocation proceeding, she could see more jail time. She was also ordered to render 100 hours of community service when released on parole, get a drug and alcohol evaluation and follow any recommendations for treatment, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, make total restitution to Walmart of $583.67, supply a DNA sample, pay court costs of about $1,000, pay a $50 per month supervision fee while on parole and probation and stay out of the Walmart store.

 America is about to go on a 'Back to School' splurge Chris Versace, Tematica Aug. 17, 2016, 3:36 PM 1,072 facebook linkedin twitter email print Angela Mueller/Flickr While parents may like to think otherwise, the reality is that children are “active decision makers” in family economies. We’re not going by what we’ve heard or seen, but rather by the data from YouGov that confirms this influence. Moreover this influence is fairly well spread among the purchases ranging from clothes, footwear and personal care products to be worn by the teenager, but also entertainment content and where to eat. Per YouGov: Apparel for the teen to wear (96% of teens having some degree of influence); Where to shop for clothes for the teen (90%); Personal care products for the teen (93%); Footwear for the teen (93%);  Which fast-food restaurants to go to (95%); and Types of out-of- home entertainment/sports/recreation to attend or do (93%); Why is this important now? We are in the midst of Back to School (BTS) shopping season, and the National Retail Federation sees BTS 2016 spending hitting $75.8 billion. And yes, that is up compared to the $68 billion spent last year. When we see aggregated numbers like that we also prefer to look at them on an individual or household basis as it tends to provide some much needed perspective. This year the NRF sees shoppers spending an average of $674 per household, up from $630 last year. T-shirts made in the USA are on sale for $4.88 at the Walmart Supercenter in Bentonville, Arkansas June 5, 2014. Reuters/Rick Wilking The two big winners this year are online shopping, which comes as hardly a surprise given our connected society investing theme, and discount stores, again little surprise given our cash-strapped consumer theme. But what will these back to schoolers be buying from online retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and at Costco (COST) or Wal-Mart’s (WMT) Sam’s Club? To ferret out some answers we turn to data published by Piper Jaffray (PJC). Each spring since 2001, Piper Jaffray has conducted a study of teenage shopping habits. In the process, Piper has surveyed more than 130,000 teens and collected more than 35 million data points about teenage spending habits over the past 15 years. This year’s study surveyed 6,500 US teens across 46 US states with an average age of 16.5 (broken down to 56% male, 44% female). Contrary to the NRF Back to School spending forecast, Piper’s finding show teen spending is down compared to 2015. Even so, upper-income teens spent 38% of their “wallet” on fashion categories, such as clothing, accessories, footwear, etc. That’s a 2% uptick from a year ago, according to the study. So where are teens spending that wallet or otherwise influencing spending decisions? Rise & Fall of the Middle Class Athletic apparel accounted for 17% of spending total. While Nike (NKE) was the most popular brand at 21%, followed by: American Eagle (AEO) 8%; Forever 21 (7%), Ralph Lauren (RL) 6%; and Hollister (ANF) at 4%).   &y Affordable Luxury Among upper-income teenage females, beauty products amounted to 10% of overall spending, which is the highest percent the survey has seen in 10 years. While no specific retailer was called out, one of the best positioned companies that continues to see more of its business conducted online is Ulta Salon (ULTA). Sales of denim jeans also rose to 14 percent of total spending among upper-income females, the first time it’s showed up as a top trend in spending since 2013. Again, there were no specific denim brands mentioned but several contenders include VF Corp.’s (VFC) 7 for all Mankind; Guess? (GES), True Religion, and brands owned by PVH Corp. (PVH). Food with Integrity, Guilty Pleasure and other food options Restaurant spending made up 22 % of total overall spending for upper-income teens and they tend to frequent limited-service restaurants rather than the full-service dining experience (and heftier price tag). The average check for a teenage meal was $4–$17 Starbucks (SBUX) was the most at 14%, followed by Chipotle (CMG) 9%; Chick-fil-A 7% and then Panera (PNRA) and McDonald’s (MCD) both at 4%. Online shopping Amazon (AMZN) dominates teen spending habits with 41% of all online teenage sales occurring there, while Nike (NKE) and Forever 21 tied for second at 5% apiece and eBay (EBAY), American Eagle (AEO) and Victoria’s Secret (LB) all tied for third at 3% each.  "The Get Down" stars, from left, Jaden Smith, Skylan Brooks, Tremaine Brown Jr., Justice Smith, and Shameik Moore. Myles Aronowitz/Netflix Media consumption Teens are also watching much more Netflix (NFLX) and YouTube (GOOGL) than traditional TV channels and shows. Teens spent 65% of their time watching Netflix (NFLX) and YouTube, compared to just 26% of their time watching “traditional TV.” Netflix is clearly dominating teen view habits at 38%.  Given the influence that teenagers have on overall spending, it’s what’s not mentioned above that is rather revealing. Given the respondent age range, there is too little data to conclusively say anything about the automotive, travel or markets; however consumer electronics is notably lacking this Back to School season. We find that rather interesting given the ongoing shift in schools to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) vs. school districts purchasing millions of dollars of computer equipment. This of course pushes the spend to families, and helps explain the continued year over year increase in Back to School spending this year. As we mentioned, there is no mention of automotive preferences from the Piper Jaffray findings, but we did come across a new study by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute that showed a drop in the number of people with a driver’s license. What we found hard to fathom was the drop in people with a driver’s license has been steadily falling since 1983 among people aged 16-44. Then we dug into the report and found something even more shocking - in 2014, just 24.5% of 16-year- olds had a license, a 47% decrease from 1983, when 46.2% did. If we expand the age range, we still find far fewer teens getting their driver’s license by the time they are 19 - 69 percent of 19-year-olds had licenses in 2014, compared to 87.3%t in 1983. Photo illustration of logo of car-sharing service app Uber on a smartphone over a reserved lane for taxis in a street in Madrid Thomson Reuters Perhaps all the various ways to communicate today as part of our increasingly connected society - thank you iMessage, Facebook (FB), Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, Instagram, FaceTime and now Google Duo (GOOGL) - means 16-18 year olds no longer feel the itch to get out of the house and hit the road to see friends. While it has little bearing on 2016 Back to School spending, we have to wonder what the longer-term implications are for auto demand? Will it shift from more individuals owning cars to consumer facing car services, like Uber and Lyft, driving new car purchases? Could it have the same effect on Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and other companies like the one Uber and Lyft have had on shares of Medallion Financial Corp. (MFIN)? Shares of Medallion Financial peaked in November 2013 at just below $18, but before too long the impact of Uber’s 2011 launch in New York City would weigh on the shares. Add in Lyft and the adoption of smartphones, and before too long Medallion Financial shares would cross the $10 mark and continue to fall even though the company instituted a quarterly dividend. The answers to those questions will come in time.

The manic University of Michigan football coach has been feuding with reporters covering the team since Monday, then took the fight national Wednesday morning after Jim Rome took some jabs at him. Rome was incensed by the “miserable” former 49ers coach, who had taken issue with media pressing him about three suspended players. Harbaugh had abruptly ended the interview, angry the reporters wanted further information. “Maybe you forgot over the summer that it’s their job to cover your team, not asking you what your favorite Drake album is,” Rome said Tuesday on his CBS radio show, via The Detroit News. “Just like they’re not there to write another tired story about your latest throwback jersey, or your Walmart khakis, or your latest shirtless photo from satellite camp, or another [attack] on the SEC. “They’re not on your staff, they do not work for the university. You preside over an alleged national power. If you suspend guys, reporters are going to ask you about it. They’re just doing their job, so you should do yours and answer the question.” Rome got personal, calling it a “jerk move” by Harbaugh. “If anybody thought this was going to be a kinder, gentler Harbaugh since he went home to Ann Arbor to rescue the football program, make no mistake, it’s the same exact guy,” Rome said. “Nothing’s changed. Same guy. Same insanely intense dude that got run from Frisco, because he was miserable. He runs way too hot and he was wearing people out. Don’t get it twisted now. Great coach. Unbelievable coach. I’m sure he’ll do a great job there. But when you have a coach who wins as he wins and nobody is ever sorry to see him leave, that tells you a little something about that guy.” But what kind of guy does Harbaugh think Rome is? The steamed coach, as if identifying a prone spot in a defense, counterattacked with a cutting tweet that included Rome’s infamous interview with Jim Everett. The 1994 moment, immortalized on the internet, saw the NFL quarterback try to attack Rome, who kept calling him “Chris” (as in Chris Evert). Do you remember the provocateur who went personal with another Big 10 QB and had the tables turned on him? #déjàvu https://t.co/0GAciV74tQ — Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) August 17, 2016 While the wording seems personal and almost threatening, Rome laughed it off — with a subtle dig of his own. Roasted! Damn, you got me good. Like 42-13 good. https://t.co/qAkYtqYKiB — Jim Rome (@jimrome) August 17, 2016 42-13? The score of Ohio State’s trampling of Michigan last year.

The change comes from a need to define the way Messenger Bots can contact a customer and with which types of content. The rule changes include the ability for a business to send promotional and marketing material to a user within 24 hours of contact. Of course, the user has to first contact the business, so you won’t get random ads from Walmart about Rollback prices or anything. Businesses can send stuff to you after that window of time, but only if it’s a template message such as a receipt or confirmation number. Furthermore, new use cases in the Subscription Bots category can be used for users who want to subscribe to bots for regular messages, such as automatic news alerts or a bot that can remind you to do something. We’re sure advertising has always been the next natural step for Messenger Bots, and we’re glad to see that Facebook is managing it in a way that ensures users won’t be spammed with irrelevant or unwanted content. And if nothing else, you can simply choose to not use the bots at all.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Erin Lash, CFA | 08-17-16 | 08:20 AM | Email Article We don’t expect a material change to our $74 fair value estimate for  Target   following tepid second-quarter results, which included a 1.1% comparable-store sales decline and flat operating margins at 7.7%. In light of a challenging operating landscape, management lowered its 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.80-$5.20 from $5.20-$5.40; we had already viewed the prior range as a bit stretched, as our estimate stood at $5.08. Despite the firm’s more muted near-term outlook, we’re holding the line on our long-term forecast for 3% annual sales growth and 7.5% average margins over the decade. About the Author Erin Lash, CFA, is a director of consumer sector equity research for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists Even with the mid-single-digit retreat in the share price, we’d suggest investors await a more attractive risk/reward opportunity, given the continued headwinds for Target. We believe Target possesses a well-known brand, convenient locations, and considerable scale; however, its product mix skews toward categories that go head to head with Amazon. Further, at $2.5 billion in 2015, digital sales accounted for just 3.5% of Target’s total sales base, and as such, the firm lacks a cost edge to defend itself against established online competitors (Wal-Mart generates more than $13 billion in online sales and Amazon generates more than $100 billion), supporting our no-moat rating. Although digital channel sales increased 16% on top of a 30% jump in last year’s second quarter (reflecting a 0.5% comp), this growth is coming off a very low base. Target’s same-store sales (excluding digital) slipped 1.6%, as the retailer has fallen victim to the challenges experienced across the sector. Traffic slumped 2.2%, with particular weakness in electronics and grocery, while prices increased 2.6% and units per transaction ticked down 0.5%. To offset these pressures, Target will probably need to cut prices to drive traffic if sales growth remains persistently low, resulting in negative operating leverage and margin contraction.

(Photo: Brown Harris Stevens) Over the years, a number of rather interesting individuals have resided inside the limestone-clad walls of 515 Park Avenue. The condo has been called home by Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton, music exec L.A. Reid and Broadway producer Harold Prince (who bought Reid’s unit for $16.5 million) in 2014. The building is also where self-proclaimed Israeli spy and former arms dealer Ari Ben-Menashe chose to buy a $7 million corner unit in 2010. This is not the coziest of condos. (Photo: Brown Harris Stevens) Menashe, who penned the book Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network, which details his supposed involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal, put the 2,500-square-foot pad back on the market in 2012, asking $9.599 million. Over the years, he lowered the price to $8.995 million, then $8.65 million, taking the home on and off the market. And now, it’s back, with a freshly cut, $8 million price tag! The home, which has an oversized entry gallery and herringbone floors, is currently configured as a 2-bedroom, with 3.5 baths, though the listing, from Brown Harris Stevens Broker Frans Preidel, clarifies that the home was originally a 3-bedroom. The “prewar-inspired design” of the condo includes an eat-in kitchen with custom cabinetry, marble countertops and “premium-grade appliances,” as well as a formal dining and living rooms and a library. Wondering if anyone has ever lived here. (Photo: Corcoran) Other than the bedroom reconfiguration, it doesn’t look like Menashe put too much of his individual touch on the place, at least from the listing photos, though considering he’s been trying to sell the place since 2012, and since last we heard, he maintains his primary residence in Montreal (which was severely damaged in an alleged firebombing in 2012), it seems likely that he’s not spending too much time in the city. Or, perhaps Menashe, who currently runs an “international commodity exporting firm,” is looking for a stealthier pad, one that’s more of a hideout-type of lair. Perhaps he should look to Alan Wilzig’s security-heavy Tribeca townhome for inspiration.

Smith, who appeared during felony bond hearings Monday and faced charges of forgery, told District Judge Don Bourne he was on a full athletic scholarship to play basketball at Philander Smith College. Bourne sighed. "That may be coming to an end. A fella ought not squander his talent," he said, shortly before setting Smith's bond at $10,000. According to a police report provided to the court, Smith was arrested for his involvement in a forgery at Walmart on July 8, 2015. The report stated two black males entered the store and put $300 on a money card using counterfeit $50 bills. The other male attempted to load $500 on a card also using counterfeit $50 bills, but the cashier noticed the bills were fake. Both males immediately left the store, but video surveillance captured images of the suspects and the vehicle used to leave the scene. The vehicle returned to Smith, and a comparison to a booking photo showed he was one of the men in the video, according to the report. Smith has a prior felony forgery conviction for an incident that occurred in Searcy. Copyright 2016 The Courier - Your Messenger for the River Valley. All rights reserved.

Double Q Country 105.9 B94.7 KCOW Double Q Country 97.5 Jobs @ Eagle CSC Sports – Listen Live / Podcasts Panhandle Post News, Opinion & Data Local News Regional News Sports Obits Open Mic Bookings Closings Community Calendar A Summer in the Sandhills (Essay and Photo Gallery) August 17, 2016 by Kira Fish Leave a Comment Sometimes those of us who live and work in the panhandle lose track of the wonderful things right before our eyes.  Chadron State College student and Gering resident Kira Fish, our Eagle Radio/Panhandle Post 2016 summer intern, has spent the summer learning the business of radio broadcasting and online journalism.  For her final project, we invited her to write about (and photograph) the places and things in Alliance and Chadron that represent “summer” to her. The Sandhills of Nebraska are a relatively new region for me. Although I’ve attended college classes in the Chadron area for over four years, this summer I spent many hours driving across this scenic place for my soon-to-end internship with KCOW, Double Q Country, B 94.7, and the Panhandle Post.  In doing this I finally became more acquainted with its roads and businesses. This area of the country is dominated by rolling hills split by gray highways and named for its sandy soil with the occasional tree or building or creek to draw the eye. The towns up here are small, even by Nebraska standards, and only appear every fifty or so miles, filled with gas stations and bars and tiny shops and old brick roads. This summer, I had the pleasure of commuting back and forth between two of the Sandhills’ larger towns, Alliance and Chadron. I noticed several locations in Chadron and Alliance that struck me as being particularly “summer-y”: some of the two towns’ restaurants, cafe’s, parks, and tourist attractions. The summer is nearly over, but it’s not too late to visit any of these areas, businesses, and attractions in Alliance and Chadron, and I’d recommend putting any of these places on your “to see” list. All photos below were taken by summer intern Kira Fish. CHADRON: Donald’s Drive-In–448 E 3rd Street Donald’s Drive-In has been around for a while–long enough for two generations of my family, my aunt and myself, to have eaten there while in college, anyway. Serving a wide selection of foods–pizzas, fried chicken, burgers, ice cream and buffets–not only is it a favorite among college students, it’s also family friendly and even has a few arcade games. While everything I’ve tried there was delicious, I’d recommend their thin-crust pepperoni pizzas any time of year, including summer. Chadron State Park–15951 Highway 385 This particular park requires a state park sticker or a day pass, which can be purchased at the park’s visitor’s center or at Wal-Mart (that I know of). The park itself has scenic drives, hiking paths, ponds, paddle boats, campgrounds, tennis and basketball courts, disc golf course, and playgrounds. I’ve only camped there once, but it appears to be a very nice place to stay in the summer and early autumn. The pond is beautiful and the entire park is perfect for landscape and nature photography, and if photography isn’t one of your interests, the campgrounds and outdoor activity spaces are still great places to visit with your family or friends. There’s plenty of shade, but I’d recommend sunscreen and insect repellent, even so. Cleo’s Daily Grind And More–219 Main Street Teenagers and college students being at coffee shops is a cliche, yet I do not feel bad about mentioning Cleo’s Daily Grind and More even if I am transforming myself into a walking stereotype. The shop is well-lit and cozy, with a small seating and dining area in front of a window that offers a nice view of Main Street and plenty of natural light. The shop offers iced coffee, frappes, cappuccinos, and other coffeehouse staples as well as non-coffee drinks and foods. Museum of the Fur Trade–  6321 Highway 20 The Museum of the Fur Trade is pretty large for a small town museum, yet retains all of the expected charm. Admission is $5 per adults 18 and older and free to children or those with a museum membership. The museum explores the complex history of North America’s fur trade, and includes exhibits on the Plains Indians, trappers, clothing, furs, trading posts, and hide tanning. Most museums are associated with school field trips, but this is a good museum to spend time admiring the exhibits and the history it hopes to preserve.   Wilson Park–W 10th Street When I lived on-campus at the college I attend, this park was only three blocks away from my dormitory. My friends and I spent several afternoons there, and I associate this park with both summer afternoons and schooldays. Trees, swing sets, picnic tables, benches, a bridge, and a gazebo make this a gorgeous park that’s perfect for walks and picnics. I’ve spent a fair amount of time playing Pokemon GO at Wilson Park’s Pokestops, but that’s a story for another article… Eagle 3 Theater–244 Main Street Because of internet streaming services and the like, movie theaters are not the media powerhouses I’ve heard they once were, but they still provide entertainment to hundreds of college students and local families. The movie tickets are affordable, as are the treats, and the historic building has three separate screens–not the largest theater, perhaps, but it’s a nice place to spend a summer afternoon or evening, with air conditioning and limited exposure to mosquitoes and ants. ALLIANCE:   Carhenge–2141 County Road 59 This is perhaps Alliance’s most famous attraction. Most people who know of Carhenge are aware of the whole cars-arranged-as-Stonehenge aspect, but the site also has metal sculptures and other car-related art as well as a gift shop, the Carhenge Pitstop. I am a particular fan of this place due to visiting it with my father as a child, although the attraction has changed significantly over the years. Carhenge is owned by the City of Alliance and visiting the site is free, though donations are appreciated. Wigglebottom’s Bakery–117 W 3rd Street  Again, this would be a nice restaurant and bakery to visit any time of year, but over the summer I’ve grown to enjoy this small business’s hamburgers and breakfast items. It’s situated right near downtown Alliance and is a nice place for a quick meal. Alliance Central Park Fountain–10th Street and Niobrara Avenue Alliance Central Park Fountain is gorgeous and has a number of different calming patterns that it cycles through every few minutes. Situated diagonally across the street from Alliance Central Park proper, it is also located in the same area as the Sallows Military Museum, and has shady areas and benches for sitting and admiring the fountain and its changing water patterns and lights. It’s a beautiful place to visit or walk by in the summer, as is the Alliance Central Park to which it belongs. Knight Museum and Sandhills Center–908 Yellowstone Avenue The Knight Museum and Sandhills Center is located on the far side of the Alliance Central Park. Created when local ranch owner Martha Eldred donated $5.4 million to what was then the Sandhills Center, the museum is large, beautiful, and contains exhibits on fossils, native plants and animals, settlers and immigrants, and the local Native American tribes such as the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. The museum also covers the Oregon Trail, the railroad’s impact on the area, and the mining and manufacturing of potash in the area during World War II. Dobby’s Pioneer Village–E 25th Street Dobby’s Pioneer Village is a replica of the buildings, businesses, and churches that would have been common in a small pioneer village back in the day. The outdoor exhibit is free to visit and provides endless photo opportunities, especially to anyone with an interest in pioneer history. The exhibits require walking around outside, so this is a perfect site to visit during the summer when the weather is nice.   Of course, there are many other sites and attractions in these two towns that are noteworthy, but I could not possibly do them all any justice here. This has been an excellent summer, and I am grateful not only to everyone at the KCOW radio station, but also to all of the people I have encountered through my internship with KCOW, Double Q Country, B 94.7, and the Panhandle Post this summer. Goodbye, and good luck.         Filed Under: Alliance, Chadron, Local News Copyright © 2016 · Panhandle Post - Alliance, NE · Powered by Eagle Communications | EEO

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Two-Fisted Radio Explorers find 2nd-oldest confirmed shipwreck in Great Lakes → Grandfather: Man killed by police was just trying to survive Posted on August 17, 2016 by Sunfire Mail.com MILWAUKEE (AP) — The man killed in a police shooting that sparked two nights of violence in Milwaukee suffered from cognitive and mental health issues, and he carried a gun because he had been shot more than once in the past, his grandfather said. Sylville K. Smith had a lengthy criminal past, but was just trying to survive in the inner city, William Brookins told The Associated Press. “In this city, there’s a lot of killings going on in the street,” said Brookins, who detailed Smith’s problems in a letter to a judge last year seeking mercy for his grandson. “He was afraid for his life. He was concerned about his safety and surviving.”   Smith, 23, was shot and killed Saturday after a brief foot chase that followed a traffic stop. Police say Smith was fleeing, and officials have said the officer’s body camera shows him being shot after he turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand. The officer, who has not been identified, is black, as was Smith. A few hours after the shooting, violence erupted on the city’s largely black north side, with protesters hurling rocks at police and burning six businesses. A lighter night of protests followed Sunday. Monday was calm, though 10 people were arrested. There were no reports of protesters gathering on Tuesday night. Smith had several run-ins with the law dating to 2013, including speeding, driving without insurance, driving with a suspended license and having open alcohol in a vehicle. In 2013, he was charged with felony retail theft for allegedly stealing $1,600 worth of DVDs from a Milwaukee Wal-Mart. According to a criminal complaint, Smith and another man were seen removing fans from their boxes and putting the DVDs in the boxes. Prosecutors later dismissed the charge. A year later, he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, a misdemeanor. According to court documents, two officers on bike patrol approached Smith and his friends after smelling marijuana in their vehicle and found a loaded .45-caliber pistol under Smith’s shirt. Smith pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one day in jail. In early 2015, Smith was charged with reckless endangerment, a felony. Investigators alleged he opened fire on a man in retaliation for the man’s role in a fight between some girls weeks earlier. According to a complaint, Smith and the man got into a car chase before the man finally stopped and ran on foot. Smith chased after the man and shot at him. He eluded Smith by hiding behind a house, according to the complaint. As that case was pending, Smith was charged with felony intimidation of a witness — the man he was accused of shooting at. Prosecutors said he had his girlfriend call the man and pressure him to recant. The man did, according to prosecutors, who dropped both cases that year. Brookins said his grandson’s criminal record was “nothing in comparison to other people.” He said Smith had never been convicted of a felony. “That’s the law, OK,” Brookins said. “He’s not guilty.” He described Smith as a good kid with a “beautiful personality.” Smith was known for his hip-hop dance moves and trained in gymnastics when he was in middle school, Brookins said. He also suffered from mental health issues, Brookins said. He declined to go into detail, saying only that Smith had problems with “comprehension and understanding” and spent time in special classes in elementary and middle school. In a letter to the judge in the reckless endangerment case, Brookins wrote that Smith was receiving Social Security payments because of his mental health problems. Smith had been shot on more than one occasion, Brookins said. The last time was “a few years ago” when he was hit six times in front of his mother’s house. His grandfather did not have any information on what precipitated the shooting but said Smith still carried bullet fragments in his body. Smith started carrying a gun after that incident. “That really had a great effect on him and his fear of being hurt and the need to protect himself from people trying to do him harm,” Brookins said. Milwaukee police could not immediately confirm Brookins’ account. A spokesman told The Associated Press to file a records request. Smith’s mother, Mildred Haynes, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that her son had recently received his concealed-carry license because he had been shot twice and robbed four times, including a robbery in which he was stripped of all his clothes. He leaves behind a 2-year-old son. “I’m not going to say he was an angel. He was out here living his life,” Smith’s godmother, Katherine Mahmoud, told the newspaper. “It’s hard to grasp he’s no longer here,” Brookins said. “Oh, my God. This is terrible.” https://www.mail.com/news/politics/4549642-grandfather-man-killed-police-was-trying-to-surviv.html#.7518-stage-hero1-3 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket Related This entry was posted in News.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → August → A Real Rally for Retail ETFs A Real Rally for Retail ETFs Tom Lydon August 17, 2016 0 Comment AMZN, Retail, RTH, WMT, XRT The very stocks, namely department store operators, that were previously holding back the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEArca: XRT), the largest dedicated retail exchange traded fund, are rebounding and that could bode well for an extended rally for XRT and rival retail ETFs. Amazon (NasdaqGS: AMZN) and Dow component Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) have recently helped XRT’s rival, the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEArca: RTH), perform less poorly than XRT. XRT, an equal-weight ETF, has been plagued by slumping apparel retailers, among other corners of the flailing retail industry. With Amazon being one of the story stocks of 2016, RTH is primed to keep rolling, but XRT is reversing its fortunes for the better thanks to rebounding department store names. That scenario is bolstering the ETF’s technical outlook. SEE MORE: America’s Less Dressed: 3 Factors Weighing On Retail ETFs Even as XRT “dipped in early August, on-balance volume held steady. This indicator keeps a running tab of volume trading on up-days minus volume on down-days and it serves as a proxy for supply and demand for shares. Normally, it tracks price action but when it diverges it can yield clues to possible price changes. Money did not flee and that suggests it was a lack of buying rather than worried selling that drove down prices. That’s bullish,” reports Michael Kahn for Barron’s. There are fundamental factors that should buoy consumer discretionary and retail ETFs. For example, the U.S. has been adding about 200,000 new jobs each month for the past two years, a rapid pace not seen since the boom days of late 1990s, and we are now at an unemployment rate of just 5%. On the other hand, economists and investors waiting on wage growth to catch up to the boom. When the economy is at full employment, wages grow about 3% to 3.5% per year, but wages are only rising 2.5% so far. SEE MORE: Amazon in Focus for Retail ETFs “There still is a problem in the sector in terms of relative performance. The SPDR Retail ETF still lags the broader market for the year despite recent improvement. Conservative investors might wait for a move above intermediate-term resistance at the March high to dispel any remaining doubts,” according to Barron’s.

REUTERS/Eduardo MunozMore (Reuters) - Staples Inc , the biggest U.S. office supplies retailer, forecast its 15th straight quarter of declining sales as it closes stores in the face of intensifying competition. The company and former merger partner Office Depot Inc are struggling to compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc at a time when people are using less stationery. Staples' shares were down 7.3 percent at $8.65 in morning trading on Wednesday. The company's sales fell more than expected in the second quarter and the company said it expected sales to also decline in the current quarter. It did not provide a specific forecast. Analysts on average were expecting sales to drop 3.1 percent in the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The blunt truth is that market dynamics are firmly against Staples in that there are far more generalists in the stationery market than there used to be and online plays a much more significant role," said Carter Harrison, a retail analyst at Conlumino. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples said total sales fell 3.7 percent to $4.75 billion in the second quarter. Analysts had expected sales of $4.77 billion. Sales at its established stores in North America fell 5 percent, steeper than the 3.1 percent drop analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected. Besides trying to buy Office Depot - a deal that fell apart over antitrust concerns - Staples has been responding to tough conditions by closing stores and focusing on serving medium-sized businesses rather than Fortune 500 companies. The company is also focusing on offerings other than office supplies, such as electronics and furniture, and said in May it would step up deliveries to 80 percent of total North American sales within three years in an effort to compete with Amazon. Staples posted a net loss of $766 million, or $1.18 per share, in the latest quarter, due to a $986 million pre-tax charge related to its European operations and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot deal. It earned $36 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Staples reiterated it would close 50 stores in North America this year. It closed 242 stores in 2014 and 2015 as a part of a restructuring plan. Staples had 1,907 stores as of Jan. 30. Office Depot earlier this month said it would close about 300 more stores in the next three years to help cut annual costs.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More A Texan kept two Mexican women as slaves for 14 years, telling them she was ‘the voice of God’ Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Washington Post  08.17.2016 Olga Murra ShareAdjustCommentPrint Olga Murra warned one of the women she kept as a slave that if the woman disobeyed, immigration officials would come to Texas, kill her and bury her in a field “with other illegal aliens.” And the punishment wouldn’t stop there. For 14 years, Murra convinced two women that she was “the voice of God” — even making them listen to recordings of her reading Bible verses as they cleaned houses, sometimes seven days a week, court documents said. If they didn’t do as she said, Murra convinced the women, they would spend eternity in hell. Last week, a jury convicted Murra, 64, of two counts of forced labour and two counts of “harboring an illegal alien,” according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The crimes were committed in Fort Worth and El Paso. When she is sentenced in November, Murra faces 20 years in federal prison for each labor charge and 10 years apiece for the harboring convictions, according to ICE. Murra made the women sleep on the floor and ask permission to use the bathroom, court documents say. They could only talk to Murra — not anyone else in the homes where they lived. She only fed them bread and water. One woman told the FBI that Murra would hit her. Another said she was allowed to sleep on the floor of a bedroom — but if either woman misbehaved, they were forced to sleep in the garage or the backyard. Almost every day, they worked. The women cleaned “on average, three or four homes a day,” according to court documents. They also cleaned Murra’s house and prepared her meals. All the while, the women were turning their money over to Murra from cleaning houses. Murra also made them get jobs at McDonald’s and Walmart using forged documents, according to court papers. Murra threatened at least one of the women that if she disobeyed her, she would contact immigration and the woman would be buried in a field with other illegal aliens Murra was born in the United States, but lived in Mexico from shortly after her birth until September 1997, when she moved to Texas — first El Paso, then Fort Worth. She operated cleaning businesses in both cities, ICE said. When Murra returned to the United States, she brought a 33-year-old Mexican woman with her. A year later, she arranged for another woman, who was 21, to come to the United States, according to ICE. The women would be her slaves for the next 14 years and endured a steady stream of abuse and indoctrination. According to the indictment: “ represented herself to (the victim) as the voice of God on earth, and caused (the victim) to believe (the victim) would go to hell if she did not obey the defendant. “Approximately once or twice a week, the defendant required I.G. to attend religious instruction in the residence, during which the defendant preached for two to three hours. Additionally, the defendant required (the victim) to listen to religious recordings when she cleaned homes, which consisted of the defendant reading Bible verses and discussing their meaning. … “Murra threatened at least one of the women that if she disobeyed her, she would contact immigration and the woman would be buried in a field with other illegal aliens.” ••• The United Nations Polaris Project, which tracks human trafficking, estimates there are 20.9 million people across the globe who are slaves, trapped in jobs they cannot leave. That’s about three of every 1,000 people in the workforce. Women make up 55 percent of the trafficked, according to the project: “Although slavery is commonly thought to be a thing of the past, human traffickers generate hundreds of billions of dollars in profits by trapping millions of people in horrific situations around the world, including here in the U.S. Traffickers use violence, threats, deception, debt bondage, and other manipulative tactics to force people to engage in commercial sex or to provide labor or services against their will.” Homeland Security agents investigated Murra’s case, but it’s unclear how the slaves came to the attention of authorities.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive CHS teacher publishes coloring book of hand-drawn sketches Wednesday Aug 17, 2016 at 8:26 AM It's titled "The Perfect Escape" for an artistic stress-relief. By Rebecca Haines It's titled "The Perfect Escape" for an artistic stress-relief. Cheryl Church, a Carthage High School art teacher, has published an adult coloring book with her own hand-drawn artwork. "Most coloring books are computer-generated, but I would say 50 percent of these are from my paintings," Church said, thumbing through the black and white paged-book. "Every one these has a story ... It's the teacher in me – if you've seen my work, you've seen these images and this is your chance to see what you can do with them." "The Perfect Escape," is available through 27,000 wholesalers including Barnes & Noble, Walmart, and Hobby Lobby. So far the artist's book, with an essence of Native American culture, has captured an audience that has made an impact in the book market. "My marketer told me there has been a 45 percent increase in sales because of adult coloring books," Church said. "I'm excited - hopefully more books will come." "The Perfect Escape," was inspired from an "painter's block," as Church described a dry spell of creation with her paints and color pencils. "When I hit those points of blockage I look to other avenues to still remain creative," Church wrote in a welcoming page. "I have created this book using my sketches in my sketchbook so that you may too bridge back over to the creative side, drenching the dry spell into color and life. “Everyone needs to cleanse their souls at some point in life. We all have a little artistic side that can take a contour line drawing and make it come alive through colors of choice."

(DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Few would argue that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) isn’t working hard to rekindle its once-impressive growth. But few would say that work is decidedly paying off. The retailer posted yet another disappointing set quarterly numbers on Wednesday morning, sending Target stock soundly lower in response. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) TGT earned an operating profit of $1.23 per share for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, up a penny year-over-year. That was enough to beat Wall Street projections for $1.12 per share of Target stock, as well as its own forecasts of $1-$1.20 per share. Revenues, however, were off about 8% to $16.17 billion, merely matching sales estimates. That came on same-store sales declines of 1.1%, which were a bit worse than the 0.9% expected. CEO Brian Cornell commented: “While we recognize there are opportunities in the business, and are addressing the challenges we are facing in a difficult retail environment, we are pleased that our team delivered second quarter profitability above our expectations. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities. Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time.” In fairness, Target really is getting its house in order. But that’s little salve to anyone whose Target stock is slumping this morning. Target Stock and Its Headwinds Target generally beats earnings and revenue estimates. However, it has stumbled a few times in recent quarters as company has been struggling with an identity crisis since calendar 2013. The “cheap chic” angle lost its luster versus the “fast fashion” movement employed by its apparel rivals. At the same time, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has continued to chip away at hard lines like toys and electronics. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) Faceplants Into a Sell Rating Perhaps more than anything, Target never really shrugged off the 2013 hack that exposed 40 million customers’ debit card data. Revenue has been dwindling ever since, while income has been choppy at best. Anemic profits haven’t even been as strong as suggested on the surface. The float has been whittled down from 663 million shares in 2012 to 604 million as of the end of Q1. Target bought back another 19 million shares last quarter, pulling the total float down to 585 million shares of TGT stock. Still, Target is optimistic it can revive growth by adding product categories, beefing up its e-commerce effort and moving forward with a new kind of store. Target’s Turnaround Effort One of those initiatives was the expansion of its food business. While Target has long offered some groceries, in the latter half of 2015, it widened its selection to perishables such as meat and produce. The idea was to better compete with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and even dedicated grocery chains such as The Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). The effort drove growth initially, but the company has more work to do on the grocery front. This week, reports surfaced that many of perishables were expiring before they could be sold, implying a lack of grocery foot traffic and/or supply-management challenges. As for e-commerce, Target is still playing catchup after years of not investing enough in its online venue. Digital sales were up 16% during the second quarter, which is an impressive improvement. But online sales still aren’t considered strong enough relative to the opportunity TGT has; they only make up 4% of the company’s revenue. That pace slowed from Q1’s growth rate of 23%. To that end, however Target continues to make strides. TGT recently hired Amazon supply chain executive Preston Mosier to serve as vice president of fulfillment operations. It will need all the help it can get on the online front. Not only was it competing head-to-head with Amazon as well as Wal-Mart, but WMT recently acquired online shopping site Jet.com. That should bolster the brick-and-mortar retailer’s online presence and threat. Perhaps the boldest initiative the company is taking on to buoy the value of Target stock is the development of smaller stores. The 20,000(+/-)-square-foot locales are roughly a tenth of the size of the typical Target store, allowing them to be established in, and serve, neighborhoods rather than the shopping center crowd. Twenty are already up and running, and while Walmart is getting out of the small-store business, Target recently accelerated its small-footprint plans. It now endeavors to open 14 more of the small-footprint stores before the end of 2016. TGT: Looking Ahead The overall assessment of Target’s overhaul efforts have been positive of late. Buckingham Research Group analysts commented earlier this week “We have been impressed with new management’s decisive actions and evidence of improved merchandising and execution, although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a modest setback.” Analysts’ collective outlook affirms the sentiment. The pros were looking for an average profit of $5.13 per share, up 19% from the prior year’s second-quarter bottom line. Sales were only expected to fall 4.5% in 2016, though, from $73.8 billion to $70.5 billion. Wednesday’s Vital Data: AAPL, CHK and HAIN But Target reeled in its full-year outlook. It now anticipates same-store sales will be flat to 2% lower for all of 2016, and lowered its earnings guidance from a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share of TGT to a range of between $5.20 and $5.40. Target stock fell 4% on the downward-revised guidance. Rival Walmart will announce its quarterly numbers on Thursday of this week. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

No action was taken after the first executive session; however, after the second executive session, the board retroactively set the pay for the interim manager, John Williams, to $50,000 per year while he is interim manager. Williams had been the assistant manager and became interim manager when Manager Kevin Shifter resigned in June. Concerns were raised by members of the public about the rates being charged by CMA. Chairman Russ Triponey explained that CMA is in line with other local authorities. Just a few days ago, he contacted DuBois and learned their rates are about $85 to $100 per month, and added that a good portion of the rates is due to regulations set under Chesapeake Bay regulations.  “I don’t like high rates either,” he said. The board also responded to a question about the increase in the base rate of $84 per quarter, which has been discussed in other meetings.  CMA also sent out notices to customers prior to the rate change. Board members and Engineer Jim Balliet explained that the authority had to build a new sewer plant to meet regulations set forth by the state Department of Environmental Protection. The bank and the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority require CMA to show they can repay the loans with a fixed amount, which is where the $84 comes from. CMA determined after much discussion that this was the amount needed to cover the debt service.  Those with larger meters, such as Wal-Mart or the Dimeling, pay a larger base rate than $84. Arnold Swales asked why the plant is so large, and Balliet explained that they were required to build a sewer plant that would handle both the average daily flow as well as the maximum hydraulic capacity set by DEP when all of the CSOs and SSOs are closed. The daily rate is based on an average of the past 20 years.  Balliet said the plant has to be big enough to handle all overflow. When Swales asked about a rumor of building equalization ponds, Balliet replied the only discussion was regarding the Hyde area, which is still bringing in extra water. The choice was to either have all the home owners replace the laterals under their homes, or build a tank to hold extraneous water until it can be treated. The board chose to do what was cheapest for the community, and the most economical way to meet DEP regulations.  “When we’re done with this plant, I don’t want to be overloaded on day one,” Balliet said. “I work there and I think it’s way too big.  We’re not Altoona,” Swales responded. Balliet said he understands and they could have built a smaller plant; however, that would have also restricted the possibility of development in the area.  He said the plant must be big enough to allow nutrient removal in cold weather and also accept high flow from infiltration. Randy Anderson asked about some financial concerns, beginning with whether former manager Jeff Williams is still on the payroll. Solicitor John Ryen said they cannot discuss personnel matters with the public, but he is employed as a consultant. Board member Chris Stott added that Williams retired when they were entering into some big projects and they have been asking him for advice in certain areas. Anderson also asked if a relative of Williams was now the manager and again he was told it was a personnel matter, but that John Williams is currently interim manager while they look for a new manager and review applications, and he was the assistant manager prior. At Anderson’s request, the board also discussed why rates are set where they are, and Triponey noted much of it has to do with DEP regulations and surcharges from the municipalities. “You’re at the wrong meeting,” he said, noting that DEP comes to CMA with the regulations because CMA has the permit, though the municipalities are the ones who need to be doing much of the work to keep the lines in working order. He added that DEP has also told CMA that the Montgomery Run water treatment plant doesn’t meet 100-year rain event requirements and DEP will probably come to them and insist on an upgrade. If that happens, the plant will be shut down for a time, and CMA does not know where the additional needed water will come from, as they are not permitted to draw from the river or other streams in the Susquehanna River Basin without a permit. In other matters, the board commended employees for quick response on several issues, including a break in a centrifuge and a main leak in front of CNB Bank at 3 a.m. The board approved purchasing a software upgrade for the office at a cost of $27,000.  John Williams explained that the current software was installed in 2001 and is out of date and will soon be unusable. An ethics and confidentiality statement was adopted by the board in a 4-2 vote, as well. Under his report, Balliet reported that DEP has approved additional time to comply with more stringent aluminum discharge limits at the Montgomery Run treatment facility, so that they can determine if they can meet compliance without making physical changes.  Also, installation continues at the wastewater treatment facility with some preliminary equipment start-ups.

(DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Few would argue that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) isn’t working hard to rekindle its once-impressive growth. But few would say that work is decidedly paying off. The retailer posted yet another disappointing set quarterly numbers on Wednesday morning, sending Target stock soundly lower in response. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) TGT earned an operating profit of $1.23 per share for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, up a penny year-over-year. That was enough to beat Wall Street projections for $1.12 per share of Target stock, as well as its own forecasts of $1-$1.20 per share. Revenues, however, were off about 8% to $16.17 billion, merely matching sales estimates. That came on same-store sales declines of 1.1%, which were a bit worse than the 0.9% expected. CEO Brian Cornell commented: “While we recognize there are opportunities in the business, and are addressing the challenges we are facing in a difficult retail environment, we are pleased that our team delivered second quarter profitability above our expectations. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities. Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time.” In fairness, Target really is getting its house in order. But that’s little salve to anyone whose Target stock is slumping this morning. Target Stock and Its Headwinds Target generally beats earnings and revenue estimates. However, it has stumbled a few times in recent quarters as company has been struggling with an identity crisis since calendar 2013. The “cheap chic” angle lost its luster versus the “fast fashion” movement employed by its apparel rivals. At the same time, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has continued to chip away at hard lines like toys and electronics. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) Faceplants Into a Sell Rating Perhaps more than anything, Target never really shrugged off the 2013 hack that exposed 40 million customers’ debit card data. Revenue has been dwindling ever since, while income has been choppy at best. Anemic profits haven’t even been as strong as suggested on the surface. The float has been whittled down from 663 million shares in 2012 to 604 million as of the end of Q1. Target bought back another 19 million shares last quarter, pulling the total float down to 585 million shares of TGT stock. Still, Target is optimistic it can revive growth by adding product categories, beefing up its e-commerce effort and moving forward with a new kind of store. Target’s Turnaround Effort One of those initiatives was the expansion of its food business. While Target has long offered some groceries, in the latter half of 2015, it widened its selection to perishables such as meat and produce. The idea was to better compete with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and even dedicated grocery chains such as The Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). The effort drove growth initially, but the company has more work to do on the grocery front. This week, reports surfaced that many of perishables were expiring before they could be sold, implying a lack of grocery foot traffic and/or supply-management challenges. As for e-commerce, Target is still playing catchup after years of not investing enough in its online venue. Digital sales were up 16% during the second quarter, which is an impressive improvement. But online sales still aren’t considered strong enough relative to the opportunity TGT has; they only make up 4% of the company’s revenue. That pace slowed from Q1’s growth rate of 23%. To that end, however Target continues to make strides. TGT recently hired Amazon supply chain executive Preston Mosier to serve as vice president of fulfillment operations. It will need all the help it can get on the online front. Not only was it competing head-to-head with Amazon as well as Wal-Mart, but WMT recently acquired online shopping site Jet.com. That should bolster the brick-and-mortar retailer’s online presence and threat. Perhaps the boldest initiative the company is taking on to buoy the value of Target stock is the development of smaller stores. The 20,000(+/-)-square-foot locales are roughly a tenth of the size of the typical Target store, allowing them to be established in, and serve, neighborhoods rather than the shopping center crowd. Twenty are already up and running, and while Walmart is getting out of the small-store business, Target recently accelerated its small-footprint plans. It now endeavors to open 14 more of the small-footprint stores before the end of 2016. TGT: Looking Ahead The overall assessment of Target’s overhaul efforts have been positive of late. Buckingham Research Group analysts commented earlier this week “We have been impressed with new management’s decisive actions and evidence of improved merchandising and execution, although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a modest setback.” Analysts’ collective outlook affirms the sentiment. The pros were looking for an average profit of $5.13 per share, up 19% from the prior year’s second-quarter bottom line. Sales were only expected to fall 4.5% in 2016, though, from $73.8 billion to $70.5 billion. Wednesday’s Vital Data: AAPL, CHK and HAIN But Target reeled in its full-year outlook. It now anticipates same-store sales will be flat to 2% lower for all of 2016, and lowered its earnings guidance from a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share of TGT to a range of between $5.20 and $5.40. Target stock fell 4% on the downward-revised guidance. Rival Walmart will announce its quarterly numbers on Thursday of this week. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.
