It was the second time Wal-Mart has shuffled its e-commerce decks after it acquired Jet.com in August and appointed Marc Lore to run its e-commerce business. In November, Wal-Mart announced a number of management changes and said Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust would lead fulfillment operations for both Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com. Among the changes announced today, Wal-Mart said Jeremy King, who was the chief technology officer of global e-commerce for Wal-Mart Stores, will oversee the technology teams for both its brick and mortar retail stores and its e-commerce business. Michael Bender, chief operating officer for e-commerce, will leave the company. Tony Rogers, the chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart in the United States, will now also oversee online marketing efforts as the company shifts its focus to building its websites and e-commerce offerings. Wal-Mart also appointed GE Power executive Clay Johnson as the new chief information officer. Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell, who will leave in February. “These changes continue to show Lore is putting his stamp on the business,” said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. “It remains to be seen how effective this will be.” The departures are a sign that Wal-Mart’s struggling online business will get a drastic makeover under Lore, who started out in e-commerce with Diapers.com, which he eventually sold to Amazon.com Inc in 2010 for US$550 million. Lore is likely to stay with Wal-Mart for at least five years, according to filings. The changes announced on Friday are also part of a broader push by Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon to narrow the gap with Amazon and to give it an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce. The retailer has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival. The management changes come at a time when Wal-Mart is cutting thousands of back-office jobs in an effort to focus more on e-commerce, cut costs and have more employees on the sales floor Analysts expect such executive shuffles to continue as Wal-Mart keeps integrating Jet.com into its business. “Wal-Mart clearly isn’t done reconfiguring its e-commerce operation and still has work to do,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. He said a lot of companies are combining oversight of their store and online operations with the goal of having a single retail organization, as Apple Inc did last year. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

A total of 174 counts of Public Health Act violations have been laid against the company, most of them for “failing to ensure that food that has been contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption must not be served, offered for sale, processed, packaged, displayed or stored for human consumption.” The list of food items in question includes baby snacks, ice cream, cheese, yogurt, bacon, steaks, frozen fish and a wide variety of snacks, drinks and condiments. Four of the health act charges relate to “obstructing, hindering or interfering” Alberta Health Services inspectors by advising them that contaminated food was no longer being offered for sale. Court documents filed in Fort McMurray show the alleged violations occurred between May 24-29 last year. Four senior Walmart executives, including the U.S.-based director of disaster response and recovery, are included in the health act charges. The northern Alberta oilsands hub was evacuated on May 3 amid a massive wildfire that wiped out about 10 per cent of the community’s structures. A phased re-entry did not proceed until the first week of June though several people, including employees of some grocery and retail stores, came back early to ensure they were stocked with goods for returning evacuees. “We know that having access to safe food is essential to the health and recovery of any community,” AHS said in a statement Friday. “Food exposed to wildfire situations can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardant chemicals, water and loss of power during a fire. After the wildfire, we worked closely with food operations across Fort McMurray to support their reopening, safely, without posing further risk to the health of residents, visitors and volunteers. “Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to public.This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community.” Walmart also provided a written statement saying the company was surprised by the charges. “Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers,” said the statement from Alex Roberton, senior director, corporate affairs. “We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community. “We have not yet received Crown Disclosure in relation to these charges, and cannot comment further regarding this ongoing legal matter.” kgerein@postmedia.com twitter.com/keithgerein As Advertised in the Calgary SUN Walmart charged for allegedly failing to throw out food after Fort McMurray wildfire By Keith Gerein First posted: Friday, January 13, 2017 03:18 PM MST | Updated: Friday, January 13, 2017 03:28 PM MST Walmart Canada has been charged with numerous health violations for allegedly failing to throw out a wide variety of food and drinks from its Fort McMurray store in the weeks following last spring’s wildfire, Postmedia has learned.

Walmart charged for selling food possibly tainted by Alberta wildfires by The Canadian Press Posted Jan 13, 2017 9:23 pm EST Last Updated Jan 14, 2017 at 7:18 am EST National A giant fireball is visible as a wildfire rips through the forest by Highway 63, 16 kilometres south of Fort McMurray, Alta on May 7, 2016.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Alberta Health Services alleges Walmart Canada kept and sold food that was potentially contaminated by the Fort McMurray wildfire. The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act. “Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public,” AHS said in a statement Friday. “This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community.” Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada’s senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. “Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers,” Roberton said in an email. “We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community.” He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn’t received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. “Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks.” Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

(Ian MacAlpine/The Whig-Standard) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Walmart Canada has pulled out of the development of a new shopping centre in Kingston's north end. Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs at Walmart Canada, said in an email to the Whig-Standard that as the development progressed, the company continued to re-evaluate the 17-acre location where the Quarry Sportsplex used to sit. "We continually evaluate the viability of potential new stores," Roberton wrote. "Occasionally, a new store project is dropped due to a variety of factors, including construction costs, approval status and market opportunity." Joshua Kaufman, senior vice-president of retail and commercial development with Dream Unlimited Corp., said his company had been working with ABNA Investments Ltd. for nearly five years getting the 215,000-square-foot project at 23 Soccer Lane through city hall. "Walmart was going to be the anchor tenant, [then] Walmart informed us of their decision that they were not going to be advancing onsite as the anchor tenant," Kaufman said. "As a result, we had to look at other plans. We're at the point right now where we're trying to work on a different vision for the site, staying consistent with the zoning and the approvals that exist, and as we firm up those plans, we'll be in consultation with the city and come to discuss what it is going to be. "Right now, it's been a land acquisition and we're focusing on the visioning of it." ABNA Investments Ltd. operated by the Doornekamp family, previously owned the property and Dream operated as agents. Kaufman said once zoning was completed, his company purchased the land and ABNA Investments Ltd. is now no longer involved in the project. Kaufman said the location will remain a commercial, retail development. "How that gets distributed amongst the site, how we basically plan for the buildings and the site works, that's all being worked on right now," Kaufman said. Dream doesn't have an ideal tenant in mind yet, whether it be a department store or smaller commercial venture. "[Dream] has made the decision to move forward with the acquisition of the land in Kingston," Kaufman said. "It is a prime location, it is a great opportunity, and it's a great municipality. Given the fact that we believe in the municipality, we want to advance with the best plan we can in light of the news of Walmart making the decision to not continue with the opportunity." With Walmart pulling out, the approval process will likely take another 12 months of planning, but an update should be available in about six months. scrosier@postmedia.com Twitter.com/StephattheWhig  Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Careers and/or Employment ACFOMI Beauty & Spa Marrello Hairstylists Entertainment Community Spirit Gaming Centre Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday.  "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada's senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. "Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email.  "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."   The Canadian Press Previous B.C.

The health agency says Walmart Canada has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act.

(Photo: Lars Hagberg/The Canadian Press) He says Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures designed to ensure the safety of the food it offers its customers. Roberton says it worked very closely with food inspectors and the crisis management team in the city following the wildfire. The huge fire that broke out May 1st forced more than 80-thousand people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority says food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power.

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday. "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada's senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. "Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By The Canadian Press on January 13, 2017. FORT MCMURRAY, Alta. – Alberta Health Services alleges Walmart Canada kept and sold food that was potentially contaminated by the Fort McMurray wildfire. The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act. “Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public,” AHS said in a statement Friday. “This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community.” Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada’s senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. “Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers,” Roberton said in an email. “We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community.” He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn’t received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. “Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks.” 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The health agency says Walmart Canada Corp. has been charged with 174 violations of the province's Public Health Act. "Despite having received this guidance and direction from AHS, both in person and in writing, it is our belief that Walmart reopened selling wildfire-contaminated food to the public," AHS said in a statement Friday. "This was a direct and avoidable risk to the health of this community." Alex Roberton, Walmart Canada's senior director of corporate affairs, said the retailer is surprised by the charges. "Walmart Canada follows very strict policies and procedures specifically designed to ensure the safety of the food we offer our customers," Roberton said in an email. "We, at all material times, and during an unprecedented crisis, worked very closely with both food inspectors and the crisis management team of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to reopen the store as soon as reasonably possible in an effort to support and meet the critical needs of the community." He said Walmart cannot comment further because it hasn't received material from the Crown regarding the charges. The huge fire that broke out May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee the city. Residents were not allowed to return to the damaged community until June. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. The health authority said food exposed to wildfires can be damaged by unsafe temperatures, smoke, ash, soot, fire retardants, water and loss of power. AHS said its staff worked closely with food operations after the wildfire to ensure they reopened safely. "Our goal was simple: ensure safe food is available to this community, as one component of returning the community to health, and protecting the community from any further risks."

Statesman Journal Published 10:21 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 | Updated 10:21 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 Photos of Charles Hollin (Photo: FBI, Multnomah County Sheriff's office) SALEM, Ore. — An Indiana man who fled his home state after being suspected of molesting a 10 year old girl in 1999 has been arrested in Salem, according to the FBI. Charles Hollin, 61, was arrested at his job at a Walmart on Tuesday after fleeing the central Indiana area 17 years ago. It was facial recognition software used by the FBI that found Hollin. The FBI in December confirmed a "most likely" facial match of Hollin with Andrew David Hall, the alias he had been using in Salem, according to a complaint affidavit provided by the FBI. Hollin, as Hall, applied for a U.S. passport in 2007 to travel to China Investigators suspect Hollin molested a 10 year old girl in 1999. He asked for the girl's help in Seymour, Ind., to retrieve keys from his locked car. When the girl approached his vehicle, Hollin allegedly placed his hand over her mouth, threatened to kill her at knifepoint and put her into the car, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice. Hollin is thought to have covered the girl's face with a stocking mask, driven to a secluded area, sexually molested her, and then abandoned her naked on an isolated road. He threw her belongings out of the window as he drove away. The girl was later found and rescued by a passing driver. USA TODAY Guilty plea entered in decades-old Ohio cold case Within four months of the kidnapping and molestation incident, Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan and applied for an Indiana driver’s license under the name of Andrew David Hall. Hall was an 8-year-old boy who died in a car crash in Kentucky in 1975. On Feb. 2, 2000, the Jackson County, Ind., prosecutor filed charges against Hollin: two counts of confinement with a deadly weapon and three counts of child molestation. Hollin disappeared before investigators could arrest him. On Aug. 20, 2001, Hollin is thought to have moved to Minnesota and used his Indiana driver’s license with Hall's name to obtain a Minnesota driver’s license, according to the affidavit. April Diane Mobley, a friend of Hollin from Indiana, was surprised to hear of his arrest. "I am in total shock, but I'm glad they got him. I would hate to think if he did this to somebody else," Mobley said. Mobley's husband, James, 68, used to work with Hollin at Cummins Engine Co., where they helped build motors for automobiles. USA TODAY Felix Vail case becomes oldest prosecution of suspected serial killer in history April Mobley said Hollin would often visit the couple in their home in the evenings after work to chat and spend some time with the family. "He was happy-go-lucky Charlie and was a really nice guy," Mobley said. "He always dressed nice and always had his Bible with him" Hollin was clutching his black, leather-bound Bible against his chest when he visited Mobley while she was working at a Walmart in Seymour in 2000, the last day she saw him. "He came in to talk to me for a bit, asked how I was doing and said, 'See you later,' " Mobley said. A couple of days later, while Mobley was thumbing through a local newspaper, she saw a sketch of Hollin and an article detailing law enforcement's investigation into the child molestation charges and search for the suspect. "I was in total shock and could not believe it," Mobley said. "All I could think of is what the heck happened, and whether he had done that to his daughters." USA TODAY DA cites new evidence in Beck murder case In 2007, a federal warrant was issued for Hollin's arrest on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Jeremy Foster of Salem said he worked the overnight shift with Hollin in 2008 at the Walmart in Salem. "He was a quiet guy and he never really talked about anything personal," Foster said. "He was a private person when it came to himself." Leslee Wright, senior manager for Walmart Corporate Communications, would not comment on Hollin's length of employment but said he is no longer with the company. "We’re cooperating with the FBI in their investigation,” Wright said in an email statement. While it's unclear when Hollin moved from Minnesota to Oregon, he obtained an Oregon driver’s license on March 29, 2011, according to the complaint. Investigators said Hollin's friends and co-workers in Indiana said he admitted to having fake hair pieces and mustaches and knew other tricks to disguise himself. One Indiana co-worker said Hollin once bragged, “If you want to, and know how, you can become someone else, just like that, real easy.” Hollin is currently in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service in Portland.

The reorganization was detailed in internal memos from executives Friday and ahead of the end of the retailer's fiscal year on Jan. 31. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in one memo the restructuring is the result of a plan formulated by company leaders to help Wal-Mart "become a digital enterprise and be enabled by a greater degree of technology." "We're making the changes that will help us win in the short-term and position us to be a winner for years to come," McMillon said in the memo. "I know change isn't always easy. But I'm certain our future success is partially dependent on becoming more of a technology company in our stores and clubs and everywhere else the customer sees us." Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell, who announced earlier this week that she would be leaving the retailer next month after six years with the company. He will lead a team focused on information systems that "run the enterprise," according to a spokesman. McMillon said in a memo that those efforts will include "lowering our costs, getting benefits of scale, associate experience and cyber security." Adding Johnson was just one component of Wal-Mart's plan to better align its online and in-store operations as it tries to a create seamless shopping experience for customers. Jeremy King, chief technology officer of Wal-Mart's e-commerce division, has been promoted to U.S. chief technology officer. He will report to U.S e-commerce Chief Executive Officer Marc Lore and U.S. stores chief Greg Foran, bringing together Wal-Mart's U.S. retail and e-commerce technology teams. Wal-Mart also created chief technology positions within its other businesses. Hsiao Wang has taken the role at Sam's Club. Kerry Pauling moves into the Wal-Mart International position, according to the Wall Street Journal. "The goals of these changes are to become more innovative and faster -- win with customers -- by putting these CTOs closer to the business while the Chief Information Officer will lower costs on the technologies that serve needs further from the customer," McMillon said. Jamie Iannone, the chief executive of SamsClub.com, will oversee the warehouse division's technology efforts online and in stores. Tony Rogers, chief marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S., will now lead a unified marketing organization that includes Walmart.com, Jet.com and Wal-Mart's U.S. stores. "This integrated team will help us communicate in a more consistent way with our customers, regardless of how they choose to shop with us," Lore said about Rogers' new role in a memo. King and Rogers were included as part of Lore's U.S. e-commerce leadership team announcement, which was unveiled nearly five months after he joined the company after Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The group, which is a blend of Walmart.com and Jet.com leaders, will lead a division that Lore said in an internal memo plans to become more customer-centric. Two Jet.com executives were moved into new roles. Scott Hilton will be chief revenue officer of all e-commerce operations and Nate Faust will lead logistics and supply-chain operations for Walmart.com and Jet.com. "Our strategy is about offering more choice, competitive prices -- particularly on food and consumables -- and operating on the strength of the world's most efficient e-commerce supply chain," Lore said in his memo. "We've also talked about building a simpler organization that enables us to work faster and smarter." Other leadership changes include the naming of Gisel Ruiz as executive vice president of operations for Sam's Club; Ashley Buchanan as Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer; and the announcement that Michael Bender, chief operating officer of global e-commerce, is leaving to "pursue other interests," according to McMillon. The realignments come as no surprise to analysts as Wal-Mart continues to invest heavily in technology and e-commerce to keep up with the changing demands of consumers, and competitors like Amazon.com. Neil Stern, a senior partner at Chicago-based retailing consulting firm McMillanDoolittle, said Wal-Mart's moves reflect major trends occurring within the company. "The first is the continued blurring of roles between the on-line and off-line businesses," Stern said in an email. "They can remove some duplication in roles by having one executive oversee both. The second is expected changes as Marc Lore assumes a larger role within the company as both head of Jet.com and Walmart.com operations." The leadership shuffle also comes as Wal-Mart prepares to cut corporate-level jobs by the end of the month in an effort to protect profits and improve efficiency. Wal-Mart has not confirmed any layoffs, but McMillon said in his memo to employees Friday that the company has to change inside to deliver the changes it wants customers to see on the outside. "From time to time, you'll see the company eliminate positions in an effort to stay lean and fast," McMillon said. "In some areas, we'll invest in new positions but in other cases, we'll operate more efficiently and work to change our processes and become more digital to change the work itself. "These are hard choices. We care about our friends and colleagues and will do our best to handle these transitions smoothly and always with respect."

Statesman Journal , KHOU 10:09 PM. CST January 13, 2017 Photos of Charles Hollin (Photo: FBI, Multnomah County Sheriff's Office) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SALEM, Ore. — An Indiana man who fled his home state after being suspected of molesting a 10 year old girl in 1999 has been arrested in Salem, according to the FBI. Charles Hollin, 61, was arrested at his job at a Walmart on Tuesday after fleeing the central Indiana area 17 years ago. It was facial recognition software used by the FBI that found Hollin. The FBI in December confirmed a "most likely" facial match of Hollin with Andrew David Hall, the alias he had been using in Salem, according to a complaint affidavit provided by the FBI. Hollin, as Hall, applied for a U.S. passport in 2007 to travel to China Investigators suspect Hollin molested a 10 year old girl in 1999. He asked for the girl's help in Seymour, Ind., to retrieve keys from his locked car. When the girl approached his vehicle, Hollin allegedly placed his hand over her mouth, threatened to kill her at knifepoint and put her into the car, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice. Hollin is thought to have covered the girl's face with a stocking mask, driven to a secluded area, sexually molested her, and then abandoned her naked on an isolated road. He threw her belongings out of the window as he drove away. The girl was later found and rescued by a passing driver. Within four months of the kidnapping and molestation incident, Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan and applied for an Indiana driver’s license under the name of Andrew David Hall. Hall was an 8-year-old boy who died in a car crash in Kentucky in 1975. On Feb. 2, 2000, the Jackson County, Ind., prosecutor filed charges against Hollin: two counts of confinement with a deadly weapon and three counts of child molestation. Hollin disappeared before investigators could arrest him. On Aug. 20, 2001, Hollin is thought to have moved to Minnesota and used his Indiana driver’s license with Hall's name to obtain a Minnesota driver’s license, according to the affidavit. April Diane Mobley, a friend of Hollin from Indiana, was surprised to hear of his arrest. "I am in total shock, but I'm glad they got him. I would hate to think if he did this to somebody else," Mobley said. Mobley's husband, James, 68, used to work with Hollin at Cummins Engine Co., where they helped build motors for automobiles. April Mobley said Hollin would often visit the couple in their home in the evenings after work to chat and spend some time with the family. "He was happy-go-lucky Charlie and was a really nice guy," Mobley said. "He always dressed nice and always had his Bible with him" Hollin was clutching his black, leather-bound Bible against his chest when he visited Mobley while she was working at a Walmart in Seymour in 2000, the last day she saw him. "He came in to talk to me for a bit, asked how I was doing and said, 'See you later,' " Mobley said. A couple of days later, while Mobley was thumbing through a local newspaper, she saw a sketch of Hollin and an article detailing law enforcement's investigation into the child molestation charges and search for the suspect. "I was in total shock and could not believe it," Mobley said. "All I could think of is what the heck happened, and whether he had done that to his daughters." In 2007, a federal warrant was issued for Hollin's arrest on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Jeremy Foster of Salem said he worked the overnight shift with Hollin in 2008 at the Walmart in Salem. "He was a quiet guy and he never really talked about anything personal," Foster said. "He was a private person when it came to himself." Leslee Wright, senior manager for Walmart Corporate Communications, would not comment on Hollin's length of employment but said he is no longer with the company. "We’re cooperating with the FBI in their investigation,” Wright said in an email statement. While it's unclear when Hollin moved from Minnesota to Oregon, he obtained an Oregon driver’s license on March 29, 2011, according to the complaint. Investigators said Hollin's friends and co-workers in Indiana said he admitted to having fake hair pieces and mustaches and knew other tricks to disguise himself. One Indiana co-worker said Hollin once bragged, “If you want to, and know how, you can become someone else, just like that, real easy.” Hollin is currently in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service in Portland. He will be returned to Indiana to face charges. He could face eight years in prison if he's convicted on the federal charges and decades of imprisonment if convicted on the Jackson County charges, according to the Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley P. Shepard, who is prosecuting the case.

Photo by Lukas Eggen. Itemizer-Observer staff report As of Friday, January 13, 2017 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter DALLAS – A Polk County grand jury found that two Dallas police officers were justified in using deadly force during the Dec. 16 shooting incident that killed Jeremiah N. Anderson. The grand jury’s finding was reached Friday and was unanimous, said a press release from the Polk County District Attorney’s Office. On Dec. 16 at approximately 5:18 p.m., a 911 caller reported a suspicious vehicle in the Dallas Walmart parking lot, 321 NE Kings Valley Highway. The caller described the vehicle as a green F-150 pickup truck and said the driver of the truck appeared to be intoxicated and was flailing around in the driver’s seat. Dallas police officers Aaron Mollahan and Michael Fleming, and Sgt. Rob Hatchell were dispatched to investigate the call. They contacted the driver of the pickup truck, identified as Jeremiah Nels Anderson. According to the DA’s office, Anderson confirmed to the officers that he had driven himself to the Walmart in the pickup truck. Mollahan developed probable cause to believe Anderson was impaired by a controlled substance, based on “poor performance on several field sobriety tests as well as his confused demeanor and speech,” the DA’s office said. Anderson refused the officers’ verbal requests for consent to pat him down for weapons. The officers determined they had probable cause to arrest Anderson on driving under the influence of intoxicants and asked him to place his hands behind his back to be cuffed. At that point, Anderson actively began resisting arrest and trying to break free from physical restraint. Anderson was told repeatedly to stop resisting and continued to struggle with the three officers, the release said. The officers restrained Anderson face down, but were unable to get his arms out from under him. At this point, Anderson told officers he would shoot, and produced a .45 caliber pistol from a shoulder holster. He fired at least two bullets, hitting Hatchell in the leg, according to reports from the DA's office. Hatchell returned fire at close range, striking Anderson in the lower extremities, the report stated. Anderson continued to struggle. Fleming fired one shot, striking Anderson in the head, according to the DA's office. Anderson died at the scene. Hatchell suffered extensive injuries to his leg and back, the DA's report stated. The grand jury found that Hatchell and Fleming's use of deadly force were lawful and justified because: The use of physical force was necessary to defend the police officer or another person from the use or threatened imminent use of deadly physical force; and The officer's life or personal safety was endangered in the particular circumstance involved. A subsequent search of Anderson's home located both methamphetamine and .45 caliber ammunition consistent with the gun he used to shoot Hatchell, according to reports from the DA's office. The Oregon State Police conducted the investigation. The Polk County District Attorney's Office presented the evidence to the grand jury. The grand jury heard testimony from the three involved Dallas officers. Also testifying were detectives and troopers from OSP and five citizen witnesses. The grand jury also reviewed a scene diagram, a report of the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office, as well as dash camera and body camera video.

Statesman Journal Published 10:21 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 | Updated 10:21 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 Photos of Charles Hollin (Photo: FBI, Multnomah County Sheriff's office) SALEM, Ore. — An Indiana man who fled his home state after being suspected of molesting a 10 year old girl in 1999 has been arrested in Salem, according to the FBI. Charles Hollin, 61, was arrested at his job at a Walmart on Tuesday after fleeing the central Indiana area 17 years ago. It was facial recognition software used by the FBI that found Hollin. The FBI in December confirmed a "most likely" facial match of Hollin with Andrew David Hall, the alias he had been using in Salem, according to a complaint affidavit provided by the FBI. Hollin, as Hall, applied for a U.S. passport in 2007 to travel to China Investigators suspect Hollin molested a 10 year old girl in 1999. He asked for the girl's help in Seymour, Ind., to retrieve keys from his locked car. When the girl approached his vehicle, Hollin allegedly placed his hand over her mouth, threatened to kill her at knifepoint and put her into the car, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice. Hollin is thought to have covered the girl's face with a stocking mask, driven to a secluded area, sexually molested her, and then abandoned her naked on an isolated road. He threw her belongings out of the window as he drove away. The girl was later found and rescued by a passing driver. USA TODAY Guilty plea entered in decades-old Ohio cold case Within four months of the kidnapping and molestation incident, Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan and applied for an Indiana driver’s license under the name of Andrew David Hall. Hall was an 8-year-old boy who died in a car crash in Kentucky in 1975. On Feb. 2, 2000, the Jackson County, Ind., prosecutor filed charges against Hollin: two counts of confinement with a deadly weapon and three counts of child molestation. Hollin disappeared before investigators could arrest him. On Aug. 20, 2001, Hollin is thought to have moved to Minnesota and used his Indiana driver’s license with Hall's name to obtain a Minnesota driver’s license, according to the affidavit. April Diane Mobley, a friend of Hollin from Indiana, was surprised to hear of his arrest. "I am in total shock, but I'm glad they got him. I would hate to think if he did this to somebody else," Mobley said. Mobley's husband, James, 68, used to work with Hollin at Cummins Engine Co., where they helped build motors for automobiles. USA TODAY Felix Vail case becomes oldest prosecution of suspected serial killer in history April Mobley said Hollin would often visit the couple in their home in the evenings after work to chat and spend some time with the family. "He was happy-go-lucky Charlie and was a really nice guy," Mobley said. "He always dressed nice and always had his Bible with him" Hollin was clutching his black, leather-bound Bible against his chest when he visited Mobley while she was working at a Walmart in Seymour in 2000, the last day she saw him. "He came in to talk to me for a bit, asked how I was doing and said, 'See you later,' " Mobley said. A couple of days later, while Mobley was thumbing through a local newspaper, she saw a sketch of Hollin and an article detailing law enforcement's investigation into the child molestation charges and search for the suspect. "I was in total shock and could not believe it," Mobley said. "All I could think of is what the heck happened, and whether he had done that to his daughters." USA TODAY DA cites new evidence in Beck murder case In 2007, a federal warrant was issued for Hollin's arrest on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Jeremy Foster of Salem said he worked the overnight shift with Hollin in 2008 at the Walmart in Salem. "He was a quiet guy and he never really talked about anything personal," Foster said. "He was a private person when it came to himself." Leslee Wright, senior manager for Walmart Corporate Communications, would not comment on Hollin's length of employment but said he is no longer with the company. "We’re cooperating with the FBI in their investigation,” Wright said in an email statement. While it's unclear when Hollin moved from Minnesota to Oregon, he obtained an Oregon driver’s license on March 29, 2011, according to the complaint. Investigators said Hollin's friends and co-workers in Indiana said he admitted to having fake hair pieces and mustaches and knew other tricks to disguise himself. One Indiana co-worker said Hollin once bragged, “If you want to, and know how, you can become someone else, just like that, real easy.” Hollin is currently in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service in Portland. He will be returned to Indiana to face charges. He could face eight years in prison if he's convicted on the federal charges and decades of imprisonment if convicted on the Jackson County charges, according to the Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley P. Shepard, who is prosecuting the case. 838 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jGHVFn NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Home The Mix In-Depth Littwin Keefe Events The Beats Civil Rights Education Environment/Energy Health Criminal Justice Politics Donate Mailing list Jeffco school board says no, again, to Walton-backed charter Marianne Goodland January 13, 2017 Education No Comments The Jefferson County Board of Education, for a second time, turned down an application for a charter school with ties to the Walton Foundation. The board voted 3-2 Thursday evening to reject the Great Work Montessori School (GWMS) application. Board members said they worried the charter would not have enough students to open the school and expressed concern about the school’s ties to Walmart’s Walton family and family foundation. One board member accused the charter’s backers of deceiving the board about those ties. The charter school, which would be located near the intersection of South Sheridan and West Alameda in east Lakewood, plans to be a preK-8 school, with a maximum enrollment of 270 students. In its first year, it would enroll preK through third grade, and add another grade every year until it reaches the eighth grade. The school board initially denied the charter application in November. In its denial the board said the budget was too heavily dependent on grants and $1,500-per-month tuition for its pre-kindergarten program, which would serve three- and four-year olds. Related: Jeffco board rejects Walton-backed charter After being denied by the Jeffco board, the GWMS board took its application to the state board of education, and last month, the state board ordered the Jeffco board to work with the charter on the budget issues and to reconsider its decision. Over the past 30 days, both board members and charter backers worked extensively on the budget, and complimented each other for the collaborative process. But it wasn’t enough. Related: Rejected Jeffco charter gets second chance from state board of education Thursday night’s board meeting was packed with supporters and opponents of the Great Work school, as well as those who wanted to chime in on what the board should do with Jeffco Superintendent Dan McMinimee. The board ultimately voted unanimously to begin a national search for a new superintendent. Related: Jeffco school board vote to launch search for new superintendent Opponents of the GWMS application, such as Alex McDaniel of Lakewood, asked the board to once again turn down the charter. McDaniel and his family said they supported the Jeffco board and blasted the state board of education. “During the appeal, the Colorado state board suggested that failure is a part of taking risks. We are ashamed that they would view a probable failure, such as Great Work, as an acceptable risk where real Jeffco students will pay the lifelong price,” McDaniel said during public comment. “Great Work claims to bring us the gift of choice. But just remember, the Trojan Horse was also a gift.” Beverly Wadman, a teacher at Denison Montessori who represented the school’s families and staff, also asked the board to turn down the application. GWMS has claimed it would serve low-income students in a diverse neighborhood where Montessori education is not available. But Wadman pointed out that Denison, a Denver Public School that is about a mile from the GWMS site, has been in operation for more than 30 years, is tuition-free and serves the same diverse population. The school accepts students from Jefferson County. Jennifer Ramsey of Lakewood wants to enroll her children in the charter, if approved. “A solid Montessori education should not be limited to those who can afford an expensive education,” she told the board. “Diversity in our school is what helps children to learn.” And Chase Bongirno, a Jefferson County resident, said the waiting list for other Montessori charter schools in the county is a year long, showing the demand for that education is strong. But the charter’s backers last night weren’t able to demonstrate that the demand for Montessori has extended to Great Work. Amy Malick, the charter’s “head of school,” said that while it had 60 letters of intent to enroll for the pre-kindergarten, a survey it did earlier this month showed it had only 19 commitments for grades one through three. The board expected at least 161 letters of intent for kindergarten through grade three, with a 50 percent dropout rate, which is standard for charter schools, according to Jefferson County staff. There’s also the matter of the ties between Walton and the charter. James Walton is the owner of Great Work, Inc., which in turn owns another company, TGNA. TGNA  purchased land for the school with money from the Walton Foundation. The charter board has insisted Walton’s only connection was a $250,000 grant from the Foundation, but an investigation by The Colorado Independent found that James Walton was among those who conceived of GWMS. The Walton Foundation boasts that it has funded one-quarter of the nation’s charter schools. Jeffco school board President Ron Mitchell on Thursday accused the GWMS board of deception about its ties to Walton. A crossover between a public and private school is a concern, Mitchell said, adding that he doesn’t like “national chain for-profit charters. “I feel like our board has been deceived…when I ask about who owns the property, I get answer that is not satisfying…I think I could prove that the home office of that organization is somewhere down in Arkansas,” where Walmart and the Walton Foundation are based. (In fact, Great Work, Inc. lists as its principal address the same one listed by the Walton Foundation.) Malick did not respond to Mitchell’s accusation. Related: Proposed Jeffco charter finds it isn’t business as usual with school board The Jeffco board’s decision Thursday night does not come without risk. Prior to the vote, several board members pointed out that if they denied the application again, GWMS could again appeal to the state board of education. The state board could just order the Jeffco school district to accept the charter, and on that, the Jeffco board would not have a right of appeal. The state board  in July ordered the Aurora Public Schools to renew the contract of a charter network, Hope Online, after the school district decided to shutter five five Hope learning centers for poor performance. That clearly weighed on the minds of the board as it voted, but the financial issues and below-acceptable enrollment projections weighed more.  GWMS is expected to appeal to the state board of education, although it will be a slightly different state board than the one it met with in December. November’s election put the state board under Democratic control for the first time in decades, with the board now at four Democrats and three Republicans. It previously had been three Democrats and four Republicans. But it’s not a given that the board will vote much differently than it did in December. The new board chair, Democrat Angelika Schroeder, voted with the board’s four Republicans in December, in a 5-2 vote, to remand the GWMS application back to Jefferson County.

It was the second time Wal-Mart has shuffled its e-commerce decks after it acquired Jet.com in August and appointed Marc Lore to run its e-commerce business. In November, Wal-Mart announced a number of management changes and said Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust would lead fulfilment operations for both Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com. Among the changes announced on Friday, Wal-Mart said Jeremy King, who was the chief technology officer of global e-commerce for Wal-Mart Stores, will oversee the technology teams for both its brick and mortar retail stores and its e-commerce business. Michael Bender, chief operating officer for e-commerce, will leave the company. Tony Rogers, the chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart in the United States, will now also oversee online marketing efforts as the company shifts its focus to building its websites and e-commerce offerings. Wal-Mart also appointed GE Power (GE.N) executive Clay Johnson as the new chief information officer. Johnson will replace Karenann Terrell, who will leave in February. "These changes continue to show Lore is putting his stamp on the business," said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. "It remains to be seen how effective this will be." The departures are a sign that Wal-Mart's struggling online business will get a drastic makeover under Lore, who started out in e-commerce with Diapers.com, which he eventually sold to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in 2010 for $550 million. Lore is likely to stay with Wal-Mart for at least five years, according to filings. The changes announced on Friday are also part of a broader push by Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon to narrow the gap with Amazon and to give it an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce. The retailer has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival. The management changes come at a time when Wal-Mart is cutting thousands of back-office jobs in an effort to focus more on e-commerce, cut costs and have more employees on the sales floor Analysts expect such executive shuffles to continue as Wal-Mart keeps integrating Jet.com into its business. "Wal-Mart clearly isn't done reconfiguring its e-commerce operation and still has work to do," said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. He said a lot of companies are combining oversight of their store and online operations with the goal of having a single retail organisation, as Apple Inc APPL.O did last year.

Linder By JORDYN REILAND jreiland @shawmedia.com WOODSTOCK – Jurors found a Zion man guilty on Friday of the drug-induced homicide of 21-year-old Danielle Barzyk. Jurors found that James F. Linder sold more than one gram of heroin to Barzyk’s boyfriend, Cody N. Hillier, on Jan. 30, 2015, in Zion. The couple returned to Algonquin and used the drugs at least three times, and just after 1 a.m. Barzyk told Hillier she was having trouble breathing and needed medical attention. Hillier and Barzyk met at a local rehabilitation facility in July 2014 and started dating. Hillier, who took the stand this week, said he and Barzyk relapsed in November 2014 and continued daily usage. When police arrived at the scene, they asked Hillier whether Barzyk had taken anything, and he said she was having an asthma attack. He later told responding officers and emergency personnel that she had taken Vicodin. Barzyk was taken to Advocate Sherman Hospital in Elgin, where she was pronounced dead. Hillier agreed to work with the North Central Narcotics Task force and bought additional heroin from Linder in a controlled narcotics transaction at a Wal-Mart in Zion. Linder was pulled over after the alleged drug deal, and officers located the money Hillier was given to buy the drugs, his wallet, a cellphone and additional cash. Linder was arrested and has since been held in the McHenry County Jail. Hillier previously pleaded guilty in May to unlawful possession and delivery of a controlled substance in this case and was sentenced to probation. He was rearrested in October after violating the terms of his probation. The jury began deliberations shortly before 11:30 a.m. Friday and returned with a verdict about two hours later. During closing arguments, Assistant State’s Attorney Randi Freese asked the jury to hold the defendant accountable. “He profited and preyed on the addiction and disease of Danielle and Cody,” Freese said. Freese said prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt because they were able to show that Linder knowingly delivered heroin to Hillier, that the heroin was at least one gram or more, that Barzyk inhaled the heroin and that Barzyk died as a result of the inhalation. Freese said the most convincing evidence in the case against Linder came from his cellphone, which was taken from the defendant when he was arrested. The text messages documented conversations between Hillier and Linder regarding the two heroin purchases. There also were recorded phone calls between the two from Jan. 31, 2015, when Hillier was working with undercover officers. Freese said there was no doubt that Barzyk died of a heroin overdose based on testimony from two forensic pathologists who took the stand this week. “What happened to Danielle could have just as easily happened to Cody. They both used the heroin. … One died; one lived,” Freese said. Mitra Kalelkar and Hillary McElligott, who testified for the prosecution and defense, respectively, generally agreed Barzyk’s primary cause of death was a narcotics overdose. Kalelkar conducted Barzyk’s autopsy days after she died and examined a toxicology report prepared when coming to her conclusion of how Barzyk died. She said Barzyk’s lungs were heavier than normal from a significant amount of fluid and congestion, something she commonly sees in patients who overdose or drown. She also said she was aware of Barzyk’s history of asthma, but did not believe it was what caused her death. Hank Sugden, Linder’s attorney, said in closing arguments that prosecutors did not prove Linder delivered heroin to Hillier nor did they prove Barzyk died of a heroin overdose. Sugden said Barzyk and Hillier were both addicts who were aware of the danger of drugs. Sugden said, referencing Freese’s prior statement, that Hillier lived and Barzyk died not because she overdosed but because of the fact that she had an asthma attack. That was the major difference between the two, he said. McElligott said while she agreed the primary cause of death was related to a heroin overdose, she believed asthma was a major contributing factor. She said someone who is overdosing will appear as though they are falling asleep or passing out, but someone experiencing a severe asthma attack is more likely to gasp for air and be aware they are not breathing properly. Sugden also said prosecutors were unable to prove the heroin sold Jan. 30 was the same as the heroin sold Jan. 31, and could have done so through further testing. In response to Sugden’s statement about quality control, Assistant State’s Attorney John Gibbons said it would have been nearly impossible to do comparative testing because heroin dealers almost always have different product. He said that fact is proven when Linder told Hillier in a recorded phone call that he didn’t have the same stuff as Jan. 30 but had different product he could sell to him. Linder faces 15 to 30 years in prison. Based on previous convictions, he could receive an extended sentence that would result in 30 to 60 years in prison. He will remain in the McHenry County Jail without bond until his sentencing Feb. 24.

Video Photo Women walk past the Sears department store at Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax, Virginia, January 7, 2010. REUTERS/Larry Downing Gary L. Maydew, guest columnist Jan 13, 2017 at 9:05 am | Print View Nostalgia is one of the most powerful (and most irrational) of emotions. Thus it was with both a little sadness and happy remembrance that I read of Sears latest financial struggles, as the CEO gradually sells off the assets and likely closes down the company. The sadness is the disappearance of an icon in retailing. Sears, Roebuck & Co. was a great innovator, beginning in the late 19th century with catalog sales, and extending even to the advent of shopping malls, as it built large retail stores. But ultimately Sears fell victim to other innovators (the big box stores such as Wal-Mart) and later of course the (now internet giants) Amazon, eBay and others. The remembrance (bringing back happy memories) is of the once omnipresence Sears catalogs. As a child growing up in a very rural area, where retail opportunities were limited, both the “Big Book” and the Christmas catalog were eagerly awaited. The big book had scads of things to appeal to a grade schooler. As a farm family, camping had no appeal to our middle-aged parents (why camp out when we were already in the country my father would say). So the camping equipment looked all the more appealing to me. In my mind, I envisioned acquiring the tents, lanterns, portable cook stoves and so on pictured in the catalog, and camping out in high style in the creek. My father also saw no need for garden tractors. We grew a fairly large garden and cultivated it (weeded) with sharpened hoes. No need for anything else. So I lusted after the cool looking garden tractors with the tiny plows, cultivators, and harrows. My sisters and I also looked forward to the clothing in the Big Book. Except for the occasional trip to a “metropolis” of 20,000 people (even stop lights!), we rarely saw any clothes more stylish than those in the local J.C. Penney or McDonalds clothing (no, not the fast food) stores. The Sears clothes were (to us) the epitome of fashions. However, the Big Book, interesting though it was, took a back seat to the almost endless (and endlessly interesting) Sears Christmas catalog! We also looked at, though with less avidity, the catalog from competitor Montgomery Ward. In the 1910s through the 1940s Ward was a strong competitor. But it had begun to fade by the time I was a child. My younger sister was entranced by various dolls and a little later by the Easy Bake ovens and toy refrigerators shown in the Christmas book. An older sister mostly wanted the winter weight sweaters and slacks. I campaigned several years unsuccessfully for a model train, especially for one with a Santa Fe locomotive. Finally, one Christmas I got one. Unfortunately it didn’t work and my parents returned it, exchanging it instead for a small pool table. (They later came to regret that choice as I whiled away time during high school at the local pool hall). So RIP Sears. Hopefully the pictures displayed from Amazon and other internetors on the computer screens will generate as much excitement for grandchildren as the catalogs did for me and my siblings. RIP and know that you were a not insignificant part of the culture of the early Boomers, the silent generation and those earlier generations. • Gary Maydew of Ames is a retired accounting professor at Iowa State University.

Picture: Lowvelder. The survey found the average bribe paid by respondents was a staggering R2 200, an increase of R195 over 2015. Bribery has increased by 2% in South Africa since 2015, with the majority of bribes paid for traffic offences, a new survey has found. The 2016 Ethics Institute of South Africa (Ethics SA) survey comes against the backdrop of recent arrests of traffic officials in Gauteng for bribery and illegally issuing drivers’ licences. The survey found that the public and private sector were close on the bribery scale, but the public sector is leading. The SAPS and the metro police, home affairs and health departments top the public sector list. In the private sector, the top three sectors were construction, mining and security. In 2015, 22% indicated it was not possible to get through everyday life in SA without paying bribes, while in 2016 that figure more than doubled to 49%. The survey was sponsored by Massmart-Walmart and conducted in stores in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape among 4 553 respondents. It found that the average bribe paid by respondents was a staggering R2 200, an increase of R195 over 2015.

In 2015, there were significantly more bribes in the R5 001 to R10 000 category, said Ethics SA. The majority of bribes were paid to evade the consequences of traffic offences – and there was an increase of 2% in this category over last year. The third most common reason, after getting a job, was to get a driver’s licence. Respondents cited various motivational factors for paying bribes, including avoiding a traffic offence, getting a job, getting a driver’s licence, discounts/free goods from businesses and winning tenders. Just under half (49%) of respondents said they had never been asked for a bribe. Ethics SA found that half of the 27% who refused to pay the bribe said it was against their moral or religious principles, while 11% were afraid of the consequences. “Although the public sector was mentioned the most, the private sector was certainly not far behind,” said Ethics SA. The survey also highlighted that people from low-income groups were more vulnerable to bribery, especially for jobs and drivers’ licences, as compared to higher-earning individuals who experienced more tender-related bribery. “The results from the survey are at the very least useful in showing that it is in fact the minority of people who pay bribes, and that many South Africans have strong moral views against bribery,” Ethics SA said.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major US banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of US Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed US retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favour with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions. Tags  Wall Street Dow Jones Nasdaq S&P500 US Market Buy, Hold, Sell ?

By Justin Elliott / ProPublica January 13, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: POD / Flickr Donald Trump ran for president as the billionaire who would champion working people. As the president-elect put it in one of the major economic speeches of his campaign: "Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration." One of the first tests of Trump's pledge to help workers will come in how his administration handles the complicated rules that govern who has the right to time-and-a-half overtime pay. Business groups and Republican state attorneys general sued to stop an Obama administration rule that would expand who gets overtime pay. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in November. Now the Trump administration will decide whether to continue defending the rule in court. At stake is the possibility of overtime pay for about 4 million workers around the country. To get a sense of how big a deal that is: The still-sketchy deal to save factory jobs at a Carrier plant in Indiana — the subject of numerous Trump tweets and extensive media coverage — affected 1,000 or fewer workers. Here's how overtime works now Most employees in the country have the legal right to time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. But there's a major exception to that: white-collar workers. So who qualifies as a white-collar worker? The government has a test for that. To be considered a white-collar worker who does not qualify for overtime pay: You have to be paid a salary and not by the hour. You have to make more than $455 per week — the equivalent of $23,660 per year. And you have to work in certain types of jobs, including executive, administrative or professional positions. That has nothing to do with your title, but rather is defined by the nature of your job. For example, executive employees have to, among other things, supervise other workers. Here are more details on how it all works. Labor advocates say some employers have been playing games with who is considered a white-collar worker. There have been a series of lawsuits and settlements outlining how, for example, the dollar store industry classifies employees as managers to avoid paying overtime. Some workers classified as managers spent much of their time doing the same manual labor as their subordinates. Halliburton in 2015 agreed to pay $18 million in back wages for overtime to about 1,000 employees who worked as pipe recovery specialists and drilling advisers, among other jobs. The company acknowledged it had improperly classified those workers as exempt from the overtime rules. Walmart paid a $4.8 million settlement in 2012 for not paying security guards and other employees overtime they were due. The Obama administration argues that the current overtime salary threshold, which was last raised in 2004 and has been eroded by inflation, is outdated. According to the Department of Labor, in 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers were eligible for overtime based on their pay. That compares to just 7 percent today. The Obama rule would make another 4 million people eligible for overtime The most important change made by the Obama administration was raising the salary threshold below which you generally have the right to overtime pay, regardless of your job duties. The new level — which is currently on hold because of the pending lawsuit — is $913 per week, or $47,476 per year. That's double the old standard of $23,660 per year. The Department of Labor has calculated that the new rule could benefit 4.2 million workers around the country. The affected workers would either start getting overtime for any time worked over 40 hours a week, or their salaries would have to be increased above the new threshold. Business groups opposing the rule, most prominently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that "the salary threshold is going to result in significant new labor costs and cause many disruptions in how work gets done" including by reducing "workplace flexibility, remote electronic access to work, and opportunities for career advancement." Some employers, acting on the expectation that the rule would go into effect, have already raised salaries. The biggest name on the list is Walmart, which bumped starting pay for some managers from $45,000 to $48,500 in order to exempt them from overtime pay. Politico reported that other employers that had promised pay increases, including several universities, have now cancelled the raises in light of the uncertainty around whether the rule will actually go in effect. (Have you heard anything from your employer about overtime changes? Tell us about it.) Trump's pick for labor secretary has attacked the idea of expanding overtime, and the president-elect himself seems skeptical When Trump was asked about the rule in August, he spoke of "a delay or a carve-out of sorts for our small business owners." It's not clear from his comments that Trump actually knew the details of the pending Obama changes. The Trump transition team didn't response to a request for comment. The Department of Justice also declined to comment about what could happen in the lawsuit after Jan. 20. Andrew Puzder, Trump's pick to be secretary of labor and the CEO of a fast-food company, has spoken out strongly against the overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder warned against "rewarding time spent rather than time well spent." "What they lose in overtime pay they gain in the stature and sense of accomplishment that comes from being a salaried manager," Puzder said of workers trying to climb the management ladder. The fate of the rule depends on how things play out in a lawsuit that will drag on past the inauguration In September, business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce along with 21 states sued to block the new overtime rule. In late November, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the rule from going into effect, which was supposed to happen Dec. 1. The judge also signaled he is likely to eventually side with the business groups, though it's not clear when that ruling will come. As of right now, the case is proceeding on two fronts, in both the district court and appeals court. The only thing that's known for sure is the litigation will continue past Jan. 20. At that point, the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the rule or not to appeal any judgment against it. Fearing that outcome, the AFL-CIO is trying to intervene in the case, hoping to continue defending the new rule if the Trump administration drops it. The district court hasn't yet ruled on that motion. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

Listener Peter expects that 20 or so years from now, he will be going into business for himself. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Jan 13, 2017 at 4:32PM In this video from the Motley Fool Answers podcast, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp welcome Sean Gates to the show as they answer listener questions. For this question, the cast considers the case of a forward-thinking young tech worker who has his retirement savings locked down and is now looking ahead to his second career -- as a bar owner. Should he put the money he is saving for that dream into the stock market via a normal brokerage account or pay off his hefty (but low-interest) mortgage? A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 13, 2016. Alison Southwick: This question comes to us from Peter. Peter writes: "I'm a 24-year-old tech worker and my dream is to retire when I'm in my mid-40s and start an e-sports bar one day." He wants to know which option he should pursue. He's basically saying (I'm summarizing this a bit) that he contributes to his 401(k) up to the company match and he also maxes out his Roth IRA. But what he's wondering is if he should put an extra $360,000 per year into non-retirement accounts or if he should put that money against his capital of a 4% mortgage. So he says: "What are the best options if I want to start a bar? Are there any accounts that you can pull money out tax-free if you start a small business?" Robert Brokamp: This is an interesting question. The one thing I would say [is] when you are starting a business, when you pay off your loan, you lose a certain amount of liquidity. You've taken all this money that you had in a brokerage account, you paid off your loan, but now you don't have that money. If you're going to be starting a business, it would seem to me like having that liquidity is pretty important. He's young. He's thinking long term in terms of when he's actually going to need that money, so you'd think over the long term he could earn a return that's higher than his current mortgage. So I would lean toward keeping the mortgage and then investing the money. What do you think, Sean? Sean Gates: Yes, and you're a brother of a different mother, I think, because I have similar goals. I don't have the e-sports thing down, but ... Southwick: Ooh! What do you want to open up? Gates: Well, I just want to be a bum and travel the world. Southwick: Just do nothing? Gates: But, yeah, Bro's point is spot-on in terms of loss of liquidity. I would say it's very clear that in this case you would want to save that money in a taxable brokerage account on the side, and invest that money for this future goal. If you pay down your mortgage, that's locked up. Who's to say that another financial crisis happens and the value of your home goes down and then you're upside down. Actually, I guess he wouldn't be upside down at that point, because he'd be paid off. But the loss of the value of your house. Anyway, I think in this case save the money. Don't pay off the mortgage. Brokamp: And this is a case that I think he could not use a self-directed IRA. Like you couldn't use it to buy your own bar that you are then working in, or could you? Gates: I think in this case you can... Brokamp: You can... Gates: ... because it's an enterprise, and you could set it up like a limited liability corporation, or something, where he got shares in the bar ... Brokamp: Got it. And one of the things that he's clearly worried about is if you take the money out of your retirement accounts before you're age 59 1/2, you could pay taxes and a 10% penalty. But there are, actually, many ways to get around that. It can be for a qualified first-time home purchase. It could be for qualified higher education expenses. These are different, by the way, if it's a 401(k) or an IRA, so you've got to know the rules. But there's also something called "substantially equal periodic payments," which is very complicated. Look into it, though. It is a way for people who are younger than 59 1/2 to get money out of their retirement accounts and not pay that penalty. Gates: And I think a lot of people get trapped in trying to figure out what type of account to save in. A 529 is for education. A 401(k) you max out for the match, and that's for retirement. Is there a business account? When there is just a brokerage account which is a catchall, and it's available at any time, it's a great resource to go to if you have extra money saved there. Because, as you said, it's liquid and there are no penalties associated with it when trying to get it out for the goal that you haven't associated with it. If it's for education, you have to pull it out for education. This account can be for anything. Brokamp: You just want to watch the tax consequences of what you invest in. Maybe favor stocks that don't pay dividends over the stocks that do. Don't do a lot of day trading or short-term trading. Buy a good solid company that doesn't pay a dividend you can hold onto for many years, and you basically don't pay any taxes until you sell. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores <WMT.N> and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook <FB.O>, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

About us Membership Contact us Mon January 16, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia By Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders: We need serious talk on serious issues International January 14, 2017 In my view, the media spends too much time treating politics like a baseball game, a personality contest or a soap opera. We need to focus less on polls, fundraisers, gaffes and who's running for president in four years, and more on the very serious problems facing the American people -- problems which get relatively little discussion. There are a lot of important questions to talk about, including: How do we stop the movement toward oligarchy in our country in which the economic and political life of the United States is increasingly controlled by a handful of billionaires? Are we content with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we are experiencing? Should the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Should one family in this country, the Waltons of the Walmart retail chain, own as much as the bottom 40 percent of our people? Should 52 percent of all new income be going into the pockets of the top 1 percent? While the very rich become much richer, are we satisfied with having the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth? Can a worker really survive on the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour? How can a working-class family afford $15,000 a year for childcare? How can a senior citizen or a disabled veteran get by on $13,000 a year from Social Security? Political system What can be done about a political system in which the very rich are able to spend unlimited sums of money to elect candidates who represent their interests? Is that really what democracy is about? Why, in the year 2017, do we still have state governments trying to suppress the vote and make it harder for poor people, young people and people of color to participate in the political process? Our nation's infrastructure is collapsing and the American people know it. Why is the richest country in the history of the world the only major country not to provide health care to all as a right, despite spending much more per capita? Why are we one of the very few countries on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave? With the five major drug companies making over $50 billion in profits last year, why do we end up paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? How do we succeed in a competitive global economy if we do not have the best educated workforce in the world? And how can we have that quality workforce if so many of our young people are unable to afford higher education or leave school deeply in debt? Not so many years ago, we had the highest percentage of college graduates in the world. Now we don't even rank in the top ten. What can we do to make sure that every American, regardless of income, gets all of the education he or she needs? Meanwhile, on climate change, the debate is over. The scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the entire world. How do we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy while protecting those workers who might lose their jobs as a result of the transition? This is no small issue. The future of the planet is at stake. We are now spending $80 billion a year to imprison 2.2 million Americans, who are disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth, including China, which is home to four times as many people. How do we reform a broken criminal justice system? How do we create jobs and educational opportunity for young people, not more jails and incarceration? Undocumented people We must create a path for the 11 million undocumented people in our country to become lawful permanent residents and eventually citizens.  How can we move our nation toward common sense, humane and comprehensive immigration reform and by doing that help reverse the decline of our middle class and better prepare the United States to compete in the global economy? At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports, levees, dams, schools and housing stock are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. How can we work together to make that happen? These are the issues that need to be talked about all over the country. I thank CNN for allowing us to have a serious discussion about serious issues.

Orlando police Chief John Mina states that the $100,000 reward for Markeith Loyd is for information leading to his arrest. He strongly advises people not to engage with Loyd and "take matters into their own hands." David Harris and Stephanie Allen Contact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Even as Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton lay defenseless on the ground, accused killer Markeith Loyd kept shooting, police Chief John Mina said Thursday. Mina offered new details about Monday's killing as the search for Loyd, now entering its fifth day, expanded into Polk County. Police in Haines City said late Thursday that he has relatives there. Orlando officers found Loyd's pants and shirt, which showed evidence that he had been shot in the chest in an exchange of gunfire with Clayton, Mina revealed. But Loyd was protected by a bulletproof vest. Knowing he was wearing the vest is important for investigators trying to track him down, the chief said. "He's already shown that he's willing to gun down a police officer and continue to shoot that police officer even after [she was] defenseless, so that information is vital when officers go arrest him because they want to go home to their families," Mina said.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Bishop Kelvin Cobaris and Orlando commissioner Regina Hill lead a vigil  to honor the Orlando Police officer killed by an assailant at a Pine Hills Walmart, and an Orange deputy who was killed while responding to the OPD fatality, Tuesday, January 10, 2017. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Police have searched nearly 100 places looking for Loyd and received more than 800 tips on Crimeline. A $100,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to his arrest. Mina said private citizens should not try to find Loyd, 41, on their own. "We don't want people going out there and taking things into their own hands," he said. "They won't get the reward if they do that." Investigators have searched several homes in Lake County and gone door-to-door through an apartment complex in the Rosemont area of Orlando, but Loyd remains on the loose.

Zarghee Mayan gave the hungry Loyd some free food Saturday,... (Caitlin Doornbos) Detectives arrested three people this week who are accused of helping Loyd avoid arrest before Clayton was killed. He had been wanted since Dec. 13, when investigators accused him of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24. Clayton was trying to capture him when she was slain. Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, and his ex-girlfriend, Jameis Slaughter, each faces a charge of accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. Prosecutors argued that Smith-Loyd's case was the more egregious, saying she is a flight risk who might know where Loyd is hiding. She is accused of trying to pick up money for her uncle, records show. A judge set her bail at $750,000. Slaughter, prosecutors allege, was in constant contact with Loyd after Dixon's death and drove to the Wal-Mart and circled the parking lot not long after Clayton was killed. Detectives also arrested Loyd's former employer, Zarghee Mayan, Tuesday on the same charge. They say he saw Loyd wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a pistol two days before Clayton was killed but didn't contact law officers. Barb Bergin, Central Florida Crimeline executive director, urged anyone who knows where Loyd is to come forward. "You need to make the phone call," she said. "Tell us where we can find Markeith Loyd now so we can end this." Memorials for Clayton and Orange County Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, who was killed in a crash on his motorcycle while responding to the manhunt Monday, have popped up across Orlando. Visitations and funeral services for both are planned for this week. A public viewing for Lewis was Thursday night at First Baptist Orlando on John Young Parkway. His funeral will be Friday at 11 a.m. at the same church. Clayton's visitation is Friday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Her funeral is 2 p.m. Saturday. Both also are at First Baptist Orlando.

(AP Photo/Jonathan Bachman) About 25 teams – including the Lakers – would likely trade their roster for Minnesota's, which is loaded with prospects like Karl-Anthony Towns (pictured), Andrew Wiggins, Zach Lavine, Gorgui Dieng, Kris Dunn and Shabazz Muhammad. (AP Photo/Jonathan Bachman) By MARK HEISLER / CONTRIBUTING WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Once upon a time, the Lakers wouldn’t even say “rebuilding.” Rudy Tomjanovich, their coach – briefly – after trading Shaquille O’Neal, called it the R-word before fleeing midway through a season in which they went 34-48. Now all you hear about is the Lakers’ rebuilding project that’s – finally – underway. Rebuilding is what any team is doing, or should be, if it’s not challenging for a title. On the other hand, there are owners who talk about contending but are really content to bank profits such as Denver’s Stan Kroenke. Kroenke, of course, also owns the Rams. Since it’s even easier to make money without winning in the NFL, his fans shouldn’t expect much. Rebuilding is about talent and the ability, or luck, it takes to acquire it, like having the No. 1 pick in 2015 (Karl-Anthony Towns) rather than 2013 (Anthony Bennett). Mostly it’s about leadership from the owner to the front-office people he or she hires to the coach. This is why good teams tend to stay good ... and the bozos tend to stay bozos. Starting with the non-playoff teams in the West, for the first time anywhere, the R-Word Rankings: 1. Minnesota – The T-Wolves don’t look like much at No. 13, trailing even the Lakers going into the weekend. Nevertheless, about 25 teams – including the Lakers – would trade their roster for one loaded with prospects such as Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Zach Lavine, Gorgui Dieng, Kris Dunn and Shabazz Muhammad. Coach Tom Thibodeau, one of the league’s top defensive coaches, turned around a less-imposing Bulls team overnight, taking the 41-41 club he inherited from Vinny Del Negro to 62-20. Young as the T-Wolves are, they’re coming from the No. 23 defense last season under Sam Mitchell to No. 7 in their past 15 games. So watch out from here. 2. New Orleans – Like the Timberwolves, just with worse luck, more injuries, less depth and no leadership. You’ve got to like a team that has Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans and made the playoffs two seasons ago. The problem is leadership, beginning with 88-year-old owner Tom Benson, who disowned his daughter and grandchildren – who then unsuccessfully challenged his mental competence in court – in favor of his third wife. Talented as the Pelicans are, there’s the matter of depth. There is none. Someone forgot to get any. 3. Lakers – After years of pinning their hopes to an injury-prone Kobe then spending a season dedicated to his farewell, they’re finally rebuilding! If there’s an obvious question – What kept you? – their prospects were in an even earlier stage of development ... embryonic ... than they are now with Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell and Brandon Ingram flashing their promise. Despite speculation about a front-office shakeup, I don’t have leadership as one of their problems compared to teams on this list, most of whom are perpetually rebuilding. It took several hires to get to Coach Luke Walton, but he’s perfect for his job, bringing the modern offense he learned in Golden State while keeping hope alive. GM Mitch Kupchak is a professional who rebuilt the post-Shaq Lakers and has drafted well in this cycle. It remains to be seen how they finish, if someone has to take the hit for it beyond Jim Buss, who’s merely ornamental, and if that’s Kupchak. If Mitch goes, you’d have to wonder how much of Lakers tradition – they’ve never canned a GM – goes with him. It comes down on Jeanie Buss, who is new in her job but well-suited to it. She’s not a basketball expert but knows it. Her father wasn’t either, communicating his vision but letting his professionals execute it. The answer to most questions in Lakerdom at the moment is, “They’re young.” Nevertheless, their good nights, at least, suggest there may come a time for them. Just don’t expect it to be soon. 4. Sacramento – The Kings’ hopes and fears can each be summed up in the same two words: DeMarcus Cousins. The game’s best center, he’s 6-foot-11 and 292 pounds worth of technical-foul incurring, suspension-prone, authority-challenging trouble on his sixth coach in seven seasons in which their best finish was 33-49. On the floor he can do anything. Off it he will do anything. The Sacramento Bee just put out a mix tape of him haranguing writers from various outlets. Then there’s fledgling owner Vivek Ranadive who showed up thinking he knew it all – after making a study of the game while coaching his daughter’s elementary school team – and is on his fourth coach in four seasons. Ranadive has toyed with trading Cousins on several occasions, including this fall when O’Neal – a minority owner – said he was “hearing talk” that DeMarcus would be dealt. Instead, Cousins has just reportedly agreed to a five-year, $207 million extension, ending Ranadive’s fear that DeMarcus would walk in 2018 leaving them with nothing. If this isn’t a no-win situation, it’s too close for comfort. With the Kings a heady No. 9 in the West, if only on a 34-win pace, it remains to be seen if they can build on this or if DeMarcus remains DeMarcus and ends up somewhere else by 2020, leaving them to start over yet again. There could actually be a happy ending. I just can’t imagine it. 5. Denver – Another civic embarrassment courtesy of Kroenke. Did I mention the family fortune comes from Stan’s wife, Ann, the daughter of Bud Walton, the brother of Wal-Mart magnate Sam? In Wal-Mart style, Stan ran the Nuggets so thriftily, the front office dwindled to a precious few in 2013 when GM Masai Ujiri, the reigning executive of the year, fled to Toronto. The Nuggets have a core of young players such as Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler plus Euro-centers Nikola Jokic and Jusuf Nurkic but, alas, no stars. Did I mention they have the No. 29 payroll? Well, at least they’re good (ka-ching!) at something. 6. Phoenix – Bob Sarver, a San Diego banker, said he would sit back and let the Colangelo family continue running the Suns after buying the team from them in 2004. Instead, Sarver went from involved to meddlesome, prompting the Colangelos’ departure and heralding the Suns’ descent from their Steve Nash-Mike D’Antoni heyday. They haven’t made the playoffs since 2010 and have few enough prospects to show for it (Devin Booker, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender, Alen Len) after repeated fresh starts. GM Ryan McDonough was considered a comer after the team went 48-34 in his first season. Unfortunately, in his second, he traded Isaiah Thomas to the Celtics for Marcus Thornton and the draft pick that became Chriss, building a power, in Boston. 7. Dallas – Management, they’ve got. Memories, they’ve got. Prospects, they don’t got. Owner Mark Cuban did an amazing job, refusing to break up his aging team that caught lightning in a bottle as a No. 3 seed in the 2011 playoffs, winning the Mavericks’ only title. Coach Rick Carlisle brilliantly managed them, posting seven 50-win seasons, the last one two years ago. Unfortunately, like the Lakers they knocked off in 2011, you have to get old sometime. Last season, the Mavs fell to 42 wins. Now they’re on track for 24 with more 30-plus veterans such as Dirk Nowitzki, Deron Williams, Anthony Bogut and Wes Matthews than young guys they can build around such as Harrison Barnes. This is what square one looks like and it’s a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.

(AP) — Federal authorities say a man charged in the 1999 abduction and sexual assault of a southern Indiana girl assumed the identity of a car crash victim and lived for years in Minnesota and Oregon until he was arrested this week. Investigators tracked down 61-year-old Charles Hollin to Salem, Ore., after he was identified through facial recognition software of his passport photograph, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said Friday at a news conference. Hollin faces federal charges of identity theft and fleeing prosecution, with court documents saying he had disappeared from southern Indiana’s Jackson County by the time prosecutors filed charges in early 2000 against him in the abduction and assault of a 10-year-old girl. Hollin assumed the identity of Andrew David Hall, who was 8 years old when he died due to a 1975 crash in Fayette County, Kentucky, and was buried in southern Indiana, according to an FBI affidavit. Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan in 1999 and a person using Hall’s identity obtained a Minnesota driver’s license in 2001 before moving to Oregon in 2011. Minkler said FBI agents had reviewed Hollin’s disappearance frequently over the years without success until linking him to the photograph with the passport in Hall’s name. “Facial recognition technology, clearly, was the break in the case that we were looking for,” Minkler said. “It is a tremendous law enforcement technique used to bring people to justice.” Hollin was arrested at a Wal-Mart store in Salem where he worked and admitted his true identity, federal officials said. Minkler said he didn’t know whether Hollin had family in Oregon and that investigators would be checking for any similar unsolved crimes in Minnesota and Oregon. Hollin was being brought to Indiana on Friday by federal agents and will be turned over to Jackson County authorities soon to face prosecution on felony charges of child molestation and confinement, Minkler said. Court records didn’t list an attorney for Hollin who could comment on his behalf. Hollin is charged with abducting the child at knifepoint from outside a Seymour girl’s club in 1999, taking her to a secluded area and molesting her before leaving her naked along an isolated road about 50 miles south of Indianapolis. DNA tests linked Hollin to the attack, according to court documents. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted of the most serious of the charges. Jackson County Prosecutor AmyMarie Travis said the victim’s father told her that his daughter was doing well and was relieved by Hollin’s arrest. “I, of course, was concerned about how it would affect her mentally and emotionally to reopen these type of wounds,” Travis said. “But he said the main emotion that he noticed in her was relief.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Investigators tracked down 61-year-old Charles Hollin to Salem, Oregon, after he was identified through facial recognition software of his passport photograph, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said Friday at a news conference. Hollin faces federal charges of identity theft and fleeing prosecution, with court documents saying he had disappeared from southern Indiana's Jackson County by the time prosecutors filed charges in early 2000 against him in the abduction and assault of a 10-year-old girl. He is also charged with abducting the child at knifepoint from outside a Seymour girl's club in 1999, taking her to a secluded area and molesting her before leaving her naked along an isolated road about 50 miles south of Indianapolis. DNA tests linked Hollin to the attack, according to court documents. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted of the most serious of the charges. Hollin assumed the identity of Andrew David Hall, who was 8 years old when he died due to a 1975 crash in Fayette County, Kentucky, and was buried in southern Indiana, according to an FBI affidavit. Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan in 1999 and a person using Hall's identity obtained a Minnesota driver's license in 2001 before moving to Oregon in 2011. Minkler said FBI agents had reviewed Hollin's disappearance frequently over the years without success until linking him to the photograph with the passport in Hall's name. "Facial recognition technology, clearly, was the break in the case that we were looking for," Minkler said. "It is a tremendous law enforcement technique used to bring people to justice." Hollin was arrested at a Wal-Mart store in Salem where he worked and admitted his true identity, federal officials said. Minkler said he didn't know whether Hollin had family in Oregon and that investigators would be checking for any similar unsolved crimes in Minnesota and Oregon. Hollin was being brought to Indiana on Friday by federal agents and will be turned over to Jackson County authorities soon to face prosecution on felony charges of child molestation and confinement, Minkler said.

Amazon seeks to run wireless tests in Washington state Posted Jan 13, 2017 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton is now Snapchat’s chairman According to documents unearthed by Business Insider, Amazon Corporate has sought permission from the FCC to run tests of wireless technology prototypes in and around one of its facilities in Seattle, and outdoors in Kennewick, Washington, for unspecified purposes. The person who filed the request on behalf of the e-commerce and IT giant, Neil Woodward, is a former NASA astronaut, now a senior manager in charge of flight test and certification for Amazon Prime Air. The wireless test request could be related to Amazon’s preparations to start drone deliveries in the U.S. Or they could indicate that Amazon is building new communications systems for use in physical security, or data gathering from the company’s considerable infrastructure. Woodward was involved in other infrastructure and security projects during his earlier years at Amazon. That said, Amazon has already embarked on drone deliveries in England. U.K. regulations were sorted ahead of U.S. regulations where commercial drone flights were concerned, which helped to make that possible. Since the U.S. established its own Part 107 rules governing the use of small, unmanned aerial systems for commercial and industrial purposes domestically, back in August, companies have been making moves. Amazon’s competitor Wal-Mart plans to use drones to monitor warehouse inventory in the U.S. this quarter. And recently, 7-Eleven started on-demand drone delivery from stores to homes in Reno, Nevada, using the services of Flirtey, a venture-backed drone delivery startup. The companies are expanding their partnership this year. On another front, Facebook is working to make safety improvements to its internet-beaming, solar drone, the Aquila. The FCC application from Amazon states: “The proposed operations will be limited in scope.

(AP) — Federal authorities say a man charged in the 1999 abduction and sexual assault of a southern Indiana girl assumed the identity of a car crash victim and lived for years in Minnesota and Oregon until he was arrested this week. Investigators tracked down 61-year-old Charles Hollin to Salem, Oregon, after he was identified through facial recognition software of his passport photograph, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said Friday at a news conference. Hollin faces federal charges of identity theft and fleeing prosecution, with court documents saying he had disappeared from southern Indiana's Jackson County by the time prosecutors filed charges in early 2000 against him in the abduction and assault of a 10-year-old girl. Hollin assumed the identity of Andrew David Hall, who was 8 years old when he died due to a 1975 crash in Fayette County, Kentucky, and was buried in southern Indiana, according to an FBI affidavit. Hollin obtained an $80,000 home equity loan in 1999 and a person using Hall's identity obtained a Minnesota driver's license in 2001 before moving to Oregon in 2011. Minkler said FBI agents had reviewed Hollin's disappearance frequently over the years without success until linking him to the photograph with the passport in Hall's name. "Facial recognition technology, clearly, was the break in the case that we were looking for," Minkler said. "It is a tremendous law enforcement technique used to bring people to justice." Hollin was arrested at a Wal-Mart store in Salem where he worked and admitted his true identity, federal officials said. Minkler said he didn't know whether Hollin had family in Oregon and that investigators would be checking for any similar unsolved crimes in Minnesota and Oregon. Hollin was being brought to Indiana on Friday by federal agents and will be turned over to Jackson County authorities soon to face prosecution on felony charges of child molestation and confinement, Minkler said. Court records didn't list an attorney for Hollin who could comment on his behalf. Hollin is charged with abducting the child at knifepoint from outside a Seymour girl's club in 1999, taking her to a secluded area and molesting her before leaving her naked along an isolated road about 50 miles south of Indianapolis. DNA tests linked Hollin to the attack, according to court documents. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted of the most serious of the charges. Jackson County Prosecutor AmyMarie Travis said the victim's father told her that his daughter was doing well and was relieved by Hollin's arrest. "I, of course, was concerned about how it would affect her mentally and emotionally to reopen these type of wounds," Travis said. "But he said the main emotion that he noticed in her was relief."
