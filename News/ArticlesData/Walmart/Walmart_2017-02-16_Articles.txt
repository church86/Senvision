(Register file photo) LEONARD ORTIZ, , LEONARD ORTIZ, ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER By NANCY LUNA / Staff Writer Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF As leases approach expiration dates, negotiations are not looking good for some restaurants. Some are closing and relocating to more affordable locations, while others are bidding goodbye to underperforming locations. In Irvine and Newport Beach, two power lunch restaurants, Il Barone and Prego Ristorante, have announced plans to relocate to new locations. Il Barone is taking over a high-profile location left vacant by a Coco’s in Newport Beach. Coco’s is among several casual dining chains – a restaurant segment still struggling in a post-Great Recession world – shuttering locations in Orange County. Here’s the latest closure round up: • Chili’s Grill & Bar, at 17071 Beach Blvd. in Huntington Beach, closed in late January. According to public notices filed with the state, the closure is permanent and impacts 46 employees. Brinker International, the parent company of Chili’s, did not provide a reason for the closure. • TGI Friday’s in Yorba Linda plans to close March 6. An employee answering the phone at the Savi Ranch retail center restaurant said its last day will be March 5. The restaurant, at 23040 Eastpark Drive, employs 42 workers, according to a state filing. “The decision to close the location was purely a business decision and we will offer the majority (of) team members the opportunity to work at our other TGIF restaurants in the area,” a restaurant executive said in a statement. • Two McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores in Huntington Beach and Laguna Niguel recently closed. A representative for McDonald's in Southern California said the decision to close at the end of a lease is up to the franchisee. Other McDonald's locations continue to operate inside Walmart stores in Southern California, McDonald’s said. • The demise of Carrows and Coco’s restaurants in Orange County continues. The Carrows at 28502 Marguerite Pkwy. in Mission Viejo has been converted to a Coco’s. As a result of the rebrand, the Coco's at 27750 Crown Valley Pkwy. in Mission Viejo has closed permanently, said Mike Griffith, a representative for Catalina Restaurant Group. The company, acquired two years ago by Food Management Partners, operates both Coco’s and Carrows brands. Griffith said there are no plans to reopen Carrows anywhere else. With the closure of Carrows in Mission Viejo, there are none left in Orange County. Last week, a Coco’s at 900 Bristol St. North in Newport Beach closed. The coffee house is being converted into Il Barone, a popular Italian restaurant relocating from another site in the city. CLICK HERE to read more about Il Barone’s relocation. • Prego Ristorante, a mainstay for three decades in Irvine, will serve its last meal at its Irvine Towers location Feb. 26. The owners of the three-decade-old restaurant said they were unable to “come to an agreement on the terms” of a new lease with the landlord, the Irvine Company. The owners are planning to relocate the restaurant. CLICK HERE to read more. • Taco Jr. in Costa Mesa recently closed. It will be replaced by Taco Brat, a taqueria/sausage house by Thomas Curren. The veteran chef has spent a career working for a variety of venues from Aubergine to Pinkberry to Umami Burger. The menu will feature “haus-made” sausages, tacos, home-cured bacon and German and Mexican beers. The restaurant is at 2101 Harbor Blvd. • Mare Culinary Lounge by Alessandro Pirozzi has closed in Laguna Beach. An employee answering the phone at Mare this week said the restaurant, located at the Holiday Inn on S. Coast Highway, is open only for private events. This week, OpenTable said “Mare Culinary Lounge will no longer be part of the OpenTable network.” In an email, chef and owner Pirozzi said the “current hotel owner did not extend our Mare lease.” He said he could not comment any further. Pirozzi is best known for launching the Cucina Alessa-branded restaurants in Orange County. Pirozzi, a native of Naples, developed Alessa from his grandmother’s recipes. After debuting Cucina Alessa in Newport Beach in 2008, Pirozzi opened one in Huntington Beach in 2009 and the Laguna location in 2010. Pirozzi “severed” ties with the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach restaurants in late 2012. Those restaurants still go by the name Cucina Alessa. He operates Alessa in Laguna Beach. He also owns Pirozzi, a pasta and pizza bistro in Corona del Mar. In December, Pirozzi took over the shuttered Salerno restaurant in Laguna Beach. • Shinkou Sushi & Poke in Laguna Hills closed in late January. The restaurant posted a closure note on its Facebook page, thanking customers for their loyalty since it opened nearly six years ago. “It is a bittersweet feeling. We are sad and yet excited for the future adventures await. We thank you all again for your patronage and love,” the restaurant wrote. Owner Veronica Hananto said a few factors contributed to the closure, including the inability to negotiate a new lease in a timely manner and the loss of key employees. Address: 24881 Alicia Parkway, Laguna Hills. • The Gypsy Den at Center Street Promenade in Anaheim has closed. It has been rebranded as Center Street Tavern. The owner, who owns all Gypsy Den locations, described the modern tavern as a zero attitude hangout serving classic beers, elevated wines and simple cocktails.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Ashley Lutz Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just sold off $900 million of Walmart stock, choosing to invest billions in airline stocks instead. The sale, which leaves Buffett with nearly no shares in Walmart, comes as America’s largest traditional retailer has been rushing to catch up to Amazon and other online competitors. Amazon’s market value is now $356 billion, compared with Walmart’s $298 billion. Buffett last year acknowledged that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were struggling in the face of competition from the e-commerce giant. “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,” Buffett said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Buffet’s been paring his stake in Walmart since then. He first bought shares in the retailer back in 2005. The 86-year-old billionaire also noted that Amazon’s competitors, “including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.” Former Walmart CEO Mike Duke admitted in 2012 that his biggest regret as CEO was not investing more in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon. “I wish we had moved faster. We’ve proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn’t move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce,” Duke said at the time. “Right now we’re making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area.” Walmart’s online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon’s $107 billion. Buffett’s retail instincts have proven correct before when he correctly predicted the downfall of Sears and Kmart in 2005. “Retailing is like shooting at a moving target,” Buffett said. “Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Justin Barkley, 38, arrived in Tompkins County Supreme Court on Wednesday morning to argue against his mother’s request for guardianship. Linda Edwards, Barkley’s mother, filed a petition with the court in January requesting custody of her son and the ability to make legal decisions for him, The Sun previously reported. Barkley is “totally unable to speak realistically, accurately or coherently about the situation which he faces,” his mother said in the petition, noting that he had been ruled incompetent to stand the murder trial by two psychiatrists. In addition to requesting the ability to make legal decisions for her son, Edwards also asked for the power to make medical decisions for Barkley and manage his financial assets.

He is being held at Tompkins County Jail without the option for bail. In a handwritten letter sent by Barkley to the court, he requested a jury trial in the custody case and asked that the judge appoint an attorney to defend him. “I do not want the counsel to have permission to inspect my medical, psychological or psychiatric records,” Barkley wrote in the letter.

Judge Guy denied Van Houten’s request to observe the guardianship proceedings, saying the district attorney’s presence might have a “chilling effect” on Barkley’s ability to freely testify in opposition to his mother’s guardianship request, Van Houten said, adding that he disagreed with but respected the judge’s decision. Ithaca Police Department Justin Barkley, 38, is facing two misdemeanor charges from August in addition to a murder charge from December Documents from Lansing Town Court raise new questions about the mental health status of Barkley, who in December claimed he had killed President Donald Trump outside of Walmart and who has been ruled incompetent to stand trial by two psychiatrists. Barkley is facing two misdemeanor charges — menacing and falsely reporting a crime — for allegedly punching and choking a store clerk at the Triphammer Marketplace on Aug. 26, according to court documents that have not been previously reported. The alleged assault occurred a little more than three months before Schumacher was killed at Walmart. Less than an hour after the murder, Barkley drove away from police and holed up in his house with a rifle, commencing an hours-long standoff with police before he ultimately surrendered. A manager at Planted Earth said a man entered the hydroponics and garden supply shop at Triphammer Marketplace on Aug. 26 claiming he had lost his wallet, but then began punching the manager and accusing him of raping his girlfriend, according to a statement given to State Police under penalty of perjury. “I came out from behind the counter to help the man find his wallet when he started yelling at me telling me not to touch his girlfriend again,” the manager said in the deposition. “The man punched me, he grabbed me, we struggled back and forth falling to the ground where he got me in a choke hold with his arm around my neck.” After trying to choke the manager, the man called 911 and spoke with an operator before leaving the store and riding away on a white Harley Davidson motorcycle, the manager said in the deposition. “While we were struggling the man said something about me tieing up his girlfriend and raping her in the store,” the manager said. “I don’t know who this man is or why he thinks I touched his girlfriend.” A State Police officer said in a complaint that Barkley called 911 claiming his girlfriend was being raped and assaulted by the store clerk before screaming “send help” and hanging up. The officer says Barkley’s claims were entirely false. Attorney Michael Perehinec, who is representing Barkley in Lansing Town Court, said the case has not been dismissed but was put on hold after Barkley was charged with the Walmart murder. Asked about the misdemeanor charges and the incident at Planted Earth, District Attorney Van Houten said the Lansing case is “on hold” as Barkley deals with the murder charge, but that prosecutors are aware of the case and have spoken with people involved. “Those people that interacted with him are people that we have on record and we will continue to communicate with them as it becomes necessary,” Van Houten told The Sun. “Everything that [Barkley] has done that we can document is relevant to evaluating his mental health.” Judge John Rowley, who is presiding over the murder case, said in January that prosecutors are doing “a disservice to the public” by maintaining that Barkley is competent despite the two psychiatrists’ evaluations otherwise. “Your evaluation is that he’s competent based on nothing,” Rowley said to a prosecutor in January. Van Houten said in January that Barkley would be undergoing a more thorough psychiatric evaluation at a secure mental health facility. The district attorney also said he was confident Barkley would be found competent to stand trial and said he was comfortable prosecuting the case even if Barkley still believed he had killed Donald Trump. Attorney James Baker, who is defending Barkley in the Walmart murder case, did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday.

Related Mother of Accused Walmart Murderer Requests Guardianship, Power to Make Legal Decisions By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs January 20, 2017 Edwards, in her petition, said she is suitable to act as Barkley’s guardian because she “has been his mother and intimately involved in his life. Of all of the available and willing people to carry out this function, she is the most familiar with his needs and assets.” Judge Says Prosecution Is Doing ‘a Disservice to the Public’ in Walmart Murder Case By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs January 19, 2017 The flub occurred because a court clerk did not scan the back of one of the psychiatric examiners’ forms, on which the examiner had clarified that Barkley was incompetent to assist in his own defense, District Attorney Matthew Van Houten told reporters.

Tim Wetzel, KHOU 8:51 PM. CST February 15, 2017 A Walmart customer shops using a handheld scanner on Wednesday in a new prototype store located in Tomball.  (Photo: KHOU 11 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HARRIS COUNTY, Texas - Walmart is testing out a prototype store in the Woodlands-Tomball area that allows customers to skip traditional check-out lanes. The store, located at 25800 Kuykendahl Road, held its grand opening Wednesday morning. "When you walk into the store, you can grab a handheld scanner or download the 'scan and go' app," explains Walmart spokeswoman, Anne Hatfield. "You walk around the store, scan the bar code and shop as you go." When they are done shopping, customers can simply show the device to an employee, pay and walk out. "It's saving customer's time and is an easier way to do things," said Hatfield. The store also contains traditional check-out lanes and an option to order items online in advance and then pick them up curbside. It is one of only two prototype stores in the country, the other location is in Florida. "What we learn here from the Tomball store, we will use in stores throughout the country," said Hatfield. The design of the new store is also different, the interior is brighter and seems more modern. "It's a nice little concept," said shopper Hector Diaz. "It kind of gets me in and out faster." Walmart officials say if more customers like the design, it will be used in more stores nationwide.

Marina Strauss RETAILING REPORTER — Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 12:01AM EST Last updated Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 12:01AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print A small-business group has won lower merchant fees for its members from MasterCard Canada, a move that could put more pressure on credit-card firms to reduce their rates and prompt other associations to seek preferential pricing. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents more than 100,000 small firms, is set to unveil on Thursday a deal with MasterCard that will reduce most of CFIB members’ transaction fees to levels that are now offered to just a small number of the country’s largest merchants, those with annual MasterCard sales of $3-billion or more. It will mean that, starting on April 3, most members’ interchange fees for regular credit cards will drop by 12.5 per cent to 1.26 per cent of the value of a customer’s purchase from 1.44 per cent currently. Those rates will decrease by 22 per cent for premium credit cards – to 1.38 per cent from 1.77 per cent – and by 7.8 per cent for ultrapremium plastic, to 1.9 per cent from 2.06 per cent. The initiative comes amid rising pressure from retailers and other businesses for lower credit-card fees, highlighted last summer when discount behemoth Wal-Mart Canada Corp. stopped accepting Visa cards in Thunder Bay and Manitoba, complaining that the fees were “unacceptably high.” In January, Wal-Mart and Visa came to an agreement that ended the dispute, although neither side has disclosed the details of their deal. In the latest CFIB-MasterCard agreement, “what this shows is that the landscape has changed,” Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, said in an interview. In the past, “merchants have felt rather powerless in terms of influencing the rates that they pay. But in the last few years, with a lot of leadership from the credit-card industry, from the payments industry and some help from government, things have changed an awful lot.” CFIB’s move to get better rates for its members marks a new front in the credit-card-fee battle. Individual companies, such as retail giants Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp., have reached their own deals with Visa and MasterCard, respectively, for some breaks. But associations have not secured their own interchange fees for their members collectively. Indeed, CFIB and other groups have raised concerns that the deals for the big companies could lead to higher costs for smaller businesses. The CFIB-MasterCard agreement now opens the door for other associations to follow suit, said Richard Crone of payments specialist Crone Consulting LLC in San Carlos, Calif. The credit-card companies “will be deluged by others trying to do the same,” Mr. Crone predicted. He wasn’t aware of any other association that has got preferential interchange fees. (Groups have secured preferential payment processor fees, which retailers also pay, but those are much lower than the interchange fees.) But he also said the fees that CFIB won are just “token reductions” and still not close to the 0.3-per-cent rates that have been regulated in other markets, such as in Europe. Brian Lang, president of MasterCard Canada, said offering a special interchange fee for an association sets a precedent in Canada. “Will there be more of them? Maybe, we’ll see how things go.” He said interchange fees in Canada are the lowest among markets such as the United States, South America and the Asia-Pacific region – everywhere except in Europe and Australia. He said higher rates are needed so the companies can invest in electronic-commerce innovation. “When rates are dropped down, it stifles that innovation,” he said. MasterCard came to an agreement with CFIB because its members are an important engine of the Canadian economy and the shift to electronic payments, he said. As well, the deal helps MasterCard honour its commitment to the federal government that it would reduce interchange fees to 1.5 per cent on average. Last September, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government would review the fees charged by the credit card networks and the effects of the fee reductions. Visa and MasterCard agreed in 2014 to lower their interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years, starting in 2015, from 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively, thus avoiding having Ottawa set rates. Both firms have said their audits have showed they’re in compliance, although they have not released the audits themselves. The Small Business Matters Coalition is pushing Ottawa to institute a 0.3-per-cent interchange fee. “We want the rate that is in force in other jurisdictions,” said Gary Sands, the coalition’s chairman. The Retail Council of Canada is also pushing for lower rates. Mr. Kelly said some of CFIB’s grocery and gas station members already have lower fees than its newly negotiated rates because of the categories they fit into under MasterCard’s rules. But the vast majority of CFIB members, which include some individual Canadian Tire, Home Hardware and Merry Maid franchisees, will benefit from the new agreement, he said.

They smashed a van through the store's south wall and left in a second vehicle. The van that was left behind was found to have been stolen out of Cleveland Heights. It was used in a similar incident in Beachwood the previous day, in which an ATM was stolen from a BP gas station. Counterfeiting, Warrensville Center Road: A man said Feb. 5 an employee of his business received a counterfeit $20 bill as part of his change from a purchase he made at Walmart. Officers spoke to the Walmart staff and were told the only way the bill would have made it into the cash register would be if a customer paid with it and there would be no way to trace it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee reported Feb. 6 a habitual thief tried to steal 30 cans of baby formula, but fled from the store when asked to see a receipt. He said the Cleveland woman, 35, is known to Walmart employees because of a company-wide notification banning her from all stores. He said she has attempted to steal $5,000 worth of merchandise from at least ten Walmart stores in the last five years. Officers did not locate the woman. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: An East Cleveland woman, 25, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 9 for the suspected theft of cell phone cases, valued at a total of $138.96. In the presence of her 12-year-old sister, she told officers she was 17-years-old. She was charged with theft, resisting arrest, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and obstructing official business. Her sister never denied the false information she provided and also contributed to her providing it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Maple Heights boy, 14, was suspected of the theft of $128.88 worth of merchandise from Walmart Feb. 9. His mother was in the store with him and was unaware that he was shoplifting. Charges will be filed in juvenile court. Fraud, Winston Road: A resident reported Feb. 8 there was about $1,000 in unauthorized charges on his bank account. He knew at least two purchases were made online. His bank is investigating. Stolen vehicle, South Belvoir Boulevard: A woman reported Feb. 9 her vehicle was stolen out of her driveway sometime during the overnight hours. It has been locked and was taken without keys. Burglary, Suffolk Road: A woman reported at 4:56 p.m. Feb. 9 two unknown males kicked in her front door, but fled when they saw her in the home. She said they left in an older model white pick-up truck. Responding officers did not locate the truck. Several similar incidents have recently been reported in the city. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights woman, 29, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 3 for the suspected theft of $284 worth of merchandise. Among the items she failed to pay for at the self-checkout were men's underwear and socks; food, medication and health and beauty items. Found property, South Belvoir Boulevard: A man turned in to police a rifle magazine with 22 rounds of ammunition Feb. 8 that he said was located in the grass median while he was supervising an adult community service cleanup. It was believed it had been recently dropped or thrown where it was found, due to its new condition. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 33, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 7 after he was seen cutting open merchandise packaging and concealing items in his clothing. He was found in possession of two box cutters. He was charged with theft and possession of criminal tools and it was learned he was recently released from jail, stemming from a prior theft offense.

Hot Topics: Missing mother, child Frog Belly Farm cleanup Longmont home prices double AG sues Boulder County Airport noise News tips Longmont police arrest man who allegedly head-butted Walmart manager By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   02/15/2017 04:29:43 PM MST Updated:   02/15/2017 07:03:39 PM MST Longmont police take Dustin Robinson-Beaty into custody at the north Longmont Walmart on Wednesday afternoon after a report of a manager being assaulted. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer) After a man became agitated at Longmont's north Walmart on Wednesday afternoon, customer Roman Avila's instinct was to stop him by tackling him. "I always tell myself I would do that if it happened, and it happened," Avila said. Police identified the man as Dustin Robinson-Beaty, 23, who they arrested outside the north entrance of Walmart, 2514 Main St.. Police said when store managers approached his camper that had been parked for several days, they told him to leave and he began yelling obscenities. Cmdr. Joel Post said police believe Robinson-Beaty followed the managers back through the parking lot to the store, where he began throwing things at the employees and another manager approached. He then reportedly head-butted the female manager, possibly breaking her nose. Avila, of Longmont, said he was checking out after shopping and noticed the argument turn physical. "I tackled him and held him down on the ground until the cops got here," he said. A manager standing outside the store said to him, "It could've gotten a whole lot worse." They handed him a $50 gift card for his help and directed customers to use the south entrance. Post said officers used a Taser when Robinson-Beaty resisted being taken into custody. He was transported to Longmont United Hospital for medical clearance. Charges are pending, but could include assault, trespass, harassment and resisting arrest. Post said there is no indication that Robinson-Beaty was under the influence. Advertisement At the same Walmart in March 2016, a customer intervened after an officer was attacked in the store by a 44-year-old man. Campers in retail parking lots have been an issue in Longmont recently, as the Longmont JCPenney said it would deal with campers and lived-in vehicles staying overnight in its parking lot in January.

Photo: Bob Finnan, Associated Press Business News Roundup, Feb. 16 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Apple looks for iPhone supplier Apple is in discussions with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for iPhones, a key component that has been provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said. Apple has been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it will add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to $14.5 billion building two plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the phone’s debut.

The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Walmart says Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay in Michigan. Walmart, which is trying to better compete with Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce company with strong industry relationships. Walmart also purchased marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Walmart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. Economy Consumer prices jump U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Labor Department said Wednesday that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, the most since February 2013 and twice what economists were expecting. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent. Food prices rose in January for the first time in seven months. Grocery prices were unchanged, but the cost of eating out rose 0.4 percent. The price of clothing, new cars, auto insurance and air fares all rose by 0.8 percent or more in January. Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the most since March 2012. Core inflation rose 2.3 percent over the last 12 months. Construction Home builders less confident Home builders are feeling a bit less confident this month, reflecting a dimmer outlook on sales in the months ahead and fewer would-be buyers dropping by builders’ sales offices. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday fell to 65 this month. That’s down two points from a revised reading of 67 in January. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has been above 60 since September and reached the highest level in 11 years in December.

Tweet Email Print Favorite Saving… Share Ask a Mexican!  By Gustavo Arellano click to enlarge Dear Mexican: My parents were born in Mexico. I was born in Dallas, Texas. This makes me a first-generation American, right? So, if my best friend's dad was born in Mexico, and her mother is a Chicana, does this make her a first-generation American or a second-generation American? —Just Curious Dear Pocha: In the eyes of the current attorney general, both you and your friend are Mexicans. ¡Trucha! When do you think Baja California and other locations in the madre-land with lots of American expatriates become U.S. territories or better yet, states? I would be very eager to live in a beautiful coastal area surrounded by people with nice cars and the world's most powerful military to back them up, I think the Mexicans would, too. —Americano-Mexicano Dear Gabacho: Be careful what you wish for. If the United States and Mexico ever went to war, snowbirds like yourself would be the first people targeted by Mexicans. Don't believe me? Ask the Chinese during the Mexican Revolution. Better make plans to move to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or whatever other Latin American country gabachos retirees like to set up colonies in nowadays where they refuse to learn Spanish besides "gringo," "cerveza" and "Soy americano." Why do Mexican women, who are basically good drivers, turn into morons when they turn into the Walmart parking lot? Also, here in New Mexico, you get the guys who sneer at you, pull into traffic in front of you at the last possible second, then slow down to 15 miles an hour. I've never seen this anywhere else. Are they Mexicans or just those "I am Espanish!" assholes showing off their inferiority complex? —Califa Motorhead Dear Pocho: With all due respect, EVERYONE turns into morons at the Walmart parking lot—hell, at Walmart, period. But what I got surprised by in researching your pregunta is how relatively few Mexis shop there. A 2014 study by Kantar Retail found only about 10 percent of Walmart shoppers were Latinos (read: mostly Mexican), with raza preferring Dollar General and Family Dollar stores by far. I guess it makes sense: Mexicans prefer swap meets and yard sales when looking for low prices. But the stats are incomplete: in a graphic, Kantar excluded New Mexico. They gave no reason, but I know the answer, which also answers your queja about slow-driving men: The Land of Enchantment is where all preconceived notions about Mexicans go to claim they're pure-blooded Spaniards going back to Cabeza de Vaca—but definitely not related to Estevanico! What is the deal with Mexicans and their fear of U.S. banks? A recent home invasion netted the robbers $2,000 that the Mexicans who lived there were using for their next house payment. When I mentioned this to a Mexicana friend, she told me she was once robbed of $15,000 that she was keeping at her apt for a house payment. Doesn't word reach the wabs from their relatives in El Norte that USA bank accounts are insured to $100,000? —Huero in the Barrio Dear Gabacho: Ask Washington Mutual.

SHARE Couple finds bloodied man in their house After apparent self-slashing, police tase him in basement By Erin McIntyre Wednesday, February 15, 2017 Kevin and Iris Foltz were having a pleasant Valentine’s Day. They were both on vacation from their jobs at Walmart, had stopped at Texas Roadhouse for dinner and picked up Starbucks on the way home, and were ready to settle in for the night around 9 p.m. But when they entered their house at 1434 Rood Ave., something wasn’t right. They saw that the door to the basement was busted open and splintered. Dark pools and smears mottled the kitchen linoleum and there was something dripping off the counter. Kevin yelled, “Hello?” into the house and a mumbling noise answered from downstairs. He looked down and saw red footprints leading down into the basement. He turned to Iris and told her to get out of the house, and she called 911. Within minutes, police arrived and they found a man wielding a knife at the bottom of the stairs leading to the basement. According to Grand Junction Police Department spokeswoman Heidi Davidson, the man threatened officers and didn’t drop the knife, though he was ordered several times to do so. Officers used a Taser to take him into custody, and then he was transported to St. Mary’s Hospital for treatment of self-inflicted injuries, Davidson said. The incident is still under investigation and charges are pending against the man, whose identity was not released on Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, disaster cleanup crews came and went from the basement as the Foltzes sat in their living room. Their cat, Princess Jasmine, sequestered herself in the bedroom. The kitchen was spattered with the intruder’s blood, the knife block on the counter sitting empty with a set of car keys by the coffee pot that didn’t belong. The Foltzes presumed the keys belonged to the man whose blood was smeared from their kitchen down the stairway, through their basement, and that their knives were confiscated by the police as evidence. They came back after spending a night in a hotel, to find the situation downstairs was even worse than in the kitchen. Kevin said he was shocked at the sheer volume of blood downstairs and could not believe the man was still alive. It’s the craziest thing that has happened at their house since they moved in 24 years ago. Sure, they’ve had random people urinate in the yard, and one time they had the tires stolen off a vehicle sitting in the driveway. But nothing like this. It’s a Valentine’s Day the Foltzes will never forget, but they aren’t angry about what happened, though they will likely incur costs for repairs, carpet removal and hazardous materials cleaning. They also said they aren’t scared to be at home, despite the intrusion. “I still feel safe,” Kevin said. “I think the gentleman was having some type of mental episode. I think he needs help. I hope he gets help.” They’re thankful they weren’t home when it happened and that the man is apparently still alive, though the amount of blood in the home makes them wonder. “I’m glad it was our house and not their house,” Kevin said, pointing at the next-door neighbor’s place. “They have young kids next door. It could have been a lot worse.” COMMENTS TOP JOBS Activities Assistant Assist Lifestyle 360 director with recreational activities. These may...

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. "What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence -- and I take domestic violence very seriously," Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him. Police Chief John Mina said the suspect "basically opened fire on her" as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton's death. Hundreds of tips poured in and a reward ballooned to $100,000 in the search. The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando's Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured. Authorities said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to one eye in the process. Loyd said he didn't resist. Orlando police said it would investigate the amount of force used to apprehend Loyd. Ayala said that case hasn't been handed over to her office. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing; she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon's death are first-degree murder with a firearm; killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother; attempted first degree-murder with a firearm; two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm; and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; carjacking with a firearm; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It's unclear whether Ayala's office would be able to seek the death penalty. In January 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled that the process used to condemn a Florida death row inmate was unconstitutional because a judge rather than a jury was the final arbiter of fact in sentencing. The 8-1 ruling came in a challenge filed by death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, who had been convicted of murdering restaurant co-worker Cynthia Harrison in 1998. The case was sent back to the Florida Supreme Court. Florida legislators then overhauled the law and allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death if 10 of 12 jurors recommended it. Last fall, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence required a unanimous jury vote, striking down the new law. A bill requiring that a jury unanimously recommend the death sentence is currently in the Legislature, CNN affiliate News 13 Orlando reported. If the jury is not unanimous, it can recommend a life sentence without parole. Ayala said prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of the bill, but will proceed with the case as planned.

A central Florida grand jury has indicted Markeith Loyd in the shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend in December and Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm violations and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. “What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence — and I take domestic violence very seriously,” Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him. Police Chief John Mina said the suspect “basically opened fire on her” as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton’s death. The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando’s Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing; she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon’s death are first-degree murder with a firearm; killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother; attempted first degree-murder with a firearm; two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm; and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; carjacking with a firearm; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Below is his speech in its entirety: Good evening. I want to thank you for attending this, my seventh, State of the Town address. I would like to recognize all of my fellow elected officials here tonight. I greatly appreciate your hard work, dedication and loyalty to our Town. I especially want to thank Rotary Club President Beth Hanlon for hosting this event and all those from Riverhead Kiwanis Club and Riverhead Lions Club for attending this event. It is always exciting to be given the opportunity to address so many of Riverhead’s leading voices in a discussion about the future of this great town. As always, the State of the Town message is about where we have been and where we are going as a town and as a people. In each State of the Town we outline our shared agenda, we measure our progress, we state our priorities, we look ahead, and we remember our past. However, first and foremost we stay positive about the town and we stay positive about each other. We don’t let the complaining creep in. Verse 16 in the Letter of Jude reminds us, “[t]hese people are complainers, disgruntled ones who live by their desires; their mouths utter bombast as they fawn over people to gain advantage.” Our job is to cause everyone to work together, regardless of how difficult it may seem in the present moment, for the good of the town and our residents. We as a town need to be thankful in all circumstances. President Harry S. Truman once said, “[i]t is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.” My message tonight runs down two threads. First we must remember the past, we should be proud our successes and must also recognize and learn from our failures. Second, we look to the future and chart a course for 2017. 2016 was an amazingly successful year. It is difficult to comprehend how much we accomplished last year. The success of this town, as any other town, depends more on its people and their efforts than it does the elected official. In fact, the elected official plays a very small part in the success of the town. I am reminded of John’s Gospel (Chapter 4 verses 36 through 41) [t]he reaper is already receiving his payment and gathering crops for an eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper can rejoice together. For here the saying is verified that one sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap what you have not worked; for others have done the work and you are sharing the fruits of their work. Truly, we as a town are sharing fruits of others labors. It is important for us to remember that we must “bear one another’s burdens… for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deluding himself. (Galatians 6, 2-4.) Let’s talk briefly about last year’s State of the Town message. One of the first initiatives that I spoke about last year was to create zoning for First Baptist Church to build the Community Life Center. You’ve heard me say this previously, this facility is a YMCA on steroids. I am happy to report that the Town of Riverhead adopted the zoning last year that will make the Community Life Center a reality. This has been a decades-long journey for the members of First Baptist Church as it is taken so many twists and turns. I am so proud and humbled by the work of the Coverdales and the Pastor Liggon and every other member of the church. “It is amazing what you can accomplish when you do not care who gets the credit.” First Baptist Church gets the credit for this accomplishment. I am also happy to report that at least half of the 4/12 initiative that we had spoken about last year was adopted. The Town of Riverhead retroactively imposed term limits of 12 years on the town council and the town supervisor. Unfortunately, the initiative to move the supervisor’s term from two years to four years was overwhelmingly rejected by the residents. But it is with a happy heart that I can report that term limits were passed in the Town of Riverhead. Now term limits did not pass unanimously. Councilman John Dunleavy voted against the code and is fond of saying I fired him. I guess in some way that is true, but there is something I know that is even more true than that. John and his wife Marie are the “salt of the earth” and the “light of the world.” The lives of John and Marie are defined by service and dedication embodied in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. The Dunleavy’s eyes have been, as our eyes must be, steering on a fixed point ahead and not changing direction with every short-term twist and turn of the road. John and Marie’s volunteerism with the Riverhead Volunteer Ambulance Corps, the Lions Club, East End Arts Council, St. Isidore’s Church, the American Legion and their own Homeowners’ Association shows their dedication to the Town we all call home. Downtown Riverhead has made amazing strides in 2016. Henry Ford once said “[c]oming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.” In downtown Riverhead, we have come together and made amazing progress. The progress is evident in the questions we have to answer about things like parking. The success is imminent by working together on projects such as David Gallo’s mixed-use apartment building on the corner of McDermott Avenue and East Main Street. I am happy to report that David Gallo has submitted his commercial site plan and special permit application to construct 117 workforce housing units and 12,000 square feet of new retail space on the corner of McDermott Avenue and East Main Street. This project was discussed after the 2011 general election and it took five years to bring it to fruition. Truly 2016 was an amazingly successful year for Main Street. I am happy to congratulate David Gallo and his partners. I want to especially thank Connie Lassandro for introducing David Gallo to Riverhead. Right next-door to the David Gallo project is the old or should I say was the old Sears building. Another wonderful thing happened in 2016 — the crumbling Sears building has been demolished to make way for another exciting mixed use project which will incorporate green space and open space flowing to the East End Arts property. I look forward to seeing the site plan submission in 2017. If these two projects weren’t enough, Conifer has broken ground on West Main Street and is in the process of building 45 new art space apartments. This project brings a creativity and vitality to West Main Street that we have never seen before. Now if you can believe it, there is one more amazing project that was mentioned in the State of the Town last year that has come to fruition. The approval and the construction of a brand new 20-room boutique hotel known as the Preston House immediately across the street from the Hyatt Hotel. I wish to credit Joe Petrocelli for restoring the historic Preston House. We are keeping our Division of Land Management busy and I am grateful for all of their hard work. Jeff Murphree, Brad Hammond and their staff have consistently risen to the occasion. Thank you. It is amazing what can be accomplished when you don’t take the credit. I am truly humbled and inspired by David Gallo, Robert Muchnick, Joe Petrocelli along with the fine men and women of Conifer arts space project all working together to make Main Street a success. Our Main Street will be transformed from a downtown business district long hindered by blight — to a vibrant community filled with young men, women and families who will take back the streets to make it feel safe and keep the shops and stores open and thriving. It is not me nor the Town Board that did this, but insightful visionaries. Truly this town is blessed. Also discussed last year in the State of the Town message was the coming of a new multiplex movie theater by Regal Cinemas. I am again happy to report that with the help of Councilwoman Jodi Giglio we have amended the zoning and the parking requirements to allow movie theater uses on Route 58. Regal Cinemas Board of Directors voted to sign the lease with Phillips International to finally bring a movie theater to the old Wal-Mart shopping center. The former Wal-Mart building will be torn down and rising up from the rubble will be a beautiful state of the art multiplex. 2016 was an amazing year. I would be remiss if I did not mention what is on the horizon at Peconic Bay Medical Center. With the help of our planning staff and our Town Attorney, Bob Kozakiewicz, we were able to write new zoning and get a site plan approved in record time for PBMC’s expansion which will include a cardiac catheterization lab. Northwell Health has estimated the cost of this much needed expansion at $43,000,000 and as we all know, not having a facility with this technology nearby could potentially mean the difference between life and death. This is what true collaboration looks like. Our residents will greatly benefit from this project and we look forward to getting it across the finish line. Moving further east in Jamesport we discussed the old Froelich farm also known as Sharper’s Hill. Suffolk County completed the appraisal of the property in 2016. I am prayerfully optimistic that the owners of Sharper’s Hill will accept the county offer and preserve the property. Preservation of this important parcel insures the rural character of Jamesport forever. I want to thank legislator Al Krupski for making the preservation of property possible. In fact, the only substantial element proposed in the 2016 State of the Town speech that was not done was the Aquebogue Jamesport corridor study. The study did not take place due solely to the vocal opposition of the Jamesport Civic Association. The Town Board heard the voices of the Jamesport and Aquebogue residents and would like to thank them for participating in this effort. Finally, the last extremely important measure in the 2016 State of the Town was the finalization of the EPCAL Environmental Impact Statement and the filing of the subdivision map. The Environmental Impact Statement was accepted, we adopted the zoning, the update to the Master Plan and update to the Urban Renewal Plan. The Planning Board held its public hearing for the subdivision and they are poised to adopt the final subdivision map. The only remaining issues are two permits from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the permit from Suffolk County Health Department. We have had numerous meetings with both the New York State DEC and the Suffolk County Health Department. We do not believe that any of these permits will be an issue. We should obtain these approvals this year. Again a truly amazing 2016. Over the past seven years I have focused inarguably upon three of the most burdensome issues confronting the Town of Riverhead. Three of the most important things that are going on in the Town of Riverhead. Three things that I ran on in 2009. These same three issues have consistently gotten better and better over the past seven years. First let’s start with the Town’s finances: I am again happy to report that the Town of Riverhead’s budget is balanced. There is no reliance on one shot revenues. We are paying as we go. In fact we have enough revenue at this point to cover the landfill debt service which was not an easy task. I am grateful for Bill Rothaar, his staff and the Town Board’s support in getting through this arduous process. I am a firm supporter of the New York State tax cap, but, as I have said again and again the tax cap does not work without attendant mandate relief from the State of New York. Both the State of New York and the County of Suffolk continue to push unfunded mandates down to the towns. New for this year, the State of New York is attempting to change our MS-4 permit for storm-water. These proposed conditions will add significant costs to an already strained budget. The monitoring alone will necessitate the hiring of an additional town engineer. The real financial strain will be borne by the highway department. The proposed regulations will require that streets in impaired water sheds to be swept monthly. In addition, high priority storm water catch basins be cleaned annually. We have 3,000 catch basins in which at least 1,500 would have to be every year. Currently, we clean 215 catch basins. I know the men and women that work in the Highway Department are second to none, but this burden would require the town to hire up to 8 additional highway workers at an initial cost of $675,000.00 per year in order to comply with these requirements. Further, the highway department will have to purchase an additional vacuum truck ($350,000.00) and an additional street sweeper ($250,000.00). The first year’s budget increase is conservatively estimated at $1,350,000.00. That my friends equates to a 19% tax increase to the Highway Department before we even turn the lights on January 1. We cannot continue to allow the State to push unfunded mandates down on the municipalities, while at the same time tout how the State remains under the tax cap. Town’s don’t print money. I want to thank Drew Dillingham for shedding light on this matter. His insight is invaluable. In 2017, we will fight hard on behalf of our residents to halt this extraordinary unfunded mandate. Not to be outdone, the County of Suffolk is looking for special state legislation to add $1.00 per 1,000 gallons of municipal water used for all residents that use public water. The money will be used for advanced wastewater treatment systems. While this is a laudable goal that I support, the problem is this fee will amount to a 57% increase in water rates while providing no money for water district improvements. The two biggest problems with this legislation is that residents and businesses in sewer districts who already pay a fee to have their wastewater treated are not exempt from the fee and the money is payable to Suffolk County. The County has a terrible record of managing, or I should say raiding sewer trust funds. The Town can only stay within the tax cap if the State and the County give us a fighting chance. The Town of Riverhead strives to stay within the tax cap while maintaining all levels of service including maintaining one of the finest police departments in the county. That being said, in 2016 alone the health insurance for the municipal employees went up more than the tax cap allowed. Unfortunately, this is not sustainable. The State of New York and the County of Suffolk must work with local government to reduce unfunded mandates. If Albany and Hauppauge are unwilling to reduce unfunded mandates then it is the job of the local elected official illuminate them. The County of Suffolk created an unfunded mandate for the Town of Riverhead when they undertook a study entitled Total Maximum Daily Load in Nitrogen in the Peconic Estuary. In response to this study the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation amended our State Elimination Discharge Permit for the Riverhead Sewage Treatment Plant reducing our overall nitrogen discharge by more than 75%. This was a worthwhile study, however, the new permit required the Town of Riverhead to upgrade the Riverhead Sewage Treatment Plant to treat to the limits of technology. So a Sewage Treatment Plant that was upgraded as recently as 2003 now had to undergo a $23.5 million upgrade. The plant upgrade was completed in 2016 and is functioning better then its design standards. I am proud to stand here today and let everyone know that we operate the most technologically advanced wastewater treatment plant in New York State at the present moment. Some of you may know, that during the growing season the effluent from our plant is used to irrigate the Indian Island Golf Course. Interestingly, the water from the plant is cleaner then the groundwater the County previously irrigated the golf course with. This is a first in New York State and will be a model going forward. We are proud of Michael Reichel and Frank Russo as well as all the fine men and women in the Sewer Department that made this plant a reality. We are also grateful to the County of Suffolk for an $8 million grant awarded to the town which was paid from the Suffolk County Sewer Stabilization Fund. We are also grateful to New York State for the $2 million grant for the golf course irrigation part of this project. Unfortunately, even after these two grants the town had to sell $13.5 million in bonds for the plant upgrade. The bond payment and additional operational costs represents roughly a 400% sewer rent/tax increase to the average business and home owner in the Riverhead Sewer District. The Town of Riverhead operates a regional sewage treatment plant pulling in sewer waste from Route 58, the neighborhood surrounding downtown Riverhead along with the Suffolk County Sewer District encompassing the entire county jail court complex in Southampton. Additionally, Riverhead also operates the only scavenger waste plant on the East End of Long Island. A regional facility in every sense of the word. The Town of Riverhead seeks to be treated in the same manner Suffolk County Sewer Districts are treated in the five west end towns. New York State Tax Law provides for the collection of state sales and compensating use tax in the County of Suffolk of one quarter of one percent (.25%) within the territorial limits of the County for distribution to the towns and villages which have established sewer districts to stabilize the assessments or taxes within such districts. The monies collected by such sales tax are paid over by New York State to Suffolk County for distribution by the County to the duly established town sewer districts located within the territorial limits of Suffolk County. The problem is, Suffolk County has not promulgated any process or rules or regulations for the administration of the funds collected through the tax law for distribution to town and village sewer districts. Thus, leaving town and village sewer districts unable to provide rate stabilization. However, if you are in a Suffolk County sewer district in one of the five west end towns, the County has determined that if the annual increase of sewer rent/tax exceeds three percent (3%) the amount above three percent (3%) will be paid out of the sewer stabilization fund. Due to the construction of the upgraded treatment plant required by the County study published in 2007 the amount necessary to stabilize the assessment or tax of the resident users of the Riverhead Sewer District at the three percent (3%) level for 2016 was $681,828. In March of 2016, the County paid the Riverhead Sewer District $144,688 from monies collected from the sewer stabilization fund leaving a shortfall of $537,140 to the Town of Riverhead. This shortfall makes it impossible for the town to stabilize the sewer rents/rates. Based upon the debt service and the increased costs associated with the operation of the upgraded sewage treatment plant, the amount payable by the County to stabilize the 2017 sewer rent/tax at three percent (3%) is $1,466,712. The County of Suffolk is sitting on at least $100,000,000 that should be used in part to stabilize all town and village sewer treatment facilities. These funds may be used for no other purpose by the County of Suffolk other than to stabilize the assessment and taxes of sewer districts within the County. Under the standard of due process and equal protection under the law Suffolk County must turn the requested funds over to the Town of Riverhead. Again, all we ask is to be treated equally. It is never a good idea for one municipality to use taxpayer funds to sue another municipality but sometimes, just sometimes it is necessary. One of the initiatives discussed in 2016 was to obtain the services of CMA to provide a five-year financial management plan for the Town of Riverhead. I am happy to report that the five year financial plan is done. One of the last pressing financial burdens of the Town of Riverhead is balancing the Community Preservation Fund. I have discussed many times previous town boards overspent our Community Preservation Fund. In 2016, the Town of Riverhead was successful in having the State of New York adopt legislation that enables the Town of Riverhead to refinance our CPF debt with a new repayment period of up to 40 years. This legislation combined with the extension of the CPF program passed by 70% of town voters will enable the Town of Riverhead to refinance the debt so that the principal and interest payments are directly in line with the income we receive through the CPF program. Once this is accomplished in 2017 every single budget line in the Town of Riverhead is balanced. It was a difficult task to balance the Town of Riverhead’s finances in seven short years. In 2010, the town of Riverhead’s general fund and the CPF fund we’re out of balance each buy 12%. This is the same percentage that the County of Suffolk budgets were out of balance in 2010.It is an amazing thing to stand here tonight and tell you that we have conquered the financial mountain. The town is on firm financial footing and it is time to start building our fund balance. The second of the most pressing issues the Town of Riverhead has faced over the past several decades was downtown Riverhead. For years downtown Riverhead languished, stores closed, buildings emptied, and you could park almost anywhere. Fast forward to today and you hear that we are beginning to have a parking problem. Over the past eight years the public private investment in downtown has been astonishing. As recently as last week the State of New York announced another $500,000 to be split equally between David Gallo’s multimillion dollar project and Michael Butler’s innovative 10,000 square foot Riverhead Food Market and Production Center. This comes on the heels of a $250,000 grant from the State Office of Community Renewal to create housing above existing retail stores. Between the State and the County, downtown Riverhead received approximately $10,000,000 in grants and financial assistance. Thank you to Chris Kempner, Joe Maiorana, Frank Messina and Dan Thompson from the Community Development Agency for your commitment to downtown Riverhead. One the issues I want to discuss is crime. Overall crime is down throughout the town, including our downtown area. The reduction in crime is a direct result of the work our fine men and women do in the Riverhead Police Department. They and we are doing everything possible to reduce crime from community policing to the East End Drug Task Force, but, more is necessary. Our police department cannot do it alone. One of the things we realized over the past eight years is that in order to make it downtown safe we have to bring people downtown. You see, people who come to downtown to shop and live their lives; going to the bakeries, the delis, the restaurants and the shops doing what it is that normal people do — you see, these folks, these are the eyes, ears and feet on the ground. The largest deterrent of crime that any municipality can undertake. Before Summerwind was built we had complaints on a regular basis in the back parking lot behind their building all concerning quality of life crimes. Once Summerwind opened their residents would not and did not tolerate that kind of nonsense. Just the presence of Summerwind’s residents pushed the criminal element out. The park along the riverfront became a vibrant, joyful place to visit. When David Gallo’s building rises up on McDermott Avenue we will also see the positive effects of new residents on East Main Street. The downtown renaissance coupled with aggressive code enforcement and an ever vigilant Riverhead police force will make downtown Riverhead one of the safest neighborhoods in Riverhead town. With the amazing growth we are about to see on Main Street, it is incumbent upon the town board to move quickly to create new parking lots along East and West Main Streets. Perhaps the most problematic parking issue exists behind Digger O’Dell’s on the west end of town and the Aquarium on the east end of town. I am happy to report that Councilman Tim Hubbard has been appointed as the new parking district liaison. We have great confidence that Councilman Hubbard along with the Parking District Committee will present a parking plan that will allow the town to continue our revitalization of downtown Riverhead. It is my belief that by this time next year when these new buildings are constructed and occupied the transformation of downtown will be surreal. The final frontier, EPCAL. We have spoken about EPCAL in almost every State of the Town message. The subdivision is largely complete. We have several suitors looking to purchase the subdivision map. We are currently negotiating with Suffolk Industrial Corporation on a $45 million acquisition of the 600 developable acres of EPCAL. It is our goal to close on the property in 2017. This one closing will add an estimated $43 million to the general fund. We must use this money wisely. We must take this money and put it in a special debt service reserve account which will be used to pay off the remaining landfill debt. By doing this, it is my sincere belief we will be able to roll back the tax increases of 2015 and 2016. The Town Board cannot spend the $43 million dollars without providing tax relief to the residences and businesses of the Town of Riverhead. It was at EPCAL, that America launched the greatest fighter jets and airplanes the world has ever seen. It was at Grumman, that inspiration, ingenuity, creativity and originality came together to protect our democracy and freedom. The people of Riverhead, built the machines and gave rise to the ideas and aircraft that touched the Moon and the stars, the skies and the heavens. I am excited to let you know that as Luminati Aerospace ushers in a new chapter in Riverhead’s love affair with aviation as they plan for the first launch of an aircraft taken from concept to design to manufacture all at EPCAL. Exciting times my friends. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?” Riverhead is an amazing town filled with amazing people as I look around I would like to honor those that have done for others. As we have discussed, Riverhead designed and operates one of the most technologically advanced Sewage Treatment Plant in New York State under the guidance of Michael Reichel our Sewer District Superintendent. What you may not know is the genius behind irrigating the Indian Island Golf course was borne of Michael Reichel. Doing for others by protecting the environment. Michael Butler is an unassuming man if you met him on Main Street you wouldn’t know that he was the mastermind behind purchasing East Main Street’s largest and longest vacant structure, the Woolworth Building. As if that renovation was not enough, Mr. Butler is in the process of purchasing the old West Marine Building to bring us the Riverhead Food Hall and Production Center. A trendy upscale food market with a view of the Peconic River. Doing for others by taking a chance on Main Street. What does a Councilman, a Deacon and a Pastor all have in common? Their love for the Congregational Church of downtown Riverhead. Councilman and former Deacon Wooten working with Pastor Sean Murray and the Town’s Community Development Agency to obtain a $71,000.00 grant from the Lyon Gardner foundation to complete the $500,000.00 transformation of the First Congregational Church of Riverhead. God’s work helping others. Not to be on outdone, Councilwomen Jodi Giglio and the Alternate Transportation Committee, again, working with the Community Development Agency obtained over $700,000.00 in grants to complete the very popular Veterans Memorial multipurpose trail around EPCAL. There are many unsung heroes in Town Hall one of them is Annemarie Prudenti. Ms. Prudenti has been the author of at least two pieces of special state legislation that were passed by the State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Cuomo. The latest such piece of legislation allows the town of Riverhead to refinance $42.5 million in debt owed by the Community Preservation Fund. This state statute allows the town to do what it normally could not do. Refinance debt for a longer period of time. The residents of the Town of Riverhead are indebted to Annemarie Prudenti for her service and dedication to this town. We have gone from sewage treatment to food halls to now one of my favorite subjects — bunker. Over the past several years of town of Riverhead has faced massive fish kills in the Peconic River. Last year the town was able to avert a fish kill through the efforts of several individuals two of which I want to mention here today. The first hero in an effort to avert a fish kill was Jim Gilmore from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Mr. Gilmore worked with the Mid Atlantic Marine Fisheries Council to obtain additional quota to allow the harvest of the bunker before they died. This additional quota enabled the next hero, Mr. William Caldwell to spring into action to harvest the additional quota to avert fish kills in the Peconic River. Mr. Caldwell harvested over 700,000 pounds of live bunker from the Peconic River all right at the doorstep of Corwell Avenue. Mr. Caldwell’s efforts allowed the massive numbers of bunker to move freely up and down the river avoiding a bottleneck that previously trapped and killed the bunker. Without the efforts of both Mr. Gilmore and the muscle of Mr. Caldwell the Peconic River would not have been a pleasant place this past spring. I want to recognize and commend the men and women of the Riverhead Water District especially Mr. Mark Conklin Water District Superintendent. Mr. Conklin works tirelessly in the Riverhead Water District to give the residents pure clean water. This past year, Long Island was in a severe drought and the Town of Riverhead pumped record amounts of water. During the months of July and August the Water District’s 17 wells ran nonstop setting records which on some days exceeded 20,000,000 gallons of water a day. In fact, total water usage for July and August was more than 900 million gallons—an all-time record. I want to thank Mr. Conklin and the employees of the water district for those tireless hours to ensure that we had good clean water for the residents of Riverhead. Finally, we must recognize, Superintendent Ray Coyne and Senior Services Director Judy Doll for their efforts in merging the town’s recreation department and senior park department into the Office of Intergenerational Services. This new department will not only provide more services to the seniors of the Town of Riverhead but it will also provide more recreational opportunities to all of the residents of Riverhead. The new Intergenerational Department will be housed in the senior services building on Shadetree Lane in Aquebogue. In addition, we will be opening a new intergenerational center on Columbus Avenue in Stotsky Park. Truly these two individuals have bridged the gap. I want to take a moment to thank my partners on the Riverhead Town Board, Councilman James Wooten, Councilwoman Jodi Giglio, Councilman Timothy Hubbard and Councilman John Dunleavy. I also want to recognize our staff who are the lifeblood of the Town. As the elected officials, we set the policy, approve the budget and provide direction. The Town employees carry out that direction and makes things happen. Your hard work is truly appreciated. I want to thank my staff: Heidi, Jill, Carol and Larry for always standing by me. I am truly blessed by having people of your caliber standing with me. Finally, I want to thank the members of my family was Zachary, Timothy and Gregory and especially my wife Cathleen for allowing me to serve as Town Supervisor. I could not do the job without the full blessing and support of my family and it is through their love and support and faith that we continue to make this town the greatest town in Suffolk County. All the glory and honor go to God. I thank the Father for placing me back in this position. I ask that you the residents and business owners of Riverhead pray for me that I may honor God by and through my service to this town. I am truly grateful for all that we have accomplished together. However, there is still more work to do before Riverhead reaches its full potential. I would like to leave you with one final verse from the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 1:18): “Come Now and Let Us Reason Together.” Photo: Riverhead Town Supervisor Sean Walter giving his annual ‘State of the Town’ address Wednesday night in Polish Town.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Time to dive back into anonymous mail Thursday Feb 16, 2017 at 1:01 AM It’s that wonderful time of the year when a reader sends in a letter with no return address, no signature and spouting nothing but hate. Once again, this is an anonymous letter sent to the Daily Globe. The letter refers to a Sunday article, which already questions the intelligence of the reader, as the Daily Globe does not have a Sunday edition. It’s the first sentence in the letter. I wish the author had stopped there, because we already knew from that first sentence that whatever came next would have no intelligent argument. None. Zero. Proven by what came next. It is a two-page diatribe about Hispanics and Muslims — although called Mexicans and Somalians by the author — which accuses Muslim women of shoplifting everything they can from Walmart. They accuse Hispanics of procreation without marriage so the women and children can remain on welfare and also go on to say shopping in our community and in Garden City is hard to do as Hispanics don’t speak English. The author goes on about others receiving free health care for Hispanics and Muslims and free school lunches. The author is upset because "the women and children all have smart phones," but "I can’t afford a smart phone." The author is also upset that "Mexican men send money back to Mexico." Shouldn’t anyone who works be allowed to send their money anywhere they want to? The most ridiculous statement in the letter is this: "Us Americans that have worked all our lives should be the ones getting welfare. We paid into our country for years. They shouldn’t get welfare or anything, let them work or go back where they came from." So, Americans should get welfare while immigrants should do all the work? I’m confused. We don’t pay into welfare, we work all our lives and pay into Social Security. Then, when we retire, we get that money back. I have no idea how the two are considered the same thing. The problem I have is the generalization of an entire group. Many of my neighbors are Hispanic and work hard for their money. They work in local businesses, buy groceries in local stores and frequent our movie theater, stores, restaurants and so on. They are not on welfare. Some of the hardest working people I’ve ever met are Somalian. Yes, most are Muslim, but that doesn’t take anything away from their work ethic. Now, my guess to the letter writer’s focus is because they live in Dodge City and see the many different races, religions and nationalities in our community. Instead of embracing cultural difference, they see changes to a community they don’t like and blame all the changes on others. I had an argument with a friend earlier this week. He believes Trump being elected president has allowed racism to come back. I say racism never left. An African-American male looks at the world different than a caucasian male. A Muslim applauds freedom of religion, but also knows many in America look at them as nothing more than terrorists. The reality is racism never left our nation. The situation is better as younger generations embrace one another and understand we are all human, no matter where we came from. Focus has shifted somewhat in the nation, however. We want to ban Muslims from coming here. We want to build a wall to stop Mexicans from coming into our country. I have a hard time with either concept. Yes, I am caucasian and Christian. I don’t discriminate. Christianity tells us to accept others and to treat all as we want to be treated, yet some spiritual leaders have forgotten that part of the Bible. Racism has never left our nation. Acceptance of others has creeped into our consciousness, but it hasn’t reached all Americans. As a nation, we must embrace our fellow man. A citizen of the US must accept all other citizens of our nation, no matter where they originated. We must accept all religions. We must accept the differences in us all and defend our fellow citizens’ rights to be different. After all, united we stand, divided we fall.

(@philwahba) From Tom's Reading List Financial Times: Trump and the tax plan that threatens to divide corporate America — "Republicans are still promising the most sweeping changes since the Reagan reforms of 1986. But the only firm proposal on the table  — from the House of Representatives — includes a 20 per cent tax on imports." Forbes: OMG! House Republicans are preparing to hit consumers with a horrible new tax that will harm Trump and hurt the economy  — "Importers will no longer be allowed to deduct an item as a business expense. To simplify things, let's say a store imports a pair of sneakers for $40 and then sells them for $50, making a $10 profit on which it would owe taxes. Under the Republican plan, however, the retailer wouldn't be able to deduct the $40 it paid for the sneakers. In fact, it would owe taxes on the entire $50! And who, ultimately, pays this tax? You, the consumer, in the form of higher prices or fewer choices of where you can shop." Tax Policy Center: Understanding the Republicans’ corporate tax reform proposals — "Rough estimates suggest that setting the DBCFT rate at around 30 percent for all businesses would eliminate the revenue shortfall ... The corporate tax is ripe for reform. The DBFCT is an excellent way to kick-start the needed discussion." This program aired on February 16, 2017. +Join the discussion Share View comment(s) Support the news   Next Up Where to now?

(WOFL FOX 35) - A controversial proposal that would allow liquor to be sold in grocery stores was nearly capped in its first House committee as lawmakers expressed concerns about who could handle the bottles. The House Career & Competition Subcommittee voted 8-7 Wednesday to approve the proposal (HB 81), but Rep. Bryan Avila, the bill's sponsor, said he would try to change the plan before its next committee vetting. “There is plenty of time to make sure we get the right fit in place,” Avila, R-Hialeah, told reporters after the meeting. The contentious and heavily lobbied proposal --- sought by Wal-Mart and Target, and opposed by Lakeland-based Publix and Orlando-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits --- seeks to end a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, an issue commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." A wider ranging measure (SB 106) that also seeks to end the separation is ready for a full Senate vote. Proponents contend abolishing the law is necessary to provide more convenience to shoppers, reduce regulations and save businesses money. Opponents argue, among other things, that the change will drive independent liquor stores of business and result in minors illegally getting access to liquor. Rep. Jay Trumbull, R-Panama City, voted for the bill but said he'd support changes that would limit the ability of convenience stores to obtain liquor licenses and restrict access to small liquor bottles. Trumbull also said the bill's implementation date --- July 1, 2017 --- should be delayed “to give people the ability to react to what is coming down the pike.” Rep. Julio Gonzalez, a Venice Republican who voted against the plan, said he hasn't heard from a single individual complaining about an inability to get liquor in Florida. And he said the measure should be closer to a compromise struck last year, but which failed to pass, that would have maintained a current prohibition banning anyone under the age of 21 from handling or selling alcohol. “I think (this) bill is even worse,” Gonzalez said.  “Now you're telling me that a 16-year-old can sell alcohol, under supervision.” Also voting against the bill, Rep. Randy Fine said that while he's “okay with sin,” those pushing for the proposal are simply seeking to increase liquor sales. “I predict that you will see a 50- or 100- or 200-percent increase,” in liquor sales, said Fine, R-Palm Bay. “Why? Because today, people can't make an impulse purchase of hard liquor. You actually have to choose to go to the liquor store.” Target lobbyist Jason Unger said the Minnesota-based company wants to provide shoppers with more convenience. And Monesia Brown, who represents Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is trying to be innovative. “When online sales in 2016 exceeded in-store purchases, and we expect that trend to continue, it is critical that we pursue opportunities to meet customers where they are,” Brown said. Publix lobbyist Lindsey Napier said there is no demand for the change that would alter the business model of the company that has spent millions to operate its separate grocery and liquor stores. “This bill seeks to change that level playing field into a system that suits the business models of large big box stores and gives them an advantage over other businesses,” Napier said. “To try to incorporate liquor items into our stores, to compete, we would have to lose a lot of other inventory that big box stores do not.”       Information from The News Service of Florida.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Rare Florida panther spotted in The Villages Changes ahead for grocery store liquor sales bill Palm Bay man injured in shooting involving police 3 teens charged with stealing guns during school Woman locked inside CVS after store closes Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Out of that 34,000 more than 7,500 stayed in Fayetteville making it the most popular place to stay in the state. The company said Little Rock saw more than 4,100 guests and Hot Springs had nearly 3,400. Melissa Thomey used to live in Hot Springs, but now has an Airbnb space in her home on North Washington Avenue. “Actually I’m shocked and I figured Hot Springs would have had more people," said Thomey, "But you get the university, you get people coming for Walmart. I get quite a few people coming in to work. There’s Crystal Bridges, there’s hiking, there’s just a lot to do up here.” When she decided to rent her extra space on the site, she said she did not realize how many people used it. She says many of her guests come from surrounding states like Texas or Oklahoma. Thomey explained many are in the area just to get away or to do something with the university. Hosts Andrew D'Acquisto and Doris Nellon said the same thing. They have rented their extra South Hill apartment for the past six months. They said the space they, and others on the site, provide can give something that maybe a hotel could not. “When they are here maybe they feel more like they belong, you know that they’re at home," said D'Acquisto. The couple said seeing these high numbers is a good thing for the state. “Arkansas is like a well kept secret in the U.S. A lot of people are finding out that Arkansas is the natural state," said Nellon, "There’s just so many things to do here in our state.” Airbnb said Fayetteville earned close to $907,000, with Little Rock following at $456,200, and Hot Springs earning $362,900.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which has been aggressively expanding. Both offer low prices by focusing on store-label products rather than name brands. Aldi has also been adding items to include gluten-free products and fresh produce. Lidl’s first 20 U.S. stores will open in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its U.S. headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. Lidl operates about 10,000 stores in 27 countries. Both Lidl and Aldi have been aggressively expanding in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a fierce price war has hurt Wal-Mart’s Asda business as well as traditional local retailers. Aldi, which opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976, now has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. and plans to increase that to nearly 2,000 by the end of 2018.

She was revived and taken to the hospital. There was no evidence of drug use at the home, but the woman, 20, later said she had snorted heroin. She said she had not used in a month but when she was at the Sunoco on SOM Center Road earlier in the day, she saw a man that resembled a drug dealer and asked him if he had any heroin. She said she bought $20 worth of it from him. When asked how he looked like a drug dealer, she told police "he just looked like one." Officers spoke to the clerk at Sunoco and he said he did not remember seeing the woman or the suspect she described. Theft, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to the Giant Eagle parking lot Feb. 6 for a report of four shoplifters who were loading $583.62 worth of groceries into a taxi. An employee said the suspects gave the groceries back and then asked why employees were still calling police. Each of the Cleveland residents, two men and two women, were charged with theft. Most said they were stealing to help pay bills. The taxi driver said he picked the group up in Cleveland. He said he has picked them up on previous occasions and they always ask to be taken to Giant Eagle stores. Assault, Marsol Road: A Mayfield Heights man, 21, was arrested for assault and resisting arrest in the Drake apartment parking lot Feb. 5. Officers had responded to the area after a report of an unspecified disturbance between the man and his girlfriend in their apartment. Forgery, Mayfield Road: The owner of Best Gyros said Feb. 4 a former employee had passed two fraudulent checks. They were cashed in the same amount as the man's final paycheck, which was issued in December. Officers said the check numbers and dates had been altered on the fraudulent checks. The suspect is a Willoughby Hills man, 33, who has two active warrants and a criminal history. The incident is under review by the detective bureau. Theft, SOM Center Road: Toys R Us employees reported Feb. 5 a man stole a battery-operated dirt bike and ran from them with it when they approached him in the parking lot. Responding officers located the suspect in Walmart, where he had entered and left the dirt bike at the front of the store. The Cleveland man, 41, was arrested for the theft, valued at $499. Impaired driving, Interstate-271: Officers located a vehicle stuck in the snow around 2 a.m. Feb. 1 and determined it had been driving south in the northbound lanes. The driver, a 23-year-old Broadview Heights woman, was subsequently arrested for OVI and reasonable control. A prescription bottle, containing suspected marijuana, was located in the vehicle's center console. Pandering obscenity involving a minor, Fruitland Avenue: A woman said Jan. 31 her eight-year-old son was receiving text messages on his cell phone from an unknown person who was asking him to send pictures of his genitals. In one text message, the sender indicates he is 11-years-old. The boy said the sender of the message is someone he met while playing a video game on Xbox Live and he gave him his phone number. Officers told the woman they would pay special attention to her residence and the matter would be thoroughly investigated. Traffic offense, Sunset Road: Officers stopped a man's vehicle while he was pulling it into his driveway Jan. 30 because they were aware he had an active warrant out of Warrensville Heights. The vehicle became stuck in snow in the apron of the driveway. Officers began speaking with the man, 41, at the rear of the vehicle. However, at one point, he hurried back to the vehicle and grabbed something and placed it into his pocket. He then tried to get into his home and wrestled with officers as they tried to stop him. Two bindles of suspected narcotics were located inside his pockets. The man was subsequently cited for driving under suspension and no operator's license. His wife came outside to see what was happening and she was also found to have an active warrant from the same city. They were both arrested and turned over to Warrensville Heights police. Charges for resisting arrest are expected to be added against the man. Theft, SOM Center Road: A Five Guys Burgers & Fries employee reported Jan. 30 she had $148 stolen from her wallet while she was at work. She said a manager had secured the wallet in the store's safe during her shift because she did have a pocket on her pants. A second manager, a 24-year-old East Cleveland woman, has been arrested in connection with the theft. Theft, Teal Trace: A woman reported Jan. 28 she believed personal checks had been stolen from her mailbox because she learned somebody had cashed one of them for $350. The check had been made out to a man, whom she believed to be a neighbor. Officers spoke to that man, 41, who initially claimed a friend that was staying with him stole the checks. When officers questioned him about inconsistencies in his story, he admitted he stole the checks and deposited one of them. He said was a recovering alcoholic and relapsed the previous week and that was why he stole the checks. He was subsequently charged with theft. Violation of a temporary protection order, Commonwealth Avenue: A woman said Jan. 30 her husband was in violation of a temporary protection order by sending her unwanted text messages and making a derogatory comment on Facebook about her being a stripper. A warrant was subsequently filed against the Willoughby man, 28, for violation of a protection order. See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

It’s a career choice Mann stands by to this day, as his love for basketball has reemerged alongside his strong faith. "It wasn’t a popular decision, but it was something that I felt led in my heart to do," said Marcus Mann. "So I just followed through with it." Since saying goodbye to the NBA the day before his career was set to begin, the former Mississippi Valley State star has spent the last two decades nurturing lives across Mississippi, including the last three years as a pastor in his hometown of Carthage.   And while the “what ifs” have naturally crept in, he’s put at ease by recalling all the people he's inspired along the way. "We walk in Walmart and a guy will walk up and say ‘Mr. Mann, Mr. Mann, do you remember when you said this and when you said that," Mann recalled. "You know it gives you that sense of joy in your heart that 'hey I did impact somebody’s life'." But now, competitive basketball is back in his life and when his story inevitably resurfaces, it is followed by a much different reaction. "Now it’s more like a ‘wow’ moment," Mann explained. "Especially with my daughter Myah, a lot of her friends will be like ‘Your dad played in the NBA?’." Mann can now be found in the stands at every Brandon High School game. With his only daughter Myah playing her first full varsity season, that spark has returned. "She started out playing soccer, but then one day she was like ‘Dad, I think I want to play basketball.’," Mann said. "And I started smiling from within I was like 'here we go!'. It’s brought me back to that love that I had for the game." Myah Mann: "He always supports me," Myah Mann says about her dad. "Any game I have he’s always there. So basketball you know kind of makes us close and that’s really what we like to do it. Watch and talk about basketball." College and beyond, the father-daughter duo has high hopes for where basketball may take Myah. But in the meantime, he’ll continue to reap the greater benefits of what the game could never provide. "No matter what people may think, no matter what people may say, I’m confident in where I am," said Mann. "I’m happy in where I am, and at this point in my life I’m where I’m supposed to be."   Copyright 2017 MSNewsNow.

Trending Now: Read today's most popular stories on CapitalGazette.com News Government Decision expected next week in robocall case County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka By Matthew Cole / Staff County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka (By Matthew Cole / Staff) Megan BrockettContact Reportermbrockett@capgaznews.com Defense motions rejected on day of final arguments in robocall case A District Court judge denied motions Wednesday for an acquittal and dismissal in the trial of Dennis Fusaro and Stephen Waters, Republican strategists charged with violating Maryland election law in connection with robocalls during a 2014 Anne Arundel County Council race. Judge John P. McKenna Jr. is expected to issue a decision in the misdemeanor case early next week, following closing arguments Wednesday in Annapolis. After hearing lengthy arguments from both sides Wednesday, McKenna ruled that circumstantial evidence presented by the state could support a conviction in the case, denying the defense's motion for acquittal. He also ruled against the defense's argument for dismissal, saying in part that robocalls are covered in the state statute that outlines election law requirements. Fusaro, the former campaign manager of County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka, and Waters, a Republican political consultant based in Virginia, are charged with violating and conspiring to violate the authority line requirements of Maryland election laws. The charges stem from an October 2014 robocall made to about 5,000 Anne Arundel County residents. The call referred to Peroutka's Democratic opponent in the District 5 race, Patrick Armstrong of Severna Park. Two men charged in 2014 robocall that targeted Peroutka's opponent Amanda Yeager Councilman says he had 'no prior knowledge' of call Councilman says he had 'no prior knowledge' of call (Amanda Yeager) Witnesses for the prosecution and other critics of the call have said they believe it was intended was to smear Armstrong, who is gay, and steer undecided voters away from him. The robocall states it was paid for by a group called Marylanders for Transgenders, which the prosecution has said does not exist. In closing arguments Wednesday, Deputy State Prosecutor Thomas M. "Mike" McDonough said Fusaro and Waters were clearly behind the call. McDonough pointed to surveillance camera video that shows the pair at a Wal-Mart days before the robocall went out. The video footage shows Fusaro buying a chocolate bar and getting cash back from the register. McDonough said that cash was then given to Waters, whom the footage shows shortly afterward buying a prepaid cellphone and handing what looks to be the change and receipt off camera, to where Fusaro was standing. McDonough said evidence and testimony show that the number of the purchased cellphone is the number that appeared on residents' caller IDs when the robocalls went out. The deputy state prosecutor argued Wednesday that Fusaro, who was promised a $2,000 victory bonus by Peroutka if he won, was the one who wanted the robocall to go out. Fusaro knew Peroutka would not have approved the call, McDonough said, and as a result went to his friend Waters to set it up. The attorneys for the defendants argued that the state has no proof Fusaro had anything to do with the robocall, but only that he went to a Wal-Mart with a friend, who had no apparent tie to the Peroutka campaign, and was there for the purchase of a phone. In order for the charges to stand, the defense said, the state would have to prove some type of agreement existed between Fusaro and Waters regarding the call. "All they have is a video," defense attorney Mandeep S. Chhabra said. The defense team made extensive arguments Wednesday on both the constitutionality of the case as it relates to free speech and on technical issues, such as whether robocalls constitute campaign material, as defined by the state. After McKenna's rulings on the defense's motions, much of the defense team's closing argument focused on the question of willfulness. The defense argued there are no Maryland statutes that address robocalls and how they must be handled when it comes to election laws. The defendants, as a result, could not have willfully committed a violation of the law, the defense said. McKenna is expected to issue a decision on the case Tuesday afternoon.

Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton's administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China's economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton's approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push "permanent normal trade relations" with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China's human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it's cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China's huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, "regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments." These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, "with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated." And "offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize." Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We're seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time's Joe Klein, to ask: "Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?" In addressing those questions, it's helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it's probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I'm a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of "earned success." It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump's trade policies, and that the answers to Joe Klein's questions aren't so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101. — Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for The Washington Examiner, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News Channel contributor and a co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

(Photo: Pool / Getty Images) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Target Corp. CEO Brian Cornell and Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly joined a half-dozen other retail executives to express “grave concerns” to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday about a proposed border adjustment tax that the retail industry says will increase costs to consumers, according to a source familiar with the closed-door meeting. The tax, a piece of a larger House Republican tax reform plan, aims to discourage companies from buying or manufacturing products outside the U.S. The border adjustment forces companies to pay taxes on the full purchase price of imported items its sells and not just on profits from those sales. It could add 20 percent to cost of imported inventory, analysts believe, forcing prices up and revenue down. In a statement Wednesday, Target said the border adjustment tax “will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials. If enacted, ... (it) would have profound implications for our guests and business.” As they came and went, Cornell and Joly were both tight-lipped about their visits to the White House and Capitol Hill. Neither man responded to reporters’ questions on the way into the West Wing meeting with Trump. Cornell came to a very brief post-meeting press appearance but did not speak. Joly did not attend the press gathering. In a lighthearted aside, a video taken as the CEOs introduced themselves showed Trump pausing after Cornell introduced himself from Target. “Tar-zhay, right?” the president said with a smile. Still, the business that brought the retail leaders to Washington was serious. “Anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America,” the Target statement said. The border tax adjustment hits companies like Target and Best Buy very hard because they import so much of their inventory. Analysts say Target is more vulnerable than its major competitor, Wal-Mart, because the retailer relies more on the sales of foreign-made clothing and housewares, while Wal-Mart does a larger business in groceries that are not imported. But the tax weighs on all retailers who import significantly. That’s why the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group set up this week’s intervention. Cornell, Joly, and CEOs Bill Rhodes of AutoZone, Marvin Ellison of J.C. Penney Co., Art Peck of Gap Inc., Stefano Pesina of Walgreen Boots Alliance, Greg Sandfort of Tractor Supply and Jill Soltau of Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Store headed from the White House to the Capitol for scheduled meetings with heads of the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who oversaw the comprehensive tax reform proposal. The move toward a more protectionist economy was one of the president’s main campaign promises. The “America first” theme of his inaugural speech bolstered that goal. The Republican tax reform pushes in the same direction. While adding taxes on the sale of imported inventory, it removes taxes on U.S. exports. It also cuts the U.S. corporate tax rate to keep companies from relocating headquarters to countries with lower tax rates. In theory, the reform plan assumes that a better trade balance and a stronger dollar will offset consumer and business cost increases caused by the border adjustment tax. But in recent statements Trump has indicated some reservations about the tax. In a tweet Wednesday he called the meeting with the retail CEOs “a great listening session.” He also promised a new tax reform proposal soon: “We’re going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category. Including personal and business.” The unintended consequences of a border adjustment tax could include hits to the bottom lines of publicly traded companies that are big importers, said Luis Resendiz, who has advised international businesses for 20 years at the Minneapolis law firm of Fredrikson & Byron. Paying $12 for the Target T-shirt that used to cost $10 or paying $1,200 for the Best Buy high definition TV that used to cost $1,000 could lead to reduced sales, he said. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2llq1MC TOP VIDEOS Joe Nardone, CEO, Wayne County Airport Authority, tours DTW 2:25 Mike Ilitch: 'I fell in love with Midwestern friendliness' 2:40 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Walking the floor at the NAIAS Charity Preview 1:00 Biden admires Detroit, 'an iconic city' 2:15 Chinese automaker GAC reveals three new vehicles 1:57 Mercedes-Benz introduces new cars 2:48 Infiniti introduces QX50 concept 1:19 2018 Honda Odyssey introduced 0:54 Nissan introduces Vmotion 2.0 concept, Rogue Sport SUV 1:25 Paul Ryan CIA chief meets Palestinians’ Abbas in first top-level talks Karin Laub Trump signs Michigan Rep.

The comments by Ninth Judicial Circuit State's Attorney Aramis D. Ayala suggest that she could seek the death penalty for Loyd, who is accused of killing a woman pregnant with his child in December and then fatally shooting a police officer during a manhunt in January. But Ayala said no decision has been made. "We are eagerly anticipating a new statute from the Florida Legislature. And at that point, we will evaluate and determine whether we are seeking death on Markeith Loyd," Ayala said at a news conference Wednesday. Markeith Loyd, center, is escorted under heavy guard after a court hearing Jan. 26 in Orlando. Florida. Red Huber / AP - pool Loyd, 41, was indicted Wednesday on first-degree murder charges in the Dec. 13 killing of Sade Dixon, 24, and the Jan. 9 shooting death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, whom authorities said Loyd killed in a Wal-Mart parking lot.

Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including three counts of first-degree murder, in the deaths of Dixon, Clayton and Dixson's unborn child, NBC affiliate WESH reported. When Loyd was arrested on Jan. 17, police video from a helicopter appeared to show two law enforcement officers kicking him as he was on the ground, and he has appeared in court with a large bandage over his left eye.

Ayala said Wednesday that the investigation is ongoing. Orlando Police Chief John Mina has said Loyd tossed two handguns to the ground before he was arrested, refused to put his hands behind his back when on the ground and was considered extremely dangerous. "In the video he's — it does look like he's having trouble crawling to where the officers are. The officers were very concerned about what was underneath him," Mina said in January. After Loyd was handcuffed and officers removed his body armor, they found a large bag of ammunition on him, "so they didn't know what was under there," he said.

Traditional retail channels including hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores had a combined growth rate of merely 0.7 percent, as they were squeezed by a moderating economy and a rapidly growing e-commerce. Local retailers have been gaining position with Sun Art Group, which operates Auchan and RT-Mart brands, continues to top urban China's market with a 7.7 percent share, followed by Vanguard Group's 6.4 percent. Walmart saw its market share rebounded to 4.9 percent from 4.8 percent a year ago as a result of more focus on China’s hinterland and a more aggressive online-to-offline strategy. Yonghui remained the fastest growing player in 2016, rising 0.6 percentage points to 2.8 percent by the end of 2016 thanks to 79 new stores opening in the past year. As many as 53.5 percent of China urban families have purchased FMCG online, 10 percentage points higher than the previous year and mobile commerce continues to be the key driver of e-commerce and has helped to drive even stronger consumer adoption in lower cities, the report shows.

According to SLO City Attorney Christine Dietrick, the city has received two fiery complaints “alleging a variety of violations of state and local workplace laws and policies.” If you missed last week’s column, the concern was over a steamy video of various female SLO Chamber of Commerce employees making sexist remarks to Olson in a searingly funny (Not! It was dumb!) video shown at its annual dinner and briefly uploaded to YouTube. Olson, wearing a city-owned body cam, recorded the women asking about sexy firefighters and whether they’ll attend the annual Chamber dinner shirtless. I’m too sexy for my shirt! Yeah, who isn’t? The SLO City Firefighters’ Local 3523 union was particularly hot under the collar, issuing a statement that characterized the video as “highly offensive sexual objectification,” adding, “members of Local 3523 are disturbed, sad, and embarrassed.” Hey, I agree that if the roles were reversed—men were asking women to come topless to a dinner—it would be rank sexism, but let’s ask ourselves a simple question: Who’s more susceptible to workplace harassment, men or women? Obviously, neither is acceptable, but let’s get a little perspective here! Was the video ill-conceived? Yes, that’s why I shredded it last week, but those involved have been contrite. Olson emailed New Times, expressing his regret, noting he was trying to be “self-deprecating, not deprecating of others,” adding, “Rather than defend my actions in the public setting, my focus is to take responsibility for my actions and express my sincere regret.” Well, I guess an apology isn’t good enough for the union, who’s demanding an independent investigation, though they may just be engaging in petty politics. Just last November, the union filed a lawsuit in a federal court alleging the city miscalculated and underpaid overtime benefits to two-dozen members over three years. Is their complaint about their members being “sad” or did they see a chance to stick it to the city and take it? Look, getting screwed out of overtime is truly something to be concerned about, but should we waste more taxpayer funds to investigate a tasteless video in which no one was actually sexually harassed? Let’s not pretend this is a five-alarm fire when it’s really nothing more than an easily stomped out ember. Put on your big-boy boots and move on, you smoldering sexy firefighters! What’s for sure going to be investigated locally is Arroyo Grande Mayor Jim Hill, who can’t seem to stay out of trouble. He’s now being accused of violating the Brown Act, meaning he allegedly shared confidential information from closed session meetings. The Arroyo Grande City Council voted to appoint an independent investigator—the law firm Liebert Cassidy Whitmore—and allocate up to $15,000 to determine if Hill did stuff like give his wife the password to his city email account. Hill says this is a politically driven attack generated by his forceful condemnation of John Wallace, who is accused of funneling money from the South SLO County Sanitation District when we was an administrator into his own engineering company, The Wallace Group. It’s not looking good for Wallace, who served the sanitation district for 27 years … or was he actually serving himself? His trial will tell! As for Hill’s upcoming investigation, even his stalwart comrade in arms, Arroyo Grande City Councilman Tim Brown, couldn’t blindly back Hill. The mayor’s main vocal support came from Los Osos resident and former Los Osos Community Services District Director Julie Tacker, who’s been accused of copious political shenanigans herself, including bankrupting the district she previously served. I haven’t seen this much finger pointing since I was a 5-year-old playing cowboys and Indians. Bam-bam! It’s like a banana republic down there! Meanwhile up in Atascadero, opponents of the proposed Walmart are doing their happy dance after the retail giant withdrew its plans to build a store—plans that were dragged through 10 years of protests and litigation. Anti-Walmart group Save Atascadero co-founder Tom Comar told The Tribune that the project was “not suitable for our small town” and noted the decision “made Atascadero great again.” Why? Because it was great before the proposed store and now that the store’s not coming, Atascadero’s great again? Huh? Look, I like Atascadero as much as the next office machine, but I’ve seen better city planning carried out by a kid with a Lego™ set. Walmart, which was supposed to begin construction this July, claimed a focus on cyber-shopping led it to withdraw. City officials who backed the Walmart plan had projected $580,000 per year in sales tax—a pretty substantial loss of potential revenue—and Atascadero Councilwoman Roberta Fonzi was particularly unhappy, though instead of blaming Walmart or even Save Atascadero, she blamed California’s cumbersome development regulations as well as California Gov. Jerry Brown. Huh? It’s Governor Moonbeam’s fault? Check your water supply. I think it’s full of Kool-Aid®. To sum up, SLO wants to investigate a silly video, Arroyo Grande pols want to play I know you are but what am I, and Atascadero thinks Jerry Brown ruined their chance at having a Walmart? This seems like a good time to say, Thanks Trump! The Shredder has been scratching his head a lot, and it ain’t dandruff! Send ideas and comments to shredder@newtimesslo.com.

Washington Man Allegedly texts his Ex-boss Instead of Hitman to Kill his Wife & Daughter for $1.5m Life Insurance 15.02.2017 at 10:23 pm By BellaNaija.com 7 Comments Photo Credit: Facebook Police has arrested Jeff Lytle, 42, from Washington for allegedly trying to murder his Filipino wife, Rhoda Mee Funtanilla Lytle, and four year old daughter. According to PEOPLE, Lytle, a father of two mistakenly sent a message to his former boss, thinking it was to a hitman requesting the murders of his wife and daughter. The former boss who received the text on February 7th, notified Snowhomish County Sheriff’s Office. He was thereafter arrested on two counts of criminal solicitation for first-degree murder. He remains in police custody on $1 million bail and court records indicate he has yet to enter a plea to the charges he faces. In the message, Lytle allegedly said: “Hey Shayne how’s it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer.” Lytle went onto explain that the reason he wanted his wife killing was for her $1 million life insurance that he was willing to split ’50/50′ with the killer. “Life insurance is worth 1 million (and there’s a bonus if) you can kill my four-year-old daughter. If you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00. I’ll split everything with the insurance 50/50.” the message read. According to police, Lytle initially denied the message was from his phone, later admitted to authoring the text. He said the message was his way of “venting” his anger at his wife, the affidavit alleges. Lytle told police he knows no one named “Shayne,” and that the text in question was written months ago following an argument he had had with his wife. He allegedly told investigators he usually deletes these cathartic messages, and theorized his daughter may have sent the message after discovering it in his “Drafts” folder, reads the affidavit. According to the criminal complaint, Lytle’s wife told police the couple had been married for seven years and that she was aware of no marital distress. She said the couple have been struggling financially as Lytle has been out of work. About BellaNaija.com Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is investing billions in airline stocks Akin Oyedele Feb. 14, 2017, 4:38 PM 20,364 facebook linkedin twitter email print Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.Rick Wilking/Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway upped its holdings in various airlines during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The 13F filing showed that Berkshire took a new position in Southwest Airlines, buying 43.2 million shares valued at $2.15 billion. The company increased its stake in Delta Air Lines by 848% to 60 million shares worth $2.95 billion. Berkshire also raised its stake in American Airlines. Buffett continued to load up on airline stocks even after calling the sector a "death trap for investors" during his 2013 annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire hiked its ownership in Apple by 277%, buying 42.1 million shares valued at $6.64 billion. Buffett's most valuable holding remained Kraft Heinz, and no change was made to the stake worth $28.4 billion. Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express also remained top holdings. Berkshire dumped nearly all its Walmart shares, cutting its stake by 89%. Berkshire's combined portfolio gained 15% during the fourth quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index of US stocks gained 3.3%. Major investment firms including hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time lag, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filings are made.

It’s a question we get asked all the time that has a simple solution. Including prints from Google Photos. Read on to learn how to make copies of your photos. Whether its with your own printer, online services or even mailed right to your house. Advertisement Our smartphones are capable of taking amazing photos these days. At the same time, they don’t need to stay digital copies or be shared in low resolution on Facebook. Print them and save a beautiful image forever. Read: How to Hide Photos, Video and Apps on Android  Users don’t need any fancy expensive printers either. We can use Google Cloud Print, apps that are designed for manufacturer printers and much more. There are multiple different options available. This is how to print photos from an Android smartphone. Our goal here today is to show owners that they have a lot of ways to do this. Using their own printer, a local Walgreens, or popular services and apps that do it for you. I’ve received over 300 photos in the mail for free, just by paying shipping and handling and using an app from the Google Play Store. Advertisement So without further delay, this is how you too can print photos right from your Android smartphone or tablet. Print Photos With a Home Printer As long as you have a decent printer, or better yet a photo printer, doing this at home is a breeze. The results might not be the best but it’s one of the easiest options for most. You’ll want a photo printer, photo paper (I prefer matte over glossy) and preferably some special photo ink. Next all we need is to use one of the many different apps and services available. First up is Google Cloud Print, but we’ve had mixed results using it. Download the dedicated Google Cloud Print app, and follow the steps to connect it to a printer. There are Cloud Print enabled printers available to buy, but regular old wired printers work just fine too. Once they are connected simply hit the “Share” button on any photo, share it to Google Cloud Print, and you’re all done. It’s pretty easy. Advertisement However, we’d recommend a few other options first as the results have been iffy at best using Google’s service. Instead, most printers have either WiFi or Bluetooth by default, and will work in seconds. Alternatively, many WiFi printers will have options to let owners quickly email photos from their phone right to it. Then, just edit or print them at will. Using the built-in share feature on Android owners can share photos to a Printer in a slew of different ways. Not to mention most popular brands have their own dedicated applications for exactly that. I use HP ePrint, but other companies have similar solutions. Here’s a list. Download HP ePrint Brother iPrint & Scan Epson iPrint Canon Print Service even manufacturers like Samsung Cloud Print All of the applications above can be found on the Google Play Store (or just click our links) and are extremely easy to use. Just follow the instructions, pair a printer to a mobile device, and print on the fly. Some even work when you aren’t home or on the same WiFi connection. Advertisement Above is a screenshot showing how easy it is open a photo and hit share, send a photo to HP ePrint, and print a photo from an Android smartphone in seconds. Their application is dead simple to use, has some decent editing tools, and works every time for me. Give any of the apps above a try today or read on for other options. Print Photos Locally If you don’t plan on printing photos often, or don’t have a good quality printer, use local stores instead. Of course anyone can walk into Walmart and print photos with a little Kiosk, but other much better options are readily available. The first thing that comes to mind is the app Kicksend. It will find nearby stores like Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Target, FedEx Kinkos and other locations. Right from the application you can upload as many or as few as you’d like, and get them printed and ready for pick-up the same day. Kodak has a similar app for finding a Kiosk to print from, and the Walgreen’s app has a photo upload option. Find what’s best for you, and get started. Then just pick-up your photos whenever they’re ready. Upload Photos and Have Them Delivered Last but not least, is probably the best option of all. Surely many of you have seen the commercials for popular services like Shutterfly, especially around Valentine’s Day. These apps essentially allow users to upload endless amounts of photos right from our Android smartphones or tablets. Choose the photo size, special options like gifts or fridge magnets, and get them printed and delivered right to your door. Often times completely free. Advertisement In fact, the Kicksend app mentioned above has this option too. They recommend using their paid print service and have the photos delivered, rather than picking them up locally. Our first recommendation would by Shutterfly. Simply download the app and get unlimited free prints in 4×6 or 4×4 prints. Just pay for shipping. A few of my photos had the tops cut-off, but getting over 300 photos for free is too good to pass up. Shutterfly has good quality prints, and tons of gift options. Like candles, cup coasters, fridge magnets and much more. Not to mention the unlimited free 4×6 are perfect for photo albums or scrap-booking. Alternatively, we’d also recommend users check out Mpix, Snapfish or FreePrints. All of these have easy to use apps that allow us to print photos from Android smartphones or tablets. Send some as a gift, get photos delivered to your door and more. All for a low fee. Of course at the end of the day you could just transfer photos from any device to your computer, and print them yourself. Or add them to a USB thumb drive and take it to any local store for quick quality prints. There are multiple options available these days, so choose what’s right for you. For those wondering, all of these options work great on the iPhone too. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By Kris B. Mamula / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette A $35 million specialty hospital that’s under construction in Lancaster, Pa., is blazing what could be the future of health care by promising big savings with assurances of quality care and patient satisfaction. General acute care hospitals should worry. For-profit Clio Health could change health care in the way Netflix streaming movies and TV shows changed Blockbuster Video. The affiliate of venture capital firm Aspire Ventures of Lancaster is building a private, micro-hospital with four operating rooms — and space to add two more — where a palette of surgical procedures will be done: general, orthopedic, spine, vascular, urological and cosmetic. The surgical services are among the most lucrative for community hospitals, where revenue generated from higher-margin service lines such as cardiology is often funneled to so-called loss leaders, including mental health services and staffing primary care doctors’ offices. In this way, competition from Clio could dent the budgets of nearby community hospitals. “This is going to have a pretty dramatic impact on health care,” Clio CEO Joseph Frank said. “What I see is a nationwide movement.” Size may impede traditional health systems in keeping up with the likes of Clio, said David Simons, an anesthesiologist and president of the Lancaster City & County Medical Society. “They’ve become very large, cumbersome in their ability to cut costs,” he said. So far, Lancaster-area doctors are reacting to the nimbler Clio with curiosity, said Dr. Simons, who is not affiliated with Clio, while some doctors view its emergence as an opportunity. While doctors wait and see what happens in Lancaster, Clio is pressing ahead with ambitious expansion plans for four more hospitals by 2019. None have been announced for Western Pennsylvania — yet. “Pittsburgh is a very sophisticated medical market,” said Mr. Frank, a University of Pittsburgh graduate. “We would be able to develop a micro-hospital there that would be so much more affordable.” Micro-hospitals are gaining traction nationwide because of comparatively lower construction costs and generally higher reimbursement for services than urgent care or ambulatory surgical centers. Clio says it will discount its surgical services by one-third to 50 percent when compared to the local health system, depending on the procedure. Beating those prices could mean less revenue to support lower margin service lines at traditional hospitals, according to Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a Downtown-based consultant. Whether that creates financial headaches for community hospitals depends on the facility’s operating overhead and other factors. “The evidence around the country is that you could charge a lot less for surgery without cherrypicking patients,” ones with the richest commercial insurance coverage and lowest medical risk, Mr. Miller said. “The truth is there is a lot of cross subsidization going on” inside most hospitals. Clio’s financial plan also calls for limiting acceptance of government health plans for the elderly, poor and disabled, Medicare and Medicaid, which community hospitals are obligated to accept. The new micro-hospital will only accept Medicare and Medicaid for doctor bills, medical imaging and rehabilitation therapy — not hospital or surgery center care due to legal requirements, a spokesman said. Health care experts say Medicare and Medicaid pay hospitals less for care than commercial insurers, and in the case of Medicaid, often less than the cost of providing the service. In some areas of Pennsylvania, private surgical hospitals have siphoned patients with commercial insurance while leaving community hospitals to deal with poorer, sicker and more costly patients. Clio’s strategy includes offering direct contracting for surgical care, a strategy used by Wal-Mart, Boeing and other big employers to hold down health care costs. Under the arrangement, self-insured employer groups will be able to contract directly for surgical care for employees. In addition to lower cost, specialty hospitals overall report fewer facility-acquired infections and complications, shorter stays and more convenience when compared to regular hospitals. Mr. Frank said Clio will offer all of those advantages to employer groups, plus advertise its rates for surgical procedures, allowing patients to shop for savings when the hospital opens in early 2018. Nationwide, few hospitals disclose charges and none in Western Pennsylvania have adopted the practice. The 35-bed Clio is projecting that it will perform 2,000 operations in Lancaster during its first year. By comparison, the 328-bed St. Clair Hospital in Mt. Lebanon reported a combined 7,766 inpatient and outpatient surgeries for the six months ending Dec. 31. “This is the beginning of something interesting,” Mr. Frank said. “The timing is right.” Kris B.

Hot Topics: Missing mother, child Frog Belly Farm cleanup Longmont home prices double AG sues Boulder County Airport noise News tips Longmont Humane Society reopens expanded clinic By Karen Antonacci Staff Writer Posted:   02/15/2017 07:47:58 PM MST Updated:   02/15/2017 07:50:33 PM MST Sue Peterson and her 12-year-old blind basset hound Baxter marveled at the amount of people and pets in the newly-reopened Well Pet Clinic at the Longmont Humane Society on Wednesday afternoon. The Longmont Humane Society announced earlier this month that crews had finished renovating and expanding the clinic in order to accommodate more people bringing in their pets for services such as exams, spaying and microchipping. More than 7,500 pets in the Longmont community were treated at the clinic in 2016, according to a news release. On Wednesday, people filled the waiting room as staff reopened after the lunch break. A dachshund puppy wagged his tail under his owner's chair, a black labrador mix happily gobbled down free treats and a cat in a carrier looked out with wide eyes at the whole scene. The clinic expansion includes a new, 349-square-foot lobby and a new, 114-square-foot exam room. Carrie Brackenridge, marketing and communication manager for the Longmont Humane Society, said that anecdotally there have been more and more people coming in to get their pets checked out. "We've had a pretty high demand for our services from the community and with the renovation, we can accommodate more people from the community and the space flows much better and more efficiently for our staff," Brackenridge said. Kelli Kanemoto, Longmont Humane Society director of development, said in an email that the renovation cost a total of $140,000. The Longmont Humane Society covered 55 percent of that cost while a grant covered 25 percent and corporate support from Sun Construction, Sam's Club/Walmart Foundation and the Kenneth & Myra Monfort Charitable Foundation covered the other 20 percent, Kanemoto wrote. Advertisement Peterson brings Baxter, who is diabetic, to the clinic regularly so veterinarians can check his glucose levels. Peterson said she was impressed with the renovation and expanded waiting area. "Oh, I think it's wonderful. It used to be so crowded we would sit out in the hallway," Peterson said as Baxter plopped down to the ground with a grunt. "And we need some space because the dogs are not supposed to meet because you never know why a dog is in here or if they have something quite contagious. This looks way more professional — there used to be stuff piled up behind the (reception) desk." The Longmont Area Chamber of Commerce will hold a ribbon cutting at the renovated clinic at 4 p.m. Thursday.

Move over, oil and gas. Retail is set to replace the troubled energy sector as the most distressed sector this year, according to ratings agencies, lawyers and analysts, beaten down by the strain of competition from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.75% and a range of other issues. The sector’s future is looking increasingly gloomy, with the cost of digital investments, trimming excessive store locations and lagging revenue amid declining traffic setting the stage for a spate of bankruptcies and restructurings in 2017 and 2018, experts say. The sector is grappling with changing consumer behavior and shrinking discretionary spending as consumers are faced with higher prices for everything from rent to prescriptions to gasoline. Fitch Ratings’ “Bonds of Concern” list is filled with retailers, and the agency is expecting the default rate for the sector to jump to 9% in 2017 from 1% over the last 12 months. The retail sector had $38.9 billion in outstanding debt as of December. Research firm CreditSights has an underperform rating on the sector’s bonds. See: Retailers are expected to suffer big spike in bond default rate in 2017 ‘What’s different about 2017 is we’re clearly seeing significant disruption from the rapid movement to online. So at a time when they have significant debt loads, declines in traffic, they’re over-stored and e-commerce is still in investment mode, it presents a challenging profile.’ Steve Barr, PwC Charlie O’Shea, Moody’s lead retail analyst, said his firm has 19 retail and apparel companies with a Caa credit rating or below, “the highest amount of highly distressed retail and apparel names since the recession.” That places them at least seven notches into speculative, or “junk” status, making them high credit risks. S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the majority of outlooks across retail and restaurants are stable, but the ratings trends are negative. “Shifting consumer preferences, and patches of global economic and policy uncertainty are contributing to the increasingly negative outlook bias,” the agency said this week. Read: TJX, Burlington, and other off-price retailers could benefit most from 2017 tax reform Also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy,’ and there may be no remedy In 2016, the energy sector was hammered by defaults, distressed exchanges and bankruptcies, although the recent recovery in oil futures to back above $50 a barrel has raised hopes the worst is over. But the issues facing the retail industry threaten to overwhelm companies that don’t have the liquidity to adjust to the changing landscape. Despite positive January results, the hurdles facing the sector are adding up, but sales are not and it’s already taking a toll. Eastern Outfitters, whose chains include Eastern Mountain Sports and Bob’s Stores, filed for Chapter 11 protection last week, and The Limited filed last month, causing the company to close all its stores. Don’t miss: The restaurant recession turned even more damaging in December Other companies that have filed for Chapter 11 or completely liquidated in the past year include Wet Seal, American Apparel, Aeropostale Inc. AROPQ, +3.18% and Sports Authority. Macy’s Inc. M, +0.18% , Gap Inc. GPS, +0.79% , Sears Holding Corp. SHLD, +6.76% and Guess Inc. GES, -0.88% are among the retailers that have announced store closures in recent months. Macy’s and Sears are often anchor stores that are meant to draw traffic to malls and other shopping centers, and specialty stores like Gap depend on the boost. Traffic declines are bad for them, mall operators, the restaurants and food courts housed in those shopping centers, and other groups that depend on the mall ecosystem. See also: Sears restructuring plan lacks the one thing it needs most: a way to drive sales “What’s different about 2017 is we’re clearly seeing significant disruption from the rapid movement to online,” said Steve Barr, PwC’s consumer markets leader. He believes 2017 will be a “tipping point” and expects more bankruptcies heading into 2018, he said. “So at a time when they have significant debt loads [and face] declines in traffic, they’re overstored, and e-commerce is still in investment mode, [and that] presents a challenging profile,” said Barr. Many of the companies facing trouble are apparel retailers, raising an issue unique to this area: relevance. “Putting aside metrics like debts and cash, it seems harder to put your arms around it,” said Corali Lopez-Castro, partner at Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton. “Trying to keep up with what’s next, then how do you get it into stores, then consumers don’t think you’re cool. How do you give your brand the cool factor?” The question of how to get merchandise into stores only has one answer: quickly. So-called ast fashion, like e-commerce, has changed the way retailers sell and present merchandise. Lopez-Castro highlighted the swift inventory turnover at Zara, an Inditex ITX, +0.11% company. “That’s why the consumer comes back,” she said. “They go back to the store knowing that they’ll see something new.” See: If Amazon grocery shopping is going to catch on, shoppers have to change Also: Amazon’s aggressive warehouse and shipping strategy is paying off What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? Prolonged challenges can weigh on liquidity. “A lot of retailers can survive one bad year,” said Philip Emma, senior analyst at Debtwire, a news and research firm focused on fixed-income markets. “But it becomes a problem when you string together a number of bad years.” The 2015 holiday season, with its unusually warm weather and heavy promotions, hurt many retailers as shoppers were reluctant to buy warm winter clothing during a warm spell. The weather was more seasonal for the 2016 holidays, but the discounting persisted. Add competition and, in apparel, a lack of fresh trends, and there’s another holiday season that falls short. “For certain retailers, if the business model isn’t sustainable, an initial debt cut might not be enough to get them through,” said Joshua Friedman, legal analyst at Debtwire. While he was reluctant to say that retail would follow in the energy sector’s path to bankruptcies, it’s “not hard to see distressed retail going into the restructuring field.” See also: Trump border tax would be a major blow for the troubled retail and restaurant sector The calendar isn’t helping, either, with Easter, an important holiday after the lull of the first quarter, pushed back this year. “Retailers have to get the goods in and pay for them and then there will be a lag time that will hurt their cash flow and further exacerbate the issues,” said Chuck Tatelbaum, senior attorney in the bankruptcy and creditors’-rights department at the Tripp Scott law firm. As if that weren’t enough, there’s also political uncertainty, the specter of rising interest rates, and the task of trying to keep up, which all requires cash. “Do you have the runway to make this change?” asked Moody’s O’Shea, who looks to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.04% and all of the money it has spent to transform its business, from the multibillion-dollar purchase of Jet.com to price investments. “It’s expensive,” he said. “The problem for many of these retailers is do they have the financial flexibility to cross the river and get to the other side?” On Tuesday, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +0.20% BRK.A, +0.23% disclosed that it slashed its stake in Wal-Mart in the fourth quarter to 1.39 million shares from 12.97 million. The latest challenge facing the sector is a doozy: President Donald Trump and his administration are proposing the introduction of a border-adjusted tax, which would tax imported goods, possibly at a rate of 20%, and subsidize exports through rebates. Trump has called out many companies, particularly car makers, for producing in countries including Mexico and then shipping their products back into the U.S., arguing they should be taxed for behavior that is keeping well-paid jobs out of the country. See: Trump is playing a starring role on U.S. companies’ quarterly conference calls Retailers are major importers and apparel retailers import about 98% of their products. No surprise, then, that a group of retail CEOs, including top executives from Target Corp. TGT, +0.15% , Best Buy Inc. BBY, +1.39% , Gap Inc. and AutoZone Inc. AZO, +0.50% , were in Washington on Wednesday to meet with congressional leaders and Trump to make their case against a border tax. See also: Target, Gap, Best Buy and other retailers going to Washington to oppose border tax “Given that retail is the largest private-sector American employer, retailers support sound policies that spur economic growth and job creation,” said Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president of public affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is investing billions in airline stocks Akin Oyedele Feb. 14, 2017, 4:38 PM 20,364 facebook linkedin twitter email print Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.Rick Wilking/Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway upped its holdings in various airlines during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The 13F filing showed that Berkshire took a new position in Southwest Airlines, buying 43.2 million shares valued at $2.15 billion. The company increased its stake in Delta Air Lines by 848% to 60 million shares worth $2.95 billion. Berkshire also raised its stake in American Airlines. Buffett continued to load up on airline stocks even after calling the sector a "death trap for investors" during his 2013 annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire hiked its ownership in Apple by 277%, buying 42.1 million shares valued at $6.64 billion. Buffett's most valuable holding remained Kraft Heinz, and no change was made to the stake worth $28.4 billion. Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express also remained top holdings.

Washington Man Allegedly texts his Ex-boss Instead of Hitman to Kill his Wife & Daughter for $1.5m Life Insurance 15.02.2017 at 10:23 pm By BellaNaija.com 7 Comments Photo Credit: Facebook Police has arrested Jeff Lytle, 42, from Washington for allegedly trying to murder his Filipino wife, Rhoda Mee Funtanilla Lytle, and four year old daughter. According to PEOPLE, Lytle, a father of two mistakenly sent a message to his former boss, thinking it was to a hitman requesting the murders of his wife and daughter. The former boss who received the text on February 7th, notified Snowhomish County Sheriff’s Office. He was thereafter arrested on two counts of criminal solicitation for first-degree murder. He remains in police custody on $1 million bail and court records indicate he has yet to enter a plea to the charges he faces. In the message, Lytle allegedly said: “Hey Shayne how’s it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer.” Lytle went onto explain that the reason he wanted his wife killing was for her $1 million life insurance that he was willing to split ’50/50′ with the killer. “Life insurance is worth 1 million (and there’s a bonus if) you can kill my four-year-old daughter. If you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00. I’ll split everything with the insurance 50/50.” the message read. According to police, Lytle initially denied the message was from his phone, later admitted to authoring the text. He said the message was his way of “venting” his anger at his wife, the affidavit alleges. Lytle told police he knows no one named “Shayne,” and that the text in question was written months ago following an argument he had had with his wife. He allegedly told investigators he usually deletes these cathartic messages, and theorized his daughter may have sent the message after discovering it in his “Drafts” folder, reads the affidavit. According to the criminal complaint, Lytle’s wife told police the couple had been married for seven years and that she was aware of no marital distress. She said the couple have been struggling financially as Lytle has been out of work. About BellaNaija.com Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

Rumors 49 0 0 February 15, 2017 ‘Teen Mom 2’ Kailyn Lowry Responds To Rumors, Is She Pregnant? Lindsay Cronin Kailyn Lowry has admittedly gained weight in recent weeks, but is the Teen Mom 2 star pregnant with her third child? Following the birth of Jenelle Evans’ third child and Chelsea Houska’s second child, Kailyn Lowry admitted that she’d like to have another baby and a short time later, rumors began swirling online which suggested the reality star may be sporting a baby bump. After sharing a couple of photos of herself in Los Angeles, Kailyn Lowry was faced with fat-shaming comments, which she quickly addressed on her Twitter page. “I did put on a little weight this winter, huh? I’m happy though,” she explained to a fan who advised her against eating Chic Fil A and said she was “fat enough.” A post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:19pm PST Kailyn Lowry has also spoken out about the swirling pregnancy rumors. After being faced with comments including, “Anyone else think Kail looks pregnant?” and “Why does Kail look pregnant?,” Lowry told Radar Online she was not pregnant on February 15. Her rep also denied the rumors. Kailyn Lowry has been known to struggle with her weight in the past and although she once spoke of her workout plan and healthy eating, she ultimately chose to go under the knife for a number of procedures, including a butt lift and liposuction. In late 2015, prior to the news of her divorce from husband Javi Marroquin, Kailyn Lowry suffered a tragic miscarriage and later claimed her husband was unsupportive of her after the incident. A short time later, Marroquin was deployed to Qatar and Lowry was left to raise her two sons back home in Delaware. Throughout the first few months of his deployment, rumors swirled in regard to Kailyn Lowry’s potential divorce and in May of last year, months after her mommy makeover, the Teen Mom 2 star confirmed she and Marroquin had decided to end their marriage. In the months that followed, fans watched as the couple’s marriage came to an end on the show. A post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:04pm PST Kailyn Lowry has not confirmed a relationship with someone else since her split from Marroquin, but the reality star and mother of two has been linked to a number of people since her divorce was confirmed, including her female friend Becky Hayter. As for who Kailyn Lowry’s potential baby’s father would be, Radar Online claimed her mystery man might be a new boyfriend. The outlet also noted that Lowry’s ex-husband had busted the man in his home just days after he returned from his deployment. “I texted her and said can I drop Lincoln off and she was like, ‘I’m at Walmart right now come in an hour,'” Marroquin said during the episode. “We pull up earlier since Kail’s car as there and we see another car. I knock on the door, Lincoln goes in and I said, ‘Let me get my stuff’ and she won’t let me in. I’m like I’m not leaving my son with another dude here, not happening.” Kailyn Lowry has yet to confirm a possible new relationship, but on Valentine’s Day, February 14, she hinted on Instagram that she may have a new love in her life when she shared a photo of a vase filled with red roses and a candle. “Maybe it looks like I have a valentine?” Kailyn Lowry asked readers on Instagram. In addition to her hints at a new romance, Kailyn Lowry has also been sharing tons of photos of her two sons, Isaac and Lincoln, on Instagram in recent weeks. To see more of Kailyn Lowry and her co-stars, tune into Teen Mom 2 Season 7B on Monday nights at 9 p.m. on MTV.

Washington Man Allegedly texts his Ex-boss Instead of Hitman to Kill his Wife & Daughter for $1.5m Life Insurance 15.02.2017 at 10:23 pm By BellaNaija.com 7 Comments Photo Credit: Facebook Police has arrested Jeff Lytle, 42, from Washington for allegedly trying to murder his Filipino wife, Rhoda Mee Funtanilla Lytle, and four year old daughter. According to PEOPLE, Lytle, a father of two mistakenly sent a message to his former boss, thinking it was to a hitman requesting the murders of his wife and daughter. The former boss who received the text on February 7th, notified Snowhomish County Sheriff’s Office. He was thereafter arrested on two counts of criminal solicitation for first-degree murder. He remains in police custody on $1 million bail and court records indicate he has yet to enter a plea to the charges he faces. In the message, Lytle allegedly said: “Hey Shayne how’s it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer.” Lytle went onto explain that the reason he wanted his wife killing was for her $1 million life insurance that he was willing to split ’50/50′ with the killer. “Life insurance is worth 1 million (and there’s a bonus if) you can kill my four-year-old daughter. If you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00. I’ll split everything with the insurance 50/50.” the message read. According to police, Lytle initially denied the message was from his phone, later admitted to authoring the text. He said the message was his way of “venting” his anger at his wife, the affidavit alleges. Lytle told police he knows no one named “Shayne,” and that the text in question was written months ago following an argument he had had with his wife. He allegedly told investigators he usually deletes these cathartic messages, and theorized his daughter may have sent the message after discovering it in his “Drafts” folder, reads the affidavit. According to the criminal complaint, Lytle’s wife told police the couple had been married for seven years and that she was aware of no marital distress. She said the couple have been struggling financially as Lytle has been out of work. About BellaNaija.com Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

Look Back ... to thousands signing up for draft in Calhoun County By Bill Edwards 2 hrs ago (…) It was a proud day in Alabama history with the launching of a battleship bearing the state's name, fitted out to help win the war. Feb. 16, 1942, in The Star: Milk dealers of Anniston will meet at 2 p.m. tomorrow at the courthouse to discuss proposals to make retail deliveries every other day instead of every day. The proposal was brought about as a matter of conserving tires of the trucks. The public has been invited to attend the meeting. Milk dealers are anxious to please their customers but at the same time ascertain some way to conserve tires. Also this date: When the current draft-registration effort ends in Calhoun County, it’s expected that more than 3,000 men ages 20 to 45 will have signed up. The estimate was based on the census of 1940 as well as the number of people thought to have moved here in recent months for work. Feb. 16, 1992, in The Star: Three companies are vying to provide commuter airline service to the Anniston area, and officials with the U.S. Department of Transportation are expected to decide by mid-March which one gets the deal. The competition arose when Skybus Express, which now provides commuter service from Anniston and Gadsden to Atlanta, informed federal transportation officials during the summer that it could not make a reasonable profit on its operations, even with an annual federal subsidy. Also this date: A relatively new concept in Wal-Mart retailing, the Supercenter, comes to Alabama this fall. The company’s first store of that type in Alabama will be built this year on a 20-acre site in Jasper. It was a proud day in Alabama history with the launching of a battleship bearing the state's name, fitted out to help win the war.

Each method has pros and cons. Your best bet is to stay flexible. iStockphoto By Lisa Gerstner, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, March 2017 Money has a long and diverse history. Several millennia ago, cattle and other livestock served as currency. Later, cowrie shells—from mollusks found in the Indian and Pacific oceans—were traded far and wide, from transactions in ancient China to the Atlantic slave trade. North American colonists briefly paid for goods and services with wampum—strings of beads that Native Americans crafted from clam shells. SEE ALSO: 10 Reasons You'll Never Get Out of Debt These days, your payment options usually boil down to paper or plastic: hard cash or a check, or a credit or debit card. With newer technologies, you can link your payment accounts to an app, allowing you to pay with your smartphone or, say, split the dinner check by sending money to a friend. Most people pack a range of options. A study by ATM operator Cardtronics found that 85% of consumers used at least two payment methods each month, and 55% used at least three. To help you make the most of different ways to pay, we’ve outlined the benefits and the pitfalls of each. With payments becoming more complex and varied, you have a lot to consider. But at least you don’t have to stuff your wallet with squirrel pelts or tobacco—two other payment methods found in the history books. The Credit Card Advantage For disciplined spenders, credit cards have the edge. A big plus is the potential to earn hundreds—or even thousands—of dollars in rewards each year (see Master the Rules of Credit Cards to Maximize Your Rewards). With the no-fee Citi Double Cash card, for example, you get 1% cash back when you make a purchase and an additional 1% when you pay the bill, for a total of 2%, on everything you buy. Other cards offer bigger rewards for spending in certain categories. The American Express Blue Cash Preferred card ($95 annual fee) pays 6% cash back on up to $6,000 in supermarket purchases yearly, 3% on money spent at gas stations and select department stores, and 1% on everything else. Frequent travelers may choose to use cards that earn points or miles that are redeemable toward flights, hotel stays and other travel-related purchases. (For more of our favorite rewards cards, see The Best List) Advertisement TAKE OUR QUIZ: How to Get Out of Debt Paying for a big-ticket item with a credit card reaps big benefits. Besides earning points or cash back, you can take advantage of the grace period: You have at least 21 days from the time the card issuer sends you your statement until the bill is due, with no interest charges on purchases if you aren’t carrying a balance. Some cards offer an interest-free period on purchases and balance transfers for the first several months after you open an account. Citi Simplicity, for example, charges 0% for a lengthy 21 months, then an annual percentage rate ranging from 13.49% to 23.49%. Many credit cards add layers of consumer protection. For example, most cards from major issuers extend manufacturers’ warranties by at least a year for items that you buy with the card. If your card offers purchase protection, you may be able to get a refund, repair or replacement for an eligible item that is damaged, lost or stolen within a few months of buying it. If you buy something with a card that has price protection and find a better deal on the item within two to three months, you may be able to get a refund of the difference. Travelers often enjoy a host of perks, too. Many cards provide insurance coverage for damage to a rental car that you reserve and pay for with the card (you must decline any supplemental insurance coverage the rental agency offers). Some also reimburse you for lost or delayed luggage and even provide travel cancellation or accident insurance coverage. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card ($95 annual fee, waived the first year), for example, provides accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000 for air, bus, train or cruise transportation that you book with the card; up to $10,000 refunded per trip that is canceled or shortened because of sickness, bad weather or other qualifying reasons; and up to $3,000 per passenger for baggage lost or damaged on a flight. SEE ALSO: Best Rewards Credit Cards for Your Wallet If a thief gets ahold of your credit card or card data, you have stronger legal protections than with a debit card. Your liability is capped at $50. And card networks American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa all have zero-liability policies that protect credit card holders in case of fraudulent purchases. If you report any credit card lost or stolen before any unauthorized charges appear, or if only the card number—but not the physical card—is stolen, you’ll have no liability. If you find an error on your credit card bill—say, a duplicate charge or one for an item you never received—you have the right to dispute the charge and withhold payment on it until the card issuer resolves the case. Advertisement The downsides. If you don’t pay your bill in full, interest will kick in—typically on any unpaid portion of the balance. And in the next billing cycle, you’ll incur interest on new purchases starting on the date you make them. Sometimes you’ll pay additional fees if you use a card. If you pay your federal income taxes with a card, you’ll pay an extra 2% to 4% of the bill because the IRS uses third-party processors. Retailers may pass on fees of up to 4% to customers who use Visa or MasterCard, as long as such businesses clearly post their policy and don’t run afoul of laws in several states that prohibit the practice. Plus, if you pay your credit card bill late, you could be hit with a penalty as high as $38. (Late payments also hurt your credit score.) If you think you’ll lose control of your spending with a credit card, consider keeping one around and using it, say, only for gas or other regular purchases that don’t tempt you to overspend. A history of on-time payments on a credit card helps boost your credit score—and a high credit score qualifies you for the lowest interest rates on mortgages and other loans. SEE ALSO: Best of the Low-Fee Credit Cards The Discipline of Debit Cards If you like the convenience of paying with plastic but prefer to spend within the limits of your bank balance, you probably tend to reach for your debit card when you’re at the register. And when you pay with a debit card (as with a credit card), you can track your spending by eyeballing your monthly statement. Some checking accounts pay an enticing interest rate on the balance, as well as refund out-of-network ATM surcharges if you use your debit card several times a month and meet other requirements. With the UltimateAccount from Northpointe Bank, you’ll earn 5% on a balance of up to $5,000 if you make 15 debit card purchases monthly totaling $500 or more, receive electronic statements, and have a monthly direct deposit or withdrawal of at least $100. Plus, the account refunds up to $10 a month in out-of-network ATM fees. The Free Rewards Checking account from Consumers Credit Union (Illinois) yields up to 4.59% on a balance of up to $20,000 if you use your debit card 12 times monthly at the register (you have to sign rather than enter a PIN to verify the purchase) and meet a few other requirements. All ATM fees are refunded. To search for other accounts that are available to you locally and nationally, visit www.depositaccounts.com. Advertisement Many institutions halted their debit rewards programs years ago, and the programs that remain aren’t typically as lucrative as those offered by the best credit cards. But it’s worth checking whether your bank offers discounts at certain merchants or points for money you spend using your debit card. Some independent services allow you to link to your debit card to earn rewards. Enroll any American Express, MasterCard or Visa debit card or credit card in Thanks Again and you’ll earn one point per dollar when you use it at eligible airport merchants, restaurants and parking facilities. Points are convertible to participating loyalty programs, including American Airlines AAdvantage, Hilton HHonors, Southwest Rapid Rewards and United MileagePlus. You can also link an American Express, MasterCard or Visa debit or credit card with Fuel Rewards. When you spend a specified amount on your card at participating restaurants and merchants, you’ll get a discount on gas at eligible Shell stations. For every $50 spent on dining, for example, you’ll get 10 cents off per gallon. And just for being a member, you’ll get at least 3 cents off per gallon every time you fuel up. SEE ALSO: Is Credit Card Debt Out of Control? The downsides. Legally, debit cards have weaker fraud protections than credit cards. Your liability is capped at $50 in unauthorized charges if you notify your bank within two business days of learning that your debit card has been lost or stolen, but you could be on the hook for up to $500 if you report a missing card after those two days have passed. And if you wait more than 60 calendar days after your statement is sent, you could possibly be responsible for all the money stolen from your account. If you report a missing debit card before any suspicious charges appear, you’ll have no liability. And if your card number, but not the card itself, is used fraudulently, you won’t be responsible for unauthorized charges if you contest them within 60 days of the statement containing them being mailed to you. In practice, your bank will likely refund any unauthorized charges as long as you notify it promptly of a lost or stolen debit card. But you may have to wait several days to get the money back in your account. Advertisement It’s tempting to spend more than you have in your checking account if you enroll in overdraft protection, and the fees can be ugly, at a median $30 a pop if the bank covers the overdraft for you, according to economic-research firm Moebs Services. Arranging an automatic transfer of money from savings to checking in case of overdraft can also incur charges of as much as $15 per transfer. (If you have no overdraft protection, merchants will decline your debit card.) SEE ALSO: The Best Card for Your Credit Style Cash Is Still King Although the use of cash declined from 40% of consumer transactions in 2012 to 32% in 2015, it’s still the most frequently used payment method at stores, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. That’s especially true for transactions of less than $10. Cash is the ultimate budgeting tool because once it’s gone, it’s really gone. “It is very hard to fully comprehend the amount of money you are spending when you never physically possess it,” says Robert Solimano, a certified financial planner and founder of Angel Oak Financial Services. He counsels young clients to use cash whenever possible, “so that they may feel the pain of actually being separated from the money they earn.” Many in the under-40 set are happy to oblige. The San Francisco Fed study found that the 18-to-34 age group preferred cash more than older age groups. And a study from TD Bank shows that 44% of millennials aren’t using credit at all, with some citing concerns about racking up debt with a credit card. SEE ALSO: 10 Financial Decisions You Will Regret Forever Paying with cash could earn you a discount. Merchants are charged fees each time you use a credit or debit card, so some smaller retailers charge less to customers who hand over cash. Some gas stations, for example, shave off a few cents per gallon of gas if you make a cash payment. The downsides. The average fee for withdrawing cash from an ATM outside of your bank’s network—including the charge from the ATM’s operator as well as one from your own bank—has hit a record high of $4.57, according to a survey from Bankrate.com. If you frequently pay with cash, you’ll benefit from using a bank that has a wide network of ATMs in your area or that reimburses fees for out-of-network ATM with­drawals. Online banks tend to have more-generous reimbursements than big national banks. Ally Bank, for example, reimburses up to $10 a month in ATM fees with its free Interest Checking account, which yields up to 0.6%, depending on the balance. Cash is immune to the data breaches that plague credit card users. But remember, if your credit or debit card is hacked or goes missing, you have liability protections. Lose a wad of cash and you will probably never see it again. The Prepaid Option A prepaid debit card, unlike a traditional debit card, is not tied to a checking account. But many prepaid cards offer similar functions, such as direct deposit and the ability to make purchases, pay bills and withdraw cash at the ATM. A prepaid card that carries no overdraft option may be a good choice if you have trouble staying within a spending limit. The fees can add up, though, with some cards levying monthly and cash-reload fees, plus other charges. We like Bluebird by American Express & Walmart for its combination of low fees and handy features. SEE ALSO: Master the Rules of Credit Cards to Maximize Your Rewards Starting in October 2017, prepaid cards will be subject to federal rules that require clear disclosure of account terms, limit the fees and interest associated with an overdraft line of credit, provide timely dispute resolution, and limit fraud liability (including a $50 liability cap for customers who report a lost or stolen card within two days of learning that it has gone missing). The regulations affect other electronic prepaid accounts, too, including some mobile wallets and peer-to-peer payment apps. Peer-to-Peer Payments: Alternatives to Cash Cash may be your first choice to pay the babysitter or reimburse a coworker for picking up the tab at lunch. But peer-to-peer payment tools, such as Square Cash, PayPal and Venmo (owned by PayPal), have made strides in mimicking the speed and ease of moving plain old cash. And in some ways, they’re more convenient: You can zap money to your sister on the other side of the country without pulling out your checkbook. Typically, you’ll need the recipient’s e-mail address or phone number to send money, and he or she will have to be comfortable sharing account information with the app. Depending on the service, you may have a choice of linking directly to your bank account, debit card or credit card or transferring money from your bank account to be stored by the service until you’re ready to use it. Square Cash and Venmo charge 3% of the amount sent if you use a credit card, and PayPal charges 2.9% plus 30 cents if you send money with a debit or credit card. SEE ALSO: 11 Overlooked Credit-Card Perks Banks have joined forces, too. Several institutions that belong to the ClearXchange network—including Bank of America, Capital One 360, Chase, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo—allow customers to send and receive money instantly with their bank accounts. In 2017, the consortium is rebranding its network with the name Zelle, which will come with a stand-alone mobile app. Anyone with a U.S. checking or savings account can receive money, and Zelle has agreements with Visa, MasterCard and other networks to open more avenues for banks to participate.
