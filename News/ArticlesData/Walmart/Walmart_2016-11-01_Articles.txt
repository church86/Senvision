Chemung County Sheriff's Deputies began pursuing an unidentified suspect after security at the Walmart in Corning reported a man trying to leave the store with a cart full of stolen merchandise around 8:00 a.m., WETM-TV reported. Security was able to recover the items, but the suspect fled on foot. Deputies found the suspect about 40 minutes later hiding in a ditch on the side of County Route 64, and he fled again. The suspect ran to the parking lot of a nearby Jo-Ann Fabrics, and stole the key of a woman who was exiting her vehicle. The suspect reportedly fled the parking lot in the car with two sheriff's units in pursuit. The chase moved to State Rt. 352 in Steuben County before the fleeing driver collided with a car in the eastbound lane.

The exact details of the video aren’t clear — including where or when it was filmed — but it has made the rounds on the internet early this week, prompting anger and disgust from those who have commented on it. In the video, the couple reportedly stands alone in an empty aisle before starting to have sex. As Crave Online noted, the man appeared to look out several times to make sure the coast was clear before continuing the act. In all, the Walmart sex tape lasted about two minutes, the outlet noted. As the report noted, the Walmart sex tape wasn’t leaked to the internet — it was released quite intentionally. “This couple actually uploaded the footage to the internet themselves, because that’s what you do nowadays,” the report noted. “But hey, good thing the woman was wearing what barely qualify as shorts, as it made it easier on this classy dude.” [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] There are still plenty of questions about the explicit video, including the biggest question of why anyone would want to do something like that inside a children’s aisle. But the location of the video is still unknown, as is the exact store. And while it has been identified as Walmart in news reports, the tall shelves and plastic-wrapped boxes look like something more commonly seen in a warehouse club store like Costco or Sam’s Club. The Walmart sex tape is not the only bit of misbehavior in the retail giant making headlines. A few weeks ago, a man inside a Houston-area Walmart store was investigated by local police after he was seen dragging his young daughter through the store by her hair. Witnesses snapped pictures of the very public act of abuse, which the man reportedly continued throughout his shopping trip. Reports indicated that the man was attempting to punish his children for misbehaving. “His three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her,” the Houston Chroniclereported. https://t.co/cxLTYopGxf — ABC 7 WWSB (@mysuncoast) September 21, 2016 The story went viral after a fellow shopper snapped pictures of the Walmart hair-pulling incident and uploaded them to Facebook along with a story of how police at the scene allowed the man and his children to go free. As witness Erika Burch noted in her post, the young girl was pleading with her father to stop the punishment. “Me and Robert are in Walmart in Cleveland Texas getting lunchables for our babies for school. Robert said “Do you see what that guy is doing to that little girl?” I turned around to this this pos dragging this little girl by the hair of her head!! He had her hair wrapped around the buggy dragging her! She is begging him to stop! She was saying ‘please stop,I promise I won’t do it again please stop!’ I took my phone out snapped pictures and then told him to let the little girls hair go! He told me to mind my own business! I said ‘No I’m not! Right now this little girl is my business and you need to let her hair go now!…” There could be some consequences for the still-unidentified couple in the Walmart sex tape as well. As Dude Comedy reported (via Crave Online), the pair have been banned from the store. It is not clear if they are being investigated by police. Anyone curious to see the Walmart sex tape can see some (censored) images at Crave Online, though the full video is not available there.

Consider yourself warned: It looks like we have the makings of a holiday toy craze on our hands. "For the last four years, there has been nothing comparable to the instant sales success within weeks of launch as Hatchimals," Juli Lennett, U.S. toys industry analyst at The NPD Group, told CNBC. Hatchimals, an interactive toy that hatches from a plastic egg, has sold out online at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, Amazon and at most Target stores. And the bidding is already getting fierce on sites like eBay. "The closest comparable new launch of a property would be Disney Frozen in 2013, which had a movie tie-in. Hatchimals is off to an even stronger start than Disney Frozen," Lennett said. "This could be the 'Tickle Me Elmo' of 2016." Spin Master released the toy in early October and it quickly started flying off the shelves. All five "species" of the toy — Pengualas, Draggles, Owlicorns, Burtles and Bearakeets — sell for around $50 and are very hard to find. Adding to the frenzy is the fact that several major retailers have exclusive selling rights to specific types of Hatchimals. Wal-Mart is the only retailer that sells Burtles, Target has the exclusive rights to Bearakeets and Toys R Us is the sole seller of Owlcorns. Representatives for Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Spin Master were not immediately available to comment. Kids must nurture the speckled egg in order to begin the hatching process. The toy will tap and peck at the plastic egg until it cracks open and a furry animatronic creature emerges. Then kids can interact with the Hatchimal and teach it to walk and talk. An employee at a Target in Edgewater, New Jersey, told CNBC that the toy was sold out at that location and she had lost count of the number of times people had called the store looking for it. Hatchimals can be found on eBay at prices ranging from $100 and to nearly $1,000, and on Facebook Marketplace for between $100 and $200. Several eBay users have put the toy up for more than $9,999, but are accepting lower offers. John Rodrigues, a firefighter from Rye, New York, is one of those sellers, but he doesn't expect anyone to pay nearly $10,000 for a toy. "Unless it was going 100 percent to charity, I would never let anybody pay that kind of money," he told CNBC. Instead, the high price tag was a tactic to lure eBay users who were searching for Hatchimals, and were curious about the most expensive options, to his auction page. Once there, users could click the "make offer" button and send in an lower priced offer. Rodrigues said that several people have clicked the "buy it now" button, but had no intention of actually purchasing the item. He canceled those orders, but they still appear as sold items on his page. He has made one sale so far, garnering $100 for the toy, and earning himself about $40. The majority of eBay sellers appear to have sold the Hatchimals for about $120 each. A bundle of three Hatchimals sold for almost $300 and a bundle of four sold for $450.

IT organizations that build their own software are moving to make that software available under an open source license. Case in point is Walmart, which is now making a React/Node.js application platform dubbed Electrode available as an open source project. Alex Grigoryan, director of software engineering for the Application Platform at Walmart Labs, says even though Walmart has spent millions of dollars developing Electrode, the retailer has a vested interest in recruiting other IT organizations to contribute code to extend the core platform. “We’re looking for contributions that can help us stay on the cutting edge,” says Grigoryan. Electrode is only the latest in a series of open source projects that Walmart contributes code to on a regular basis. In fact, members of the Walmart Labs IT team told attendees at a recent OpenStack East 2016 conference that Walmart is considering making the software it uses to manage DevOps available as open source code. While Walmart would no doubt benefit from external code contributions, the code it’s making available also helps level the IT playing field against archrival Amazon for any company engaged in e-commerce. Other retailers may not have much more love for Walmart than they do for Amazon, but they do stand to benefit from the rivalry between the two retailer giants as Walmart essentially moves to arm the entire e-commerce sector with free software. Naturally, providers of commercial e-commerce software may not be quite as thrilled by that prospect. But Electrode does show how organizations are starting to turn custom software they create into open source code that furthers their own competitive agendas. As more IT organizations come to the same conclusion, the opportunity to change the way software is created and consumed across the enterprise winds up being nothing less than profound.

The latest Wal-Mart patent application, dated September 8, 2016, is titled “Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods.” The patent application claims a system for bringing shopping carts to customers. The system includes a plurality of sensors and motorized transport units. The units then interact with a user interface associated with each customer. Separate and related patent applications include a patent application allowing the motorized transport units to retrieve a locker, a mother vehicle containing a plurality of motorized terrestrial transport units, and an individual user interface to control the motorized transport units. ipbiz In general, the shopping carts are novel inventions, yet they essentially involve a ‘Roomba’ style robot attached to the underside of a shopping cart. This Roomba like device called a “motorized transport unit” will drive the cart around the store as directed by the customer. The system is based on a sensor-rich world including central computers that track inventory and match customer needs to what’s available in the store. Essentially, the system operates similar to an online search function. However, the whole process is done in real time by robots and computers. There is a limit to this concept though because the robots are limited to selections within the physical bounds of the store. popsci This can be advantageous though as it allows the robots to cross-sell items and suggest associated items based on previous customer selections in the store. forbes This type of marketing technique may eventually expand to carts taking “accidental” detours in order to promote products and offer specific coupons. computerworld The cart locates customers using a method which includes LEDs “mounted in the ceiling” at known positions throughout the store. A typical smart phone display screen can be used as a light sensor to receive and process data encoded from the LED light sources. The patent also considers low-energy radio beacons, typically using Bluetooth and audio beacons to communicate with the shopper. computerworld Four years ago, Microsoft partnered with the Whole Foods grocery chain and tested a similar idea. However, Microsoft suffered from a few technical issues. It tried to navigate carts by using infrared dots in combination with a laser. Yet, when the shopping carts were near windows or skylights, the infrared dots got washed out by the sunlight and couldn’t be detected. computerworld The main motivation for these patents is the competition that exists between “brick and mortar” stores and online shopping websites. Therefore, Wal-Mart is seeking to improve both customer experience and convenience. For example, during peak hours employees are not always available to answer questions about products or guide shoppers through the store. Shopping carts are also often left abandoned, aisles become messy, and inventory becomes misplaced. Wal-Mart hopes that their shopping carts will alleviate many of these shopping problems. ipbiz It seems that Wal-Mart wants to implement these carts in order to be seen as an innovative brand. Even if shoppers see this as a novelty item for their stores, Wal-Mart will nevertheless be recognized for this idea. As Wal-Mart said in a related company statement, “We want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop.” Wal-Mart also strives to find ways to “help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers.” In effect, Wal-Mart is patenting its new shopping cart technology to capitalize on the interests of its employees and shoppers alike. cbsnews Tags: #walmart #shoppingcarts #shopping #robot #technology #userinterface Leave a Reply Cancel reply ← Approving Generic Drugs via an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Don’t Cut The Cheese: The Importance of GI’s in Transatlantic Trade → Follow Us!

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next If you were a child during a certain time in the 70's or 80's, no doubt you remember the Sears Wish Book. It was a giant (or so it seemed to a 7-year old) book filled with all sorts of toys, bicycles, toy kitchen sets, robots and other things kids dreamed of for the holidays. The book was a starting point for millions of Christmas wish lists. Those days are long gone, but other stores are stepping forward to fill the void with smaller toy books of their own in 2016. Wal-Mart Book Released You know the holiday season is getting close when the big toy books start to leak, that show the expected hottest toys of the season. The website BF Ads.net has just released a scan of the 32 page Wal-Mart Holiday Toy Catalog.  It includes more than 200 hot toys, many chosen by kids as their favorite. Some are "only at Wal-Mart" toys, so if your young one wants them, you will have to shop Wal-Mart: they won't be available anywhere else. But don't expect any great deals in the book: BF Ads says those will come with the Wal-Mart Black Friday ad in a couple of weeks. Toys r Us Toy Book Released Wal-Mart's book comes just days after the release of Toys R Us' 2016 Toy Book. This is one worth getting your hands on, according to BF Ads.net, because it actually contains valuable store coupons  and can be used now.  See the highlights here. Target Toy Book Released Target has also released it's 2016 Toy Spectacular catalog. While not as big as the Toys R Us or Wal-Mart books, it has some good toys at good prices, according to BF Ads, and gives a good idea of the hottest video games and electronics, in fewer pages.' All of these however are just to whet the appetite and help kids create wish lists. Where are the Black Friday ads? The real deals will appear in the Black Friday fliers, which are expected in the days right after Election Day. And we will probably all need some diversion after the election. As always, don't waste your money. _________________ “Don't Waste Your Money” is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc. (“Scripps”).

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 2, 2016 at 7:22AM Image source: Getty Images. Once again, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported an industry-leading number of postpaid net adds in the third quarter. Its 851,000 net postpaid phone additions marks 11 straight quarters T-Mobile has led the major wireless carriers. The Q3 numbers were reported Oct. 24. But investors who looked over the company's reported operating metrics for the quarter may have noticed that the number of postpaid phone subscribers on T-Mobile's books actually declined 514,000. That's a pretty big discrepancy that needs some delving into. Fortunately for us, T-Mobile was very forward in detailing what exactly is going on here. "The MVNO transaction" In T-Mobile's press release and 10-Q filing with the SEC, it makes reference to an "MVNO transaction" and details the impact on its operations. MVNO stands for mobile virtual network operator and T-Mobile is referring to a deal it struck with Tracfone to transfer over its Walmart Family Mobile sub-brand. T-Mobile previously accounted for those subscribers as branded customers, but with Tracfone now operating the brand, they'll be moved to its wholesale line. T-Mobile details all the accounting on its operating metrics release. Specifically, it's moving 1.365 million postpaid phone customers and 326,000 prepaid phone customers to Tracfone. (Not all of these are Walmart Family Mobile customers, but the vast majority are.) The company's transparency is quite welcome, considering its competitors' similar disclosures, or lack thereof. Sprint (NYSE:S) relegated a similar deal to a footnote in its earnings release, and AT&T (NYSE:T) completely ignores customers who switch from its retail wireless service to its enterprise service when counting net adds. Why T-Mobile is distancing itself from Wal-Mart T-Mobile partnered with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in 2010 to establish the Walmart Family Mobile brand. At that time, Wal-Mart's 5,000-plus stores offered a valuable geographic footprint for T-Mobile. It allowed it to reach customers in more rural areas where it didn't have many storefronts. But T-Mobile is aggressively expanding the number of stores it operates for both its flagship "Magenta" and MetroPCS brands. This year alone, the company plans to open 1,000 MetroPCS stores and 400 T-Mobile stores. The 400 new T-Mobile stores will reach an additional 30 million to 40 million people. T-Mobile isn't the only company adding new stores. AT&T plans to open 900 stores for its prepaid Cricket Wireless brand this year, and Sprint added over 1,400 new stores last year with its co-branded RadioShack stores. Even so, T-Mobile clearly feels its physical footprint is large enough that it can go without directly selling phones through Wal-Mart. How the move will affect T-Mobile's results going forward Walmart Family Mobile customers are typically lower-value customers than those in T-Mobile's flagship brand or its MetroPCS prepaid brand. T-Mobile is giving up some of the revenue those customers generate in its deal with Tracfone, but it received some capital to deploy on real estate, spectrum, or other capital expenses. (The companies didn't reveal the details of the transaction.) T-Mobile noted in its earnings release that had the transaction gone through at the beginning of the quarter instead of Sept. 1, its postpaid phone churn would have been 1.20% for the quarter. That's a 12-basis-point improvement over its reported results. Additionally, Walmart Family customers also had lower average revenue per account than T-Mobile brand customers. As a result, T-Mobile will see a modest boost in APRU. That will offset the negative impact of more family plans in T-Mobile's base. While the deal will have an overall net positive impact on T-Mobile's operating metrics, it's hard to know the real value it's getting out of the MVNO transaction without the exact details of the agreement. With the strong net additions T-Mobile reports every quarter, it won't take long for the company to make up the difference. Adam Levy has no position in any stocks mentioned.

As per the report, circulars from retailers like Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart repeat products, prices from holidays past. Target Corp.'s 2015 Black Friday circular's front page was almost identical to the front page of its 2014 circular. Both displayed Beats headphones, a Nikon digital camera, and DVDs with same prices, except an Xbox gaming console that changed price. WSJ noted, citing Brad's Deals, a website that tracks retail discounts, that Target's each Black Friday circular since 2008 has featured a Razor scooter, with the price fluctuating between $17 and $22. Wal-Mart Stores' Black Friday newspaper inserts for the past two years have included a $49 Toshiba hard drive, a $19 Pyrex Bake-n-Store set and a $49.97 Brother sewing machine. The report also noted that the circulars of Best Buy Co., Kohl's Corp., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. also have featured many items and prices without much change. For three years running, the front page of Macy's Black Friday circular has featured Rampage boots for $19.99. The past two circulars of Best Buy have showcased a $779.99 11.6-inch MacBook Air, $224.99 Klipsch Reference dual 8-inch speakers and a $74.99 Amazon Fire TV. Meanwhile, the retailers reportedly noted that they are simply catering to customer tastes, and that some products and categories such as toys and small appliances tend to be popular year over year. In order to mitigate risks in the crucial shopping time, they showcase the products that were successful in the previous year. For years, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, remained one of the busiest shopping days of the year, even though it is losing its preference these days with more and more online shopping. WSJ noted that the trend is likely to continue as the retailers are under pressure to contain costs.

Hong / Associated Press Five nonprofits in the Pittsburgh region received a share of $1.26 million that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation provided to support healthy food and nutrition programs. From staff and wire reports Ampco-Pitt posts loss Ampco-Pittsburgh reported a third quarter loss of $23.1 million, or $1.88 per share, as the Carnegie metals industry supplier was weighed down by a tax-related charge of $22.6 million, or $1.84 per share. Sales rose 43 percent to $82.9 million, reflecting the March acquisition of Akers AB. The company has issued layoff warnings to 184 workers at Akers’ Avonmore plant in Westmoreland County. Ampco-Pitt said 164 workers will be affected by the notice. Separately, the company said it will pay $13.1 million to acquire ASW Steel, a specialty steel producer based in Welland, Ontario. Black Box reports loss but turnaround continues Losses at Washington County-based Black Box Corp. were down sharply for the three months ending Oct 1 as the company continues a turnaround plan. The struggling communication and information technology equipment company reported a net loss of $6.1 million for the quarter, which compared to a loss of $130 million for the same period a year ago. The earnings per share loss was 40 cents, which compares to a loss of $8.45 per share a year ago. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $164.3 million, off from $165.4 million a year ago. Walmart funds food programs Five nonprofits in the Pittsburgh region received a share of $1.26 million that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation provided to support healthy food and nutrition programs throughout Pennsylvania. The recipients are: 412 Food Rescue, Pittsburgh, $4,550 for food education programs; the city of Uniontown’s parks and recreation department, $32,000, and the city of Pittsburgh’s Department of Parks and Recreation, $20,000, for meals and nutrition education for children; and Valley Points Family YMCA, New Kensington, $25,000 and Beaver County YMCA, New Brighton, $55,000 for after-school and summer meals for children. Angie's List may seek outside help, possible sale Angie’s List may be seeking a partner or a buyer after watching its sales slide for more than a year. The Indianapolis company is working with Allen & Co. LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch to explore “strategic alternatives.” Last year, the Indianapolis company rejected a $512 million takeover offer from internet company IAC/​InterActiveCorp. It said the per-share offer of $8.75 was too low. Shares had fallen to around $6.30 by July. Angie’s List Inc. reported a third-quarter loss of $16.8 million. Gannett walks away from deal to buy LA Times publisher tronc Gannett Co., the owner of USA Today, dropped its $683 million bid for rival Tronc Inc. after financing fell through, ending a months-long pursuit that would have put some of the biggest U.S. newspapers under one roof. The companies’ handshake deal early last month, in which Gannett would buy tronc for about $18.75 a share, collapsed when bankers wouldn’t line up to fund the transaction, a person familiar with the matter said. Gannett said financing wasn’t an issue. McLean, Virginia-based Gannett has already bought the publishers of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Record of Bergen County this year and acquired 15 dailies in 2015. Gannett is trying to get bigger to compete more aggressively with online news sites for national readers and advertisers. U.S. factory activity picks up in October U.S. manufacturing grew last month at the fastest pace since July, a sign that American factories are coping with economic weakness overseas and a strong dollar. The Institute for Supply Management says its manufacturing index came in at 51.9 up from 51.5 in August. Anything above 50 signals growth. Production and export orders grew faster in October.

Photo credit: Timothy Hong By Bailey Brammer | Staff Writer The annual Dale P. Jones Business Ethics Forum began on Tuesday evening at the Paul L. Foster Campus for Business and Innovation with speeches by Bill Simon, former president and CEO of Wal-Mart, and Tom Mars, former general counsel for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The forum will run from Nov. 1-11 and will include lectures from leaders in the business world, as well as student competitions. “If something happens to you, and you end up in an unfair situation, the key to success is to keep your eyes on the next step,” Mars said. “When you trip and fall, get back up, as long as you’ve done the right thing.” Mars and Simon discussed how to react in the business world when accused with untrue allegations, using Mars’ own experience of being ousted by Wal-Mart after charges of bribery in 2014 as an example. In addition to Simon and Mars, other business leaders such as Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby, and Bert Smith, CEO of the Prison Entrepreneurship Program, will be giving lectures throughout the forum. According to the Baylor Business School website, the Business Ethics Forum has been held annually at Baylor University since 2005. “We have a broad theme for this year’s ethics forum. It’s ‘Just Business,'” said Mitchell Neubert, Chavanne Chair of Christian Ethics in Business at Baylor. “It’s about the idea of fairness and ethics in business, and that’s lived out in a variety of ways.” Three different competitions will also take place during the forum, according to Baylor Media Communications press release. These contests are designed to provide students with realistic ethical challenges and promote growth and leadership. “The forum helps you learn more about business and get out of a classroom setting,” said Pearland freshman Abigail Finger. “And competing gets people out of their comfort zones.” The 11th annual Business Ethics Case Competition on Friday will consist of teams of undergraduate and graduate students presenting an ethics case and their recommendations in formal business presentations. The winning team in each league will receive a $500 prize. Twelve teams of students from across the U.S. will contend in the 10th annual National M.B.A. Case Competition in Ethical Leadership on Nov. 10. The winning team will be awarded the grand prize of $5,000, and the second and third place teams will also receive lesser prizes. First-year business students at Baylor will have the opportunity to compete in the Ethics SLAM! Competition Thursday through Friday for a $100 gift card to the Baylor Bookstore. While these competitions offer students a chance to test the waters of the real world, Simon gave students some parting advice on dealing with ethics and business as they move forward in their careers. “There’s no gray in ethics, and there’s no gray in business,” Simon said. “When you make a mistake, the earlier you can acknowledge it and correct it, the better off you are. And, if you didn’t do anything wrong, stand up for yourself.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Bailey Brammer RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Baylor reveals Briles’ role in reporting rape case Anti-Trump protestors take message to Fountain Mall, met with Trump supporters Riverfront project gets funds to develop downtown Tweets by @bulariat Follow us on Instagram OWN LOCAL Widget TODAY’S ISSUE EDITOR PICKS Mayfield; Oklahoma carve up Baylor defense Football November 12, 2016 Baylor reveals Briles’ role in reporting rape case News November 12, 2016 Anti-Trump protests fill streets in Washington D.C.

On Wednesday, Oct. 19, a female said her wallet was stolen at some point while shopping at Walmart. She received a call later from her credit card company advising of suspicious activity. Transactions had occurred on her card at the Northstar gas station located on Midland Avenue, just south of Cataraqui Woods Drive, as well as Foot Locker at the Cataraqui Centre and other stores. Video surveillance from the gas station shows one of the two men using the tap feature on the credit card to purchase various items. The vehicle the three suspects were using appears to be a dark gray or blue Pontiac Torrent SUV with Ontario licence plates. Detectives are confirming if this is possibly associated to a registered owner from the Amherstview area. The first male is described as Caucasian, 30 to 40 years of age, with a thin build, partial beard and moustache, prescription eyewear, and possibly tattoos visible on his right forearm. He is wearing a black ball cap, a black T-shirt with white lettering or graphic on the left breast, blue jeans and brown shoes or sandals. The second male is described as Caucasian, 25 to 35 years of age, with a medium build, clean-shaven, and with short brown receding widow's peak hair. He is wearing a ball cap possibly red in colour, a blue or black hoodie with white lettering saying "Crooks & Castles" on the chest, light gray jogging pants with what appears to be Adidas in black on the right lower leg, and black shoes with white soles. The female is described as Caucasian, 25 to 35 years of age, with a thin to medium build and short dark hair.

Wal-Mart's plan is to be totally removed from the grid, powered only by renewable energy sources and lithium batteries, by 2020. Ambitious as it may sound, it's been a boon to an industry falling into a lull.  Ever since the extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) late last year, investments in solar companies have slipped. The market expected to see a sudden increase in new solar installations in the rush for installers to get the biggest credit. Instead, the country’s solar installers... took a break. Without the sudden pressure to get new projects underway, companies and individual buyers alike have relaxed, causing solar capacity growth to do the same. But don’t think that means you should ignore solar stocks. In fact, this may just be the best time to buy in... Market Restart Wal-Mart, for all its boasting, isn’t the only company building a renewable base. In fact, it’s not even the biggest! The Solar Energy Industries Association’s biggest corporate solar installer lineup currently reads like this: Target (147 megawatts) Wal-Mart (140 megawatts) Prologis (107.8 megawatts) Apple (93.9 megawatts) Costco (50.7 megawatts) Other big solar installers include Kohl’s, Ikea, and Macy’s. Each has a goal of being mostly, if not completely, powered by clean energy within the next few years. These large-scale installations are becoming a larger part of solar's growth this year, even as that growth slows. Without the hype to keep them up, solar stocks are slowing as well. But given the long-term outlook on the technology, that may just be giving savvy investors a chance to grab up the best stocks at a bargain. GTM Research expects that solar capacity will increase steadily through 2020, though recent research suggests there will be a lull through 2017. Investors shouldn’t worry about a single year’s worth of slow growth, however — not in an industry that’s had such steady increases since its inception and is expected to continue expanding for the foreseeable future. The Energy Information Administration estimates that solar will account for about 1% of all U.S. energy by next year, up from 0.6% in 2015. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s just the beginning. The whole world is working to move away from fossil fuels now, which means the market for renewables has been busted wide open. And just because we haven’t yet seen the surge in installations that many expected doesn’t mean it won’t happen at all. The ITC offers a 30% tax credit on all solar installations under construction by the end of this year. That number drops to just 26% after 2019, 10% after 2021, and cuts out completely in 2023. New projects still have a little bit of leeway in getting those credits, and the rush may come at the last minute. To get complete articles and information, join our newsletter for FREE!

Foresight on how the future of energy will unfold. Additional Storage Anyone looking to be 100% solar anytime soon is also going to need some battery power to back it all up. Energy storage and renewable technologies go hand in hand, if only because there still needs to be electricity running when the sun goes down. Large-scale energy storage especially will see some growth in coming years as energy grids all over the world integrate more solar and other renewables. The biggest growth in these large-scale systems is yet to come! Now, by the time that happens, I expect we’ll have much better solar panels as well. We’ll have to, in fact! Right now, the best designs only function at about 28% efficiency, not nearly enough to make up for all the fossil fuel power the world wants to retire. Renewable energies are struggling to find the balance between efficiency and price. For obvious reasons, higher-efficiency solar panels cost more, which makes widespread adoption a challenge. But the price is dropping as capacity is growing, helped along by projects like Wal-Mart’s. The more low-cost installations are adopted, the easier it will be to integrate the technology everywhere else. Investment Interest I wouldn’t blame you for hesitating to buy into solar right now. The recent history of the biggest installer in the country, SolarCity, reads more like a cautionary tale than a success story. But even the skeptics are only seeing a slowdown through 2017. Beyond that, business will pick up again, and probably even reach new highs as the final deadline for the ITC comes into play! Without a doubt, this is far from the death of the solar industry.

Tom Jewell/Special to cleveland.com  SOLON, Ohio -- Backers of the Fountains of Solon rezoning initiative have now taken a different tack on selling their plan to voters. Sent out last week in what could be the final mailing before the Nov. 8 election, potential developers of the proposed upscale apartment complex urged residents to vote "yes" on Issue 98 to stop Walmart from coming to Solon. "Hypothetically, it could go in there," Fountains of Solon spokeswoman Jori Mintz said of the retail giant and the city's current "C-3" commercial zoning designation. At least one Fountains opponent accused the property owners of resorting to "fear tactics" to scare voters before they head to the polls next Tuesday, while a resident of Ward Four -- where the land sits --believes the campaign is getting "desperate." Mintz noted that Walmart closed its "Supercenter" in neighboring Bedford early this year -- the only one in Ohio -- as part of a "global restructuring" that shuttered 154 stores. "Those people need a place to shop now," Mintz said. Opponents countered that the Solon parcel is still considered too small by current Walmart standards, and pointed to the fully-operational store on the other side of the city limits in Bainbridge Township. "They're not going to build a new store a mile-and-a-half away from that one," said Mark Haas, treasurer of the group Citizens Against Rezoning Solon (CARS), who lives less than 1,000 feet down Solon Road. In addition to Walmart, the campaign literature mentions dollar stores, check-cashing enterprises, and fast food outlets as possible uses on the 22 acres of land off of Solon Road and Erico Drive. "These uses are approved by Solon, but they are not right for Ward Four," rezoning petition organizers said. "You have the power to stop Walmart by voting 'yes' on Issue 98." What developer Nathan Lancry and his team of investors want is "R-3" Multi-Family Residential zoning to allow them to build "high-end luxury lifestyle apartments" on the land, renting individually for $1,500 to $2,000 a month. Compared to the theoretical scenarios put forth, Mintz said that  "a relatively small, modest 186-unit building would be a much better neighbor." Opponents have questioned all along whether the zoning change would lead to such an apartment complex, or open the door for speculative uses. Lancry has given his assurances that the Fountains of Solon would proceed -- at a projected cost of $20 to $30 million -- once the rezoning is approved by voters. City officials have pointed out that no development agreement has been reached with Fountains of Solon. Lancry said he offered a development agreement at the outset, but was told it would not be necessary, at least when he introduced the proposal in early 2014. That was before he and Jay Buick GMC President Marc Jacobson actually bought the property from University Hospitals later that year for $2.35 million.  "Nathan will not build any of these," Mintz said, referring to the hypothetical possibilities of Walmart, payday lending, fast food or dollar stores. "But he will certainly have to consider selling the land if the zoning change doesn't pass," Mintz added. Another vocal opponent of the Fountains of Solon rezoning proposal has been Jacki Calavitta, who said she was "totally flabbergasted" after getting a "Stop Walmart" campaign flier in the mail on Monday. "These people will stop at nothing to trick voters into approving their rezoning," Calavitta said. "They must figure that their unrealistic sales pitch hasn't convinced enough people, so now it's 'hey, let's try the fear tactic.'" Calavitta believes "the idea that any of these types of commercial businesses are just dying to get their hands on that piece of property is ludicrous." Haas agreed, saying that he feels the Fountains of Solon backers have gotten desperate. "They can't convince people that their bad idea is a good idea, so now they're trying to intimidate them," Haas said. Neither Haas nor Calavitta can see a luxury apartment complex succeeding in that location. "But there are generous financial incentives through the federal government for public housing, particularly in 'affluent' areas," Calavitta said. "And if multi-family rezoning is approved, there would be nothing to stop it." Haas said there would be nothing to stop the owners from selling the land after it was rezoned. Although the land is zoned commercial, the City Planning Department has recommended office space, something that the previous owner, University Hospitals, was not happy with back in 2010 when such revisions to the city's Master Plan were discussed. City Planning Director Rob Frankland said at the time there was "no rationale to the current zoning in that area," citing an "unusual pattern" beginning with low-intensity office space on the corner of Solon and SOM Center roads. Frankland also noted in 2010 that a Master Plan is supposed to reflect "ideal zoning" for a city, but remains only a blueprint, and that conceivably, "we could end up with a hostile attempt to implement full commercial zoning." City Law Director Tom Lobe reminded council earlier this month that under the "home ward veto" zoning provision in the City Charter, Issue 98 has to be approved by the majority of voters both citywide and in Ward Four. "If one or the other fails, it does not pass," Lobe said.

It’s only one day after Halloween and more than three weeks to Thanksgiving but Black Friday deals are already here.  Amazon began offering sales on Tuesday as part of its Black Friday Deals store, which will run through Dec. 22. Each day will bring a set of timed sales with new deals coming “as often as every five minutes,” similar to last years.  Meanwhile, Walmart and Target are taking cues from each other by offering more exclusive merchandise during the holiday season. Walmart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It’s also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places.” The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Walmart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. For the end of the year, the world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. Macy’s announced in October it was staying committed to Thanksgiving Day shopping, saying it’ll open an hour earlier this year. The move dampened hopes that other key stores will back away from the “Christmas Creep.” The retailer plans to open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, with most Macy’s stores closing at 2 a.m., and then reopening at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. It cited “ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy’s and at many other retailers.” Macy’s announcement shows that many major chains will probably stick with the Thanksgiving opening and may even open earlier than last year as they try to avoid being trumped by the competition. Macy’s is under pressure to do well, after six straight quarters of declines for a key revenue measure. Target, Best Buy and J.C. Penney have not yet announced their Thanksgiving strategy.

It's only one day after Halloween and more than three weeks to Thanksgiving but Black Friday deals are already here.  Amazon began offering sales on Tuesday as part of its Black Friday Deals store, which will run through Dec. 22. PBS News Anchor Gwen Ifill Dies at 61 After Cancer Battle Each day will bring a set of timed sales with new deals coming "as often as every five minutes," similar to last years.  Meanwhile, Walmart and Target are taking cues from each other by offering more exclusive merchandise during the holiday season. Top News Photos of the Week: Mosul, the Election, and More Chris McGrath/Getty Images Walmart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places." The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Vouching for Trump, Obama Says US Will Maintain Alliances Walmart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. Priebus Says He and Bannon Make Effective Team Amid Backlash Macy's announced in October it was staying committed to Thanksgiving Day shopping, saying it'll open an hour earlier this year. The move dampened hopes that other key stores will back away from the "Christmas Creep." The retailer plans to open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, with most Macy's stores closing at 2 a.m., and then reopening at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. It cited "ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy's and at many other retailers." Justice Ginsburg Makes Opera Debut With Speaking Role Macy's announcement shows that many major chains will probably stick with the Thanksgiving opening and may even open earlier than last year as they try to avoid being trumped by the competition. Macy's is under pressure to do well, after six straight quarters of declines for a key revenue measure. Target, Best Buy and J.C. Penney have not yet announced their Thanksgiving strategy.

Manndrell D. Fuller  Circuit Judge Robert L. Kaczmarek on Monday, Oct. 31, sentenced Manndrell D. Fuller for six felonies. Kaczmarek sentenced Fuller to the mandatory, consecutive five years in prison for possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony-second offense and one year in jail for receiving and concealing stolen ammunition and other felonies. Men take pleas in theft of rifle ammo at Walmart Fuller, 23, pleaded no contest as charged in September for an Oct. 29, 2015, incident at the Walmart on Brockway in Saginaw Township. He pleaded to the stolen ammunition charge, single counts of possessing a firearm as a felon and possessing ammunition as a felon, and three felony firearm counts Because he was on parole at the time of the incident, Fuller did not receive any credit for time served. He was on parole for assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, which he committed by opening fire on an East Side Saginaw house in March 2011. Fuller entered his plea on the day he was scheduled to go to trial along with his co-defendants, Shauna S. Washington and Tyrus L. Williams, who faced the stolen ammunition charge and a single first-offense felony firearm charge. Testimony: Man charged with theft of assault rifle ammo at Walmart told security to 'look the other way' After observing a vehicle matching the description of one involved in the theft of ammunition from the Walmart, Saginaw police performed a traffic stop on the vehicle, according to testimony from the defendants' preliminary hearing. Officer Matthew Carpus testified he observed an SKS-style rifle and SKS-style magazine on the floor boards of the back seat. Officer Isaac Babinski said the magazine was "high capacity," which he defined as a rifle magazine that accepts more than 10 rounds. Carpus testified that after he was alerted by another officer, he observed a box in the area of the front-seat passenger. Inside the box was a box of 9mm Winchester ammunition and multiple 7.62 ammunition in a plastic shopping bag. The 7.62 ammunition also was Winchester, police said. Williams pleaded guilty to the stolen ammunition charge on the same day Fuller entered his plea and likely will receive a probation sentence. Washington on Oct. 3 accepted the same plea agreement and also will likely receive a probation sentence. Williams, 22, and Washington, 24, both remain free. Kaczmarek is scheduled to sentence them on Nov. 7.

(WKRN) – Metro police arrested three people accused of robbing a homeless man outside the Walmart at the corner of Nolensville Pike and Harding Place Tuesday morning. An off-duty Nolensville police officer was working security at the Walmart. He was patrolling the parking lot just before 3:30 a.m. when he saw the robbery. Detectives said the man was asleep in his truck when the suspects opened the door, demanded money and started going through his things. Detectives said one of the men was wearing camouflage and had a machete. The suspects now identified as Aaron Maddux, Darry Wilson and Jeffrey Fuqua, reportedly took $20 from the victim and his cell phone. The off-duty Nolensville Officer held two of the suspects until Metro police arrived. The third man fled the scene. A Metro officer found him walking down the road shortly after. All three men are charged with aggravated robbery. Wilson is also charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. The victim is ok.     Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to send this to your Kindle device (Opens in new window) Related Posts 2 suspects sought after money, cigarettes taken from Nashville gas station during robbery 3 accused of trying to steal TV from Walmart in Mt.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart has removed books featuring photos of child nudity from its website. The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were not sold in Walmart stores but were available at Walmart.com. Last week, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization, launched a petition to remove those and other books and magazines the group says are offensive. “The books were in violation of our prohibited items policy and were removed as soon as they were brought to our attention,’’ Walmart said in a statement Monday. “We’re refining our policies and filters to better flag and block these types of items in the future.” Sturges has produced books featuring art photos of nude adolescents for decades. In 1990, The New York Times reported, the FBI raided his studio and confiscated his cameras, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He continued to work. A variety of his art books are on sale on Amazon's website. Dawn Hawkins, NCOSE’s executive director, applauded the change. “This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation,’’ she said in a statement. The group says it is also seeking an end to the retailer selling Cosmopolitan magazine, which is says features sexually suggestive content that can be easily viewed by children shopping with their parents, and primers for the sex trafficking of women that NCOSE says are still sold online. "We are continuing communications with Walmart executives,'' Hawkins says, "and we hope Walmart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials," . 301 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f6n4KX

(WMT) Need a Christmas Boost By Scutify Oct 31, 2016 11:33 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. WMT and TGT stock need a little Christmas right now against Amazon "We need a little Christmas, right this very minute. Candles in the window. Carols at the spinet." The Jerry Herman song We Need a Little Christmas, from Mame, which debuted 50 years ago, reflects the prayers of retailers like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) "Christmas creep" means most stores will have their Christmas decorations up as soon as they take down the Halloween masks. In the online world of TGT, WMT and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), those decorations are already up. Free shipping, mobile-first sites and online video ads are now just an ante in this high-stakes game, as e-commerce sales are expected to grow 13% and mobile alone up to 60%, to over $12.5 billion. Retail stocks like TGT stock and Walmart stock that want a leg-up on AMZN are doing just that - seeking any possible advantage. These big merchants can also gain one with exclusive merchandise, things Amazon won't have, like giant pink princess cars and virtual reality drones. It's all a little bit desperate. The WMT Strategy Walmart has a reason to be desperate. The growth of Amazon has cut its total share of the retail market to 10% from 11.6% in 2009, as online now represents 10% of the total retail market. WMT's online sales grew 12% last year to $13.7 billion, and it's now the second-largest e-tailer, but Amazon sales grew 20% in the same period. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? Merely offering free pick-up of online orders wasn't getting the job done. The pick-up process remains more difficult at Walmart than AMZN, just as I found out last year when I needed an in-car audio solution. It's unimaginable that this would work on the day after Thanksgiving. So WMT has bought Jet.Com for $3 billion to bolster its e-commerce operations and is launching a price war. Jet became interesting to Walmart because it made online shopping fun, offering savings with debit cards and a shopper's willingness to opt-out of free returns. Some analysts are skeptical of the purchase, but WMT thinks that Jet's "dynamic pricing" module, which rewards bigger orders with bigger discounts, is perfect for Christmas shopping. The Target Strategy Target had a great e-commerce Christmas last year, with sales growing 34% and a successful integration of online ordering and in-store pickups. Industry watchers gave its effort strong reviews, alongside Amazon and Wayfair Inc (NYSE:W), which is another e-commerce unicorn that could also be sold by next Christmas. But the success came at the cost of margins for TGT stock, and the company's 2016 strategy is, well, more targeted. TGT is emphasizing value over mere price this year, and already offering free shipping on Christmas orders. Target is ramping up its e-commerce budget to $2 billion, poaching executives from Amazon and other successful e-tailers and working to improve online cash registers, so they don't "freeze" at the crucial moment. Exclusives are also a big part of the plan for bringing in TGT shoppers. Last year, Target featured an exclusive edition of the Adele's album 25. This year it's a boxed set of Garth Brooks' work and a new line of children's clothes called Cat & Jack, launched last summer under the Brooklyn Bridge. Next Page The key buzzword for TGT stock last year was "omnichannel," making the process of buying online, or in the store, as seamless and painless as possible. But the key to TGT stock this year will be differentiation, making the online channel do what it's best at - quick ordering and fulfillment - while having the stores do what they do best - promotions and serendipity. Can This Work for TGT Stock? The online and offline shopping worlds are coming together. Amazon is opening stores, WMT is offering deals, TGT is offering focus, and that's going to continue. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is Going to Disrupt Retail Again For the brick-and-mortar giants like Target stock and Walmart stock, this is an expensive, unprofitable slog, trying to replicate infrastructure and systems Amazon has already built and profits from. But they feel the pain is necessary if they're to remain relevant in Christmases to come. Just remember, when you look at the results, that e-commerce sales for the big merchants aren't necessarily incremental gains. That's why I'm still long AMZN and don't currently have a position in either TGT stock or Walmart stock.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Donald Trump touts that as president he would be good for American workers. Although many of his plans are vague or possibly harmful, there is one clear outcome of a Trump presidency: with the power to appoint Supreme Court justices, Trump promises to continue a conservative majority. We usually think of the Supreme Court in terms of what it means for abortion rights, marriage equality and the Second Amendment. At the third presidential debate, that’s what we heard. Trump vowed to appoint justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia who would be hostile to Roe v. Wade and bolster gun rights. Hillary Clinton said her nominees would support women’s rights, marriage equality and reverse Citizens United. The candidates did not, however, address the Supreme Court’s substantial impact on the workplace – an impact that’s often ignored amid these hot-button issues. Almost five decades of a conservative Court majority have sharply limited the rights of workers to unionize, form class actions and fight discrimination. The results have been profound and help explain the deterioration of the working class and the rise of economic inequality in recent decades. The court is now in a 4-4 split between liberal and conservative justices. The Senate’s refusal to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia means it’s likely the next occupant of the Oval Office will get to pick who fills that seat – and possibly several more. That will determine the kind of court Americans have for years or even decades to come. Conservative appointments by a President Trump would likely continue the decimation of workplace justice, particularly collective efforts to improve working conditions and pay. As I have documented, a look back at some of the court’s recent rulings shows how. The body of Justice Antonin Scalia arrives at the Supreme Court in February. Alex Brandon/AP Killing off the class action Take the case of Wal-Mart v. Dukes. In 2001, past and present female workers of Wal-Mart sued the company for paying and promoting them less than their male counterparts. The workers joined together to file a class action – a legal procedure that makes it possible for relatively small claims to be aggregated so that plaintiffs can afford to bring a case. They are also far more efficient for our judicial system than hearing scores of similar claims separately. Yet in 2011, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority that Wal-Mart was essentially too big to sue. Scalia said the plaintiff’s claims lacked a common basis and scoffed at the notion that Wal-Mart’s discretionary pay and promotion system could result in company-wide discrimination. In dissent, Justice Ruth Ginsburg countered that discrimination is most likely to flourish in discretionary systems like Wal-mart’s due to stereotyped assumptions that managers make about female employees, even unconsciously. As a result of the ruling, the effectiveness of the class action tool in employment cases has been reduced. Then, in 2016, the court – without Justice Scalia – declined to expand Wal-Mart v. Dukes (in a 6-2 vote) by resisting an employer’s bid to disallow statistical evidence in all class actions. In that case, employees at a Tyson pork processing plant used statistics to establish the amount of time they were not paid for taking on and off their protective gear. Statistical sampling was necessary because Tyson failed to keep accurate time records. The analysis showed that employees spent an average of 18 to about 21 minutes on this task, depending on their job duties. This additional time made some employees eligible for overtime pay. As a result of the case, the use of statistics in class action cases will continue to be hotly litigated. Eroding the right to organize In the past, one of the key ways workers have improved their pay and working conditions is by forming a union. Indeed, collective bargaining is associated with a wage premium of 13.6 percent, compared with workers who aren’t covered by such an agreement. Conversely, the ongoing decline in union membership is a key factor in growing economic inequality, depressing wages of union and non-union members alike. The Supreme Court has helped accelerate that decline. In 2014, the court struck down a 2003 law granting home health care workers in Illinois who are paid by Medicaid the right to collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions. Justice Samuel Alito concluded for the 5-4 majority that the First Amendment prohibited the state from requiring these workers to pay union dues. In so doing, he circumvented years of precedent upholding union dues for public employees as necessary to prevent free-riding by non-members and to give the state a single entity for negotiating purposes. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan described the labor instability that would result from the court’s ruling. She also noted evidence that collective bargaining helped the workers double their wages, obtain health insurance and receive better training and enhanced workplace safety. Those benefits could vanish without collective bargaining, harming not only the workers but also the elderly and disabled people for whom they care. Scalia’s sudden death in February ended up giving unions a reprieve in another important case involving the constitutionality of requiring public workers to pay their fair share of union dues, even if they aren’t a member. That case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was heard in January, with a skeptical Scalia in attendance, but in March the Court issued a 4-4 decision that left a lower court’s decision upholding such fees intact. Split decisions mean whatever ruling immediately preceded the hearing before the Supreme Court stands but doesn’t create a precedent. This issue will arise again, and, obviously, the next justice will tilt the balance. Health care and religious belief Health care is another area where a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker protections. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Hobby Lobby and other privately held employers objected on religious grounds to paying for certain forms of legally mandated contraceptive coverage for millions of employees and their dependents. The court in 2014 upheld the employers’ religious claims in a 5-4 ruling. In so doing, the court privileged the religious beliefs of business owners against the health care needs of employees. The decision overturned part of the Affordable Care Act – a law passed through our democratic process with an express purpose of expanding preventative care for women and reducing gender inequities in the cost of care. The connection between access to contraception and the economic success of women is clear cut. To succeed in education and in the workplace, women need the ability to control the timing and size of their families. The Hobby Lobby ruling expresses a robust view of equality for corporations but none for women. It might spread to other areas as well. As Justice Ginsburg asked: “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” The Obama Administration approved accommodations for religious employers to avoid paying for employees’ contraceptive coverage directly. All they had to do was fill out a form, and, under the accommodation, insurers would pay for it instead. Some non-profit religious employers objected to even that and took their claim to the Supreme Court earlier this year. Apparently at an impasse and without a ninth justice, the court sent the government and the religious employers back to the drawing board to find a solution. Thus, it remains unresolved – for now – whether the Obama Administration’s accommodation on birth control coverage is lawful. And once again, who fills Scalia’s seat will likely determine whether such coverage remains a part of Obamacare for employees of religious employers. President Barack Obama’s choice to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland (right), still hasn’t gotten a hearing in the Senate. Jose Luis Magana/AP The Supreme Court matters These are just a few of the more significant cases of recent years in which a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker rights. It’s likely that these issues will continue to be fought in the courts and find their way to the Supreme Court, along with many others. Simply put, a Trump-appointed Justice is far more likely, in my view, to rule against workers than a Clinton nominee. Whatever impact his other policies would have on the working class, it is clear his appointments for the highest court in the land would hurt workers and make it that much harder for them to join together to fight for their rights.

Although many of his plans are vague or possibly harmful, there is one clear outcome of a Trump presidency: with the power to appoint Supreme Court justices, Trump promises to continue a conservative majority. We usually think of the Supreme Court in terms of what it means for abortion rights, marriage equality and the Second Amendment. At the third presidential debate, that’s what we heard. Trump vowed to appoint justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia who would be hostile to Roe v. Wade and bolster gun rights. Hillary Clinton said her nominees would support women’s rights, marriage equality and reverse Citizens United. The candidates did not, however, address the Supreme Court’s substantial impact on the workplace – an impact that’s often ignored amid these hot-button issues. Almost five decades of a conservative Court majority have sharply limited the rights of workers to unionize, form class actions and fight discrimination. The results have been profound and help explain the deterioration of the working class and the rise of economic inequality in recent decades. The court is now in a 4-4 split between liberal and conservative justices. The Senate’s refusal to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia means it’s likely the next occupant of the Oval Office will get to pick who fills that seat – and possibly several more. That will determine the kind of court Americans have for years or even decades to come. Conservative appointments by a President Trump would likely continue the decimation of workplace justice, particularly collective efforts to improve working conditions and pay. As I have documented, a look back at some of the court’s recent rulings shows how. Take the case of Wal-Mart v. Dukes. In 2001, past and present female workers of Wal-Mart sued the company for paying and promoting them less than their male counterparts. The workers joined together to file a class action – a legal procedure that makes it possible for relatively small claims to be aggregated so that plaintiffs can afford to bring a case. They are also far more efficient for our judicial system than hearing scores of similar claims separately. Yet in 2011, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority that Wal-Mart was essentially too big to sue. Scalia said the plaintiff’s claims lacked a common basis and scoffed at the notion that Wal-Mart’s discretionary pay and promotion system could result in company-wide discrimination. In dissent, Justice Ruth Ginsburg countered that discrimination is most likely to flourish in discretionary systems like Wal-mart’s due to stereotyped assumptions that managers make about female employees, even unconsciously. As a result of the ruling, the effectiveness of the class action tool in employment cases has been reduced. Then, in 2016, the court – without Justice Scalia – declined to expand Wal-Mart v. Dukes (in a 6-2 vote) by resisting an employer’s bid to disallow statistical evidence in all class actions. In that case, employees at a Tyson pork processing plant used statistics to establish the amount of time they were not paid for taking on and off their protective gear. Statistical sampling was necessary because Tyson failed to keep accurate time records. The analysis showed that employees spent an average of 18 to about 21 minutes on this task, depending on their job duties. This additional time made some employees eligible for overtime pay. As a result of the case, the use of statistics in class action cases will continue to be hotly litigated. In the past, one of the key ways workers have improved their pay and working conditions is by forming a union. Indeed, collective bargaining is associated with a wage premium of 13.6 percent, compared with workers who aren’t covered by such an agreement. Conversely, the ongoing decline in union membership is a key factor in growing economic inequality, depressing wages of union and non-union members alike. The Supreme Court has helped accelerate that decline. In 2014, the court struck down a 2003 law granting home health care workers in Illinois who are paid by Medicaid the right to collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions. Justice Samuel Alito concluded for the 5-4 majority that the First Amendment prohibited the state from requiring these workers to pay union dues. In so doing, he circumvented years of precedent upholding union dues for public employees as necessary to prevent free-riding by non-members and to give the state a single entity for negotiating purposes. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan described the labor instability that would result from the court’s ruling. She also noted evidence that collective bargaining helped the workers double their wages, obtain health insurance and receive better training and enhanced workplace safety. Those benefits could vanish without collective bargaining, harming not only the workers but also the elderly and disabled people for whom they care. Scalia’s sudden death in February ended up giving unions a reprieve in another important case involving the constitutionality of requiring public workers to pay their fair share of union dues, even if they aren’t a member. That case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was heard in January, with a skeptical Scalia in attendance, but in March the Court issued a 4-4 decision that left a lower court’s decision upholding such fees intact. Split decisions mean whatever ruling immediately preceded the hearing before the Supreme Court stands but doesn’t create a precedent. This issue will arise again, and, obviously, the next justice will tilt the balance. Health care is another area where a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker protections. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Hobby Lobby and other privately held employers objected on religious grounds to paying for certain forms of legally mandated contraceptive coverage for millions of employees and their dependents. The court in 2014 upheld the employers’ religious claims in a 5-4 ruling. In so doing, the court privileged the religious beliefs of business owners against the health care needs of employees. The decision overturned part of the Affordable Care Act – a law passed through our democratic process with an express purpose of expanding preventative care for women and reducing gender inequities in the cost of care. The connection between access to contraception and the economic success of women is clear cut. To succeed in education and in the workplace, women need the ability to control the timing and size of their families. The Hobby Lobby ruling expresses a robust view of equality for corporations but none for women. It might spread to other areas as well. As Justice Ginsburg asked: “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” The Obama Administration approved accommodations for religious employers to avoid paying for employees’ contraceptive coverage directly. All they had to do was fill out a form, and, under the accommodation, insurers would pay for it instead. Some non-profit religious employers objected to even that and took their claim to the Supreme Court earlier this year. Apparently at an impasse and without a ninth justice, the court sent the government and the religious employers back to the drawing board to find a solution. Thus, it remains unresolved – for now – whether the Obama Administration’s accommodation on birth control coverage is lawful. And once again, who fills Scalia’s seat will likely determine whether such coverage remains a part of Obamacare for employees of religious employers. These are just a few of the more significant cases of recent years in which a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker rights. It’s likely that these issues will continue to be fought in the courts and find their way to the Supreme Court, along with many others. Simply put, a Trump-appointed Justice is far more likely, in my view, to rule against workers than a Clinton nominee.

Search Search for: About Us Toggle navigation Data Science Engineering Innovation Mobile Tech Culture Events About Us Social Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Topics Data Science Engineering Innovation Mobile Tech Culture Events Walmart Will Manage 200-Plus Distribution Centers With OneOps, Jenkins, Nexus and Kubernetes By: Patrick Dolan and Suyog Barve October 26, 2016 One of the key competitive advantages of Walmart Logistics over the decades has been keeping its distribution centers running as efficiently and autonomously as possible.  That autonomy extends to the very hardware and software infrastructure running within these facilities — more than 200 worldwide — as each location contains what could be viewed as a mini-datacenter. Managing this vast distributed landscape is a complicated logistics problem, presenting substantial challenges for everything from minor upgrades to the delivery of new software and solutions. To meet these challenges, Walmart Technology is undertaking an effort to enable cloud-like flexibility across its distribution centers. The initiative’s top-level goals include abstracting applications from their underlying infrastructure, delivering the ability to rapidly deploy new business solutions, and providing seamless, on-demand scaling based on application workloads. Each business application should function autonomously, like the distribution centers themselves. But bringing a cloud-like environment to a disparate network of on-premises logistics systems is no easy challenge. To meet these goals, Walmart Technology is bringing together a handful of individually impressive open source software components: OneOps, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Nexus. OneOps, a @WalmartLabs-led open source project, enables a consistent infrastructure provisioning and delivery mechanism in a cloud-agnostic fashion. And while Walmart Technology has employed OneOps to help manage more than 1,000 deployments daily across its many data center-based clouds, distribution centers have not been able to leverage the same convenience. This initiative aims to change that, standing up each distribution center as its own cloud, with OneOps provisioning the underlying virtual machines, as well as all other key technology components required for a Kubernetes cluster (see Figure 1). Figure 1: OneOps VMware distribution center interactions In the above diagram, integration between OneOps and VMware’s vCenter occurs via Fog adapters. This key integration allows distribution centers to use their existing VMware investments with minimal changes to DC infrastructure. Once this integration stands up the backing virtual machines, OneOps takes over by laying down the Kubernetes ecosystem directly onto these newly provisioned VMs. This convenient approach means that whether applications are in the cloud or on-premises, OneOps can facilitate a consistent infrastructure management experience across the enterprise. Predecessors to Kubernetes in Walmart’s distribution centers are open source successes in their own right (Nagios, Apache-Httpd to name a few). And while they have been relatively effective in meeting the current needs of the applications they serve, these disparate products require customized configurations and install scripts to provide a cohesive application deployment platform. As applications transition toward a microservice-style architecture, the overhead of managing these disparate components has increasingly made that transition much more difficult. Kubernetes has proven to not only meet the same needs provided by its open-source predecessors, but it is doing so in a much more efficient, stable and easier-to-manage fashion. With its roots grounded in years of Google cloud-computing experience, Kubernetes also brings with it powerful Docker container orchestration features to help enable a microservice architecture. These include: abstractions for managing application deployments and upgrades container monitoring and health checks isolated networking (via Flannel) workload scheduling auto-scaling enforced memory and CPU limits, per application / container, or namespace Applications provisioned within Kubernetes are assured to always be running and making the most efficient use of on-premises resources. This is accomplished with relatively little additional overhead, having just three small VMs dedicated as redundant master nodes. The complete provisioned cluster provides everything needed for an application execution ecosystem (figure 2): Figure 2: Kubernetes VM layout for a distribution center Master nodes ensure the cluster is running smoothly, tracking the status of each component, and handling API requests for deployments and updates; worker nodes remain busy executing application workloads; NFS servers meet locally shared file-system-based requirements; and load balancer nodes intercept and route external, non-Kubernetes based traffic into the cluster. Once the Kubernetes clusters are provisioned by OneOps, each freestanding cluster is hooked into Jenkins-based continuous delivery pipelines. These pipelines ensure applications are delivered to each distribution center in a timely and efficient fashion (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Jenkins / CD pipeline interactions with Kubernetes clusters Treating each application as its own isolated microservice component, Jenkins has proven to be a fast, effective tool for not only building software, but also as a foundational platform for Walmart’s continuous delivery pipelines. Jenkins alone isn’t sufficient as a deployment mechanism. Any Docker-based solution requires a solid image registry — that single “source of truth” for Docker binaries. Having already invested in Nexus for Java, dotnet, Linux RPMs and more recently, NPM-based artifacts, the obvious solution for Walmart Technology was to expand Nexus’ already impressive feature list to include Docker registry capabilities. Furthermore, given a distribution center’s autonomous nature, a local registry within each DC becomes a must to ensure clusters are able to operate independently and also buffer against excessive external network traffic. Once again, the same Nexus solution, but running as a more optimized Docker container image, is deployed within each DC’s Kubernetes cluster, serving mostly as a proxy and cache to the enterprise-wide registry (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Nexus (Docker registry) Topology As shown in the above diagram, Jenkins pipelines deliver application updates directly to the enterprise Nexus instance in the form of new Docker image versions. Each DC Kubernetes cluster pulls from the central image on-demand and caches these latest updates within the local file system. The resulting approach forms a complete federated image management infrastructure, powered by Nexus, Jenkins and Kubernetes. By combining these key open source products into a cohesive solution, Walmart Technology is able to deliver the level of flexibility and isolation its modern logistics systems require. Development teams are empowered to make the right technology choices for the solutions their logistics partners need. Walmart Logistics end users and management are happy because they can use existing distribution center assets and see improvements in the speed of delivery, systems uptime and asset utilization. And finally, Walmart customers ultimately benefit from a system that ensures their favorite items are in stock at Everyday Low Prices.

Here are three reasons why. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 31, 2016 at 6:33PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was tumbling again after last week's earnings, with shares falling 5% on Friday. Longtime observers of the company shouldn't be surprised. While most corporations try to deliver steady earnings growth to please shareholders, Amazon is as erratic as they come. Ramped-up investment was again to blame, as the company opened 18 new warehouses and stepped up video development to beef up Amazon Prime benefits. That kind of sudden slide in profits has happened to the company many times before, and CEO Jeff Bezos still likes to think of his company as a start-up even though its market cap is near $400 billion. Friday's sell-off and the company's sky-high valuation are a reminder that the stock is anything but stable. Shares could easily fall 30% again as they did at the beginning of this year. As the company continues to grow at a breakneck speed, here are its three biggest risks. 1. The boys in Bentonville In the court of public opinion -- and according to many conventional metrics -- Amazon seems to have vanquished Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the world's biggest retailer. The e-commerce leader's market value is close to double that of Wal-Mart's, and its revenue is still growing by nearly 30%. Amazon's stock has been one of the best on the market in the last decade, while Wal-Mart's underperformed the S&P 500. But based on revenue and profits, Wal-Mart is still much bigger. Its resources, which include one of the largest trucking fleets in the U.S, a nationwide network of 5,000 stores, and more than 150 distribution centers, are unmatched by any other retailer. If any company can mount a worthy challenge to Amazon, it's Wal-Mart. After ignoring the e-commerce space for years, Amazon's prevalence has finally got its attention, and under CEO Doug McMillon the company is putting up its strongest growth since the recession. McMillon has made e-commerce a priority with the rapid expansion of its grocery pick-up program and the $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com earlier this year. He's also pushed the company to make investments in stores and wages that have driven comparable sales higher and made the chain a more attractive place to shop. Wal-Mart likes to say it has a store within five miles of 70% of Americans, giving it an advantage in any kind of omnichannel competition, and it has the supply chain and economies of scale to compete with anyone on price. With the Jet.com acquisition and the online grocery pick-up expansion in particular, you can expect the company to continue increasing its focus on e-commerce. 2. A potential recession With Amazon's triple-digit P/E ratio and fickle profits, the market is unlikely to treat the stock kindly during a recession as high-priced growth stocks tend to fall further than defensive dividend payers like Wal-Mart. In its earlier years, Amazon built its value proposition on low prices -- but with the rapid rise of its Prime loyalty program, convenience has become the biggest selling point for most of its customers. That shift also explains why Amazon continues to invest in enhancing Prime benefits by building more fulfillment centers and leasing planes to make deliveries even faster, and spending billions on content for its streaming service. If a recession hits -- and there's a decent chance that will happen in the next few years as the economy is about to enter its eighth straight year of expansion -- American consumers needing to pinch pennies may drop their $99 Prime memberships and shop instead at low-priced options like Wal-Mart, Costco, or dollar stores. That could zap the company's blockbuster growth and put pressure on the stock. 3. The law of large numbers  It's a cliche in business to say that no company can outgrow the economy forever. With 20 years of outstanding growth, Amazon may be doing its best to avoid the economic laws of gravity, but with revenue set to approach $140 billion this year, it will get harder to maintain that growth rate each year into the future as the company will have to find even more sales dollars. The U.S. retail market alone is worth more than $1 trillion, but Amazon isn't going to take it without a fight.  The company's model is better suited to some sectors than others, and while it's clear why it's been able to dominate categories like books and electronics, its ambition in grocery seems questionable. The e-commerce leader has plans to open 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next decade, a move that plays to none of its inherent advantages and is instead an area where Wal-Mart is better suited to succeed. Wal-Mart has already opened hundreds of kiosks in store parking lots to facilitate pickup of online orders, and should have close to 1,000 by the end of next year, meaning it's fast seizing the opportunity in grocery e-commerce. But if Amazon is going to keep growing at the rate investors expect, it needs to make a play for groceries, which represent a domestic market of more than $600 billion a year. Similarly, Prime is another key area for investment and growth, but at this point brand awareness in the U.S. is near 100%. Customer acquisition will become more difficult as the market gets more saturated, and Amazon will have to make the service even better if it wants to attract those customers. That again explains the investments in speedier delivery for new services like Prime Now, and why it's expanding Prime to new markets around the world.  Some of Amazon's ideas, like Amazon Web Services, have paid off richly, but with a market cap near $400 billion and relatively tiny profits, the stock still has plenty of risk. The Bezos-led behemoth has built an impressive set of competitive advantages, but Amazon will have to step outside its wheelhouse to continue delivering the kind of growth the stock's valuation demands. Even as it's become one of the biggest companies in the world, the stock will remain as volatile as ever.   Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

EST October 31, 2016 Vicki Carll was cleared of shoplifting when video showed a security guard setting her up. WTSP photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Tampa, Florida -- Imagine shopping at a store paying the cashier and then moments later manhandled as you try to leave. This happened to a Tampa woman walking out of a Walmart. As 10Investigates explains how this woman claims she was not only framed - but physically detained over less than $30. The incident happened two years ago as Vicki Carll was walking out of a Tampa Walmart. Carll says, ”It was the most humiliating thing you could ever go through.” As soon as she walked out the door, two men grabbed her, manhandled her and dragged her back into the store. At the time Carll says she was baffled. “I didn't know what was happening, I thought I was being mugged,  actually, because I had $500 in my hand and I didn't know what was going on, I had no idea.” It turned out Carll was being arrested for shoplifting. The security guard who was waiting on a bench next to the exit said she stole flea medication worth $29. Click here to read complaint against Walmart Carll's attorney, Barry Cohen calls the incident , “Shameful! Shameful!” Cohen  claims this was an elaborate plan by the security guard to frame his client. In a lawsuit filed Monday afternoon, Cohen points out the security tape shows the guard, who just started that day, dumped something on the floor from a box and then seconds later accused Carll of stealing that item. According to Cohen, a veteran attorney, “I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy, in this case the Walmart employee, was actually caught on video planting the evidence. 10Investigates reached out to both Walmart and the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office. They would just tell 10Investigates they believe the guard, who said he found the medication in Carll's sleeve. Walmart asked the state to prosecute and a jury found her not guilty in less than a minute. 10Investigates talked to several jurors and one said it seemed obvious the guard planted the evidence and couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case. Walmart issued this statement: "This was an unfortunate event in a number of ways. We know how important it is to maintain a safe and secure environment for our customers and associates, and we continually evaluate and work to strengthen our safety measures. That's why we invest in crime prevention efforts and training aimed at deterring criminal activity in our stores and keeping our customers and associates safe." When we asked Carll, “What's this done to your life?” She paused, took a deep breath and sighed saying “It's hurt me a whole lot.” Carll says she has suffered mentally and physically and has filed a lawsuit against the retail giant. She says he no longer feels safe shopping in stores since the incident. “I just couldn't believe it happened and I hope it never happens to anyone else.” The security guard and a manager who grabbed Carll no longer work for Walmart, but the company tells us it's not due to this incident. Neither was disciplined for the case. Walmart also told us the men did not violate company policy by physically restraining the woman   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Heightened security over political unrest Police investigating shooting in Norfolk Entire school board resigns Two shot and killed at Tarrytown Apartments More Stories AMBER ALERT: Police search for 4-year-old believed… Nov 14, 2016, 6:13 p.m. Post-election comments prompt principal's letter to… Nov 14, 2016, 6:03 p.m. Drier weather on the way Feb 20, 2016, 2:12 p.m. About Us Contact Us Meet The Team Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Outlook Hurricane Center Closings & Delays Weather Maps Weather Cameras National Webcams More...

Highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2016: The Trust improved its occupancy to 98.3% in the quarter (from 98.2% in the second quarter) based on leased and occupied space.

The total purchase price of this acquisition was $62.0 million, which was be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing mortgage totalling $34.5 million with an interest rate of 2.87% that matures in 2017 On October 28, 2016, the Trust entered into an agreement to extend a loan receivable in the amount of $40.3 million issued to OneREIT for a period of one year that was due to mature on October 30, 2016 with an interest rate of 6.75%, resulting in a revised maturity date of October 30, 2017 with substantially the same terms except for a one-time prepayment option of $10.0 million that was exercised by OneREIT on October 31, 2016 Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT said, “Our two key focuses remain the health of our core retail holdings and the development of a strong pipeline of growth initiatives and we are pleased with the progress on both fronts. Despite a very competitive market, our principally Walmart anchored sites are able to attract new tenants and increase occupancy. The investments we are making in developing multiple projects in our large urban sites continue to have a modest negative impact on our current profitability but we are confident that these mixed-use investments will provide significant long term benefits for our Unitholders as they become part of our extended portfolio,” added Thomas. Portfolio Highlights Portfolio Information The following table summarizes SmartREIT’s portfolio information: September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Change Fair value of real estate portfolio (in millions of dollars) (1) $8,267.4 $8,168.6 $98.8 Weighted average stabilized capitalization rate 5.89% 5.94% (0.05)% September 30, 2016 Built gross leasable area 31.5 million square feet Future estimated development area 4.7 million square feet Lands under Mezzanine Financing 0.7 million square feet Number of retail properties 142 Number of properties under development 8 Number of office properties 1 Total number of properties owned 151 (1) Includes the Trust’s share of investments in associates Developments and Earnouts Completed on Existing Properties Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 (in millions of dollars) Area (sq. ft.) Investment ($) Yield (%) Area (sq. ft.) Investment ($) Yield (%) Earnouts 9,253 4.7 6.0 49,820 19.1 6.5 Developments 45,592 13.2 7.0 345,471 92.0 6.0 54,845 17.9 6.7 395,291 111.1 6.1 Acquisitions On August 16, 2016, the Trust completed the acquisition of a property in Lethbridge, Alberta, from a third party, totalling 53,392 square feet of leasable area. The total purchase price of this acquisition was $15.3 million, which included $6.2 million paid in cash and the assumption of a mortgage of $9.2 million, adjusted for costs of acquisition and other working capital amounts. Key Financial Highlights Quarterly Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT’s key financial highlights for the three months ended September 30 (including the Trust’s share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $56.7 $92.6 -$35.9 (38.8)% Rentals from investment properties $174.1 $172.9 $1.2 0.7% Net operating income $115.1 $116.2 -$1.1 (0.9)% FFO excluding adjustments $83.5 $83.9 -$0.4 (0.5)% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $0.54 $0.54 $0.00 -% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $0.51 $0.52 -$0.01 (1.9)% Distribution $0.41 $0.40 $0.01 2.5% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 81.0% 76.9% 4.1% 5.3% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing – which are added back to FFO – in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million. Year-to-Date Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT’s key financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30 (including the Trust’s share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $232.2 $227.8 $4.4 1.9% Rentals from investment properties $541.0 $492.2 $48.8 9.9% Net operating income $356.3 $323.9 $32.4 10.0% FFO excluding adjustments $260.1 $229.2 $30.9 13.5% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $1.67 $1.58 $0.09 5.6% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $1.58 $1.49 $0.09 6.1% Distribution $1.24 $1.20 $0.04 3.3% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 78.4% 80.6% (2.2)% (2.7)% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust’s portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust’s portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing – which are added back to FFO – in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in AFFO of $29.6 million was primarily due to the increases described in FFO above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further offset by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $2.0 million. Non-IFRS Measures The non-IFRS measures used in this Press Release, including AFFO, FFO, NOI and payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-IFRS measures are more fully defined and discussed in the ‘Management Discussion and Analysis’ (MD&A) of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, available on Sedar at www.sedar.com.

Key Financial Highlights Quarterly Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT's key financial highlights for the three months ended September 30 (including the Trust's share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $56.7 $92.6 -$35.9 (38.8)% Rentals from investment properties $174.1 $172.9 $1.2 0.7% Net operating income $115.1 $116.2 -$1.1 (0.9)% FFO excluding adjustments $83.5 $83.9 -$0.4 (0.5)% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $0.54 $0.54 $0.00 -% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $0.51 $0.52 -$0.01 (1.9)% Distribution $0.41 $0.40 $0.01 2.5% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 81.0% 76.9% 4.1% 5.3% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million. Year-to-Date Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT's key financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30 (including the Trust's share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $232.2 $227.8 $4.4 1.9% Rentals from investment properties $541.0 $492.2 $48.8 9.9% Net operating income $356.3 $323.9 $32.4 10.0% FFO excluding adjustments $260.1 $229.2 $30.9 13.5% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $1.67 $1.58 $0.09 5.6% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $1.58 $1.49 $0.09 6.1% Distribution $1.24 $1.20 $0.04 3.3% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 78.4% 80.6% (2.2)% (2.7)% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust's portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust's portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in AFFO of $29.6 million was primarily due to the increases described in FFO above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further offset by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $2.0 million. Non-IFRS Measures The non-IFRS measures used in this Press Release, including AFFO, FFO, NOI and payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-IFRS measures are more fully defined and discussed in the 'Management Discussion and Analysis' (MD&A) of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, available on Sedar at www.sedar.com.

Included in that model, apparently, are collard greens, a hearty staple of meat-and-threes everywhere. Collards are typically thought of as a value vegetable, but at Neiman Marcus, they’ll run you $66 plus $15.50 for shipping. What makes $81 collard greens so special? According to the store’s website, these are ready to heat in the microwave and seasoned with "just the right amount of spices and bacon." An order includes four 12-ounce trays meant to serve eight to 10 people, working out to $1.69 per ounce, which is... a lot. Neiman Marcus doesn't mention what particular spices go into the greens, but it's a good bet they're similar to what's found in a 27-ounce can of "Margaret Holmes Seasoned Southern Style Heat N Serve Collard Greens," available at Walmart for a single buck. As for the bacon, a 16-ounce package of Oscar Meyer is listed on Walmart’s website for $4.98. Passing on the Neiman Marcus ready-to-heat selection, a savvy shopper can get 54 ounces of pre-cooked collards and a pound of bacon — plenty for to mix in as seasoning — for about $7. That translates to $0.13 per ounce of greens (or $0.10 if you want to factor in that entire package of bacon). That’s a much better deal. To be fair, Neiman Marcus's greens are likely superior in taste if the company is starting with fresh produce, but is it worth that steep price? Anyone who does their grocery shopping at Neiman Marcus already knows they're paying a premium for $65 broccoli-cheese casserole, $85 cornbread dressing, $72 enchiladas, and so on. Of course, you could simply buy some fresh collards from the market and cook them yourself. Not everything has to be microwaveable, you know. Either way, don’t buy your food at Neiman Marcus. • [H/T: WHIO] • Neiman Marcus Will Sell You Six Dozen Fancy Tamales For $110 [EDAL] • All Rich People Things [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Read Restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Post-Election Letter to Employees My Cast-Iron Conversion This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Are Festive AF This Article has a component height of 6.

Falk / Staff Photographer Pottstown's Marvin Pearson started losing his sight at 8 and was completely blind two years later. During that time, he inexplicably also lost his hearing. Now, at 18, he is a senior at Pottstown High School after spending three years at the Overbrook School for the Blind, and plays football. He scored a 65-yard touchdown and two-point conversion in recent games. by Kathy Boccella, Staff Writer Close icon Kathy Boccella Staff Writer After going blind and then deaf while still in grade school, Marvin Pearson learned how to get around his Pottstown neighborhood, even walking alone six blocks to a Walmart. Regaining some hearing after getting an implant in his left ear, he excelled at wrestling and track at Overbook School for the Blind, figured out how to defeat his two sisters on PlayStation games, and occasionally alarmed them and his mother by roller-blading around the house. Slideshow Blindness can't sack Pottstown running back Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon But that still wasn't enough. During the summer, Pearson contacted Pottstown High School and said he wanted to return to his hometown school for senior year - and there was one other thing. He was going out for varsity football. "I talked to him and said, 'It's going to be a process,' " recalled Pottstown head coach Gary Rodenbaugh. This fall, that process quickly evolved into a remarkable journey not only for his blind and hearing-impaired running back, but for Pearson's teammates, who say his contagious can-do spirit has made an otherwise so-so season a life lesson they will never forget. It was the viral video of a 65-yard touchdown sprint last month during the last play of a 48-0 rout that gave Pearson a burst of fame, including a TV appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he was given a $10,000 scholarship and the promise of a trip to meet his football idol, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. No one seemed to care that the other team's defense stood aside as Pearson tore down the field. The real highlight for the teen was his three-yard plunge for a critical two-point conversion in a victory over Upper Merion High School, because that time he fought off live tacklers to reach the end zone. "It was time to show I was just a football player, not a blind football player," said Pearson, recalling how six defenders couldn't bring him down until he was finally over the goal line. It was the epitome of what Pearson has done again and again since he began losing his sight at age 7: Finding a way to do just about anything other kids do. "People ask, 'How does your brother play football, how does he run track?' I say, 'I don't know,' " marveled his older sister MarDaije, a freshman at Chestnut Hill College. "It's like he never even lost his sight," she said, adding: "He doesn't think he has it worse than others. He feels equal to everybody else." Indeed, Pearson, who maintains a 3.6 grade-point average, is already sprinting toward his next goals, college and a career in sports management, a fitting choice for a kid who's juggling 17 fantasy football teams. "Marvin doesn't know what obstacles mean," said his mother, Ana Carmona. "He has none. If they're there, he does not see them." Growing up in Pottstown, Pearson was an active, sports-loving kid who played youth football in Conshohocken and, his mother recalled, was often "hardheaded." The child's stubborn determination would serve him well when seemingly out of the blue, his vision began to deteriorate. Doctors eventually determined that he suffered from retinal detachment, and laser surgery on both eyes didn't prevent a total loss of sight over the next two years. "I was never the type to cry," Pearson recalled of the experience. "I wasn't scared, but it was frustrating trying to prove to doctors and teachers that I couldn't see." About a year into his vision crisis, Pearson started losing his hearing as well. Carmona said neither the family nor doctors ever figured out the cause. Only the cochlear implant prevented him from completely losing touch with the outside world. Yet Carmona said the harrowing experience seemed to be harder on her than on him. "Marvin, honestly, he took it on the shoulder," she recalled. "It was me in the corner crying every night and angry with God." Pearson's relatives say he always remained focused on what he could do, not what he couldn't. He knew his way around his Bright Hope Community neighborhood, so it wasn't long before he ventured out with his cane, making it two blocks to an aunt's house or to a nearby park with an assist from one of his sisters. "He always just kept going and acted the same," said MarDaije. Sometime he insisted on riding his bike, and she would have to run alongside. At Pottstown Middle School, he wrestled and played football, although he wasn't cleared for full contact. He started high school at the Overbook School for the Blind, where he also played goal ball, developed for blind athletes, in which players try to score with - or block - a ball that makes noises with tiny bells. In transferring to Pottstown High this fall, Pearson, 18, knew it was a chance to pursue his unfulfilled dreams on the gridiron - for real this time. It's a road that few travel. The U.S. Association of Blind Athletes is tracking just two similar players in the entire country, defensive lineman Jay Spencer at St. John Paul II Catholic High School in Huntsville, Ala., and long snapper Jake Olson at the University of Southern California. But Mark Lucas, executive director of the USABA, said it's possible for a blind athlete to succeed in just about any sport as long as coaches are willing to provide adaptations. Rodenbaugh and his staff were more than willing to adapt. They drew up plays for Pearson to take the snap under center and plow forward behind a wedge of blockers, but they also saw the larger, intangible benefit of someone who could teach his teammates about overcoming adversity. Just 5-9 and 154 pounds, Pearson said he idolizes Brees because the Saints quarterback was once dismissed as too short at 6 feet. "We're both underrated," Pearson said. "He's small, I'm blind. And we're both individuals that people don't expect to be as tough as we are." At a recent practice, a few guys worked on the sidelines with Pearson while the first-team defense was on the field. He put his hands together to catch passes, and even threw a few strikes of his own, with a helper telling him how far to throw and pointing his left arm in the direction of the receiver. "Good throw, Marvin!" they said again and again. Teammates appreciate both his accomplishments and his attitude. Nehemiah Figueroa, 16, admires how Pearson works up the home crowd with a few front flips before a game. "Marvin basically proves that no matter what your disability is, you can do anything you want," he said. The 65-yard dash against rival Pottsgrove - in which the opponents didn't challenge Pearson as he sprinted for the touchdown with a teammate's guidance - came with mixed emotions. It had been the Pottsgrove coach's idea. "I just kind of shared with him, this was going to be an opportunity to get to the end zone," Rodenbaugh recalled. "Marvin, being a competitor, was like, 'I don't want them to let me.' I emphasized it was a sign of respect for what you've been able to do and what you've shown to the world." It also proved that Pearson sometimes literally doesn't know when to quit. Five yards past the goal line, he finally dove to the ground. "We were yelling, 'Stop, stop!' - if he kept on running, he would have hit a gate," his mother said. That momentum should carry him to college next fall. It sounds like Pearson might be leaning toward Kutztown University. "I talked to the coach," he said. "He sounds like the kind of guy who will give me a chance to play." kboccella@phillynews.com 610-313-8232@Kathy_Boccella Published: November 2, 2016 — 3:59 PM EDT | Updated: November 3, 2016 — 1:08 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Published Nov 2nd, 2016 2:45 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores and its other retail subsidiaries filed an antitrust suit against owners of Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea tuna brands alleging conspiracy to fix prices and coordinate on can sizes. The federal suit was filed Monday (Oct. 31) in the Western District of Arkansas by attorneys Kutak Rock of Little Rock. A similar and original lawsuit against the three tuna brands was filed in August 2015 by Olean, N.Y.-based Olean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative. Since that filing, several other distributors, restaurants and grocery store operators have filed suit. The suit comes on the heels of other federal litigation resulting from the Department of Justice’s criminal probe on the matter. The DOJ’s investigation focuses on price fixing by the tuna industry’s major players Thai Union Group and Dongwon Industries who own Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Seas shelf-stable tuna brands — a $2.6 billion market. Wal-Mart told Talk Business & Politics it filed the suit to best protect its rights and the interests of its 260 million customers who shop its stores weekly. Wal-Mart also said there is strong evidence to support the price conspiracy claims in the complaint. In the Wal-Mart complaint the retailer said it purchased approximately $400 million per year of self-stable tuna from the defendants in the years under investigation from 2008 through the July 2015. The retailer also claims responsibility for 25% of the defendants’ combined total sales. The gist of the 38-page complaint relates to collusion by the tuna companies. The complaint alleges agreements to reduce can sizes across the industry, to issue collusive list prices, to limit promotional or discount activity, and refrain from offering products using tuna caught without fish aggregation devices (FADs) to consumers. The suit claims owners of Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Sea carried out the conspiracy through secret e-mails and telephone calls, conversations, and meetings facilitated by various industry groups. The price fixing became apparent to the public after the DOJ’s investigation began in July 2015. Because the conspiracy was actively concealed though secret communications, Wal-Mart claims it did not know it was being overcharged for packaged tuna until the federal investigation was launched. “The affirmative acts of the Defendant and their co-conspirator, including acts of further conspiracy, were wrongly concealed and carried out in a manner that precluded detection,” the complaint states. MARKET ‘NOT FUNCTIONING COMPETITIVELY’ The alleged conspiracy to reduce can sizes is said to have begun when Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea “collusively raised prices by decreasing the amount of tuna in cans sold to putative class members without also decreasing prices.” Wal-Mart’s case also states there were economic incentives for the tuna suppliers to conspire given since 1960 the supply of packaged tuna increased because of fishing innovation. However, the demand for tuna has fallen since 1985, suggesting that more supply and lower demand would push prices lower. Wal-Mart claims tuna prices have risen since 2007 with significant jumps since 2011. The suit said retail tuna prices in the U.S. jumped 10.9% in 2010 and 6.6% in 2012 amid a 7.7% drop in consumption. Wal-Mart claims the tuna companies violated the Sherman Act when they conspired to fix, raise or stabilize the price of packaged tuna products sold in the United States. The complaint asked the court to consider the charges and award damages at least three times the overcharges Walmart paid to the defendants in their relevant investigation period. The tuna industry has been had its share of litigation in recent years. In May 2015 StarKist agreed to pay $12 million to settle claims it was underfilling the cans sold at retail. The case was litigated in California federal court. All three tuna companies faced similar claims in 2012 and agreed to a $3.3 million settlement, also in California. The U.S. Department of Justice in December 2015 blocked a planned merger of Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea, noting that “consumers are better off without this deal.” “Our investigation convinced us – and the parties knew or should have known from the get go – that the market is not functioning competitively today, and further consolidation would only make things worse,” Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer note in a DOJ statement. Talk Business & Politics has sought comment from Starkist. Bumble Bee has said it does not comment about ongoing litigation or investigations. DEFENDANTS • Bumble Bee Foods of San Diego, Calif.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Justin Wm. Moyer November 2 Follow @justinwmmoyer   What appeared to be a terrifying criminal abduction in Prince William County turned out to be a YouTube prank, police said Wednesday. Last week, Prince William County Police released video of what appeared to be a person being shoved into the trunk of a car at about 10 p.m. Friday at a Walmart in Woodbridge, and asked for the public’s help in learning more about the incident. But on Monday, police released additional video that showed those involved in the possible kidnapping calmly shopping together in Walmart afterward. So was the kidnapping real — or was it “playfighting,” as one witness reported? “From the beginning, we didn’t really know what it was,” said Sgt. Jonathan L. Perok, a spokesman for Prince William County Police. “We don’t want to call it a prank until we talk to the people involved.” Now, police have determined for sure that the kidnapping was faux. On Wednesday, they announced they contacted the “victim,” an 18-year-old Woodbridge man, who said the incident was staged. “The parties involved appeared to have filmed the incident to later post on YouTube,” the Prince William County Police said in a statement. No charges will be filed, police said. local local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

In the first nine months of 2016, Group revenues totalled €734.2 million, +7.9% or +9.7% on a like-for-like basis. Eric Hémar, Chairman and CEO of ID Logistics, comments: "Every quarter, ID Logistics' business grows at a good pace, both in France and internationally, where the large number of new contracts gaining momentum balances the negative impact of exchange rates in emerging countries. In addition, September brought the first contribution from Logiters, whose integration is progressing on schedule. In a contrasted geographical market environment, with our offer strategically positioned and the quality of our team, we are confident in being able to pursue our growth."

In the first nine months, revenues totalled €425.6 million, +12.4% versus the year-earlier period. This very strong performance was driven by a number of new contracts starting during the period, combined with good momentum, notably in volume, in existing contracts. International revenues rose +16.2% to €125.3 million in the 3rd quarter, and were up +2.3% to €308.6 million in the first nine months, taking into account initial consolidation of the Group Logiters, acquired at the end of August 2016 in Spain and Portugal, on September 1st. Negative currency impact, mainly due to the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and South African rand, was weaker in Q3 than at the start of 2016. On a like-for-like basis, revenues were up +2.9% in the 3rd quarter and +5.9% in the first nine months compared with the equivalent periods of 2015, where growth was strong. NEW CONTRACTS The Group is still taking part in a large number of invitations to tender and winning or starting new contracts, including the following: France The Group is extending its collaboration with long-standing client Carrefour and is beginning operations at a 20,000 m² platform at the Brie-Comte-Robert (Seine-et-Marne) site. It serves 461 Carrefour convenience stores in the Southeast part of the Paris region. ID Logistics is continuing to develop its e-commerce offering and has been selected by AuchanDirect, an online shopping and home delivery service, to operate a 25,000 m² mechanized platform at Chilly-Mazarin (Essonne), which will be able to deliver goods to central Paris and its inner suburbs within a few hours. International Worldwide retail leader Walmart has, for the first time, appointed ID Logistics to manage its logistics platform for non-food products (general goods, garden, office, DIY, toys, etc.) in Argentina. From a 13,000 m2 platform, ID Logistics will manage collection and distribution flows, store 16,000 SKU and carry out cross-docking operations. In Taiwan, the Group is starting a partnership with City'super, an upscale retailer specialising in chilled products, delicatessen goods and lifestyle products with more than 10,000 SKU. Lastly, the Group launches a platform in Russia for the international liquor group Bacardi, 15,000 m² close to Moscow to serve the whole of its retail, distribution, and restaurant clients. OUTLOOK In 2016, the priority of the Group is to focus on the operational and financial management of the numerous operations it has started, laying strong foundations for their future productivity improvement, and integrating the Logiters business. In 2017, the Group will thus be able to take advantage of its strong financial position and consider new acquisitions.

It often seems like people are only dressing to scare or seduce. While some people actually do manage to create an amusing, good-natured costume, the majority suck. I thought we had seen the worst of the worst with these damn clowns. Clearly, I was wrong. Photo courtesy of creative commons / Mike Mozart For the very affordable price of $3.99, Walmart planned on selling “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up.” Yeah, you read that right. Somehow this mockery of mental illness and self-inflicted wounds got past all of the higher-ups at Walmart and was being sold for money. Thankfully, enough people signed an online petition to remove the product, according to pix11.com. Walmart released a statement explaining and apologizing for the incident. “The costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace,” the statement said. “It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it yesterday morning when it was brought to our attention.” Despite Walmart’s reasoning, this is still horrendous and unacceptable. Mental illness is a serious topic, especially on the impressionable youth who easily could have gone online in search of the perfect costume and seen this. It is extremely disheartening that grown people still do not take this seriously. Costume or not, mocking mental illnesses is not okay, and as of right now, neither is Walmart. -M.

Results Outlook Presidential Candidates OnPolitics Wal-Mart may help change conversation on US wages Politics Now Mark Barrett , mbarrett@citizen-times.com 2:30 p.m. EDT November 5, 2016 54 Shares The sign at Walmart's East Asheville store glows in the early evening Tuesday.  (Photo: Mark Barrett/mbarrett@citizen-times.com) While most of us have been distracted by an especially angry election season, The New York Times published an article on a development that may help soothe some of those hard feelings. The Times' Oct. 15 article suggested Wal-Mart's decision announced in February 2015 to pay its employees more, provide them with training and career paths, and give them more flexible and predictable schedules might be paying off. After increasing dissatisfaction with the state of its stores, a drop in a key sales measure that lasted five quarters and a wry observation from a consulting company that, "If an item is not on the shelf, you cannot sell it," the company raised its minimum hourly pay to $10 an hour for workers who complete a training course. The idea was to pay enough to get better employees, including workers who might aspire to a career with Wal-Mart. That was a big switch from the company's approach historically, in which human resources policies were designed to pay as little as possible to as few people as possible. The number of Wal-Mart employees in the United States fell 7 percent over a five-year period ending in early 2013, for instance, while the square footage of stores rose 13 percent. There's some evidence that the investment is paying off, although it is too soon to render a final verdict. The Times reported that sales at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year were up 1.6 percent for the most recent quarter, in comparison to a decline of 0.4 percent for general merchandise retailers overall. Profits were down, but the degree to which that reflects higher payroll costs or other costs is not clear What does all of this have to do with politics? One of the biggest sources of discontent among people considering who they will vote for in 2016 is a long-term trend of stagnant wages for many Americans, particularly those who do not have college degrees. When your pay either doesn't buy more from one year to the next or maybe even drops a bit once inflation is taken into account, it is natural to wonder what or who is to blame. Wal-Mart has a total workforce of about 1.2 million, and it's a good guess that many - by no means all - did not graduate from college. If many of those 1.2 million get a raise, employers hiring from the same pool of workers may have to give raises too. As big as Wal-Mart is, there are limits to how much it can change the national employment picture by itself. In September, there were 36.5 million workers who had only a high school degree or less and an additional 37.9 million who either had a two-year degree or some college without a degree. But with unemployment at around 5 percent these days, Wal-Mart's decision suggests employers may be finding they have to be more generous with their workers to keep them on the payroll. By at least one measure, hourly workers have seen an increase the buying power of their wages for more than three years now. That's a trend that could continue for a while, and perhaps even change Americans' attitudes a bit no matter who sits in the Oval Office in 2017. Crime scenes? But, there's always a "but." A labor union group called Making Change at Wal-Mart challenged the Times' story. "The New York Times didn’t talk to the many workers that still struggle with understaffed and understocked stores, erratic scheduling and poverty wages. It only talked to ones who were willing to push Wal-Mart's propaganda," it said in a news release. The release didn't say how the group knows whom the Times didn't interview, however. Reporters don't always name every source they speak to, especially in a story as involved as the Times' story is. Better documented than the group's complaint is the picture painted by an August story in Bloomberg Businessweek that says cost cutting at Wal-Mart stores has left them staffed with too few people to deter crime. The burden then falls to local police departments. The story says a log of police calls to one store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, runs 126 pages and documents more than 5,000 trips over five years. Bill Ferguson, a police captain in Port Richey, Florida, told the magazine: "The constant calls from Wal-Mart are just draining. They recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it." The mayor of a town in Indiana said he had instructed his police chief to declare the store there a public nuisance. Wal-Mart's CEO says dealing with crime is a top priority and the company says measures to bring down crime are working. Bloomberg Businessweek said police chiefs and officers it interviewed disagree. We don't know what the crime situation is at local Wal-Mart stores, and who should bear what share of the burden for policing Wal-Mart stores or any other store would be a good topic for a debate another day. But the problems suggest that overall, Wal-Mart still has some work to do - and needs more workers to do it.

The ranking is designed to identify the retailers currently setting the highest standards of performance as viewed by their trading partners, and to gain insight into what makes these retailers "best in class."   While Walmart’s long-standing dominance among U.S. retailers now has a formidable challenger in the overall composite score, the discounter continues to outrank all other retailers in the areas of clear strategy and supply chain management.    A major factor in Kroger’s performance this year, according to Kantar, was its ability to innovate and maximize the shopper experience by applying insights derived from both suppliers and its own shopper insights firm, 84.51. Manufacturers voted Kroger No. 1 in the categories of “best retailer to do business with,” “best buying teams,” “most innovative merchandising,” and “best practice category leadership.”       In addition to being tied for the overall No. 1 position, Kroger ranked first in the following categories: "best retailer to do business with," best practice category leadership," "best buying teams," and "most innovative merchandising."     The company also tied for first in the "clearest strategy" category.   Click here for more.     Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Macy’s unloads five stores Sears executive jumps ship for party supplies specialty retailer Online fashion retailer files Chapter 11 CEO shakeup at Whole Foods Safeway to acquire 87-year-old specialty grocery Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Target axes kids’ shopping carts Unusual deal gives Aeropostale new lease on life — and it just got better Flip-Flop Shops on the move Target first out of the gate with holiday hiring plans Solutions Spotlight Holiday Uptime: Preparing Your Network for the Holiday Rush Your network connection is more than just a means of connecting your point-of-sale system – it’s a driving force of your online and in-store experiences.

Share Home MOBILE Contact LOGIN LOGOUT ✕ ≡ Will Fresh kill local grocers? Have you tried Walmart�s new Pickup? You go to Walmart.com or their app and order groceries. Employees shop for you before you drive to the store to pick up everything. No walking around the store, standing in line, or getting stuck longer than you wanted. Walmart took the idea from AmazonFresh. Amazon started AmazonFresh in Seattle, delivering groceries to your door so that you didn�t have to go to a store. It then entered 16 other major markets. Amazon�s only problem was keeping produce, dairy and meats cold enough once delivered. Leaving those items outside a door all day isn�t as easy as leaving your latest DVD purchase. Walmart capitalized on that idea and created Pickup. You schedule a time to visit the store guaranteeing that your items are kept fresh. Not to be outdone, Amazon has decided to create pickup locations in Seattle. Customers can order what they want online and have it waiting for them at a gas station-esque store where they pull up and their groceries are put in their cars. This gives them the ease of ordering online while keeping all items as fresh as possible. The only question is, if these Amazon and Walmart succeed in our community, how long before local neighborhood groceries go out of business? Have you used Walmart Pickup? What are your thoughts on it? Any other tech questions? Email me at Ashley.LexChron@gmail.com Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

In September, in Huntsville, TEXAS, Wilma Price was driving through a Walmart parking lot when she saw a homeless man holding a sign that said, “Dog in pound. Need help.” Price, who runs a rescue called Mr. K’s Pet Shelter, stopped to find out his story. She learned the homeless man, named Patrick, had been arrested and jailed for trespassing, and that, because of that, his dog ended up in the animal shelter. She took Patrick to the shelter, and paid the $120 necessary for him to get his dog — named Franklin — back. The story was picked up by the website Life with Dogs, CBS News, People.com and many more. Dozens of other websites reprinted or rewrote it — most of them doing a decent job of passing along the facts. Then there was the Alabama Observer. It reported that the story took place in Huntsville, Alabama, that the dog’s name was Wilbur, that the homeless man’s name was Mark Spencer, and that the good Samaritan’s name was Elizabeth Masterson. The story had no links to actual news sources, and little attribution. It wasn’t the only website to get the facts askew, but it was the only one that appeared to be making up entirely new names for everyone involved. At least three other websites published versions of the story with those erroneous names. One wonders what might be the motivation for substituting illegitimate names into a legitimate story. Might the exact same story have happened with different people at a Walmart in Huntsville, Alabama? Clearly not. Might the website be trying to cover its rear, legally? Maybe. Might there be something more nefarious going on, such as diverting donations intended for Patrick (whose last name isn’t Spencer) to some guy named Mark Spencer? We hope not. Might a computer program be doing the website’s writing? Highly possible. Apparently, a bogus Go Fund Me campaign to raise funds for Patrick was launched by someone neither Wilma nor Patrick knew, and, using photos from Wilma’s Facebook page, it raised $3,000 before the page was removed from Go Fund Me. That’s $3,000 Patrick and Franklin didn’t get. Wilma Price, meanwhile, started a campaign for him too, and it has raised more than $15,000 for Patrick on GoFundMe. Price said Patrick has been helping her organization with rescue efforts since the two met, and her Facebook page documents their adventures together. Snopes.com looked into the story and couldn’t figure out how or why the Alabama Observer version had new names inserted into it. There is no contact information on the Alabama Observer’s web site, and no description of who operates it. Snopes reported it appears to accept stories submitted by users, as opposed to having its own reporters or freelancers. We think there’s a good possibility it’s one of those websites that runs news stories through computer programs that rewrite them (with mixed results, or should I say “stirred outcomes?”). How else could you explain the opening of this recent Alabama Observer story about clown sightings in Ohio? “The developing rash of reported dangers including clown-faced villains has law authorization offices crosswise over Ohio and somewhere else attempting to recognize true blue dangers while cautioning deceptions are no giggling matter.” (Photos courtesy of Wilma Price) Bookmark on Delicious Digg this post Recommend on Facebook Pin it on pinterest share via Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet about it Subscribe to the comments on this post Bookmark in Browser Tell a friend Posted by John Woestendiek November 2nd, 2016 under Muttsblog.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Walmart in McDowell County has been sold Share Article By MetroNews Staff in News | November 01, 2016 at 7:29PM KIMBALL, W.Va. — The Walmart in McDowell County, which closed earlier this year, has been sold. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports the McDowell County Clerk’s Office said the store in Kimball was sold in September for $175,000, according to a specialty warranty deed on file. Walmart announced in January the closure of more than 250 under-performing stores worldwide with more than half of those in the U.S. The list included the Kimball store. The state had been contacted by the Rural King chain, but no announcements have been made about the store being bought. County officials said selling the Walmart property is good for the county because it would bring back jobs lost during the store’s closure.

Brad Sibley said. Reagan Principal Andrew Bullock was notified around 1:45 p.m., and the schools were locked down, with a police presence, until about 2:15 p.m., when they told school administrators it was safe for kids to be released. A couple of bus schedules were thrown off a bit, but every student got on and was taken home. No injuries were reported. By the time officers arrived at Walmart, the suspect – described as teen boy – had fled north into the woods between the train tracks and Dixon Rehabilitation & Health Care Center. At one point, officers had him in sight and tried to establish a perimeter, but he escaped and has not been caught, Sibley said. At no point were there any threats of violence or any references to a weapon, so the department was “being very precautionary” by locking down the schools while they collected more information, he said. “With no threat of violence, it’s just a kid running from us,” Sibley said, adding that police are looking at Walmart surveillance footage to try to get a more thorough description of the suspect. Superintendent Margo Empen said parents were made aware of the situation by phone. “Obviously, Walmart is very close to our property,” Bullock said. “But nothing ever endangered anyone here.” It’s the schools’ first lockdown of the school year, he said, “and hopefully, the only one.” Related Links Preliminary levy increase triggers hearing for Dixon school district The definition of generosity in Sterling LEARN AND LIVE: Follow those kids Patients have some good friends at Sterling grade school Polo alum focuses on solutions to student struggles Sterling High School's October Student of the Month: Kallie Zuidema More News Preliminary levy increase triggers hearing for Dixon school district NEW: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:51 pm He wants to bring it all together for development NEW: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:41 pm The definition of generosity in Sterling NEW: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:15 pm Relief effort in Dixon is quite an operation NEW: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:14 pm LEARN AND LIVE: Follow those kids UPDATED: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:49 pm Patients have some good friends at Sterling grade school UPDATED: Nov. 14, 2016 - 6:15 pm Comments National video Tweets from https://twitter.com/saukvalley/lists/svm-news-sports-staff Reader Poll What do you think of the people who have marched in U.S. cities to protest Donald Trump’s election as president?

Highly weighted course work adds to student anxiety Retail’s nightmare before Christmas November 1, 2016 Rachel Sterzai Opinion No comments Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) / collider.com   Tis the season to get spooky and get in the holiday spirit, apparently. While you may have noticed the past month or so had most store covered in Halloween decorations, it’s hard to pass through a Walmart, dollar stores or even some residential neighbourhoods without seeing the tell-tale signs of flashy lights and giant Santas. But the real world isn’t exactly like Tim Burton’s iconic duo-holiday film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. I’m all for holidays and being cheery but there’s something weird about starting one celebration before another is even over. Halloween is a time for the dark and scary which is definitely contrasted by the holiday seasons’ bright and happy vibes, and I don’t see the two mixing well. Is all of November and December really not enough for the holidays? While it is based around Christian religious beliefs, Christmas is one of the most widely celebrated holidays around the world. Millions oonsibilities that don’t involve eating mass quantities of food. Even if you don’t celebrate, it’s still a time for relaxation. Christmas holidays away from home, time off from school for kids and lots of home cooked meal. But before we get there, there are still two whole months between Halloween and Christmas. In this time, fill the store with decorations, candy and Michael Buble’s seasonal album. However, I think the time before October 31 should be reserved for the ghoulish side of things. Not only does speeding up the holiday transition make some people uncomfortable, but also – as a student – I feel like it makes deadlines seem a lot closer than they really are. If I’m already supposed to be getting in the Christmas spirit, should I be thinking about exams, too? Because I’m honestly not ready for that. There is still so much to happen before the holidays can. As November begins, people do not often recognize Remembrance Day. Canada is supposed to be pretty patriotic, and thinking about those who fought for our country takes the backburner to Christmas and even Halloween because it’s not a largely celebrated holiday. And on the note of other holidays, while Christmas is such a major focus it takes the attention away from equally important times, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. These are important holidays for many people in North America and should not be overshadowed by Christmas just because of its secular Santa Claus Christmas is one of the most highly celebrated times of the year, but I think when it comes to the advertising of it, it’s very much a consumer oriented event and marketed in a way that makes it seem like companies just want attention. ‘Buy these decorations,’ ‘eat all these cookies’ and ‘spend all the money on presents for everyone you know.’ Don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly invested in getting into the ‘Christmas spirit’ myself, but I don’t think half the year should be dedicated to the material aspect of the season. However it’s also a time to spend with family and friends; gifts are just an added bonus. Each holiday is special and deserves attention, so don’t go too crazy and remember what they’re there for. So, let Halloween finish before you start decorating the house and getting ready for Santa – Christmas will definitely get it’s fair share of time. 2016BrockCanadalocalprotest About Rachel Sterzai View all posts by Rachel Sterzai → Tweet Pin It Related Posts Late Trent comeback ends Brock’s bid for...

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Dell's Black Friday 2016 Xbox One S Deal Is The One To Beat Posted: Nov 1 2016, 10:11am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 1 2016, 11:34pm CDT, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Dell Black Friday 2016 Ad features the best Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal. The sales managers at Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are likely having to change their planned Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deals.

Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Dell will offer the Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 with Gears of War 4 game and an extra Xbox One Wireless controller for $249.99. The combined value of the three items in the bundle are $419.99. The total savings are $170 and this is no fluff. Dell makes the Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal more desirable with selling it $50 less than the Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 sells now. The offer is cheaper and you get free stuff worth $120.

This Dell sale starts today at 8am ET and will end on 11/2 7am ET on dell.com.

(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz) Share Written by Ismat Sarah Mangla November 01, 2016 Every holiday season, the stakes get higher for brick-and-mortar retailers fighting off the rise of online sites like Amazon. And with good reason: The National Retail Federation expects online sales in the US to jump from 7% to 10% this holiday season, while research firm PwC predicts that e-commerce will rise by 25%. Better discounts and customer service haven’t managed to stem the tide of harried holiday consumers turning to online shopping. So this year, brick-and-mortar retailers are doubling down on in-person “experiences” consumers won’t find on their smartphones and laptops. Wal-Mart is rolling out selfie booths for consumers to snap pics of themselves and Santas roaming the stores, and “holiday helpers,” employees who stand guard at checkout lanes and help (or nag at) customers to retrieve forgotten items. Target has said it’s rolling out toy demonstrations, along with in-store marketing that will feature “elements of theater” like spotlights and red stage curtains. Both stores plan to offer “exclusive products” you can’t find online. Those include a $400 Disney Princess Carriage at Wal-Mart, and a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, featuring the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places” at Target. For its part, Home Depot has created a new app that lets customers get directions to an item they’re looking for in the store, along with information on inventory and what other locations might carry the item. Lord & Taylor is offering an app that allows customers to live-chat with a salesperson while shopping; Saks Fifth Avenue is enlisting an army of personal shoppers to help people pick out gifts. Employing all those extra hands is a risky bet. Retailers angling for a leg up are already scrambling for seasonal workers, which has put upward pressure on wages. The typical non-seasonal hourly rate of $10 to $12 is expected to climb by $1.50 to $3 an hour during the fourth quarter, according to Prologistix, a large US logistics staffing company. Incorrectly estimating staffing needs has hit retailers and logistics companies in the past. More online shopping and harsh winter weather cost UPS some $200 million in overtime pay, customer refunds, and other overruns costs in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. “What we see the leading retailers doing is creating emotional experiences in their stores,” said Steven Barr, PwC’s U.S. retail and consumer leader. “A website can’t give you goosebumps.” The question is whether the goosebumps will pay off. Correction: An earlier version of this article said the toy demonstrations at Target would feature “elements of theater.” It is the in-store marketing that will include those elements, not the toy demonstrations.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Nov 1, 2016 at 9:09AM Uncertainty about who will become the next president is helping to put holiday spending on track to fall below below last year's record numbers. Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to the holiday season, at least until the presidential race ends, according to the National Retail Federation's (NRF) annual consumer spending survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. The research found that people will spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, down from 2015's record $952.58. "Everywhere you turn -- whether you're picking up a newspaper or watching television -- political advertisements are taking up ad space that retailers typically use to get holiday shopping on the minds of consumers across the country," NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a press release. Customers shop at a Wal-Mart on a Black Friday. Image source: Wal-Mart. It's not going to last The good news for retailers is that barring a protracted tallying, like what happened between Al Gore and George Bush in 2000, Election Day should end the uncertainty. Even though either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump supporters will be disappointed after Nov. 8, the public will at least know who has won, and television will move back to regular commercials. "Once the election has passed, we anticipate consumers will pull themselves out of the election doldrums and into the holiday spirit," Shay said. The NRF, in a separate poll, found that 43% of the American buying public say they "are being more cautious with their spending due to the uncertainty of the election season." That seems like a bad sign, but the survey also found that 87% of consumers could be convinced "to spend an extra $25 this holiday season if tempted by a good sale or promotion, the perfect gift for themselves or others or free shipping." "Retailers should prepare for a rush of consumers in the weeks following the presidential election as they get more economic and political certainty and are looking to take advantage of promotions and deals that are too good to pass up for their friends, family and even themselves," Shay said. Consumers are starting early Despite the uncertainty of the election people are cautiously starting their holiday shopping well before Black Friday. The NRF research showed that 41% of shoppers began in October while the same amount will begin shopping in November. Only 18% will wait until December. "While many holiday shoppers are starting early on their gift lists, Millennials are waiting to catch the best deals for their gifts, with nearly half (46 percent) waiting until November to start shopping," Prosper Insights Principal Analyst Pam Goodfellow said. "Younger consumers are likely to be looking forward to the Thanksgiving/Black Friday shopping 'experience' -- and know that retailers will be offering great promotions that weekend." Stores are starting early Department stores and big-box retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have pushed the start of the holiday season earlier each year. That includes opening on Thanksgiving, which both of those chains have done in recent years and launching Christmas merchandise before Halloween products have been cleared from the shelves. That makes sense given the increased competition for holiday dollars. In addition to having to deal with election uncertainty, retailers like Wal-Mart and Target would do well to take note of one other trend, according to NRF's research. "Many shoppers are taking the approach of 'one for you, two for me' this holiday season," Shay said. "Retailers are preparing by offering a wide array of merchandise and promotions -- items shoppers want to give as great gifts at prices so good they want to buy for themselves too." That's an attitude that seems perfectly reasonable in a season defined by political unrest. The election's impact may fade by the time Thanksgiving, Black, Friday, and Cyber Monday roll around, but for now shoppers are being cautious. Still, stores need to be ready for a giant post-vote exhale. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned. He does very little holiday shopping (so you're not getting a gift).

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Life-saving presentations, no action items on Wednesday's city council agenda Tuesday Nov 1, 2016 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 In what may be another brief meeting, the Ridgecrest City Council is looking at an agenda with no discussion/action items for Wednesday, the last meeting before the election November 8. Police Chief Ron Strand will make two life-saving award presentations. So honored will be Officers Cory Ballestero and Richie Garibay, along with residents Adam Southard and William Sample—all of whom saved a life during a mobile home fire on Oct. 3, 3016. Two consent calendar items relate to easements. In one, council will be asked to accept a grant of easement from Russell and Tina Warren offering 25 feet of their property to “meet the half street Right of Way width of 55 feet for S. Downs.” The property is located at the southeast corner of  “future W. California Ave. and S. Downs Street and along the frontage of South Downs St.” according to the staff report. In another consent calendar item, council will be asked to accept a grant of easement from Walmart Stores along South China Lake Boulevard, East Bowman Road and South Silver Ridge Street. The streets in question bound the new Walmart Super Store. Also on the consent calendar is an item asking for approval of the disability retirement of Police Patrol Officer Thomas Dilley. A string of consent calendar items relate to contract change orders on projects with contract Griffith Company, Inc. In another consent calendar item, council will be asked to approve a contract change order for $5,877.80 in charges for various “additions and subtractions” to the West Graaf Street Improvement Project. Another consent calendar item involves potentially approving $18,766.44 in charges for changes to the East Drummond Avenue Project. Another consent calendar item involves a change order of $3,395 in charges for changes to the North Warner Street Improvement Project. A final consent calendar item involves a change order with a decrease of $390 and another with a charge of $23,287.17 for the West Drummond Widening and Realignment Project. The closed session will begin at 5:30 p.m. Two items are listed: potential ligation with Kern County and potential litigation with Southern California Edison. The regular council meeting is scheduled for Wednesday Nov. 2 at 6 p.m., at City Council Chambers at City Hall, 100 W. California Ave in Ridgecrest. It will also be broadcast on Mediacom Channel 6 and streamed online at www.ridgecrest-ca.gov/city-media/rc6-live.

She helped overturn a ballot measure that increased electric rates for businesses and lowered them for the poor. “Instead of defending poor people and righting wrongs, we found ourselves squarely on the side of corporate greed against the little people,” her colleague, Webb Hubbell, later wrote. The future presidential contender worked for 15 years as a corporate litigator at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas’s capital, longer than any other position in or out of government. Her portrait still hangs in the firm’s downtown offices. Arkansas first lady Hillary Clinton in 1985 before one of her husband’s inaugural balls.

LYNN/ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet that chapter in her life has been all but excised from the official Hillary Clinton story. She hardly ever mentions it on the campaign trail. Her husband skipped past it when telling of her life story at the Democratic National Convention. Until August, it wasn’t even mentioned on her campaign’s official biography. It illustrates a pattern apparent through Mrs. Clinton’s career and into this year’s presidential campaign: She emphasizes different roles for different audiences. During her time in Arkansas, she was an advocate for children and families, and a successful lawyer at a white-shoe, mostly male law firm, representing the state’s biggest corporations. This characteristic leads many supporters to predict she would build governing coalitions if she becomes president. Opponents, including some on the left of her own party, conclude it means she lacks core convictions. The duality was on display in transcripts of paid speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to Wall Street firms before she entered the presidential race. As a candidate, she has emphasized the need for tough regulation of Wall Street. In those addresses, she pointed to the industry’s contributions.

FBI Reviewing New Evidence in Clinton’s Email Server Case Trump Adds $10 Million of His Own Money for Ads Early Voting Bolsters Clinton in Key States “More thought has to be given to the process and transactions and regulations so that we don’t kill or maim what works,” she said in one speech underwritten by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a transcript that was stolen from her campaign chairman’s email account. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon pointed to her advocacy work during her Rose years. “From the day she left law school, Hillary Clinton has never stopped being an advocate for children and families,” he said. “This period was among her most active years as Arkansas’ First Lady, when she introduced a new early childhood education program and expanded health access to rural parts of the state.” Mrs. Clinton’s years at the firm included some controversy. For one, the roots of the Whitewater affair reach back to her years at Rose when her husband was serving as Arkansas governor. The firm and Mrs. Clinton represented a failed savings-and-loan association run by James McDougal, the Clintons’ partner in the Whitewater real-estate investment, in a matter before state regulators. Whitewater dogged the Clintons throughout Bill Clinton’s presidency, though neither of them was ever charged. For Hillary Clinton, 1993 was one of the most brutal years of her political career. Marked by scandal, harsh media coverage and the defeat of her health-care plan, the year began her transformation into the tough, cautious candidate she is today. When her husband ran for president in 1992, her work at Rose sparked questions about whether she had benefited from state business handled by her firm. Mrs. Clinton denied that it had. “For goodness’ sake, you can’t be a lawyer if you don’t represent banks,” she said at the time. Two of her best friends at the firm followed the Clintons to Washington. One of them, Mr. Hubbell, eventually went to prison after it was discovered he had stolen from the firm. They haven’t spoken since. “She doesn’t talk to me,” Mr. Hubbell said in a recent interview. The other friend, partner Vincent Foster, committed suicide. Mrs. Clinton, known then as Hillary Rodham, joined the Rose Law Firm in 1977. She had followed Mr. Clinton to Arkansas and was teaching at the University of Arkansas law school when he was elected attorney general and planned a move to Little Rock. She had worked with Mr. Foster on a project, and he helped recruit her to the firm, which was founded in 1820 and bills itself as the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi River. At the law school, she had run a legal-aid clinic for the poor. Many of the Rose firm’s clients were big companies, including three of the state’s largest: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Tyson Foods Inc. and Stephens, Inc., a brokerage firm. In one way, the Rose years reinforce a theme of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign—that she is a pioneer for women. She was the firm’s first female associate, and two years later, its first female partner. Although many partners welcomed her to the firm, some initially worried how they would introduce her to clients and what would happen if she became pregnant, Mr. Hubbell recalled. When she did have a child, she has said, some partners were surprised that she expected to be paid during her maternity leave. Some people who worked with her said her casual dress and look were out of step with Southern women of that era. “Her appearance was much more stodgy and old maid-ish,” said Joe Giroir, one of her partners from that era. “I don’t think she ever had a real feel of Arkansas.” Mr. Giroir said there was just one woman in his law school class, and for years he had “misgivings about female attorneys because I felt like their family obligations were going to interfere” with their work. He said he changed his mind after seeing a female lawyer in Houston do a good job with a case. Inside the firm, lawyers were split over Mrs. Clinton’s value as a partner, according to Mr. Hubbell and others. Mrs. Clinton recruited Amy Lee Stewart to the firm and mentored her. “Whenever I needed anything, wanted to ask a question, needed help with the right angle on a brief, I’d say, ‘Do you have a few minutes?’ ” recalls Ms. Stewart. “She’d say, ‘Come in. Let’s have a cup of tea and cookies.’ ” Other colleagues resented Mrs. Clinton’s outside interests and how they limited her billable hours. In addition to time away campaigning for her husband, who was on the ballot every two years, she served as chairwoman of both the Legal Services Corp. and the Children’s Defense Fund and led efforts to revamp Arkansas’s education system. “You can say that, well, perhaps from one perspective she wasn’t as productive as other partners were,” says Jerry Jones, a Rose colleague. “But from another perspective, what a great role model. She is able to balance all of these things and be successful at them.” As first lady in 1996, Mrs. Clinton gave a deposition as part of a Whitewater inquiry in which she talked about how her attentions were divided in the mid-1980s. “I was engaged in a lot of pro-bono public activities,” she said. “I spent much of 1982 campaigning nearly full-time for my husband. I spent much of 1983 heading up the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, so that my time was not solely devoted to law practice by any means.” At Rose, her share of the profits was tied to the business she generated, so her time on outside civic and political activities meant she earned less than other partners. She supplemented her income by serving on corporate boards including Wal-Mart and TCBY Enterprises, the yogurt franchise, both Rose clients. She wrote in her 2003 memoir, “Living History,” that she “worried that because politics is an inherently unstable profession, we needed to build up a nest egg.” By 1991, she was earning just over $100,000 from the firm, plus another $60,700 from director’s fees, according to news reports at the time. As governor, Mr. Clinton earned $35,000 that year. In her 2003 book, Mrs. Clinton writes only briefly about her work at Rose. She highlights a couple of cases, including her first jury trial, where she defended a canning company sued by a man who found the rear end of a rat in his pork and beans. He claimed he couldn’t kiss his fiancée because every time he thought about the situation he would spit. Mrs. Clinton argued the man hadn’t suffered any real damages and because the rodent part had been sterilized it would be considered edible in parts of the world. She said the plaintiff won “only nominal damages.” Mrs. Clinton didn’t identify the name of the man or the company involved. After that, she rarely appeared in trial. She took on some family-law cases, such as a father fighting for custody of his 6-year-old daughter, and a family that wanted to adopt their foster child, which ran counter to the rules then in place. The bulk of her cases involved defending large corporations, a Wall Street Journal review of court records suggests. She represented a supplier of Jenn-Air products in a contract dispute between a distributor and supplier. She represented the cosmetics maker Maybelline Co. seeking to stop a competitor from advertising its mascara as “clean lash” because, Maybelline contended, it wasn’t actually waterproof. She defended a company accused of wrongfully terminating an agreement to distribute natural-food products. She represented First Nationwide Bank when it argued that Nationwide Savings and Loan was violating its trademark by using the term “Nationwide Savings.” And when a former employee of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Arkansas argued he had been wrongly denied disability benefits, she represented the company. Another partner, Herbert Rule, remembers a case in which a wealthy timber owner left the bulk of his $17 million estate to Arkansas College. When the man died at age 94, his recently hired female caregiver produced another will that left most of the money to her. The firm sued on behalf of the college. “At a meeting with the lawyers representing the caregiver, Hillary spoke up after 30 minutes in a loud voice, pointing to the caregiver and said, ‘Everyone knows you told him what to do, and he did it. You told him to change his will, and he did,’ ” Mr. Rule recalled. A long silence and “some muttering” by the caregiver followed, he said. About two weeks later, the case settled, he said, with the bulk of the money going to the college. Webb Hubbell, left, with Bill Clinton in Little Rock in 1986, was one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest friends at the Rose Law Firm.

PHOTO: JOHN SYKES/LIAISON/GETTY IMAGES “This was a remarkable example of Hillary’s strategic insight and chutzpah, two of her remarkable traits,” he said. The electricity-rate case was already under way when she joined the firm in 1977. In November 1976, the activist group Acorn, which is now largely defunct, had succeeded in getting onto the ballot an initiative, dubbed LifeLine, to lower electricity rates for low-income users and increase them for businesses. It passed. The Rose team’s argument was that it amounted to an unconstitutional taking, a line of reasoning Mr. Hubbell credits in part to Mrs. Clinton. “We hated seeing her on the other side of the table,” says Wade Rathke, founder of Acorn, who was friends with her husband at the time. “We had never been confronted with the reality of her as a corporate lawyer. But there she was and there we were. We didn’t win this one.” Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Next article FBI’s revelations on Hillary e-mail probe leave campaigns scrambling to react Previous article Spending on U.S. Elections Slides for First Time in Recent Political History DigitControl Related Posts News November 14th, 2016 Trump draws sharp rebuke, concerns over Stephen Bannon appointment Financial Times November 14th, 2016 Trump sticks to $1tn stimulus and tax cuts US Election November 13th, 2016 Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Leave a Reply Cancel reply BD eXpress Agriculture gets attention at COP22 climate discussions through AAA initiative For the first time in the 22 years of Conference of Parties (COP) session of the United Nations...

Many theories continue to be explored, as criminologists seek the best solutions in reducing types and levels of crime, including theft. Retail theft is a $200 million problem. According to the 28th Annual Retail Theft Survey by Jack Hayes International, 1.2 million shoplifters and dishonest employees were apprehended in 2015 by just 25 large retailers. In many states, shoplifting is charged and punished as a theft or larceny offense – usually as a petty theft or the state’s lowest-level theft offense if the value of the merchandise stolen falls below a certain threshold ($500, for example). Retail theft causes consumers to pay higher prices for goods, and is having a detrimental effect on retailers’ bottom-line profits. When someone is caught stealing, normally police are called, but the response time is usually slow, as shoplifting is considered a minor offense. One theory on how retail theft is being handled comes from entrepreneurs at the Corrective Education Company (CEC), who have created an alternative that benefits both shoplifters and stores. If a participating retail store catches someone stealing merchandise, they give the shoplifter a choice – either the store calls the police, or the shoplifter can agree to sign up for a shoplifting education course that is administered by CEC. According to CEC, the six-hour education course is designed to explain the costs of shoplifting and ensure that offenders will never steal again. The course costs $400 to take, but CEC notes that more 20,000 offenders have already chosen to take the course rather than risk going to jail, and CEC offers scholarships to those who are unable to afford the $400 fee.                         CEC says that less than two percent of shoplifters who complete the CEC educational program reoffend, compared with estimates as high as 80 percent for those who do not participate in a restorative justice program. Darrell Huntsman, CEC founder and CEO says, “Sometimes good people can make bad choices. We believe we are offering a unique option to our clients that provides a more positive alternative to the traditional legal process, benefitting the retailer, the offender and the criminal justice system.” According to the CEC, retail loss prevention professionals like the solution because they can deal with shoplifters more quickly, and it saves time and money. Retailers can connect to the CEC network with a preloaded iPad that allows the signup process to be efficient and safe. The technology allows the store to archive witness statements, video footage, or other evidence to ensure organized reporting. Walmart is currently piloting the solution in about a third of its stores, with plans to expand it, says Mike Lamb, Vice President of Asset Protection for Walmart.  Walmart has typically relied on local law enforcement to deal with crime on company property, but its partnership with CEC is helping to reduce the burden of shoplifting on the criminal justice system and on its loss prevention teams. Walmart executives are hoping the collaboration can help the store earn back some of the $3 billion it loses each year to shoplifting. “We’ve had the program in pilot at a handful of stores since 2014 so we could evaluate results and effectiveness,” Lamb explains. “We have recently expanded the number of participating stores after the initial pilot was shown to be successful in reducing calls to law enforcement while providing first-time offenders a second chance to make better choices for themselves in the future.” Lamb adds that Walmart’s Asset Protection Field Teams go through training sessions with the CEC Restorative Justice Providers. “Our providers utilize mobile technology and communicate to the participants on how the program works through pre-recorded videos so that the communication to each participant is both fair and consistent. We also strive to work closely with local law enforcement because we know their collaboration and support is very important to overall success,” he says. A main goal of the program at Walmart, Lamb says, is to decrease store calls to law enforcement. “The reduction of calls to law enforcement also benefits our associates because they spend less time processing an offender or in court and instead can focus time and efforts on the sales floor.” What are your thoughts on this restorative justice program? Is it an opportunity for shoplifters to get a fresh start and to repair whatever harm they caused through poor behavior? Or is the approach too “soft”?

Pictured is the store at 1401 W. Passyunk Ave. in Philadelphia. Caption(Photo provided) Pretzel options sit out for the Philly Pretzel Factory in the Philadelphia Mills Mall. The company is looking to expand with the possibility of multiple DeKalb locations beginning next spring. By STEPHANIE MARKHAM smarkham @shawmedia.com DeKALB – The Philly Pretzel Factory is looking to set up shop in DeKalb by next spring with the possibility of opening multiple locations. Chief development officer Tom Monaghan said the company is in the process of finding someone to be a local franchise owner, which he hopes will happen in the next three months. “We’re looking for a small business owner to be the ‘pretzel mayor’ of their town,” he said. Monaghan said the person should be community-minded, as part of the company’s operations includes selling its products wholesale to places like schools, hospitals and nursing homes. In addition to traditional soft pretzels and party trays, products include specialty items such as pretzel cheesesteaks, spicy pretzel sausages, pepperoni pretzel melts and pretzel dogs. Pretzel dough is made fresh and hand-twisted, according to the company’s website.  Monaghan said the Philly Pretzel Factory could partner up with the DeKalb Walmart to open an in-store location, as well as open an individual store in the city. “We have 31 in-store locations open already,” he said. “It allows us to take advantage of Walmart’s existing customer base.”  Monaghan said the company foresees being able to support multiple locations in DeKalb based on research into the demographics of the city, but the owner of the local franchise will ultimately decide where to operate. “It costs $150,000 to $200,000 to get an in-store location up and running, and a little more with traditional stores,” he said. “So, it depends on the person.” DeKalb being home to Northern Illinois University is part of the appeal, but the large population of children is also a draw for the company, he said. “We sell our pretzels for fundraisers in the schools, birthday parties, soccer games, in the cafeteria at lunch time,” Monoghan said.  Philly Pretzel Factory was founded in 1998 in Philadelphia by Dan DiZio and Len Lehman and has expanded to more than 150 locations, according to the company’s Facebook page.

Credit: Courtesy of Rachel Kajfez | Assistant Professor with the Department of Engineering Education By mixing engineering with community service, the Toy Adaption Program: Connection for Expansion is a group of engineering students that provides modified toys for children with special needs. While most toys you will find at Wal-Mart or Target are designed for the common child, some children with special needs are unable to operate a given toy because of physical impairment. By making a few modifications, such as changing a switch to a button, TAP makes toys that any child can play with. Elizabeth Riter, program manager and founder of TAP, said the program arrived on campus in 2013 after a former student of hers contacted her about the idea, which sprung from a similar organization — Replay for Kids in Medina, Ohio. The former student had gone through a toy adaptation workshop with Replay for Kids and proposed bringing it to OSU with the purpose to apply engineering outside of the classroom, Riter said. “We are just starting to see students who are interested in doing this type of engineering that also helps humanity in some way.” — Elizabeth Riter, program manager and founder of TAP. While Riter said the first workshop only had about a 50 percent success rate with adapting toys, she went on to say TAP is now run by a group of engineers who run workshops for different groups and has evolved into a lab experience in the classroom. “Sometimes you break open a toy and it’s easy to break open, but then it’s really hard to put back together,” said Meg West, a fourth-year in civil engineering and an intern with TAP. Now in its third year, the team has gained experience in modifying toys. As for the design process, Riter said the plan to attack for each toy is open-ended, as each toy is built differently. Keeping up with the newer and popular toys can be difficult, the team has been able to make modifications to toys like an electrical bubble blower, where the team added an audio jack cord where the user can plug in the switch to activate the toy. “It’s opening them up. It’s figuring out how they work then basically adding a second way to activate the toy,” Riter said. “It still works the original function, but kids can activate it by using a switch.” Since each special needs child suffers from a different disability, each toy has to be specifically modified to fit the child’s capabilities. Much like Design for 90, TAP is an engineering program that has a focus on humanitarianism. Riter believes the program’s popularity comes from students’ interests in helping others with assistive technology. “We are just starting to see students who are interested in doing this type of engineering that also helps humanity in some way,” Riter said. “Assistive technology and adaptive technology is something that is becoming more prevalent in what students want to do with an engineering degree.” Rachel Kajfez, an assistant professor with the Department of Engineering Education, said she feels it is important to add TAP to a first-year engineering student’s curriculum, saying it would give the student the opportunity to find an interest in assistive and adaptive technology. “Students can have a really tangible, hands-on, people-orientated experience for their first year,” Kajfez said. “So hopefully this will spur involvement in other humanitarianism or people-centered kind of work.” TAP works with two organizations –– the Nisonger Center Toy and Technology Library as well as Katelyn’s Kloset –– which help distribute the modified toys to families. In addition, the group plans to work with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to host a workshop to show parents how to create adaptations for toys. Because of grants from the Office of Outreach and Engagement, TAP is able to donate all of their modified toys for free. “If you were to buy a toy, you might buy it at Target or Amazon for something like $15,” Riter said. “If you bought (the adapted toy) from a company that actually sells adapted toys, it’s going to be four or five times more that cost.” While doing a workshop at Katelyn’s Kloset, an adaptive toy library, Jarod Manguiat, a second-year in computer science engineering and an intern with TAP, had the chance to witness how his work can impact the lives of the children and families. “It’s really cool to see the families, especially giving the chance to see their kids be independent,” Manguiat said. “It’s even cooler to watch the parents watch their kids be independent.” The Engaged Scholars logo accompanies stories that feature and examine research and teaching partnerships formed between the Ohio State University and the community (local, state, national and global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources.

Unlucky Louie showed up at the club for his penny game complaining of an aching back. “Did you strain a muscle?” I asked in sympathy. “At Wal-Mart,” Louie groaned. “One of those ‘World’s Strongest Man’ events should be trying to pull the shopping carts apart.” Louie got snarled up in today’s deal. As the declarer at five diamonds (not North-South’s best spot; as the cards lay, they could have made six clubs), he ruffed the second heart and drew trumps. Louie next cashed the A-K of clubs. The queen fell from East, but after Louie took the jack and ten, the suit was blocked. He couldn’t reach dummy’s fifth club and lost two spades to go down. SINGLETON “I needed either defender to have the singleton queen,” Louie sighed. Louie can get untangled. He can draw two trumps, ending in dummy, and lead a club to his nine. When that strange finesse wins, Louie can draw the last trump, lead a club to his ten, and cash the A-K and the fifth club for a spade discard.

Since his actual bidding suggests a distributional minimum, settle for game. Raise to four hearts. To try 3NT with only one spade stopper might be a losing action.

Whole Foods Co-Founder John Mackey to Take Over as Sole CEO Bloomberg 11/2/2016 Craig Giammona Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

Robb will cease to be co-chief executive officer on Dec. 31, but he’ll remain on the board and serve as an adviser to Whole Foods, the Austin, Texas-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Robb has been at the company for 25 years. Quotes in the article Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 32.03 +1.73 +5.71% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.49 -0.74 -1.04% The move puts pressure on Mackey to fix the current crisis at a company he helped found more than 36 years ago. Mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continue to make inroads into Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. The company has been trying to fight back by offering more discounts and even starting a new chain focused on younger shoppers, but the payoff isn’t yet clear. Though sales slid last quarter, cost cuts allowed the company to post better-than-expected earnings. That helped send the shares up as much as 6.6 percent to $30.38 in late trading. The stock had been down 15 percent this year, hurt by Whole Foods’ longest sales slump in more than a decade. Profit was 28 cents in the fourth quarter, topping the 24-cent estimate of analysts. But same-store sales dropped 2.6 percent in the period -- worse than the 2.1 percent decline predicted by analysts. Total revenue of $3.5 billion was in line with estimates. Comparable sales are expected to range between flat to a 2 percent decline in fiscal 2017, the company said. Whole Foods expects to record an expense of $13 million this quarter tied to Robb’s departure, including $10 million for a 30-month noncompete agreement. “In a year that presented many headwinds for food retailers, we made measurable progress on positioning our company for continued success,” Mackey said in the statement.

(Steve Griffin | The Salt Lake Tribune) Boarded-up Granite High School in South Salt Lake, Monday, March 14, 2016. The mayor has vetoed the latest plan to tear down the buildings and redevelop the site. Development plan » New application from Garbett Homes focuses on residential half of property. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) The South Salt Lake City Planning Commission will consider a new plan Thursday to develop the old Granite High School property, and this time, Wal-Mart shouldn't come up. The public hearing will feature a new plan from Garbett Homes — the developer with an agreement to acquire the century-old high school property from Granite School District — that skirts around the controversial question of whether big corporations or local businesses should fill the commercial section of the site. Instead, Garbett Homes is only proposing land-use changes to build 80 new homes on the 13.5-acre southern half of the property at about 3540 South and 500 East. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The developer has applied to prep the southern chunk of the site for residential development by changing its designation to low-density residential, adopting a planned-unit development overlay zone, and getting preliminary subdivision approval. The homes will mimic the design of the nearby Terra Sol subdivision at 3500 South 300 East and follow Terra Sol's lead with energy efficient features and solar capability. Garbett Homes has also suggested a one-acre park at the northeast end of the subdivision to act as a barrier between the homes and future commercial development. To go into effect, the plan has to pass through the City Council. But first, the Planning Commission will pass on its recommendation. The Commission has said the plan mostly meshes well with the city's General Plan goals and would blend easily into the surrounding community, but it noted a few things to look out for. According to city code, 20 percent of any new development must be allotted to parks or other open space, and Garbett Homes' proposed park only amounts to 7.4 percent of the development. The developer argues that the backyards it has planned for the homes are more compatible with the neighborhood, which would exempt it from the requirement. Staff also drafted a recommendation that the park relocate to a more accessible location for the new homeowners and the rest of the community. Garbett Homes' plan would also mean that 500 East turns into blank-façade street with a long line of backyards bordering the road. The layout would require special approval from the City Council, and the Planning Commission gave specific landscaping requirements — including preserving the old trees — to keep the streetscape beautiful. In March of this year, Garbett got the City Council's approval for a full development plan that included a Wal-Mart grocery store in the commercial section of the land, but Mayor Cherie Wood vetoed it with vocal support from some community members. Now, Garbett has set aside — at least temporarily — the controversial commercial development issue to get going on the lower-profile homebuilding. The hearing is at 7 p.m. on Thursday at South Salt Lake City Hall, 220 E Morris Ave.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 6 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Gov.

The total purchase price of this acquisition was $62.0 million, which was be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing mortgage totalling $34.5 million with an interest rate of 2.87% that matures in 2017 On October 28, 2016, the Trust entered into an agreement to extend a loan receivable in the amount of $40.3 million issued to OneREIT for a period of one year that was due to mature on October 30, 2016 with an interest rate of 6.75%, resulting in a revised maturity date of October 30, 2017 with substantially the same terms except for a one-time prepayment option of $10.0 million that was exercised by OneREIT on October 31, 2016 Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT said, "Our two key focuses remain the health of our core retail holdings and the development of a strong pipeline of growth initiatives and we are pleased with the progress on both fronts. Despite a very competitive market, our principally Walmart anchored sites are able to attract new tenants and increase occupancy. The investments we are making in developing multiple projects in our large urban sites continue to have a modest negative impact on our current profitability but we are confident that these mixed-use investments will provide significant long term benefits for our Unitholders as they become part of our extended portfolio," added Thomas.

 Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million.

 Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust's portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust's portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015.

Macy's announced Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, it is staying committed to Thanksgiving Day shopping, confirming that it will open an hour earlier on Thanksgiving Day. The move comes as several stores and a mall operator have decided to close for the turkey feast. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) NEW HAVEN, Conn. (WTNH) — It may seem too early to talk about holiday shopping, but in the retail world, it has officially begun. Whether you’re a fan of Christmas coming early or not, ’tis the season at least to save a lot of money!  Here are a look at some great deals you that may help you save money on just about anything over the night couple months. Target and Best buy are both offering free shipping all season long. So save yourself the money of gas to shop in person. Amazon has already rolled out Black Friday-like deals. There’s now a “deal of the day” section on their website. The company says they’ll roll out new discounts there sometimes hourly leading up to the holiday. I checked it out and found you can save on everyday items like laundry detergent or things like winter coats or toys if you want to start checking things off your list. Money.com is also reporting, to compete with Amazon, Walmart is staffing ”holiday helpers” to specifically help you find gifts and make purchases easier. So with a little luck, things will at least become less stressful for you. Also, now is a great time to think about layaway which is a great way to ease the financial burden this time of year can have.

ISSUE 9 News Lifestyles Feature Sports Opinions Campus Safety Report Comics Corrections .pdf Contact Archive There’s a nationwide prison strike Nov 2nd, 2016 | By annaneshyba | Category: 2016-2017, Opinions How the prison-industrial complex perpetuates adapted slavery By Jacqueline Mckenna Staff Writer If you haven’t heard about the nationwide prison strike that began Sept. 9 of this year, you are far from being the only one. Maybe you’re someone who gets the majority of their news online, and you’ve been lucky enough to see a headline or two about the strike on your Facebook feed from a small, online-only news source or blog. Maybe you haven’t, but you reasonably expect that major American media outlets would report on the largest prison strike in U.S. history. But since we live in this terrible time where up is down and you don’t have to know jack shit to be a presidential nominee, you have assumed incorrectly! It doesn’t take a plucky, dedicated journalist like myself to Google “nationwide prison strike” and scroll fruitlessly for a CNN or MSNBC blurb. Neither station seems to be covering this instance of 24,000 inmates in at least 40 prisons from nearly two dozen states protesting the institutions that capitalize from their underpaid (or often completely unpaid) labor. The closest one will find to breaking news stories is a paltry one and a half Opinion pieces from The New York Times, a quick rundown from CBS on the first day of the strike and two actually informative pieces from The Guardian, only one of which was published within the past month. That last point is especially important: this disturbing media silence is so pervasive that I actually had to start by Googling if the strike was even still happening. Spoiler alert: it is. The strike began at Holman, an Alabama prison, and was organized by a prisoner-led group called the Free Alabama Movement (FAM). Starting on Sept. 9, 2016, protesting inmates ceased performing work activities, which can range from general prison maintenance to various forms of labor used by dozens of corporations. (Examples include sewing garments for Victoria’s Secret, harvesting produce for Whole Foods and Walmart or even manning call centers for AT&T). Prisoners performing this labor (typically during long shifts in unsafe or unhealthy workplaces) are paid barely pennies a day, and have no resources in the event of workplace injury. Prisoners who fail to report to work, even in the case of illness, can be punished with solitary confinement and other disciplinary methods. If forced labor with little to no pay sounds like slavery to discerning readers, that’s because it absolutely is. Under the 13th Amendment, which many believe outlawed all slavery in the United States, there is a very wide, very profitable loophole allowing slave labor to continue as a completely constitutional “punishment for crimes.” If you are just now tuning in to the history of institutionalized racism in the U.S., that loophole created a legacy that produced sharecropping, Jim Crow and basically everything about our current day prison-industrial complex that continues to disproportionately incarcerate People of Color. (The phrase “prison-industrial complex” can be defined as “the overlapping interests of government and industry that use surveillance, policing and imprisonment as solutions to economic, social and political problems,” according to prison abolition group Critical Resistance.) According to FAM and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC), an associated organization advocating for prisoners’ rights, inmates from various striking prisons across the country have issued lists of demands compiled by prisoner groups. Nearly every individual list demands fair pay for work, more humane living and working conditions, better access to rehabilitation and education programs, etc. One prison group wants, among those basic rights, a library that fits more than eight people at a time. Most striking inmates don’t even necessarily want the work to stop; they just want to be fairly compensated for the work they do while they serve their time. It is this uncomplicated plea for human rights and dignity that make it so shocking that nobody, not even Fox News, has scooped the story up. They could so easily twist it (as with everything else they report on) to make a sensationalized point about how — I don’t know — racism is over or every inmate on strike is a puppy killer or #PrisonGuardLivesMatter or some other such nonsense. At least then there would most likely be a rebuttal of liberal outrage from the other corners of major media; there could be some semblance of a public conversation about the strike. Is this the state of news and journalism, where even a badly reported story would be better than none? But perhaps it should be ultimately unsurprising that the mainstream media won’t touch this story. According to one of the half-assed pieces from The New York Times (whose title, “In Race for Millennials, It’s Time to Speed Up”, is so bafflingly misleading to the subject that I scrolled passed it multiple times before realizing it showed up in my search results on purpose), reporters aren’t allowed to enter federal prisons while this kind of “action” is taking place. Even the basic fact that the strike is still ongoing is “an assertion that is hard to verify.” Then again, the undrinkable water that continues to flow through the pipes in Flint, Michigan, and poison its largely Black population is extremely easy to verify. The overwhelming rates of deadly police brutality against Black and Latino people are easy to verify. The lack of human rights afforded to prisoners who are disproportionately Black and Latino is clearly documented and should, in fact, be easy to verify. It doesn’t feel like much of a stretch at this point to label media indifference towards the nationwide prison strike as yet another cog predictably upholding the legacy of slavery that every aspect of American culture is, in one way or another, built upon. The white America that is inarguably in control of the narrative of news is the same white America that created the old slavery, pretended to abolish it and has been benefitting from its loopholes ever since. We — white America as a whole, media and all, including myself —don’t like to talk about slavery, old or new. And because the inmates on strike are literal slaves, why would we talk about them?   jmckenna@willamette.edu Comments are closed.

Billy Ray Wilhelm, 58, of Claremont was sentenced in Catawba County Superior Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to common law robbery and admitting his status as a habitual felon, prosecutors said. On Dec. 7, 2015, Wilhelm approached the woman in the parking lot of a Hickory Walmart and asked for money to help his family, according to prosecutors. The woman gave him the money and her address to later return the money. The next day, Wilhelm showed up at the woman’s Conover home, bringing her newspaper to the door. She let him inside, and he stole her purse, the Catawba County District Attorney’s Office said. When she confronted him about it and tried to take her purse back, Wilhelm shoved her and left, prosecutors said. The victim got his license plate as he drove away. “It was very satisfying to send Mr. Wilhelm to prison for victimizing a trusting, elderly lady,” District Attorney David Learner said in a statement. “He only decided to plead guilty when we walked into court this morning to begin picking a jury for his trial. “I would also like to commend all the officers involved for their outstanding investigation and quick arrest in this case,” Learner said.

 Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT said, "Our two key focuses remain the health of our core retail holdings and the development of a strong pipeline of growth initiatives and we are pleased with the progress on both fronts. Despite a very competitive market, our principally Walmart anchored sites are able to attract new tenants and increase occupancy. The investments we are making in developing multiple projects in our large urban sites continue to have a modest negative impact on our current profitability but we are confident that these mixed-use investments will provide significant long term benefits for our Unitholders as they become part of our extended portfolio," added Thomas.

 Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million.

 Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust's portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust's portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in AFFO of $29.6 million was primarily due to the increases described in FFO above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further offset by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $2.0 million.

Last year, in the car park of a Walmart in Portsmouth, Virginia, an 18-year-old called William Chapman became one of 306 African-Americans killed by their own police force. So far, so routine. What was unprecedented about this case, however, was what happened next: Stephen Rankin, the officer who shot him, was charged with first-degree murder. In Unarmed Black Male (BBC Two), the director James Jones hit documentary pay dirt: he had access to all sides in Rankin’s trial, including Rankin himself. Unflinching, open-minded, letting the facts speak loud, this was exemplary film-making. It was tough to watch at times, though; Chapman’s mother and Rankin’s wife providing tear-stained proof of the ripples of gut-wrenching misery that spread wide from such encounters. What was clear from the start was that nothing was clear. Chapman, a testosterone-driven teen, may have been up to no good. And Rankin had previous – he had shot dead an unarmed Kazakh immigrant four years earlier, whose only crime was to be hopelessly, stumblingly drunk. Former police officer Stephen Rankin Credit: AP The pair’s wretched misfortune was to meet in that car park. It was a confrontation partially captured on film, like so many of the shootings of unarmed black Americans, footage that gave blood-splattered punctuation to Jones’s piece. But the footage proves nothing about intent. Grandstanding lawyers (from both the defence and the prosecution), myopic witnesses and paranoid jurors, perhaps scared of repercussions from the police force were they to reach an unfavourable verdict, added little to the application of justice. In the end, Rankin was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently serving two and half years; time, you imagine, he will spend wishing he had eyes in the back of his head. But the damage, Jones made all too clear, lives on. It is there, crackling below the surface, in the fractious, fractured relationship between America’s black population and those supposed to protect them. If ever argument were needed about the incompatibility between guns and civilisation, it was provided by this harrowing, necessary piece of television.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More Matthew Fisher: Donald Trump’s pledge to revive mines resonates in down-and-out coal country Matthew Fisher  11.02.2016 ShareAdjustCommentPrint WELCH, W. Va. — There are few better places to understand how Donald Trump could become U.S. president than McDowell County, whose county seat, Welch, straddles the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River. This corner of Appalachia’s severely depressed coal country has become a sensation because Trump is more popular here than in any other place in the U.S. The abrasive real estate developer won 91.5 per cent of the vote in the Republican primary on a promise of better days. Or, as he likes to phrase it, “making America great again.” He did this by pledging to revive coal mining, which has fallen on increasingly hard times because of concerns over the carbon emissions it produces and competition from cheaper fracked gas from the Dakotas and elsewhere David Thompson is one of the few miners in the county who still has work. Wiping grime off his face after an eight-hour shift “more than a mile underground” during which he had shoveled “33 blocks of 100 feet of coal,” he said he and nobody he knew trusted politicians any more. Trump was different because he did not regard him as a politician. “Seems like he’s got a level head on him,” Thompson said. “He knows how to make money, to put businesses in. He’s advanced himself.” To understand just how bleak life is here, Walmart closed its store in January after 12 years trying to make a go of it. Small wonder. The county’s population has shrunk from 100,000 to 20,000 in the past few decades. Unemployment has been above 50 per cent for several years. Country music and religious programming dominate local airwaves. Candidates for sheriff vow they will bring “Christian values” to their work. Trump has become a hero in such down-and-out places because he offers hope. His commitment to revive the coal industry smacks of opportunism, but such words resonate with millions of Americans who feel the 21st century has left them behind. It is a message that contrasts sharply with that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. She vowed months ago that part of her environment agenda was to “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” “We’re on the backburner for everything and it just ain’t right,” said Thompson, 57. At a time when “everybody’s scrapin’ to make ends meet,” he called Clinton out as “a professional politician.” He blamed her for supporting Obamacare, which he says most working people in West Virginia cannot afford, and the email scandal. “If I’d been caught with all those secrets where I shouldn’t have had them, I’d now be in jail,” he said. However, Clinton’s worst sin was that she wanted to close the remaining mines. “If she gets in there I think the coal miners will have it tough makin’ a livin’ because of the (Environmental Protection Agency),” Thompson said. This remote valley has voted Democrat for generations. This fall, it was hard to find anyone who would admit they would still do so. One of the exceptions is Johnny Bishop, who sells an eclectic assortment of used mining helmets, belts and lamps, overalls and American flags from his roadside flea market. “I will vote for Clinton because my father was a Democrat but between her and Trump, I see nothing but trouble,” Bishop said. “I remember John Kennedy’s train stopping here during the 1960 campaign. But we don’t have a train station any more. Hell, we don’t even have a bus stop.” Although he was backing Clinton, Bishop, who lost his job in the mines years ago and whose six children had left to find work, said she “wasn’t right about coal. I think it’s got a good future. All she is doing is following (U.S. President Barack) Obama, but she sure has got everybody here riled up.” Frances Blankenship, editor of the Welch Daily News, doubts coal could come back, although she wishes it would. Her family has lived in McDowell Country for generations. She was in despair not only about the collapse of mining, but the social crisis it has triggered. “Most young people have moved away,” she said. “Worse than that, a lot of those who stay are overdosing. We are losing two or three of them every month that way.” As for the choice voters faced on Nov. 8, Blankenship described Trump as “pitiful” and Clinton as such a liar “I don’t believe anything she says. I really wish we had a third party to vote for.” Still, she was sure the county “would go hard for Trump. Throw a stone out on the street and you’ll hit somebody who is voting for him.” That’s what Thompson is counting on. “I am just one person but I say, ‘Give him a chance and let’s see,’ ” he said. “He might pull something out of his hat.

Next came the police officer who leaned over the backyard fence and peered under his deck. Were they looking for a criminal in the quiet neighborhood of houses and woods? Then the retired Pepsi worker saw a sheep with four horns wander by the backyard pool. "It was creepy for sure," Bott said Wednesday afternoon. Police officers and municipal workers Wednesday captured five sheep who have been wandering the fields, woods and backyards from Onondaga to Camillus and back again for nearly two weeks. The sheep gathered a loyal following on the Camillus Community Connection Facebook page. "I didn't know anything about this," he said during an interview at his home at 214 Emann Drive. The great CNY sheep hunt: They're big, with 4 large horns each, they're on the lam The sheep, estimated at one time to be a flock of five to seven animals, escaped from a property on Kasson Road in the town of Onondaga. The Onondaga County Sheriff's Department has had a half dozen calls about the wandering sheep since Oct. 24. Two days later the Camillus Police Department put a notice on the department's Facebook page asking for the public's help in finding the animals. The sheep were spotted on Sheridan Road, Corporal Welch Road, Kasson Road, Howlett Hill Road and Fireside Lane, as well as near a Wal-Mart. Then at 9:29 Wednesday Camillus police got a call: five sheep were grazing near East Hill Elementary School on Blackmore Road in Camillus. Sheep grazing at East Hill Elementary School in Camillus.Camillus Police Department  Officers tried to round them up, but the sheep moved away, said Lt. Dan Burlingame. Camillus called in extra help from the New York State Police and the Solvay Police. Members of the Camillus animal control, highway department, parks and recreation department, and the building and grounds department helped in the round up, as did workers from the West Genesee School District. In all 40 people, stretching a snow fence between them, herded the animals through backyards, making the fence smaller and smaller until the flock was boxed into the fenced yard at 216 Emann Drive, Burlingame said. They were finally captured at 11:35 a.m. Camillus' 5 runaway sheep nabbed after 2 weeks by 40 people with snow fence The animals were loaded into a livestock trailer donated by a local farmer. One sheep, though, got away. "It somehow jumped the fence into my yard," said Bott, who lives at 214 Emann Drive. He estimated that his house is about a half mile through the woods from the elementary school where the sheep were first spotted. As Bott watched from a second- floor window, the sheep wandered around the backyard, climbed up on the pool deck before is went under the deck. From there officers herded it out and put into the trailer with its mates, he said. "It was my excitement," Bott said. Mike Bott, 214 Emann Drive, Camillus, watched as police officers and municipal workers captured a sheep from under his deck on Wednesday Nov. 2, 2016.Charley Hannagan|channagan@syracuse.com  Burlingame said he's confident the five sheep picked up Wednesday make up the entire flock. The sheep escaped from property that is not zoned for livestock, and the owner doesn't want them back, the officer said. Finding a new home for the sheep wasn't easy, Burlingame said. This is mating season for the animals and farmers have told police that a new ram introduced into a flock will likely fight with other rams, he said. A local farmer, who doesn't want any publicity, has taken the sheep to his farm for safe keeping, Burlingame said. They will be taken to their permanent home on another farm on Thursday, he said.

The retailer named Mackey as its sole chief executive officer on Wednesday, ending a dual-CEO role that he shared with Walter Robb for the past six years. In taking the step, the board is trusting that the eccentric Mackey can figure out how to make Whole Foods fresh again after its worst sales slump in at least a decade. Mackey, 63, is a libertarian who has railed against Obamacare and minimum-wage laws, putting him at odds with some Whole Foods customers and employees. But he’s also a vegan who pioneered the organic-food movement and briefly turned Whole Foods into the second-most-valuable food retailer in the U.S. -- behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- in the fall of 2013. Though Robb helped provide a check on Mackey’s outspoken tendencies, the current struggles have probably made it increasingly difficult for the pair to reach consensus, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “When things were going well, it was probably much easier to agree on things,” he said. Mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart, continue to make inroads into Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. The Austin, Texas-based company has been trying to fight back by offering more discounts and even starting a new chain focused on younger shoppers, but the payoff isn’t yet clear. Cost Cutting Though sales slid last quarter, cost cuts allowed the company to post better-than-expected earnings. That helped send the shares up as much as 5.4 percent to $30.06 Thursday in New York. The stock had been down 15 percent this year. Profit was 28 cents in the fourth quarter, topping the 24-cent estimate of analysts. But same-store sales dropped 2.6 percent in the period -- worse than the 2.1 percent decline predicted by analysts. Total revenue of $3.5 billion was in line with estimates. Comparable sales are expected to range between flat to a 2 percent decline in fiscal 2017, the company said. “In a year that presented many headwinds for food retailers, we made measurable progress on positioning our company for continued success,” Mackey said. Early Days In 1980, when the first Whole Foods opened in Austin, there were fewer than a half-dozen natural-food supermarkets in the U.S. Now every major chain touts its selection of organic groceries. As it tries to bounce back, Whole Foods is pursuing $300 million in cost cuts and working to lower prices at its more than 460 locations. The company also is building out a lower-priced store concept called 365. The first location of that chain opened about five months ago in Los Angeles, followed by two more on the West Coast. The stores, cheaper to build and staff than a standard Whole Foods, are designed to pull in budget-minded shoppers. A fourth location will open in Austin this spring, the company said on Wednesday. Results for the first three stores have been mixed, but the company said it now has time to assess what is working and what isn’t. The fourth location will be “365 2.0,” Mackey said. The company has said the new chain’s locations will come on top of the 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. But that forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the company’s stock hit an all-time closing high of $65.24. Analysts have questioned whether there’s room for so many high-end organic stores in the U.S. Rivals Catch Up When Whole Foods was thriving in the ’90s and ’00s, the burgeoning popularity of foodie culture was a reliable growth engine. The company offered items like grass-fed beef and organic produce that had been difficult to find elsewhere. But the industry has caught up. Organic products are now widely available at U.S. grocery stores, often at lower prices. And food deflation has made matters worse. With costs dropping for items like beef and eggs, some retailers have slashed prices in a bid to boost store traffic. That’s put even more pressure on Whole Foods to stay competitive. Robb, 62, will step down from the company on Dec. 31, but he’ll remain on the board and serve as an adviser to Whole Foods. The company expects to record an expense of $13 million this quarter tied to his departure, including $10 million for a 30-month noncompete agreement. Robb, who has been at the company for 25 years, also will get a 30 percent lifetime discount at Whole Foods’ stores. The board decided it was time for a more “streamlined structure,” Robb said on a conference call. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Brian Bollinger Nov 2, 2016 11:49 AM EDT Recent economic data could cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. When this will happen is anybody's guess. When it does happens, however, stocks with big valuations could see a lot more volatility. In building a portfolio or planning for retirement, we need to be ready. Here are some options. This group of safe dividend stocks won't necessarily impress you with their dividend yields, but they offer attractive value. The key is their low payout ratios and rapid dividend growth. If and when interest rates increase, these 10 dividend stocks could be a reasonably safe place to be. 1. Newell Brands  (NWL) Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, Newell Brands has built a brand-name empire in consumer and commercial products. The Newell Brands portfolio includes the following names: Rubbermaid, Lenox, Goody, Contigo, Waterman, Parker Pens, Paper Mate, Sharpie, Dymo, Graco, Aprica, Marmot outdoor gear, K2 Skis, Volkl Skis and Baby Jogger. These brands -- and others -- bring in a total of about $5.92 billion in annual sales. The range of brands is so diverse that at least one of them likely will turn up wherever people shop. Newell Brands is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells NWL? Learn more now. Walmart is one of the largest buyers of Newell Brands products. Having a wide range of well-respected brand names eases the path to negotiating with this price-sensitive customer. In the final analysis, Walmart sets the base price for most of Newell's products. This company's competitive edge comes from strength in product design and manufacturing combined with efficient distribution and advertising. The other secret to Newell Brands' success is its strong sales base. The company's brands dominate writing (30% of sales) and several categories of what's known as "homecare."  The current 76 cent-per-share annual dividend payout offers investors a 1.5% yield. In the past five years Newell has been improving cash flow and the payout ratio as well. During this time, dividends have compounded at a 30.6% annual rate. On Oct. 12, Newell announced the $1.95 billion cash sale of its tool business. That cash will be a significant addition to the $627 million already in Newell's bank account, further strengthening the safety of its dividend.

She said the boy liked her daughter and he was upset because she was dating someone else. Officers spoke to the boy, 13, who said the woman's son was bullying him at school and wanted to meet up to fight him. He denied making any threats of violence and agreed not to contact the woman or her children. Officers explained to the woman that both boys are contributing factors in the incident, however, she became irate and began yelling at them and told them they were not doing their jobs. She told them it would be their problem when the boy comes over and shoots her son. She added that they would be sued and she would make sure they are fired. She slammed the door shut as they left her residence. Departmental information, Mayflower Avenue: A man said Oct. 26 his vehicle and garage were egged and he believes it was due to the Donald Trump political signs in his yard. He asked for special attention during overnight hours. Disturbance, Mayfield Road: A man said Oct. 22 there was a woman at Walmart on a scooter who was not taking care of her kids and letting them eat food and put it back on the shelf. Officers spoke to the woman, 57, who said the kids were her grandchildren and one of them, a two-year-old, was having a bad temper tantrum. She was advised of the complaint. Disturbance, Oakville Road: Officers responded to Oakville Park Oct. 23 after it was reported two boys were going to fight and others were going to film them with their phones. They learned the two 14-year-old boys did not like each other and were going to fight. Officers explained to them the consequences of fighting and had everyone leave the park in separate directions. Disturbance, Eastgate Plaza: Officers were asked to remove a customer from Marc's Oct. 23 because he was yelling racial obscenities at people for unspecified reasons. He had left prior to their arrival and was not located. He was last seen walking on Queens Park Avenue. Theft, Golden Gate Boulevard: A comfort Inn manager reported Oct. 23 a guest failed to pay for a second night at the hotel and had damaged the room. He tried to pay with his mother's credit card, but it was declined. He said he would return to pay for it, but he hadn't at the time of the report. The manager said the Mayfield Heights man, 41, owed $265.48, which included a $150 charge for violating the no smoking agreement. Officers did not observe damage in the room, but did smell an odor of cigarette smoke and noted the suspect is known to the police department. A warrant was issued for his arrest after they tried unsuccessfully to locate him at his home. Trespassing, SOM Center Road: Officers responded to the Coppertree apartments Oct. 23 for a report of a man banging on a patio door. They learned the Parma man, 35, had been previously banned from the property due to other disturbances there. He said he did not remember being told not to return. He was arrested for criminal trespassing. Traffic offense, Interstate-271; A Mayfield Heights man, 29, was cited for no operator's license and expired license plates after his vehicle was pulled over Oct. 23 for the expired registration. He told officers he had a driver's license in Russia, but had not obtained one in Ohio since arriving in the state two months ago. His vehicle was towed and he was given a ride home to his apartment. Theft from building, Sunset Road: A woman reported Oct. 24 she arrived home after a week-long vacation and discovered the TV in her bedroom was gone and had been replaced with a similar model. She suspected a man, 21, whom she and her sister were allowing to stay at the home because he is recovering heroin addict, was involved. She told the man he could no longer stay at the house and she also threw out the TV because she believed it was stolen. She then learned the man had two friends over the home while she was away. He told her he noticed after his friends left that the TV was gone so he said thought he could replace it and everything would be OK. There were also two computers, an iPad and $400 cash missing from the home, but the man denied having any knowledge of it. In a separate incident, an Iroquois Avenue resident reported her TV stolen from her home Oct. 18. She said her neighbor, a 21-year-old woman, was at her home before she left for the evening. She came to ask for a cigarette and make small talk. Her boyfriend, a 21-year-old Highland Heights man, was on the front porch while she was in the home. The couple is the same friends the man had over the home on Sunset Road. The woman said they are both heroin addicts.

Voters to Decide on Pro-Charter School Measure Published on Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by Common Dreams Public Education at Stake With Mass. Voters to Decide on Pro-Charter School Measure "Wall Street must not be allowed to hijack public education in Massachusetts," said Sen. Sanders by Andrea Germanos, staff writer 0 Comments Massachusetts voters will decide the fate of Question 2, which would allow up to 12 new charter schools per year. (Photo: Save Our Public Schools) U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has weighed in on the most expensive statewide ballot measure voters will face November 8—Massachusetts' Question 2, which would lift the existing cap and allow for as many as 12 new charter schools per year. Referring to the financial industry's backing of Question 2, the former presidential candidate said in a statement Tuesday, "Wall Street must not be allowed to hijack public education in Massachusetts." "This is Wall Street's attempt to line their own pockets while draining resources away from public education at the expense of low-income, special education students and English language learners," he continued. Indeed, the International Business Times and MapLight published last week the results of their investigation which found "that executives at eight financial firms with contracts to manage Massachusetts state pension assets have bypassed anti-corruption rules and funneled at least $778,000 to groups backing Question 2, which would expand the number of charter schools in the state. Millions more dollars have flowed from the executives to nonprofit groups supporting the charter school movement in the lead-up to the November vote." Further, WBUR reported Sunday that while the no side "is almost entirely funded by national and local teachers' unions," over 80 percent of the contributions flowing to the yes side have come from so-called "dark money." Foremost among those is Families for Excellent Schools, a controversial New York group whose donation total has surpassed $13.5 million so far—and keeps rising. But other out-of-state cash comes from familiar names in support of charters, including $1.8 million from Walmart heirs Jim and Alice Walton, $240,000 from former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and $250,000 from John D. Arnold, a Texas-based billionaire and philanthropist. While polling last month showed the no on 2 side ahead, a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll conducted Oct. 24-Oct. 26 showed voters equally divided —45.4 percent to 45.4 percent. More on the Referedum in Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has already vocalized her opposition to the measure, expressing concern over what "this specific proposal means for hundreds of thousands of children across our Commonwealth, especially those living in districts with tight budgets where every dime matters. Education is about creating opportunity for all our children, not about leaving many behind." That speaks to concerns of many charter school opponents—that they cherry-pick students, foster segregated schools, exclude children with disabilities, and others who may "jeopardize the academic profile of the school." Proponents, meanwhile, have argued that it will help "failing public schools" and offer parents a "choice." Among them is Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who has gone "all-in"  to stump for the pro-charter measure. According to education historian Diane Ravitch, the state is "ground zero of the charter fraud." Question 2 proponents, she wrote, are engaging in a "misleading, dishonest campaign" because "They do not explain that passage of Question 2 means that neighborhood public schools will be closed and replaced by corporate-controlled charter schools. They do not explain that more money for charter schools means less money for public schools. They do not explain that those who vote for Question 2 are voting to cut the budgets of their own public schools." Recognizing such threats, 30 mayors in the state have come out against it, including Worcester Mayor Joseph Petty, who said the $24.5 million his city will spend on charter schools "is money that could be used to hire more teachers, improve our facilities, and invest in our students." According to the latest count, over 200 school communities have come out against lifting the charter school cap. And support from this sector makes sense, wrote Ravitch, as "The school boards recognize that this would take money away from public schools and destroy public education in Massachusetts." In a blog post outlining why he'll be voting no on Question 2, Christopher Martell, a professor of Social Studies Education at Boston University, wrote, "If this ballot question passes, it would have a devastating impact on our local public school districts. It would continue to weaken traditional public schools, which serve 96 percent of the state's students. This ballot question will possibly lead to a two-tiered education system in Massachusetts, with the negative impacts exacerbated in our urban communities." Warning that so-called education reformers' success on the measure could spread to other states, Ravitch wrote: "What happens on November 8 will matter to the future of public education in America. " School Takeovers in Georgia Meanwhile, voters in Georgia will also vote Nov. 8 on a measure that could foster charter school expansion. Amendment 1 would allow the state to take over "chronically failing" schools. It would take away control from local boards of education and would allow the governor to appoint a superintendent who could then choose to turn them over to charter operators. It was modeled after the Recovery School District in Louisiana and the Achievement School District in Tennessee. WSAV calls it "the most talked about potential change to the Georgia state constitution this election year." An 11alive poll released Tuesday found the opposition ahead—54 percent to 29 percent. Sid Chapman, president of the Georgia Education Association, warned that if voters do choose to amend the state constitution, "Public schools as we know [them] could go away."

Unless you're talking about the cartoon versions with rainbow hair and colorful clothes, that is. Now that's the stuff of beauty dreams. Enter Hard Candy’s limited-edition Trolls collection. The product range — available today in Walmart stores — features a few items we’ve long coveted (like lip balms that change with your pH and rainbow highlighter), plus a few we didn’t know we needed until now, including marbleized lipstick and a full-spectrum palette of hair chalk. As if that weren't enough, each one of these goodies is housed in the cutest packaging, ever. (We’re already envisioning the hundreds of ways we can re-use the bokeh tins that come with metallic matte liquid lipsticks.) The icing on the cake? Each piece is either $6 or $8 — even less than it'd cost to go see the film that inspired the collection, so we’ll suffer zero guilt when splashing out on every last item.

If I miss anything, I apologize right now. I’d count five big deals going up in front of our eyes. 1. The six duplexes scattered in various locations around town; I hear they will be open soon. 2. Greenhaw Pharmacy has a very nice looking building going up at the entrance to town from Hillsboro Heights. I am looking forward to the drive-though feature. 3. MB Foundation has a new office building going up that will accomplish two things: take the place of an old eyesore, and provide MBF with a facility that fits its mission. 4. A new hospital, which has really taken shape in the past few weeks. I hope to never use it, but if any of us need a hospital it will be there for us. 5. Not the least of these is the new Tabor College fine arts center named after Shari Flaming. It is very impressive and will end up with a about a 50-foot wall at the back of the stage in the auditorium when it finished. I am told it is about halfway up at this point. • I should also mention that Dollar General has moved into the old Wal-Mart building, which closed about 9 months after it opened. I haven’t been there yet, but hear it is very nice inside with a much bigger selection than it previously had in its older, smaller building. • We went to Kansas City last week and came back by the new hospital on the new highway. (Notice I still call it the “new highway” even though it has been there for almost 30 years). I commented that they had really made progress since the morning when we first went by and was told that we didn’t go by it in the morning. Oh, well. • I am fearing I may be late to work next summer when the fine arts center wall blocks out the sun and our house will be shaded for most of the morning. Should save on cooling in the summer and when the sun shifts south in the winter it will help with the heating. • When they handed out the skill of keeping things organized, I must have been standing behind the door and missed out. Everywhere I look where I sit down to work I see piles and piles of things. Every so often I haul the stuff out and restack it, hoping to get a grip on it. It hasn’t worked yet and probably never will. They say you should scan all of your papers and then there is no need for the physical paperwork. If I did that, then I would have to be able to find it on the computer, which would basically boil down to the same problem. • I did put a sound bar on a shelf under the desk knee hole in our office at home; it diverts my attention from the stacks of papers. • If you wish to share your comments or ideas, my e-mail address is joel@ hillsborofreepress.com.   Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) NEW HAVEN, Conn. (WTNH) – It may seem too early to talk about holiday shopping, but in the retail world, it has officially begun. Whether you’re a fan of Christmas coming early or not, ’tis the season at least to save a lot of money!  Here is a look at some great deals you that may help you save money on just about anything over the next couple months. Target and Best Buy are both offering free shipping all season long, so you can save yourself some gas money by shopping online. Amazon has already rolled out Black Friday-like deals. There’s now a “Deal of the Day” section on their website. The company says they’ll roll out new discounts there–sometimes hourly–leading up to the holiday. You can save on everyday items like laundry detergent or things like winter coats and toys if you want to start checking items off your list. Money.com is reporting that in an effort to compete with Amazon, Walmart is staffing “holiday helpers” to specifically help you find gifts and make purchases easier. So with a little luck, things will at least become less stressful for you. Also, now is a great time to think about layaway, which is a great way to ease the financial burden this time of year can have. Money.com says Kmart and Toys R Us are offering special deals for people who take advantage of layaway and price matching. Last but not least, Consumer Reports has released a gift-giving guide to help with gift ideas. They’ll rate products to help you pick out what’s best for the people on your list–or at least the list you’ll eventually have.

(Journal file photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on November 02, 2016 at 2:43 PM, updated November 02, 2016 at 2:57 PM comments SECAUCUS – A Pennsylvania man wanted for burglary in Connecticut was captured in a New Jersey store, authorities said. Police in West Hartford, Connecticut notified Secaucus police on Oct. 25 that they had tracked Victor Padilla's cell phone to the Walmart on Park Plaza Drive, Secaucus Capt. Dennis Miller said. Details on the West Hartford burglary were not available. Secaucus police officers located the suspect's car, created a perimeter around the area, and proceeded into the store, Miller said. Padilla, of Sciota, Pennsylvania, was then arrested on charges of being a fugitive from justice and he was taken into custody, police said. "Our dispatchers, supervisors, detectives and officers all did a really good job that day," Miller said. "They effectively set up a perimeter and made an arrest within a busy shopping area with the thought and mind to limit the risk to the public."

'Publix-like' grocery one step closer near Exit 11 Pranaav Jadhav , pjadhav@theleafchronicle.com 3:17 p.m. CDT November 2, 2016 Buy Photo A new shopping center anchored by a large grocery store is coming soon near Vaughan Road, pending local government approvals. (Photo: Jimmy Settle / The Leaf-Chronicle)Buy Photo In Thursday's regular session, the Clarksville City Council is set to adopt the rezoning application on its second reading that would likely enable construction of a new grocery store near Exit 11. So far, no councilman has expressed any reservations about the application. Earlier in October, the council voted 12-0 to adopt the rezoning application of Cumberland family, Mike Young and Brookside Properties managed by developer David Crabtree. The rezoning application is to change the new grocery store area from O-1 office district and R-1 Single Family Residential District to C-5 Highway and Commercial District. Developer Fred Hohnadel, of Tampa, Fla., said the shopping center won't add another Walmart or other discount big-box retailer to Clarksville's already-large lineup. "I will tell you now, it is not a Walmart," he said in October. Although, Hohnadel did not rule out a large grocery store chain. But he said it's still early to reveal exactly who is likely coming, pending local government approvals. After Thursday's adoption on second reading, there is a possibility that an official announcement could be made. "I think the developers have done a wonderful job of being the kind of community partners by going out to the community and taking their thoughts into play," Clarksville Mayor Kim McMillan said during October's regular session.

(Mike Segar/Reuters) Amazon.com has found more ways to keep you from leaving your computer — bringing, say, your favorite artisanal coffee and neighborhood taco truck fare to you. The company’s grocery subsidiary, AmazonFresh, is beginning home-delivery of “nitro” coffee, whoopie pies, Nepalese dumplings and other foodie fodder sourced from local micro-kitchens, food trucks and farmers markets  to customers across a broad swath of the East Coast. The move allows mom-and-pop artisans to tap into AmazonFresh’s huge reach, placing their goods on doorsteps in hundreds of Zip codes up and down the mid-Atlantic within 24 hours of the order being placed. It means the tiny businesses — many of whom have sales of less than $25,000 a year — will be able to sell beyond the traditional farmers markets and brick-and-mortar storefronts. [If Amazon is really opening brick-and-mortar grocery stores, it’s a big deal] “This allows small cupcake companies and people who make Nepalese momos to deliver their products within around 24 hours from West Virginia to Delaware, which they could never do before,” said  Brenda C. Brown, the chief executive of Frontier Kitchen, a food business incubator in Lorton, Va., that is working with AmazonFresh. AmazonFresh’s Northern Virginia fulfillment center supports deliveries across West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. AmazonFresh declined to comment. The company already delivers grocery and prepared foods across the country from established businesses. [Watch out Wal-Mart. Amazon is coming after the grocery business] “These very small new companies view AmazonFresh as a distribution method that allows their products to more consistently reach customers and to expand their reach beyond farmer’s markets into homes across the mid-Atlantic they would never otherwise reach,” Brown said in an e-mail. “Many of these companies began with Amazon in mid-September and only six weeks into the program have seen sales that will be significant and impactful to their businesses.” Frontier Kitchen incubates very small/micro-companies in their earliest start-up phases. Most of these companies have been operating for less than a year and have annual revenue of less than $50,000. All of them are growing at a rapid pace. “AmazonFresh is beginning to act as an accelerator for their growth,” Brown said. Debra Moser, who runs three farmers markets in the Washington region and a small sausage and salami maker in Landover, Md., said AmazonFresh partnering with small businesses “is a good thing all the way around. It helps the farms and the artisan food producers. And for the people at the farmers markets, it’s another outlet for them.” Brown provided snapshots of some of the companies partnering with AmazonFresh: * Cascade Beverage Company, based in Lorton and in Mississippi, invented a technology for infusing nitrogen into beverages and developing a proprietary process for crafting smooth, rich cold-brew coffee at scale. * Guadalajara Grills, also in Lorton, was created by Rosa Vasquez, a native-born Mexican immigrant who, along with her daughters, began sharing their cuisine through festivals and private parties. The food is now sold from a food truck and AmazonFresh. * Loopy Scoops, based in Haymarket, Va., is the work of Loreann Grimes, a pastry chef and ice cream maker who started with a small cart in the Manassas farmers market in 2015. She now has three ice cream carts in two farmers markets and is beginning to supply ice cream, sorbets and popsicles for local restaurants and food trucks. * Ms. Jo’s Petite Sweets was founded February 2016 by Army veteran Erinn Roth as a tribute to her late mother. Jo’s Petite Sweets creates desserts from scratch, gourmet ice cream and Southern-inspired holiday dinner packages. * Himalayan Soul Foods truck, based in Lorton Va., began operations in July 2016, serving special Nepalese Momos (dumplings) throughout Washington. It was invented by Nepalese-born Sujit Shakya, who left his job at a nonprofit to launch his food truck. Amazon was founded Jeffrey P. Bezos, who is the chairman and chief executive of the company. Bezos also owns The Washington Post. AmazonFresh began its home delivery grocery service in 2007. It serves U.S. metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston and Dallas. It plans to roll out in the District, too. It also has a service in London. For more than a year, reports have circulated that Amazon.com wants to open grocery-centric brick-and-mortar locations, including outposts in Seattle and Sunnyvale, Calif. [How Walmart plans to transform the way we buy groceries] The new outlets would allow shoppers to drive up and retrieve grocery orders they place online. The buzz grew louder last month when the Wall Street Journal reported that many such locations are in the works. It said the locations would include walk-in stores where customers can buy perishables. business business true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

News 1 0 0 November 2, 2016 Orlando Shooter’s Wife: ‘I Am Very Sorry!’ Could She Have Stopped Killer Omar Mateen? Amanda Katherine The wife of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen admitted that she missed the warning signs before the brutal massacre at Pulse nightclub on June 11. Could Noor Salman have stopped Omar Mateen before he murdered 49 people? The #Orlando shooter Omar Mateen worked for global security firm G4S https://t.co/nfEOlzsYyh pic.twitter.com/lcJOmZ7bDS — CNN (@CNN) June 13, 2016 Noor Salman, the wife of shooter Omar Mateen, has finally broken her silence for an interview with the New York Times. Salman described the weeks and the months leading up to the shooting on June 11 at the Orlando night club saying that if anything, she thought he was on his best behavior. “I was unaware of everything.” However now, looking back, Salman confessed that she may have missed a few major red flags. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] The wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter admitted that she knew Mateen had been watching jihadist videos and that he was under investigation by the FBI. Noor Salman said that once the FBI “let him go,” she assumed there wasn’t anything to worry about. Shockingly, Salman was even with Omar Mateen when he purchased the ammunition at Walmart in the months before the shooting. The same ammunition that would eventually leave 49 innocent people dead in a nightclub. Omar’s wife insisted that she had thought her husband was buying the guns for his job as a security guard. Omar Mateen had been accepted into a police training program. Mateen and Salman’s marriage was in a good place; Omar was showering her with jewelry and he had stopped hitting her. He had even allowed her to visit her family in California and gave her money for the trip. Mateen’s wife described her husband as a man who angered easily, beat her often, and lived his life in secret. Noor Salman even recalled Omar Mateen taking them on a random trip to Orlando, but she did not know he was scouting locations for the brutal massacre. “I don’t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people.” Salman’s New York Times interview gave a new perspective on the horrifying Pulse night club shooting. Salman went into hiding after the massacre because a lot of people blamed her for not warning anyone. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Salman’s parents immigrated from the West Bank in 1985, which also made her an immediate person of interest to the FBI. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tN_x1HUaYPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED POSTS BY THE INQUISITR NOOR SALMAN: ONE MONTH AFTER ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING, WIFE OF OMAR MATEEN STILL OUT OF PUBLIC EYE Seddique Mateen, Father Of Orlando Nightclub Shooter, Omar Mateen, Explains Why He Attended Rally For Hillary Clinton In Florida FLORIDA MOSQUE OF PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTER OMAR MATEEN BURNS ON THREE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF MASSACRE AND IT WAS LIKELY ARSON [VIDEO] OMAR MATEEN SPOTTED AT PULSE NIGHTCLUB BEFORE, WAS A BIT OF A ‘REGULAR’ [REPORT] Several #PulseNightclub regulars say they saw shooter Omar Mateen there multiple times https://t.co/s6wpe6iGAo pic.twitter.com/rsfOeN33c3 — Orlando Sentinel (@orlandosentinel) June 13, 2016 On the night of June 11, 2016, Omar Mateen told Salman that he would not be home for dinner, kissed her and hugged their 3-year old son before he left. Mateen never returned. Instead, he drove the two hours from the family’s home in Fort Pierce to Orlando. He entered Pulse nightclub, killed 49 people, and wounded many more. Police arrived on scene and fatally shot Mateen. Salman was at home with their son while Mateen was off committing one of the worst terrorist attacks in the United States since 2001. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Since the Orlando shooting, Salman has been left shattered and afraid. She often cannot get herself out of bed and relies on family members to take care of her son. “I just want people to know that I am human. I am a mother.” Noor Salman has had to move three times since the attack to avoid the media. She is living in legal limbo, awaiting potential charges including lying to the FBI.

Ty Wright — Bloomberg What's in your jeans? A rogue's gallery of unpronounceable chemicals whose effects on humans are suspect. Perfluorochemicals, phthalates and azo dyes are among the substances that are widespread in making clothes. Under pressure from consumers demanding safer alternatives to harmful chemicals, American companies including Levi Strauss & Co. are taking a more European approach. The European Union has banned or restricted more than 1,000 chemicals; in the U.S., fewer than 50. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. Suppliers are often reluctant to share their formulations, buyers balk at higher costs, and in some cases cost-effective safer substitutes simply aren't available. Levi's has prohibited certain chemicals since 2000, but this is different. The jeans maker and other companies are asking suppliers to use materials generated from bacteria, fungus, yeast and methane gas to replace the petroleum-based substances that make up more than 95 percent of U.S. products' inventory of chemicals. There are plenty of incentives to change. A Pike Research report estimates that the global market for green chemistry will increase to almost $100 billion by 2020, from $11 billion last year. Millennials are overwhelmingly interested in sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. And innovating can give companies a competitive advantage, said Monica Becker, co-director of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council, which works with companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.     ▲ The Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry's lab. The Warner Babcock Institute Companies can make false promises that a product is consistent with green-chemistry practices, Becker said, but guarding against that are assessment methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency's Safer Choice program. Rules can also confound the efforts of U.S. companies. To approve chemicals and processes, the European Union uses a so-called hazard-based approach that the Chinese government is also considering. Manufacturers need to prove their products meet safety standards before they bring them to market. The U.S. method is risk-based. It involves weighing metrics, such as quantity and duration of exposure, to assess the danger in an existing product -- if data exist.     ▲ A worker unloads jeans from a fabric dyeing machine at a factory in the Mundargi Industrial Area of Ballari, Karnataka, India, on May 16, 2016. (MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Dhiraj Singh) Proponents of a hazard-based approach argue that exposure to even tiny amounts of some chemicals correlate with learning disabilities, asthma, allergies and cancer. "Shouldn't it be that chemicals are guilty until research proves them innocent?" said Amy Ziff, founder and executive director of Made Safe, a new hazard-based certification program. Levi's said its goal is to use only chemicals that pass hazard-based screens by 2020. Even as some suppliers push back, "we wouldn't give up on hazard-based," said Bart Sights, Levi's director of global development. Levi's already uses some green methods to make its signature blue jeans. To give them a worn look, Levi's uses an enzyme derived from fungus and tumbles the jeans in ozone gas instead of bleach -- a process that Sights estimated has had the added benefit of saving the company a billion gallons of water in the past three years. "Some companies are spending the same amount on environmental compliance as they are on research and development," said John Warner, president and chief technology officer of Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, who created the first green-chemistry Ph.D. program in the U.S., at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Companies can be roiled by the use of non-green chemicals. Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. was beset by lawsuits last year after a "60 Minutes" investigation said it used unsafe levels of formaldehyde. Shares plunged before a government probe ended without a product recall. The company no longer sells the flooring. Such problems have investors taking notice, said Mark Rossi, whose company, Clean Production Action, created the Chemical Footprint, modeled on the carbon footprint, that investors can use to measure risk and costs. It also developed and licenses a chemical-screening method used by Levi's and others. Rossi has signed on firms including BNP Paribas, Calvert Investments and Trillium Asset Management, while companies like Johnson & Johnson and Clorox Co. participated in the first survey to assess their footprint. Gojo Industries Inc., maker of Purell hand sanitizer, has pledged to cut its chemical footprint in half by 2020. In the five years since it launched a campaign to spur clothing makers and sellers to get rid of toxic substances, Greenpeace International has signed on 78 brands, said Kirsten Brodde, head of the organization's Detox My Fashion campaign.     ▲ Workers make jeans in Parras, Mexico, on Sept. 25, 2014. Bloomberg photo by Susana Gonzalez At the Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, across the Bay Bridge from Levi's San Francisco headquarters, students have worked with the jeans maker and companies such as outfitter Patagonia Inc., office-furniture maker Steelcase Inc. and Mango Materials Inc., which manufactures plastics out of methane gas, to develop safer materials, including a non-toxic resin for Autodesk's 3D printers. But an overnight change for the greener just isn't possible. "When it comes to materials, we're at the very initial step, which is figuring out what the heck is actually in our products," said Marty Mulvihill, a founder of the Berkeley Center and its former executive director. "A lot of companies are just completing that first step." A comprehensive replacement for formaldehyde, for example, hasn't been developed, Mulvihill said. Mulvihill is now a partner at Safer Made, a new venture-capital firm he co-founded that's seeking investments in companies that use green chemistry. It's looked at more than 100 companies, with plans to invest in 10 to 15 firms in the next five years, he said. Patagonia has also invested in green chemical companies. A Levi's supplier, Beyond Surface Technologies, is one of a dozen the Ventura, California-based clothing maker has seeded out of 1,400 prospects it's looked at since 2013. "Ultimately, some of these companies that we fund could be able to help us clean up our own supply chain," said Phil Graves, Patagonia's director of corporate development. There are 20 environmentally friendly chemicals available for the company's textile finishes, compared with 200 to 300 that contain non-green chemicals, said Matthias Foessel, Beyond Surface's founder and chief executive officer. Developing safer alternatives can take years, while acceptable green substitutes for some substances used in waterproofing and stain protectants, such as perfluorocarbons, don't exist, Foessel said. New chemicals often behave differently than expected. Beyond Surface had been trying to create a water repellent when it developed a fabric that absorbs sweat instead. Still, Foessel's eight-year-old firm, based near Basel, Switzerland, now has more than 100 customers, including Adidas AG. "Ten years ago, people wouldn't have even talked to us," Foessel said. "People accepted that you had to use chemicals that pose a risk."     ▲ Blue jeans for sale at the Times Square Aeropostale location in New York on March 7, 2012.

By Sam Cinquegrani on November 2, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk E-commerce retailers can benefit from better SEO. Shutterstock / ne3p Companies know they need to regularly examine the wide range of distinct areas that form the larger e-commerce experience — from considerations like search engine optimization to how easily customers can make purchases — if they want to maintain relevance in the market and grow. Without taking a critical eye to e-commerce operations and seeking out strategies and tools for improvement, online merchants risk driving away users — or even worse, not attracting them in the first place. Some of the most important aspects of e-commerce are search engine optimization, user experience, micro-analytics and digital merchandising. Consider the following advice for three easy fixes as you review the e-commerce functions of your organization and seek out areas to improve. Micro-analytics and Digital Merchandising While SEO and site performance are commonly recognized, if not necessarily acted upon, by businesses, micro-analytics are less widely understood. That’s partially because it’s such a new strategy. Micro-analytics offers a number of advantages on the leading edge of e-commerce, such as enabling micro-segmentation. This powerful, focused targeting and gathering of information about small demographic groups and individuals leads to more effective merchandising, connecting shoppers with relevant products in a way that can be emulated at broader levels. Despite the newness of this strategy in e-commerce, it’s easy to see the roots of micro-analytics and digital merchandising in something as mundane as a visit to the supermarket. There’s a reason ketchup and mayonnaise are stocked next to each other, for example, and there are plenty of other considerations that make for optimum positioning in a physical space. While spatial limitations don’t exist in the same context online, that type of strategy definitely has an important place in e-commerce sites. Analytics can tell merchants where customers look on each page, and provide valuable information about which products sell most frequently with others. Eventually, the standard for e-commerce will be fully customized pages for individual shoppers based on their preferences — an approach that takes full advantage of micro-analytics and digital merchandising. Such an approach will significantly reduce the time necessary to complete a purchase and tap into customers’ love of quick and convenient interactions. While the ultimate result of this trend is still in the future, businesses can start harnessing the power of analytics and merchandising today to provide a more individualized and effective shopping experience. Performance Tuning There’s a well-known finding from Amazon showing that a delay of just 100 milliseconds costs 1 percent of total sales. For any company, that’s a major — and almost completely avoidable — negative, one that stops a business from reaching its potential. For a major retailer like Wal-Mart or Target, that 1 percent loss means tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in a single day for no reason except a slow-loading web site. There are innumerable situations across the world of business where speed is a major factor for success. In stock trading, the first organization to respond to an order is the one that gets paid. Similar circumstances and examples exist in realms ranging from supply chain and shipping to food service. In terms of e-commerce, customers place a high degree of value on product pages and payment processes that quickly load. But too many companies don’t realize the importance of speedy transactions, which are vital to a positive user experience. That’s despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. The speed with which a company can present its web site is just as important as the design and layout of the page and the accessibility of product information. Load times also have a substantial impact on SEO. A slow page encourages visitors to leave, harming SEO metrics by increasing bounce rate and reducing time spent on page. Customers are used to fast load times and multitasking on their computers and devices, so a page that loads slowly will send them packing quickly. That trend is exacerbated by the widespread use of mobile devices. With performance specs worse than those of full-sized computers and less reliable data connections to boot, mobile needs to be a consideration during site development. If businesses can’t prioritize mobile to the necessary extent and provide a top-notch experience, they’re better off creating a basic mobile site than trying to push the issue with mediocre results. Search Engine Optimization Maintaining relevance may be the largest challenge in terms of search engine optimization. Because Google wants relevancy to matter most in search results seen by its users, the company regularly changes aspects of its search algorithm in ways that don’t pay much consideration to current SEO strategies and tactics. Google makes a number of determinations that are based on evidence, like load times and readability, but the company also makes some arbitrary choices, and cloaks the entire process in secrecy. With a focus on the holistic user experience instead of specific elements of use and a proprietary, closely guarded method for making these changes, SEO is simultaneously well understood on a general level and harder to contend with when it comes to specifics. That’s especially true around the time of an update from Google, particularly a major one. Paired with the competition businesses face in the marketplace, SEO can seem like an especially difficult challenge when it comes time to move past generalities and make distinct decisions. While this realization can drive companies to consider options like search engine marketing — paying for clicks — over the long-term, the reality is that regular optimization is a more cost-effective and worthwhile approach, as long as the right long-term strategy is used. It’s vital that SEO is considered early and often, and placed on the same level as other important e-commerce considerations. It’s an all-too-common error to leave strategy and implementation by the wayside when developing or revamping an e-commerce site. SEO success can often hinge on the approach taken by a business and the experts it works with. Trial-and-error efforts are frequently seen, but are far less preferable than situations where businesses, or their advisors, know how to use available SEO platforms and tools to craft meaningful strategy. To make SEO spending efficient, there needs to be a level of understanding much higher than throwing basic strategies at the wall and seeing what sticks. With these three tune-ups successfully under your belt, it should be possible to realize a measurable benefit in your online performance. Your customers will thank you by staying on your site longer, and coming back for more.

First up, for our Canadian friends up north, we bring to you news that Liokaiser is available at Walmart.ca for $149.97. The listing can be found HERE. Up next, we have a reminder that Robot Kingdom has an order open for Liokaiser, as previously reported. Robot Kingdom lists Liokaiser for $109.90 and currently has him in-stock. We also remind you of the Entertainment Earth catalog that shows that Liokaiser will be available from there for $129.99, which should qualify for the free shipping option Entertainment Earth offers. Finally, Ebay has several listings up for Liokaiser, the cheapest of which have him averaging around $115 including shipping. We do ask that you be careful with these Ebay sellers though. Make sure to check their approval ratings before you commit to buy. We will continue to keep you updated on any Liokaiser listings that make their way to us, so until then, stay tuned!

Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838500) Posted by YoungPrime on November 2nd, 2016 @ 12:09pm CDT Tempted by the 109.90 at Robot Kingdom but I'm still hoping that Takara makes a better more accurate one next year. That and I still don't like that "Deathsaurus" substitute (no bot mode anyway). So if Takara also makes an MP version that'll really render this Skylynx remold even more useless IMO. So yeah, I'll pass. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838504) Posted by o.supreme on November 2nd, 2016 @ 12:11pm CDT RK has a good purchase price, but add on shipping it gets outrageous, and will bring it closer to $150 to ship to US. The best prices for LioKaiser are still on eBay, but as others have stated, caution should be taken. I've never had a problem, but I know others have. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838511) Posted by Relic0037 on November 2nd, 2016 @ 12:37pm CDT I still don't see a listing for it on Entertainment Earth's website yet. eBay is a bit sketchy, & the shipping charge at Robot Kingdom is a bit steep, so I guess I'll wait and see at this point.

Entertainment Earth is only for their catalogue at the moment. You have to call their 800 number and place the order. I feel you I'm always worried about eBay sometimes but make sure to look at their past 6-12 months of history and feedback. If it's all positive or 99% positive you're fine especially if it's a store's eBay account. Online store a take their rep very serious.

Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838833) Posted by nycPrime on November 3rd, 2016 @ 2:19pm CDT $50 for the Insecticons Platinum set on Amazon. Good deal? Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838835) Posted by william-james88 on November 3rd, 2016 @ 2:21pm CDT nycPrime wrote:$50 for the Insecticons Platinum set on Amazon. Good deal? Thats what I bought it for. I think its a good deal, less than 20$ a piece for the insecticons. They go for about 20$ second hand complete on e-bay and here you are getting them minty fresh (with exclusive energon cubes made for their cockpits) so yes its a good deal. They look like little jewels. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838853) Posted by o.supreme on November 3rd, 2016 @ 2:50pm CDT nycPrime wrote:$50 for the Insecticons Platinum set on Amazon. Good deal? back in April when my local K-Mart was closing, they had at least a dozen of these starting at $80, then every couple weeks the toy section would go down an additional 10%. Finally just before the store closed, a close friend bought the last 6 sets they had at 60% off ($31.99 each), but at the time I was seeing them all over eBay in the 30-40 dollar range and nobody was buying them. Of course I'm not a big fan of the Insecticons, but if I were still collecting I probably would have picked up the more compact release from TRU a few years back. I had every TRU re-release starting with the first assortment in 2004 (Prime, Magnus, and Hot Rod) all the way up until I think Astrotrain somewhere around 2006. I loved those toys, but I think the realization that they would never re-relese the original Megatron (aside form the Takara re-release), plus the fact that I was selling off my collection lead me to stop collecting that series.

Emerje I know right? at first I thought it was a mistake because in my mind "Platinum" was somehow associated with "on-line only" as I had never seen one at retail. Of course *someone* here likes to flaunt their pics of Canadian stores that sell them as if its no bid deal. Of course the one Platinum I do want (LioKaiser) truly is an online exclusive as far as I know, thankfully it doesn't appear to be to difficult to acquire. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838939) Posted by RAR on November 3rd, 2016 @ 9:01pm CDT Has anyone got any side-by-side pics of the Insecticons with the 1980's originals - as they sometimes show up cheap I wanted to see if there was a reason to buy some more or not. Or if perhaps I should buy some more older ones. I'd certainly buy some more if they had some colour differences like different colour plastic. ------- I'm still a little miffed that Blaster/Perceptor were the same colour as before as I considered that a missed opportunity to make a blue accented Perceptor instead of teal. or to at least re-issue Blaster with a different leg or different shade or finish to his red parts. Considering how cheap and easy it is to get collectors edition Blaster I would have preferred a Platinum version to show some distinction. Heck I like that idea in general - say G1 Tracks reissued with metallic blue paint / plastic for example and a tampographed hood sticker and chromed weapons.

There are no side by side pics, but from what I have heard in reviews, the colours are very close to the originals.

Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838973) Posted by Bronzewolf on November 3rd, 2016 @ 11:08pm CDT Seibertronians, today we have some additional images of not only one of the most anticipated Combiners of the year, but one of the most anticipated figures of the year, Liokaiser! Thanks to Seibertronian TF-fan Kev777, we have up-close-and-personal looks at all of the figures included in this set, minicons and all. Check out the photos and tell us in the comments below: do these additional pictures change your mind on this classic Combiner team, now that it's starting to become more and more available? Is the price Tag for the set too high? Are there any design changes you would have made to maybe make the set more accurate? Please let us know!

Is he really that anticipated? Seems like the people who actually like him (I'm one of them) are in the minority. Or maybe it's the complainers that are in the vocal minority? Seems like more people like the idea of the set (without Dezarus) than actually like it.

The original Liokaiser is hard to find 3.) One if his components, Killbison, suffers from Gold Plastic Syndrome So yes, he is anticipated. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838979) Posted by Noideaforaname on November 4th, 2016 @ 12:23am CDT I dunno. Victorion, Technobots, hell Scrounge, were highly anticipated (not to mention figures like MP Shockwave or Primal). With Liokaiser, everyone's just waiting for the replacement already. That's not really impressive. Re: Combiner Wars Liokaiser Box Set Sale Roundup (1838980) Posted by Emerje on November 4th, 2016 @ 12:32am CDT JelZe GoldRabbit wrote:1.)

It's hardly an ideal interpretation lacking two key members (including the team leader!) and replaced by someone that wasn't part of the original team 2.) It's still a very obscure character for any casual fan, unlike the bulk of the CW teams making it a difficult sell. 3.) Hasbro CW figures aren't exactly substitutes for Japanese G1 figures. Compared to the likes of the Technobots, Combaticons, and Sky Reign, to say nothing of the UW stuff coming out of Japan or the Titans Return, Legends, and Masterpiece stuff he seems a little low on the 2016 "OMG I NEED THAT!" list. Especially when so many people seem to be hoping for a sale before they buy it. Emerje Click here to view additional comments about this topic at the Energon Pub Forums ...

The retailer, which is owned by US giant Walmart, is set to slash the price of scores of children's favourites. The flash sale will begin on Thursday, November 3, and run into December. Parents can take advantage of great deals, discounts and offers from the supermarket chain, which operates multiple stores in Coventry. Asda stores in Coventry can be found in Brade Drive, Daventry Road, Jubilee Crescent and Abbey Park. For more information on your nearest store, go to the Asda website and use the store finder.

Lisa Richlich filed a federal lawsuit against Spectrum Health Systems after a neurosurgeon's office provided her employer with information that she "uses illicit drugs (marijuana) about five times per week." Richlich said she had been prescribed medical marijuana by her regular doctor for chronic pain, but rarely used it. She tested negative for marijuana but was "encouraged and pressured" by Gentex officials to resign and accept a severance package, her attorney wrote in court documents. The lawsuit was filed last week in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids. Medical marijuana law no protection for fired Battle Creek Walmart worker, appeals court says Spectrum Health has not yet responded to the lawsuit in court. In a statement to The Grand Rapids Press and MLive, it said: "Patient privacy and confidentiality is of paramount importance to Spectrum Health. However it is not our practice to comment on active litigation cases." Richlich, who now lives in Wisconsin, said she worked for Gentex in Zeeland from June 23, 2003, to April 15, 2015. She was working as a purchasing specialist with satisfactory evaluations, the lawsuit said. She was granted leave under the Family Medical Leave Act from March 3, 2015, to April 15, 2015, for neck surgery, subject to Dr. Todd Vitaz completing a required medical certification, the lawsuit said. His office was asked several times to do so before it was provided March 18. The certification included "progress notes" with Richlich's medical history, her attorney, Rhett Pinsky, wrote in the lawsuit. "Plaintiff's medical history disclosed that she 'uses illicit drugs (marijuana) about five times per week.' In fact, Plaintiff's physician Dr. Patricia Persenaire, on or about June 24, 2014, prescribed medical marijuana for her chronic pain but she rarely used it," Pinsky wrote. It was unnecessary to provide Richlich's medical history for Family and Medical Leave certification and it violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the lawsuit said. Richlich underwent surgery March 3, 2015. She said she requested on "several occasions" that Vitaz's office correct the medical history to indicate she used medical marijuana only rarely, and to advise Gentex. It was not corrected, the lawsuit said. Gentex contacted her about two weeks after her surgery and said she was in violation of its "Substance Abuse Policy for Employees." At the company's request, she took a drug test. It was negative, the lawsuit said. On April 1, 2015, she was offered a severance to resign, or be subject to Gentex's substance-abuse policy, the lawsuit said. She believed she would be unfairly subjected to drug treatment, including counseling, random testing and a last-chance agreement, with a likelihood of being terminated without any severance, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit contends that Spectrum was negligent in disclosing Richlich's medical history and failing to correct it. It also claims that the release of her medical history invaded her privacy and placed her in a false light to her employer. The lawsuit also claims intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Her attorney declined to comment on the lawsuit. A Gentex spokesman also declined to comment.

The three-disc collection, out November 18th exclusively at Walmart, will feature two new songs: "Kicked Outta Country," which Strait co-wrote with Jamey Johnson, and "You Gotta Go Through Hell," which the entertainer penned with his son Bubba Strait and his longtime go-to tunesmith Dean Dillon. Johnson, with Bill Anderson and Buddy Cannon, previously co-wrote "Give It Away," Strait's 2007 ACM Single of the Year and CMA Song of the Year, which is among the tracks on Strait Out of the Box: Part 2. Related George Strait Honors Haggard at Triumphant Vegas Show After two years of "touring retirement," the King of Country returns to the stage Covering the most recent two decades of Strait's impressive run, the 56-track collection boasts 36 of the country legend's singles, including 26 Number Ones, all personally selected by the singer himself. The 1995 predecessor, Strait Out of the Box, has sold more than two million copies to date and – because it contains four discs – is certified eight-times platinum, making it one of the top-selling box sets of all time. "Going back through all the songs for this box set does bring back a lot of old memories,” says the Texas native, who debuted in 1981 with "Unwound," a Top Ten hit co-written by Dean Dillon and Frank Dycus. "A lot of them we considered for radio singles and for whatever reason, we just picked something else. It was not that hard to pick them after I looked through them because there are just so many that are my favorites." Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 is now available for pre-order along with select merchandise, including a silver-plated belt buckle identical to the one featured on the collection’s cover. A 23-time CMA award winner, with 89 total nominations, Strait will perform on Wednesday night's 50th Annual CMA Awards telecast, airing live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena, November 2nd at 8 p.m. ET.

By Lorie Palmer As of Tuesday, November 1, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter GRANGEVILLE  Micah and Sarah Musick left the hustle and bustle of the Pacific Northwest two years ago for greener pastures. “We’d been visiting my parents and family [Fred and Renee Stevens] for about 10 years and we fell in love with Grangeville,” Sarah said. Now, the two have opened Virtual Fox Technology at 111 S. Mill Street, next to Presnell Gage and across from Pine Tree Community Credit Union. Micah recently completed his bachelor degree in IT security. He also holds a variety of professional certifications for various training he has completed in the computer technology field. Micah and Sarah met as young children in the Puyallup, Wash., area and grew up together, attending the same youth group. They began getting to know each other better in their teens and later began dating. Micah had the opportunity to work for Youth With A Mission in Hawaii for two years where he was in charge of the organization’s computer system. He also worked at an IT internship and for WalMart in the electronics department. “I got a lot of experience on various computer problems and issues,” he said. He worked for Circuit City and then as a consultant for both a small and a large company in Tacoma. “When we moved here two years ago, I continued to work remotely for the company out of Tacoma, then about a year ago ventured out on my own,” he said. For the past year his workshop has been at the Musick’s home just outside of Grangeville. “It was finally time to put a little separation between home and work,” Micah smiled, with Sarah agreeing. The office space on Mill Street allows for a workshop space, open office, private office and lunch/family room. “We are really excited about being able to be right here at this location – it’s perfect,” Sarah said. Micah will offer all computer repair, security and virus removal and will also work on phones, tablets and gaming systems. He is also available to work with local individuals, businesses and organizations on their security and maintenance issues, including hard and software. “I know not everyone can afford to have a tech person on-site, so I want to be able to offer those services to people who need the help,” he said. The Musicks have a daughter, 7, and a son, 4, and said they are happy to be raising their family in Grangeville. Sarah recently started as a teller for U.S. Bank. At Virtual Fox Technology, Yumi Taylor will be assisting with repairs and service. “Customer service is paramount and we’re really looking forward to meeting our clientele,” Micah said. “Stop by and see us or give us a call. We want to problem solve any way we can.” Call VFoxTech, Computer and Network Services, at 398-3369; e-mail vfoxtech@gmail.com; Facebook.com/VFoxTech; www.foxtech.com.

Retail BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. Kroger has a game-changing new grocery service, and moms are freaking out about it Hayley Peterson Nov. 2, 2016, 9:00 AM 42,049 facebook linkedin twitter email print I'm a huge fan of Kroger's ClickList.Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I just got a glimpse into the future of food shopping, and my life will never be the same again. Earlier this week I tried Kroger's ClickList, which lets you order groceries online and then pick them up at a store where employees load everything into your car. The service — known in the industry as click-and-collect — has been popular for years in the UK, but it has just started taking off in the US. Kroger started testing ClickList two years ago, and it recently started rolling out the service nationwide. ClickList is currently available at more than 500 stores, the company told Business Insider. Other companies offering grocery pickup include Walmart, Harris Teeter, and soon Amazon. Many customers have been praising the service, with parents in particular calling it a game changer. Articles and reviews of ClickList are popping up all over parenting and mom blogs. "A few months ago I started to see my Facebook feed fill up with busy moms talking about how their life had been changed. Maybe you've heard of a little thing called Kroger ClickList?" one health blogger wrote in January. "I jumped on the bandwagon and tried it. And they are right. It is a game-changer!" Customers with young children are highlighting the fact that they don't have to leave their cars to get their groceries. "I used Kroger ClickList for the second time today," Melodie Shrontz wrote on Kroger's Facebook page. "Huge timesaver for the working mom, and no more dragging fighting kids through the grocery store." Audra Logan wrote, "Dear Kroger ClickList... You have changed my life. I don't know if I'll ever go in a grocery store again. Ok maybe that's exaggerating but with twins and 20-degree weather, having groceries brought to my car was awesome!!!" I tried ClickList at a Kroger in Richmond, Virginia. Here's what it was like. View As: One Page Slides The ordering process was so simple. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The site used my Kroger rewards number to populate the items I purchase most often. That made it really easy to start building my shopping list.  For other items, I used the search bar and found exactly what I was looking for in a matter of seconds. This saved me at least 20 minutes of criss-crossing the sprawling store in search of random ingredients.  And it was so easy to compare prices.  Gone are the days of wandering around the condiments aisle trying to pinpoint the cheapest ketchup or mustard brands in a sea of dozens of choices.    Once I placed my order, I selected a one-hour time slot to pick it up on the following day. Pickup times for this location run from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and every time slot was available. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson When I arrived at the store, I noticed that eight parking spaces near the store's entrance had been turned into a ClickList pickup area. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I parked in one of the ClickList spots and next to my window, I saw a sign instructing me to call a phone number to notify the store that I had arrived. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I called the number and an employee answered the phone on the first ring. He asked for my name and told me he would deliver my groceries in a few minutes. Five minutes later, an employee walked up to my car window and introduced himself as Morgan. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Out of my order of 24 items, the store didn't have two items in stock in the brands that I had selected, he said. So he substituted those products with comparable brands that were the same price. He showed me the items he had substituted to make sure I approved of his selections.  He swiped my credit card using a tablet and gave me a receipt for my order. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Then he started loading my car with grocery bags. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Once he finished, I decided to run into the store to grab some flowers.  This is a huge advantage of ClickList over grocery delivery services that I have used in the past. With click-and-collect, you can still enjoy the benefits of a brick-and-mortar store without having to spend an hour wandering the aisles inside. So if you like to pick out your own produce, for example, or if you realize you forgot something on your list, you can make a quick trip into the store to grab those items since you are already on site to pick up your online order. Within 10 minutes of my arrival, I had a trunk full of groceries that will last me more than a week. Normally, this shopping trip would have taken me about an hour. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson ClickList was ridiculously easy and seamless, and now I can't imagine buying groceries any other way. Of course, this kind of convenience doesn't come without a price. ClickList costs $4.95 per order. For your first three orders, the service is free.

By  Leada Gore | lgore@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on November 02, 2016 at 6:01 AM, updated November 02, 2016 at 9:19 AM Print Email Who makes more money in Alabama - doctors, dentists or lawyers? (file photo)  Look at almost any list of jobs that offer high salaries and you'll see entries for doctors, dentists and attorneys. But have you ever wondered which of those careers pays the most? Zippia, a career website, recently looked at each state's average salaries for dentists, physicians and attorneys. The data used comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is adjusted to reflect the cost of living in each state since the person's salary would go further in Alabama than it would in California. Here's how the salaries broke down in Alabama: Average dentist salary: $192,524 Average physician's salary: $218,969 Average attorney's salary: $126,412 When compared to other states and adjusted for cost of living, the average salary for dentist salaries was 13th highest in the country; Alabama physicians came in ninth highest; and attorney salaries 12th highest. In case you're curious, the states with the highest salaries for each job when adjusted for cost of living were: dentist, North Dakota, $231,107; physician, Mississippi, $244,402: and attorneys, Texas, $150,313. Welcome to Wednesday's Wake Up Call. Here's what's going on: Big Foot nabs campaign sign? A Tennessee congressional candidate is having some fun with his opponent's complaints about disappearing signs. Candidate Steven Reynolds released a video saying they were "finally able to catch the thief in the act." The video then cuts away to an image of Big Foot stealing his opponent's sign. Reynolds, a Democrat, is running against incumbent Scott Desjarlais, a Republican, for the fourth Congressional seat. Bono among women of the year Glamour magazine has selected a man as one of its Women of the Year. Bono, the lead singer of U2, was named to the list alongside Simone Biles, Ashley Graham, Christine Lagarde, Nadia Murad, Gwen Stefani, Miuccia Prada, Zendaya, and the three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Glamour explained its choice by saying Bono earned the honor for his work with the charity One which recently launched a campaign called "Poverty is Sexist" to help imp Walmart pulls controversial photobook from website Walmart has pulled a controversial book from its website. The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were mentioned in a letter sent to the retailer from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization. The group has launched a petition to have the books – which include nude photos of adolescents – as well as some magazines removed from Walmart stores and website. Walmart said it reviewed the complaint and found the books were in violation of its policies and were therefore removed. Amazon to open 2,000 grocery stores Amazon plans to open as many as 2,000 grocery stores in the next 10 years.

The stores will consist of two types: the first will act as a drive-through for online orders and the second will be a traditional grocery store. Amazon's pilot grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, is currently offered in Seattle. Until tomorrow.

(MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS) Amazon boxes are stacked for delivery in New York City. (MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS) STOCKS Want to buy Amazon and eBay? Do your stock shopping carefully Add to ... DAVID ISRAELSON Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Nov. 02, 2016 5:00AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Nov. 02, 2016 10:39AM EDT Comments AA More Canadians are using e-commerce to shop and do their banking, but investing in the e-commerce sector is still a mystery to many. First, it can be hard to figure out what an e-commerce company is. There’s not necessarily a consensus among advisers and analysts. Amazon.com Inc. or Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. are obvious candidates. Each was created and developed as an online marketplace. But Amazon also offers cloud computing services, makes consumer electronics and streams original television programming.   Yield Hog P&G: A dividend growth powerhouse Unused shopping carts are lined up at the Carrefour hypermarket in Rosny sous Bois, east of Paris, April 30, 2013. French households bought less furniture, cars and clothes in the first quarter of the year, sparking fears of recession. Reuters Economy Video: Spain shows resilience, France not on target   Video Video: Market Call Tonight: Top Picks from Avenue's Paul Harris As well, big retailers now incorporate e-commerce as a large component of their business. In August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s big-box behemoth, announced it was buying Jet.com, a one-year-old online bulk retailer, for $3-billion (U.S.) to build its online retail strategy. “Most public companies already incorporate e-commerce into their existing business models,” says George Christison, an investment planner and founder of IFM Planning Services and investingforme.com, based in Lantzville, B.C. E-commerce is growing more slowly in Canada than in the United States, but the pace is still brisk, says Larbi Moumni, equity specialist at Raymond James Ltd. in Toronto. According to Forrester Research Inc., a consumer analytics and advisory firm, Canadian e-commerce is anticipated to reach $39.9-billion by 2019, representing 9.5 per cent of total retail transactions, Mr. Moumni says. Perhaps conservatively, Morgan Stanley has predicted that the U.S. e-commerce domestic market will be worth $119-billion by 2020. Growth in Canada will be facilitated by a number of factors, Mr. Moumni says. “They include a maturing assortment of U.S. and international brands operating tailored online stores for Canadians, and the launch of all-new or revamped online stores from incumbent Canadian retailers.” Venture capital funds have been eager to invest in e-commerce. Five of the world’s top VC investors in e-commerce are based in the United States (Tiger Global Management LLC and Morgan Stanley in New York, and Iconiq Capital, Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital in California), while five come from Russia, South Africa and other countries, according to PitchBook Inc., a private equity, M&A and venture capital database. In some places, the VCs may be too eager. On the Indian investor website yourstory.com, writer Anurag Avula observed that in 2015, investors put $7.4-billion (U.S.) into e-commerce startups in India alone, a 57-per-cent increase over the previous year. While it’s true that in India e-commerce has grown 60 per cent year over year, “people seem to have ignored unit economics” and they may pay a price for their “exuberance,” says Mr. Avula, who is also a co-founder of Shopmatic, a Singapore-based service platform for e-commerce companies. In addition to buying shares of e-commerce firms, Canadians can invest in more indirect ways, says Jason Castelli, vice-president and portfolio manager at Raymond James Ltd. in Toronto. For example, he cites Pure Industrial Real Estate Trust, a Canada-based industrial REIT that invests in properties in Canada and the United States. “As e-commerce grows, we anticipate warehouse and distribution capabilities near major urban centres to experience steady demand,” he says. “This will benefit companies that own warehouses.” For investors who are not experts in e-commerce, one way to distinguish serious players from the also-rans is to look at how particular companies are run, says Gabriel Dubois, financial security adviser and president of Advanced Financial Systems Group Inc. in St. Catharines, Ont. “Amazon [founder and CEO] Jeff Bezos has transformed the e-commerce landscape and is continuing to do so. Success is more a function of the leadership that drives the business model. Amazon, in particular, will continue to evolve and transform itself. Traditional players are looking over their shoulders,” he says. In addition to Amazon and Alibaba, Mr. Moumni is taking notice of other e-commerce players such as Etsy Inc., eBay Inc. and Shopify Inc. “Although all of these are pure-play e-commerce companies, they focus on different segments,” he says. “Amazon is an online store with cloud computing services and their own shelf space, and eBay is an online marketplace that simply brings buyers and sellers of all kinds of products together,” he says. “Etsy is similar to eBay but focused on arts and crafts, and Shopify is a cloud-based platform that helps customers set up their e-commerce websites.” Investors can also see differences in growth patterns for e-commerce companies around the world, Mr. Avula says. The average Indian online shopper uses e-commerce portals primarily for research and not to purchase high-ticket items, he says. “Consumers from more developed economies have a higher tendency to buy products of high-value categories online,” he says. Also, “an online shopper in the U.S. makes an average of six times more online transactions than an Indian shopper.” Mr. Christison says, “If I were looking to invest in a pure e-commerce company, I would start with a top-down approach.” “Start by reading industry journals and reports to see what the industry itself is focused upon and talking about. Determine what statistics or metrics the industry uses to assess or judge an e-commerce company. Look at where Wall Street and Bay Street are throwing their money. “Then I’d wait six to nine months,” he says. “It helps to take the emotions out of your decisions.” Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter: @GlobeInvestor Also on The Globe and Mail M&A activity on full tilt (Reuters)   AMZN-QAmazon.com Inc Latest Price$719.07 -19.94 (-2.70%) BABA-NAlibaba Group Holding Ltd Latest Price$89.77 -3.22 (-3.46%) AAR.UN-TPure Industrial Real Estate Trust Latest Price$5.01 -0.24 (-4.57%) EBAY-QeBay Inc Latest Price$27.89 -0.75 (-2.62%) SHOP-TShopify Inc Latest Price$51.36 -2.37 (-4.41%) ETSY-QEtsy Inc Latest Price$11.67 -0.05 (-0.43%) Updated November 14 3:59 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Clif Bar Proves That Corporate Social Responsibility Can Win Customers by Bill Roth on Wednesday, Nov 2nd, 2016 Food & Agriculture Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Year after year, Clif Bar proves that corporate social responsibility wins customers. The company is growing at a 17 percent annual compounded rate. That is exceptional in an economy struggling to achieve 3 percent growth. Further so, Clif Bar achieves 17 percent compounded annual growth by running its business to achieve five aspirations for profits, brand, people, community and the environment. Corporate social responsibility is not a business function like finance or operations at Clif Bar. Being purposeful is at the core of the company and how it measures performance. It is Clif Bar’s secret sauce for winning customers in the highly competitive food market segment. Clif Bar links purpose and business growth Today’s business environment can be characterized as a race to the bottom on price. In this business model, people and products are commodities. Only high-volume, low-cost competitors win. But money is not the sole consumer issue. Market research documents that consumers seek purpose and values in what they buy and who they buy from. Here are three examples of how the consumer search for purpose is reshaping our economy and creating business opportunities: Our national weight crisis is very real to moms and millennials. These key consumers are searching for foods that taste good, are affordable and have authentic health benefits. The vast majority of Americans believe global warming is real and manmade. Americans seek to buy from businesses that are part of the solution and not part of the problem. This trend has resulted in renewable energy now representing 50 percent or more of our new power generating capacity. Voters support growth of renewable energy over the growth of fossil energy by a 4 to 1 margin. How a business treats its customers, work associates and the disadvantaged is a major consumer concern. Consumers do not want to buy seafood connected to slave labor. They do not want to buy clothes made by children. And the millennial generation, the most diverse in U.S. history, will not tolerate a company that discriminates. Clif Bar demonstrates the business case that a company can achieve superior financial results by meeting these types of consumer expectations. Clif Bar is not alone in demonstrating that purposefulness sells. Many of our volume retailers are now Green Giants selling over a billion dollars worth of green products annually. For example, Costco is now the largest organic food retailer selling $4 billion annually. Target’s Made to Matter product line generates $1 billion annually, and products that satisfy Walmart’s Sustainability Index now generate $1.5 billion in annual sales. Clif Bar’s CEO Kevin Cleary on how to be purposeful and profitable Here’s how Clif Bar’s CEO Kevin Cleary explains the company’s success: “Our culture is our competitive advantage!” Cleary defines culture as how people work together. His anchoring leadership goal is to connect people to what matters. Connecting people to what matters drives product design. It drives the design of the work environment. It exemplifies their brand equity. Ultimately, it is the link between the company’s purpose and profits. You see this in Cleary’s execution of Clif Bar’s five aspirations. Under his leadership, Clif Bar built one of our country’s first LEED Platinum corporate headquarters. This building aligns with the company’s environmental aspiration. But it is also is an example of Cleary’s leadership in embracing best practices that improve employee productivity, such as Biophilic Design. Under Cleary’s leadership, Clif Bar also doubled its business size. But this business result was achieved while only increasing the number of employees by about 50 percent. Cleary and his team also use the company’s five aspirations in determining how to invest in the business. The company just launched its first bakery, a $90 million investment. It did not qualify potential locations in the traditional economic development process that is heavily focused on least cost. Instead the company applied all five aspirations of business, brand, people, community and environment in assessing where to locate. On that basis, Clif Bar choose Twin Falls, Idaho. Tellingly, this town’s motto is, “People serving people.” Doesn’t that sound like Clif Bar? And of course, the company built its bakery using Biophilic Design to make sure employees stay connected to the beauty of Twin Falls while on the job. If your business is in search of double-digit growth, this video interview with Clif Bar CEO Kevin Cleary conducted at Sustainable Brands 2016 is a must-watch. In it, Cleary speaks to how he is growing the business. He explains in more detail how the company is realizing increased worker productivity. He shares how the company’s supply chain has engaged in collaborative learning to lower costs and emissions. Most importantly, Cleary outlines how Clif Bar has successfully linked purpose and profits.

Tech firms are the best place to look. brionv via Flickr By James K. Glassman, Contributing Columnist From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, December 2016 Rapidly rising revenues are my favorite indicator of a great company. Economists say that a stock’s value ultimately reflects the profits—not the revenues, or sales—that a firm is expected to reap in the future. But it’s easier for a company to manipulate reported earnings than revenues. Moreover, although a firm can cut costs to boost profits over the short term, even if sales are stagnant, cost-cutting isn’t a productive long-term strategy. See Also: 10 Worst Stocks of the Bull Market To get higher profits over the long haul, you need higher sales. And to get higher sales, you need products and services that keep improving. Where is that improvement most dramatic? In technology firms. Alphabet (symbol GOOGL, $804), the former Google, is now raking in ad sales at a rate of more than $6 billion a month, or roughly the same as all the television networks combined. But Alphabet has other ventures, including apps, maps, self-driving cars, broadband and health care, and it has made investments in more than 300 businesses, including Uber and Nest (see A Smarter Way to Heat and Cool Your Home). Stocks in boldface are those I recommend; prices are as of September 30. Amazon.com (AMZN, $837) is not just the world’s largest online retailer; it also runs a $10-billion-a-year cloud-computing business, makes the world’s number-one streaming media player (Fire TV), and produces original TV series that this year received five Emmy awards. Amazon’s price-earnings ratio is a sky-high 95, based on projected earnings for the year ahead, but I don’t care. Big profits will come later. Advertisement In the second quarter of 2016, total revenues for the companies that make up Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.2% compared with the same period a year earlier. But revenues at Facebook (FB, $128) in the same quarter soared 59%. Sales at Netflix (NFLX) have increased by an average annual rate of 26% over the past five years; Amazon and Alphabet, by 26% and 21%, respectively. Comparing Value Line’s estimates of revenues for 2016 with actual results in 2010, I found that Facebook’s revenues have risen by a factor of 13, and those of Amazon, Net­flix and Alphabet have each more than tripled. (Facebook did not go public until 2012, but the company reported its audited financial results for previous years.) By contrast, revenues for Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) rose a total of just 14%, and sales for Procter & Gamble (PG) have actually fallen. Of course, it’s the future, not the past, that counts for shareholders. Analysts believe these four companies—collectively known as the FANGs (the last letter coming from Alphabet’s former name)—will keep growing at a remarkable pace. Value Line projects that over the next five years, the rate of growth of revenues for Facebook will be 31%; Amazon and Netflix, 20%; Alphabet, 13%. In a U.S. economy that is growing by only about 3% annually, including inflation, these figures are mind-boggling. (For another take on the FANGs, see Practical Investing.) Before you rush out to buy the FANG stocks, consider an intriguing alternative. Nearly 20 years ago, I introduced readers to a portfolio devised by Leslie Douglas, of Folger Nolan Fleming Douglas, a venerable Washington, D.C., investment firm that was founded in 1889. Les Douglas, who died at age 96 in 2010, had an elegant idea for his clients: Buy equal dollar amounts of the five largest stocks on the Nasdaq exchange at the start of each year, then repeat annually. The brilliance of the Douglas Theory is that, first, you own big tech companies, which tend to be more stable than smaller ones; second, by reallocating each year, you shift your money away from stocks that have soared recently and toward those that may be better values; and, finally, your portfolio gradually changes with the times. Advertisement For example, in 1997, when I first wrote about the Douglas Theory, the five largest Nasdaq stocks were Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT, $58), Oracle (ORCL) and MCI (which later merged into WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002). Four of the five are no longer on the Douglas Theory list. Compared with the FANGs, Douglas drops Netflix and adds Apple (AAPL), which has the largest market cap of any U.S. company, and Microsoft, which ranks third, after Alphabet. Apple is no slouch when it comes to revenue growth—up an average of 37% annually for the past five years. Microsoft is the outlier, with just 9% annualized growth. Since 1991, Douglas Theory stocks have gained an average of 24% a year, or about twice the return of the S&P 500. Last year, the portfolio returned 42%, compared with 1.4% for the S&P, and in the first nine months of 2016, Douglas earned 12.9%, compared with 7.8% for the S&P. Another way to buy fast-growing tech stocks is through PowerShares QQQ (QQQ, $119), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon account for 40% of the fund’s assets. Over the past 10 years, QQQ returned 12.3% annualized, an average of 5.0 percentage points per year more than the S&P 500. With the high returns of fast growers, however, comes high short-term risk. Over the past three years, QQQ has been 29% more volatile than the S&P 500. That said, the balance sheets of the fast growers are rock-solid. Value Line gives its highest rating for “financial strength,” A++, to Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft; Amazon and Facebook each get an impressive A+. Alphabet has $78 billion in cash and short-term investments and just $4 billion in debt; Facebook has $23 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt. Advertisement I noted earlier that Amazon’s P/E is in the stratosphere, but I don’t think that all of the FANG and Douglas stocks are overpriced. Facebook’s P/E is 27, based on projected profits. That’s not too pricey for a company whose sales are growing so rapidly. Alphabet’s P/E is 21; Microsoft’s is 19; Apple’s, 13. Netflix, which has eked out only small profits, has a P/E of 154. In fact, I have some worries about Netflix—as much as I love its service. Unlike the other five companies, it has only a single business line, and it has attracted some rough competition. Also, it is much smaller than the others. There’s a case for eliminating Microsoft as well because its growth rate is so much lower (Value Line projects just 7% annual profit growth for the next five years). But Microsoft has clearly gotten a second wind, and I would leave it in a collection of fast growers with Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. Call them the Four Revenue Risers for the Millennium, or an FRRM portfolio of FAAM stocks. No guarantees, of course, but you should get a profitable ride over the long haul.

Deborah worked with Wal-Mart for 24 years and was a manager there for many of those years. Deborah was a light to this world and a beacon of hope to many. Anyone who knew her knew how her smile would light up a room, how her laugh was contagious and her strength was unlike no other. She was a lover of life and loved anything to do with helping the earth. Deborah's surviving family are her parents John "Lenny" Souza and Lorraine Medeiros Souza, her loving husband of 26 years Michael Anthony Saraiva, her brothers Kevin Souza and Jeff Souza, her three children, oldest son, Joshua Michael Oliveira, her daughter Courtney Lynn Scholz, and her youngest son Michael Christopher Saraiva, and her two beautiful grandchildren, grandson Joshua "JJ" Michael Oliveria Jr. and granddaughter, Amelia Leigh Scholz. She may have left this earth but she will never leave our hearts, she lives on in all of us. A celebration of life in Deborah's honor will be later announced.

The new sentences stem from Hall’s arrest in Hudson in January, when he was charged with a felony count of receiving stolen property and a misdemeanor count of fraudulent use of a credit card after stealing a woman’s car, driving to the Hudson Wal-Mart and using her credit/debit card to withdraw $200 from an ATM, according to the charges. ...

The new sentences stem from Hall’s arrest in Hudson in January, when he was charged with a felony count of receiving stolen property and a misdemeanor count of fraudulent use of a credit card after stealing a woman’s car, driving to the Hudson Wal-Mart and using her credit/debit card to withdraw $200 from an ATM, according to the charges. Hall, 22, who was represented Tuesday by public defender Paul Borchardt, pleaded guilty to the two charges in exchange for one two- to four-year prison term and a 12-month term in Valley Street jail, all suspended for five years following his release from prison. The time Hall is serving stems from convictions on charges including accomplice to robbery, theft, possession of a firearm by a felon, willful concealment, resisting arrest and three probation violations, according to Assistant County Attorney Kathleen Broderick, who prosecuted the case. Those convictions were split between Hillsborough County Superior Court North in Manchester and Rockingham County Superior Court in Brentwood. One of Hall’s arrests, in April 2015, came two days after he was named the Fugitive of the Week by the U.S. Marshals Service’s New Hampshire Fugitive Task Force. Information gleaned from citizen tips led Manchester police to Hall’s mother’s house, but when they approached her, police said at the time, she fled on foot. When officers caught up to her, they learned that he was inside the residence, according to the task force and Manchester police. Officers eventually found him hiding in a closet and took him into custody. The terms of the agreement accepted Tuesday, meanwhile, include the stipulation that Hall pay the victim in the Hudson case $670 restitution, have no contact with her and participate in any programs as recommended by prison officials. Calling the disposition of his newest case “a global resolution,” the judge, Charles Temple, turned to Hall and addressed his criminal history. “It’s time for you to make the decision whether you’re going to spend your life on the installment plan at New Hampshire State Prison and the House of Corrections,” Temple said. “You need to decide if you want a life behind the wall or on the outside of it.” Dean Shalhoup can be reached at 594-6443, dshalhoup@nashuatelegraph.com or@Telegraph_DeanS.

Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall online shopping marketplace announced on October 20 that the upcoming shopping festival will include 98,000 retailers from across the world, including Costco, Macy's and German Pool. The e-commerce platform also aims to sell goods to other places besides the Chinese mainland, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Double 11 event, held every year on November 11, also known as Singles' Day, was established by Alibaba in 2009. Luxury brand Burberry's international flagship store on Tmall has joined this year's Double 11 shopping event, indicating that "famous brands are starting to take seriously domestic large e-commerce platforms," said Lu Zhenwang, founder of Shanghai Wanqing Commerce Consulting. "Overseas brands like Burberry are rolling out new products instead of providing clearance sales for the upcoming shopping event. This shows that they consider the domestic online marketplace a key platform to popularize their products," he told the Global Times on Tuesday. U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc announced on October 20 that it will open an international flagship store on jd.com. In 2015, Chinese tourists' spending overseas hit 4.5 billion, up 16.6 percent year-on-year, according to a report released by the China Tourism Academy and bank card issuer UnionPay International. Alibaba's Tmall online shopping platforms posted sales of 91.2 billion yuan (.5 billion) in the Double 11 shopping event in 2015, up 60 percent year-on-year, said a statement on the group's website. U.S. second largest retailer Costco saw its Tmall store sell about 300 tons of mixed nuts and dried craneberries during last year's Double 11 shopping festival, with revenue hitting more than 22 million yuan, according to media reports. China's online shopping market maintained steady growth in 2015, the China Internet Network Information Center said in a report in January. An estimated 413 million Chinese purchased goods online last year, up 14.3 percent year-on-year, said the report. Due to the strong buying power of Chinese shoppers, foreign e-commerce platforms are also seeking opportunities to develop in the country. On Friday, U.S. online retail giant Amazon announced plans to offer tailored Prime services for Chinese customers in a bid to deliver authentic goods to China from the U.S. Experts suggested domestic e-commerce dealers step up efforts to crack down on fake goods on their platforms. Luxury brands have close cooperation with foreign e-commerce dealers but only a few have entered China's online market, indicating that they may have concern about counterfeits, Lu said, adding that Chinese online vendors should try their best to fight against counterfeits. In May, the International Anti-Counterfeit Coalition (IACC) suspended Alibaba's membership, mainly due to concerns by various IACC members.
