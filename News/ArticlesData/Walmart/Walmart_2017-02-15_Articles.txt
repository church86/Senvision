(Register file photo) LEONARD ORTIZ, , LEONARD ORTIZ, ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER By NANCY LUNA / Staff Writer Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF As leases approach expiration dates, negotiations are not looking good for some restaurants. Some are closing and relocating to more affordable locations, while others are bidding goodbye to underperforming locations. In Irvine and Newport Beach, two power lunch restaurants, Il Barone and Prego Ristorante, have announced plans to relocate to new locations. Il Barone is taking over a high-profile location left vacant by a Coco’s in Newport Beach. Coco’s is among several casual dining chains – a restaurant segment still struggling in a post-Great Recession world – shuttering locations in Orange County. Here’s the latest closure round up: • Chili’s Grill & Bar, at 17071 Beach Blvd. in Huntington Beach, closed in late January. According to public notices filed with the state, the closure is permanent and impacts 46 employees. Brinker International, the parent company of Chili’s, did not provide a reason for the closure. • TGI Friday’s in Yorba Linda plans to close March 6. An employee answering the phone at the Savi Ranch retail center restaurant said its last day will be March 5. The restaurant, at 23040 Eastpark Drive, employs 42 workers, according to a state filing. “The decision to close the location was purely a business decision and we will offer the majority (of) team members the opportunity to work at our other TGIF restaurants in the area,” a restaurant executive said in a statement. • Two McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores in Huntington Beach and Laguna Niguel recently closed. A representative for McDonald's in Southern California said the decision to close at the end of a lease is up to the franchisee. Other McDonald's locations continue to operate inside Walmart stores in Southern California, McDonald’s said. • The demise of Carrows and Coco’s restaurants in Orange County continues. The Carrows at 28502 Marguerite Pkwy. in Mission Viejo has been converted to a Coco’s. As a result of the rebrand, the Coco's at 27750 Crown Valley Pkwy. in Mission Viejo has closed permanently, said Mike Griffith, a representative for Catalina Restaurant Group. The company, acquired two years ago by Food Management Partners, operates both Coco’s and Carrows brands. Griffith said there are no plans to reopen Carrows anywhere else. With the closure of Carrows in Mission Viejo, there are none left in Orange County. Last week, a Coco’s at 900 Bristol St. North in Newport Beach closed. The coffee house is being converted into Il Barone, a popular Italian restaurant relocating from another site in the city. CLICK HERE to read more about Il Barone’s relocation. • Prego Ristorante, a mainstay for three decades in Irvine, will serve its last meal at its Irvine Towers location Feb. 26. The owners of the three-decade-old restaurant said they were unable to “come to an agreement on the terms” of a new lease with the landlord, the Irvine Company. The owners are planning to relocate the restaurant. CLICK HERE to read more. • Taco Jr. in Costa Mesa recently closed. It will be replaced by Taco Brat, a taqueria/sausage house by Thomas Curren. The veteran chef has spent a career working for a variety of venues from Aubergine to Pinkberry to Umami Burger. The menu will feature “haus-made” sausages, tacos, home-cured bacon and German and Mexican beers. The restaurant is at 2101 Harbor Blvd. • Mare Culinary Lounge by Alessandro Pirozzi has closed in Laguna Beach. An employee answering the phone at Mare this week said the restaurant, located at the Holiday Inn on S. Coast Highway, is open only for private events. This week, OpenTable said “Mare Culinary Lounge will no longer be part of the OpenTable network.” In an email, chef and owner Pirozzi said the “current hotel owner did not extend our Mare lease.” He said he could not comment any further. Pirozzi is best known for launching the Cucina Alessa-branded restaurants in Orange County. Pirozzi, a native of Naples, developed Alessa from his grandmother’s recipes. After debuting Cucina Alessa in Newport Beach in 2008, Pirozzi opened one in Huntington Beach in 2009 and the Laguna location in 2010. Pirozzi “severed” ties with the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach restaurants in late 2012. Those restaurants still go by the name Cucina Alessa. He operates Alessa in Laguna Beach. He also owns Pirozzi, a pasta and pizza bistro in Corona del Mar. In December, Pirozzi took over the shuttered Salerno restaurant in Laguna Beach. • Shinkou Sushi & Poke in Laguna Hills closed in late January. The restaurant posted a closure note on its Facebook page, thanking customers for their loyalty since it opened nearly six years ago. “It is a bittersweet feeling. We are sad and yet excited for the future adventures await. We thank you all again for your patronage and love,” the restaurant wrote. Owner Veronica Hananto said a few factors contributed to the closure, including the inability to negotiate a new lease in a timely manner and the loss of key employees. Address: 24881 Alicia Parkway, Laguna Hills. • The Gypsy Den at Center Street Promenade in Anaheim has closed. It has been rebranded as Center Street Tavern. The owner, who owns all Gypsy Den locations, described the modern tavern as a zero attitude hangout serving classic beers, elevated wines and simple cocktails.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Ashley Lutz Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just sold off $900 million of Walmart stock, choosing to invest billions in airline stocks instead. The sale, which leaves Buffett with nearly no shares in Walmart, comes as America’s largest traditional retailer has been rushing to catch up to Amazon and other online competitors. Amazon’s market value is now $356 billion, compared with Walmart’s $298 billion. Buffett last year acknowledged that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were struggling in the face of competition from the e-commerce giant. “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,” Buffett said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Buffet’s been paring his stake in Walmart since then. He first bought shares in the retailer back in 2005. The 86-year-old billionaire also noted that Amazon’s competitors, “including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.” Former Walmart CEO Mike Duke admitted in 2012 that his biggest regret as CEO was not investing more in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon. “I wish we had moved faster. We’ve proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn’t move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce,” Duke said at the time. “Right now we’re making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area.” Walmart’s online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon’s $107 billion. Buffett’s retail instincts have proven correct before when he correctly predicted the downfall of Sears and Kmart in 2005. “Retailing is like shooting at a moving target,” Buffett said. “Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Justin Barkley, 38, arrived in Tompkins County Supreme Court on Wednesday morning to argue against his mother’s request for guardianship. Linda Edwards, Barkley’s mother, filed a petition with the court in January requesting custody of her son and the ability to make legal decisions for him, The Sun previously reported. Barkley is “totally unable to speak realistically, accurately or coherently about the situation which he faces,” his mother said in the petition, noting that he had been ruled incompetent to stand the murder trial by two psychiatrists. In addition to requesting the ability to make legal decisions for her son, Edwards also asked for the power to make medical decisions for Barkley and manage his financial assets.

He is being held at Tompkins County Jail without the option for bail. In a handwritten letter sent by Barkley to the court, he requested a jury trial in the custody case and asked that the judge appoint an attorney to defend him. “I do not want the counsel to have permission to inspect my medical, psychological or psychiatric records,” Barkley wrote in the letter.

Judge Guy denied Van Houten’s request to observe the guardianship proceedings, saying the district attorney’s presence might have a “chilling effect” on Barkley’s ability to freely testify in opposition to his mother’s guardianship request, Van Houten said, adding that he disagreed with but respected the judge’s decision. Ithaca Police Department Justin Barkley, 38, is facing two misdemeanor charges from August in addition to a murder charge from December Documents from Lansing Town Court raise new questions about the mental health status of Barkley, who in December claimed he had killed President Donald Trump outside of Walmart and who has been ruled incompetent to stand trial by two psychiatrists. Barkley is facing two misdemeanor charges — menacing and falsely reporting a crime — for allegedly punching and choking a store clerk at the Triphammer Marketplace on Aug. 26, according to court documents that have not been previously reported. The alleged assault occurred a little more than three months before Schumacher was killed at Walmart. Less than an hour after the murder, Barkley drove away from police and holed up in his house with a rifle, commencing an hours-long standoff with police before he ultimately surrendered. A manager at Planted Earth said a man entered the hydroponics and garden supply shop at Triphammer Marketplace on Aug. 26 claiming he had lost his wallet, but then began punching the manager and accusing him of raping his girlfriend, according to a statement given to State Police under penalty of perjury. “I came out from behind the counter to help the man find his wallet when he started yelling at me telling me not to touch his girlfriend again,” the manager said in the deposition. “The man punched me, he grabbed me, we struggled back and forth falling to the ground where he got me in a choke hold with his arm around my neck.” After trying to choke the manager, the man called 911 and spoke with an operator before leaving the store and riding away on a white Harley Davidson motorcycle, the manager said in the deposition. “While we were struggling the man said something about me tieing up his girlfriend and raping her in the store,” the manager said. “I don’t know who this man is or why he thinks I touched his girlfriend.” A State Police officer said in a complaint that Barkley called 911 claiming his girlfriend was being raped and assaulted by the store clerk before screaming “send help” and hanging up. The officer says Barkley’s claims were entirely false. Attorney Michael Perehinec, who is representing Barkley in Lansing Town Court, said the case has not been dismissed but was put on hold after Barkley was charged with the Walmart murder. Asked about the misdemeanor charges and the incident at Planted Earth, District Attorney Van Houten said the Lansing case is “on hold” as Barkley deals with the murder charge, but that prosecutors are aware of the case and have spoken with people involved. “Those people that interacted with him are people that we have on record and we will continue to communicate with them as it becomes necessary,” Van Houten told The Sun. “Everything that [Barkley] has done that we can document is relevant to evaluating his mental health.” Judge John Rowley, who is presiding over the murder case, said in January that prosecutors are doing “a disservice to the public” by maintaining that Barkley is competent despite the two psychiatrists’ evaluations otherwise. “Your evaluation is that he’s competent based on nothing,” Rowley said to a prosecutor in January. Van Houten said in January that Barkley would be undergoing a more thorough psychiatric evaluation at a secure mental health facility. The district attorney also said he was confident Barkley would be found competent to stand trial and said he was comfortable prosecuting the case even if Barkley still believed he had killed Donald Trump. Attorney James Baker, who is defending Barkley in the Walmart murder case, did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday.

Related Mother of Accused Walmart Murderer Requests Guardianship, Power to Make Legal Decisions By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs January 20, 2017 Edwards, in her petition, said she is suitable to act as Barkley’s guardian because she “has been his mother and intimately involved in his life. Of all of the available and willing people to carry out this function, she is the most familiar with his needs and assets.” Judge Says Prosecution Is Doing ‘a Disservice to the Public’ in Walmart Murder Case By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs January 19, 2017 The flub occurred because a court clerk did not scan the back of one of the psychiatric examiners’ forms, on which the examiner had clarified that Barkley was incompetent to assist in his own defense, District Attorney Matthew Van Houten told reporters.

Tim Wetzel, KHOU 8:51 PM. CST February 15, 2017 A Walmart customer shops using a handheld scanner on Wednesday in a new prototype store located in Tomball.  (Photo: KHOU 11 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HARRIS COUNTY, Texas - Walmart is testing out a prototype store in the Woodlands-Tomball area that allows customers to skip traditional check-out lanes. The store, located at 25800 Kuykendahl Road, held its grand opening Wednesday morning. "When you walk into the store, you can grab a handheld scanner or download the 'scan and go' app," explains Walmart spokeswoman, Anne Hatfield. "You walk around the store, scan the bar code and shop as you go." When they are done shopping, customers can simply show the device to an employee, pay and walk out. "It's saving customer's time and is an easier way to do things," said Hatfield. The store also contains traditional check-out lanes and an option to order items online in advance and then pick them up curbside. It is one of only two prototype stores in the country, the other location is in Florida. "What we learn here from the Tomball store, we will use in stores throughout the country," said Hatfield. The design of the new store is also different, the interior is brighter and seems more modern. "It's a nice little concept," said shopper Hector Diaz. "It kind of gets me in and out faster." Walmart officials say if more customers like the design, it will be used in more stores nationwide.

Marina Strauss RETAILING REPORTER — Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 12:01AM EST Last updated Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 12:01AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print A small-business group has won lower merchant fees for its members from MasterCard Canada, a move that could put more pressure on credit-card firms to reduce their rates and prompt other associations to seek preferential pricing. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents more than 100,000 small firms, is set to unveil on Thursday a deal with MasterCard that will reduce most of CFIB members’ transaction fees to levels that are now offered to just a small number of the country’s largest merchants, those with annual MasterCard sales of $3-billion or more. It will mean that, starting on April 3, most members’ interchange fees for regular credit cards will drop by 12.5 per cent to 1.26 per cent of the value of a customer’s purchase from 1.44 per cent currently. Those rates will decrease by 22 per cent for premium credit cards – to 1.38 per cent from 1.77 per cent – and by 7.8 per cent for ultrapremium plastic, to 1.9 per cent from 2.06 per cent. The initiative comes amid rising pressure from retailers and other businesses for lower credit-card fees, highlighted last summer when discount behemoth Wal-Mart Canada Corp. stopped accepting Visa cards in Thunder Bay and Manitoba, complaining that the fees were “unacceptably high.” In January, Wal-Mart and Visa came to an agreement that ended the dispute, although neither side has disclosed the details of their deal. In the latest CFIB-MasterCard agreement, “what this shows is that the landscape has changed,” Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, said in an interview. In the past, “merchants have felt rather powerless in terms of influencing the rates that they pay. But in the last few years, with a lot of leadership from the credit-card industry, from the payments industry and some help from government, things have changed an awful lot.” CFIB’s move to get better rates for its members marks a new front in the credit-card-fee battle. Individual companies, such as retail giants Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp., have reached their own deals with Visa and MasterCard, respectively, for some breaks. But associations have not secured their own interchange fees for their members collectively. Indeed, CFIB and other groups have raised concerns that the deals for the big companies could lead to higher costs for smaller businesses. The CFIB-MasterCard agreement now opens the door for other associations to follow suit, said Richard Crone of payments specialist Crone Consulting LLC in San Carlos, Calif. The credit-card companies “will be deluged by others trying to do the same,” Mr. Crone predicted. He wasn’t aware of any other association that has got preferential interchange fees. (Groups have secured preferential payment processor fees, which retailers also pay, but those are much lower than the interchange fees.) But he also said the fees that CFIB won are just “token reductions” and still not close to the 0.3-per-cent rates that have been regulated in other markets, such as in Europe. Brian Lang, president of MasterCard Canada, said offering a special interchange fee for an association sets a precedent in Canada. “Will there be more of them? Maybe, we’ll see how things go.” He said interchange fees in Canada are the lowest among markets such as the United States, South America and the Asia-Pacific region – everywhere except in Europe and Australia. He said higher rates are needed so the companies can invest in electronic-commerce innovation. “When rates are dropped down, it stifles that innovation,” he said. MasterCard came to an agreement with CFIB because its members are an important engine of the Canadian economy and the shift to electronic payments, he said. As well, the deal helps MasterCard honour its commitment to the federal government that it would reduce interchange fees to 1.5 per cent on average. Last September, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government would review the fees charged by the credit card networks and the effects of the fee reductions. Visa and MasterCard agreed in 2014 to lower their interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years, starting in 2015, from 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively, thus avoiding having Ottawa set rates. Both firms have said their audits have showed they’re in compliance, although they have not released the audits themselves. The Small Business Matters Coalition is pushing Ottawa to institute a 0.3-per-cent interchange fee. “We want the rate that is in force in other jurisdictions,” said Gary Sands, the coalition’s chairman. The Retail Council of Canada is also pushing for lower rates. Mr. Kelly said some of CFIB’s grocery and gas station members already have lower fees than its newly negotiated rates because of the categories they fit into under MasterCard’s rules. But the vast majority of CFIB members, which include some individual Canadian Tire, Home Hardware and Merry Maid franchisees, will benefit from the new agreement, he said.

They smashed a van through the store's south wall and left in a second vehicle. The van that was left behind was found to have been stolen out of Cleveland Heights. It was used in a similar incident in Beachwood the previous day, in which an ATM was stolen from a BP gas station. Counterfeiting, Warrensville Center Road: A man said Feb. 5 an employee of his business received a counterfeit $20 bill as part of his change from a purchase he made at Walmart. Officers spoke to the Walmart staff and were told the only way the bill would have made it into the cash register would be if a customer paid with it and there would be no way to trace it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee reported Feb. 6 a habitual thief tried to steal 30 cans of baby formula, but fled from the store when asked to see a receipt. He said the Cleveland woman, 35, is known to Walmart employees because of a company-wide notification banning her from all stores. He said she has attempted to steal $5,000 worth of merchandise from at least ten Walmart stores in the last five years. Officers did not locate the woman. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: An East Cleveland woman, 25, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 9 for the suspected theft of cell phone cases, valued at a total of $138.96. In the presence of her 12-year-old sister, she told officers she was 17-years-old. She was charged with theft, resisting arrest, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and obstructing official business. Her sister never denied the false information she provided and also contributed to her providing it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Maple Heights boy, 14, was suspected of the theft of $128.88 worth of merchandise from Walmart Feb. 9. His mother was in the store with him and was unaware that he was shoplifting. Charges will be filed in juvenile court. Fraud, Winston Road: A resident reported Feb. 8 there was about $1,000 in unauthorized charges on his bank account. He knew at least two purchases were made online. His bank is investigating. Stolen vehicle, South Belvoir Boulevard: A woman reported Feb. 9 her vehicle was stolen out of her driveway sometime during the overnight hours. It has been locked and was taken without keys. Burglary, Suffolk Road: A woman reported at 4:56 p.m. Feb. 9 two unknown males kicked in her front door, but fled when they saw her in the home. She said they left in an older model white pick-up truck. Responding officers did not locate the truck. Several similar incidents have recently been reported in the city. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights woman, 29, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 3 for the suspected theft of $284 worth of merchandise. Among the items she failed to pay for at the self-checkout were men's underwear and socks; food, medication and health and beauty items. Found property, South Belvoir Boulevard: A man turned in to police a rifle magazine with 22 rounds of ammunition Feb. 8 that he said was located in the grass median while he was supervising an adult community service cleanup. It was believed it had been recently dropped or thrown where it was found, due to its new condition. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 33, was arrested at Walmart Feb. 7 after he was seen cutting open merchandise packaging and concealing items in his clothing. He was found in possession of two box cutters. He was charged with theft and possession of criminal tools and it was learned he was recently released from jail, stemming from a prior theft offense.

Hot Topics: Missing mother, child Frog Belly Farm cleanup Longmont home prices double AG sues Boulder County Airport noise News tips Longmont police arrest man who allegedly head-butted Walmart manager By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   02/15/2017 04:29:43 PM MST Updated:   02/15/2017 07:03:39 PM MST Longmont police take Dustin Robinson-Beaty into custody at the north Longmont Walmart on Wednesday afternoon after a report of a manager being assaulted. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer) After a man became agitated at Longmont's north Walmart on Wednesday afternoon, customer Roman Avila's instinct was to stop him by tackling him. "I always tell myself I would do that if it happened, and it happened," Avila said. Police identified the man as Dustin Robinson-Beaty, 23, who they arrested outside the north entrance of Walmart, 2514 Main St.. Police said when store managers approached his camper that had been parked for several days, they told him to leave and he began yelling obscenities. Cmdr. Joel Post said police believe Robinson-Beaty followed the managers back through the parking lot to the store, where he began throwing things at the employees and another manager approached. He then reportedly head-butted the female manager, possibly breaking her nose. Avila, of Longmont, said he was checking out after shopping and noticed the argument turn physical. "I tackled him and held him down on the ground until the cops got here," he said. A manager standing outside the store said to him, "It could've gotten a whole lot worse." They handed him a $50 gift card for his help and directed customers to use the south entrance. Post said officers used a Taser when Robinson-Beaty resisted being taken into custody. He was transported to Longmont United Hospital for medical clearance. Charges are pending, but could include assault, trespass, harassment and resisting arrest. Post said there is no indication that Robinson-Beaty was under the influence. Advertisement At the same Walmart in March 2016, a customer intervened after an officer was attacked in the store by a 44-year-old man. Campers in retail parking lots have been an issue in Longmont recently, as the Longmont JCPenney said it would deal with campers and lived-in vehicles staying overnight in its parking lot in January.

Photo: Bob Finnan, Associated Press Business News Roundup, Feb. 16 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Apple looks for iPhone supplier Apple is in discussions with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for iPhones, a key component that has been provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said. Apple has been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it will add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to $14.5 billion building two plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the phone’s debut.

The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Walmart says Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay in Michigan. Walmart, which is trying to better compete with Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce company with strong industry relationships. Walmart also purchased marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Walmart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. Economy Consumer prices jump U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Labor Department said Wednesday that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, the most since February 2013 and twice what economists were expecting. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent. Food prices rose in January for the first time in seven months. Grocery prices were unchanged, but the cost of eating out rose 0.4 percent. The price of clothing, new cars, auto insurance and air fares all rose by 0.8 percent or more in January. Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the most since March 2012. Core inflation rose 2.3 percent over the last 12 months. Construction Home builders less confident Home builders are feeling a bit less confident this month, reflecting a dimmer outlook on sales in the months ahead and fewer would-be buyers dropping by builders’ sales offices. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday fell to 65 this month. That’s down two points from a revised reading of 67 in January. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has been above 60 since September and reached the highest level in 11 years in December.

Walmart has told some vendors it is seeking to make the buying process more efficient for itself and vendors, and improve coordination between its buying teams, according to the report. It also wants to apply its bricks-and-mortar expertise in securing the lowest possible prices to its e-commerce business, according to the vendors, who spoke over the last few days. They declined to be identified for fear of disrupting business relations with Walmart, Reuters said. The company has told vendors it plans to disclose the change at a meeting with suppliers later this week, the vendor sources told Reuters. Walmart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez on Monday would say only that the company wants to create "a more efficient process that accelerates how we bring the full assortment of products in stores to Walmart.com," according to the report.The company expects Walmart.com's buying team to focus on expanding the online assortment, Lopez told Reuters. Going forward, Walmart's store buying team based at Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters will place combined store and Web orders with suppliers who sell on both platforms. Under the new system, an item available for sale in the store will also be approved for sale online, Reuters' sources added. "The way it operated until now was extremely inefficient for us and them," a large consumer goods supplier told Reuters. "For example, they would buy 5 million cases a year for stores and 500 cases (for) online and then make us go through a different buyer for online. It was a nuisance." Walmart's buying team in San Bruno, California, will still deal with suppliers that make products that sell only on Walmart.com, the vendors said. Store suppliers who have items they sell exclusively online will also have to go through San Bruno, they added. The strategy is designed to leverage Wal-Mart's powerful Bentonville purchasing operation, where dozens of vendors have set up offices solely to facilitate sales to Walmart.   RELATED LINKS RFID Sending Strong Signals Going Deeper with Data Sharing Best of NRF 2013: Top 10 Takeaways Item-Level RFID: Accuracy Enables Omnichannel Growth POST A COMMENT Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RATE THIS CONTENT (5 Being the Best) Rating Rating Rating Rating Rating 1 2 3 4 5 Current rating: 0 (0 ratings) Tweet Add To Favorite Email Print Text Size + − MOST READ STORIES Vineyard Vines Employs Unified Commerce to Sell a Lifestyle Best of NRF 2017: Top 10 Takeaways Walgreens CIO Quits, Forming Marketing Startup Top 10 Department Stores: Who Made the Cut?

(Photo: Rachel Woolf, Detroit Free Press) 6684 CONNECTTWEET 207 LINKEDIN 42 COMMENTEMAILMORE MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. — Walmart is buying Moosejaw, a company based here that specializes in outdoor recreation apparel and gear, in a bid to strengthen the global retail juggernaut's online offerings for $51 million in cash, the companies announced Wednesday. Walmart (WMT) said it will continue to operate the website and 10 stores for Moosejaw, known for its quirky, cutting-edge marketing, as a standalone site and separate retail outlets. Employees will remain in Michigan. "From the customer's perspective, they really won't see much change in Moosejaw.com or our stores," said Eoin Comerford, Moosejaw's chief executive officer. "We are going to continue to be an outdoor specialty retailer of premium brands. "You are going to have the same Moosejaw voice and the same Moosejaw madness is going to be very prevalent," he said. ► Related: Walmart sued for allegedly selling craft beer that isn't craft beer What will change: The company intends to amplify its marketing, he said. Still, balancing what will be different, so the two companies can benefit from the deal, and what will remain the same, so that the acquisition does not harm the Moosejaw brand or erode its customer base, is the central challenge that the both companies will wrestle with going forward. “Moosejaw is considered to be a pioneer, early adapter of social marketing. ... It has to totally be related to expertise, the culture approach to social commerce.”Ken Nisch, JGA consulting Over the long term, Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., hopes to leverage the privately held Michigan retailer's online sales knowledge and marketing of apparel and accessories and aims to open opportunities for Moosejaw suppliers to expand their reach on Walmart sites. But the company does not plan to sell Moosejaw-branded merchandise in Wal-Mart stores. "You won't go into Walmart and see Moosejaw T-shirts," Comerford said. "The customers are quite different." Walmart purchased Moosejaw from private equity partners Parallel Investment Partners and W Capital Partners. Walmart, which has more than 11,000 stores, has been focusing on growing online sales, which has included a buying spree of online outlets in the past year to boost its e-commerce portfolio and compete with retailers such as Amazon. Walmart, whose stock was down 14 cents to $68.53 at about 2 p.m. ET, is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. Last year, Walmart bought Jet, a Hoboken, N.J., start-up, which seeks to offer online shoppers items that few retailers offer, for about $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Walmart shares. Walmart said the two company websites — Walmart.com and Jet.com — would operate as separate brands but would leverage technology and talent. Jet offered more urban and millennial customers. ► Related: Walmart sued for firing of employee with Down syndrome In January, Walmart announced it also was acquiring ShoeBuy.com for $70 million, a move aimed at enhancing its footwear sales. The same month, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon highlighted a new e-commerce strategy for the company that is built around a retail future in which customers are ordering products from mobile devices and expect to have it delivered or pick up the same day, or in a few hours or minutes. “You won't go into Walmart and see Moosejaw T-shirts. The customers are quite different.”Eoin Comerford, Moosejaw "It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes — and in some areas even lead the way — or they’ll fall behind and disappear," he said at the time. Comerford's new duties include overseeing Walmart's outdoor e-commerce, including what it sells on Walmart.com and Jet.com. Chairman Ken Nisch of JGA, a Southfield, Mich., consulting firm —estimated that 80% to 85% of Moosejaw's sales are online. "Moosejaw is considered to be a pioneer, early adapter of social marketing," he said. "It's not a huge company, which makes it interesting from Walmart's standpoint. "They are not doing it for incremental sales. It has to totally be related to expertise, the culture approach to social commerce," Nisch said. "The addition of Moosejaw's sales to Walmart is not even a pinprick." Moreover, demographics of the two retailers' customers are quite different: Walmart customers tend to be more working-class mainstream while Moosejaw's are more affluent and tend to be younger. As a general comparison, he said Walmart's shoppers are hunters while Moosejaw's are hikers. ► Related: Walmart layoffs just the latest cuts in retail industry Founded in 1992 by long-time friends Robert Wolfe and David Jaffe, Moosejaw now has about 350 employees. Wolfe was a University of Michigan graduate, and Jaff, a University of Wisconsin grad. The duo originally planned to become wilderness guides and take people on camping trips, but instead they decided that more money could be made in selling camping equipment so they opened Moosejaw Mountaineering and Backcountry Travel in Keego Harbor, Mich., near Pontiac. At the time they started the company, Wolfe was just 21, and his retail experience was mostly hawking T-shirts at University of Michigan football and basketball games. ► Related: Walmart stops selling Black Lives Matter 'bulletproof' shirts after police complaint In their first year, the business exceeded their expectations. But by 2007,  the founders had sold their interest in the company to private equity firms. Yet even after its founders exited, Moosejaw held on to the fun-loving culture that touted its stores as places to get dating advice and play hand games such as rock-paper-scissors. It did not change the tongue-and-cheek self-description on its website, which called the company "the greatest place in the world to work, according to the owner's mom." ► Related: Walmart program: Stash cash in savings account, win prizes It also kept offering its zany promotions, known as Moosejaw Madness, that, among other edgy concepts had included a digital mobile app that let customers see what Moosejaw catalog models were wearing under their clothes when they hovered over the images, and a "break-up service" for couples too timid to end their own relationships. In 2012, Moosejaw opened a temporary retail outlet in downtown Detroit about 15 miles from company headquarters for the Christmas shopping season. But, whether Moosejaw ultimately will be able to maintain its distinctive voice and culture under Walmart is unclear. The goal is to take what we can from Walmart, and use it to amplify Moosejaw, Comerford said, "but not have it become a mini Walmart."

Wal-Mart de Mexico posted a net profit of 10.4 billion pesos ($504 million) in the period, up from 8.47 billion pesos a year earlier. The result beat analysts' expectations of 10.156 billion pesos, according to a Reuters poll of five analysts.

While some company fleets have been testing in-cab cameras that face drivers, most large carriers in the state either don’t plan to use the systems or declined to talk about them. Privacy remains the biggest concern with their use. In many cases, “companies are apprehensive” because of the privacy issue, said David O’Neal, director of safety services for Arkansas Trucking Association. There use might be viewed as a “big brother type atmosphere. I think that’s probably the biggest issue,” a driver-facing camera “right there on you every moment of the day.” But Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores and Memphis-based FedEx have been looking at them. Wal-Mart uses and tests technology “to make our logistics network, a core strength for the company, safer and even more efficient,” company spokesman Scott Markley said. This “is just one of many pilots to learn how we can be even better.” In a similar statement, FedEx Freight looks at “technology that will better ensure the safety of our team members and the motoring public.” ArcBest Corp., a Fort Smith-based transportation company, plans to have “collision mitigation systems with either forward-facing cameras and/or forward-looking radar” on the trucks it will purchase in the future, spokeswoman Kathy Fieweger said. “At this time, we do not plan on purchasing tractors with cab-facing cameras.” While the trucking association doesn’t have a specific stance on in-cab cameras, there are other cameras aside from the driver-facing camera that carriers have been using. Some in-cab cameras face toward the front of the truck, not monitoring the driver but capturing the road ahead. There are also external cameras that can be used in conjunction with in the in-cab cameras to help determine liability if the truck is involved in a crash. Generally, most camera systems are always recording, but the video is typically not saved unless an incident happens that triggers the video to start being saved, O’Neal said. A triggering event, such as a crash, sudden turn of the steering wheel or hard braking, would cause the camera to save the video about 10 seconds before the event and 10 seconds after it ends. The video that’s saved in a triggering event could be reviewed by the trucking company, but some camera system suppliers review the video before determining whether to notify the carrier based on the cause of the trigger. This “full package service” would have the supplier monitor the system instead of the carrier, O’Neal said. One of the top brands offering these systems, San Diego-based SmartDrive Systems, recently reported 94% “organic subscription growth” in 2016, compared to 2015 and almost 400% growth over three years. While some suppliers are “trying to gain a foothold in the market with low cost, no-review services,” fleets are opting for “full-service programs” to “identify risk, improve driver performance and save their teams’ time versus requiring them to hire more headcount to become video reviewers,” according to a company news release. “What gives use the greatest satisfaction is knowing how many drivers avoided collisions that didn’t have to happen, how many lives were saved as a result and how many drivers’ jobs were protected based on clear and accurate information about what occurred on the road,” SmartDrive CEO Steve Mitgang said in the release. Another top brand, Lytx, which is also based in San Diego, provides the company’s DriveCam program to more than 650,000 commercial and government fleet drivers. RISK AND REWARD Attorney James Franklin, who works in litigation, transportation, distribution and logistics and personal injury groups, wrote that some suppliers “offer affirmative coaching for drivers seen as demonstrating risky driving behavior.” Also, carriers could use data gathered by the systems “as a teaching tool to reduce the likelihood of future accidents.” The main purpose of the camera systems is “to promote safety,” O’Neal said. They would do this by encouraging the driver to operate the vehicle safely, and they could be used to determine fault in a crash. But one concern with using the systems is if a carrier were sued as a result of a crash involving one of the company’s trucks and driver, and the video that was recorded would likely be required to be turned over to the complainant, Franklin wrote. “Even more terrifying are the potential consequences involving any report rendered by the vendor. The default rule in litigation is that a third party’s involvement probably waives the protections otherwise afforded to confidential material between the transportation company and its attorney,” he noted. Because the court might see the supplier or vendor as a third party, “a court may force the company to turn over the recording and the report,” which might lead to more damaging information against the company or driver in question. Companies also should be aware of the costs related to the systems, and the laws that might restrict their use. Carriers that understand and address the risks associated with using the systems may “completely recognize and profit from the significant benefits offered by on-board video camera technology,” Franklin said. As an estimate, each system costs less than $1,000 per truck, and a monthly fee of $25-$30 per truck might be required. But this could change based on order volume, O’Neal said. Camera systems have been available for about 10 years, and started becoming more commonplace in the past five years.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Lowdown: New Report: CMOs Have Half the Tenure of CEOs Published on February 15, 2017. Marketing leadership turnover continued to soar last year. The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. If you are chief marketing officer and you've held the job for more than four years, you are above average. CMOs have the shortest average tenure in the C-suite at just 4.1 years, according to a new report by organizational advisory firm Korn Ferry. That is about half the average tenure of CEOs, which is eight years. The short lifespan of CMOs is not all bad news. While the position is plagued by high turnover, it's also true that CMOs are in a good spot to be plucked for promotions. "Today's customer-centric CMO role is exceptionally complex and requires the right balance of left as well as right brain skills, and very importantly, a differentiated set of leadership competencies," said Caren Fleit, senior client partner and leader of Korn Ferry's marketing center of expertise. "CMOs with this unique profile are in high demand and are often recruited to lead the next transformation. Also, in some cases, short tenure can be attributed to the organization not being well aligned behind the change that the CMO is tasked with leading." CMOs are also among the youngest executives in the C-suite, with an average age of 52. Only chief information officers are younger, and by just one year, with an average age of 51, according to the report. Marketing leadership turnover continued to soar last year. Recruiting firm Russell Reynolds tracked 177 marketing leadership appointments in the last two quarters of the year, up from 173 in the first half of the year. Total turnover for 2016 was the highest since Russell Reynolds began tracking it four years ago, according to a recent report. Of the CMOs who moved on in the first half of the year, 9% were internally promoted and more than 60% left their company for a new opportunity. One of the CMO's best friends are client-side agency relations directors. But two of the nation's largest marketers are making changes in that role... Coca-Cola Co. is searching for an executive to lead agency relations after the departure of Sarah Armstrong, who since 2006 was the marketer's director for worldwide agency operations. A company spokesman confirmed that she left the company on Feb. 3 and a successor has not yet been named. She left for personal reasons, according to the spokeswoman. Ms. Armstrong was an Ad Age Woman to Watch in 2009. She was known for implementing a "value-based" compensation model in which agencies are paid a guaranteed fee based on the value of each project, with the potential to earn a performance-based bonus. "We want our agencies to earn their profitability, but it's not guaranteed," she said at an industry conference in 2009. "We need them to be profitable and healthy, but they have to earn it through performance." Deb Giampoli Ms. Armstrong's exit follows the departure of another influential agency relations executive. Debra Giampoli, the director of global strategic agency relations for Mondelez International, left the food marketer in December, a spokeswoman recently confirmed. But Mondelez does not plan to replace her. Instead, the company reshuffled its agency relationship responsibilities across the global and regional marketing teams, with global and regional marketing capabilities people handling agency relationships, supporting the brand teams, according to the spokeswoman. On to the courtroom … When is craft beer not craft beer? Apparently when it's a Walmart private label, according to a lawsuit filed Feb. 10 in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati. Plaintiff Matthew Adam takes issue with Walmart 's private-label craft beers, launched last year under the Trouble Brewing brand, including Cats Away IPA. The complaint cites a Brewers Association definition of craft brewers as "small, independent and traditional," brewing fewer than 6 million barrels annually, and owned no more than 25% by a bigger brewer. Walmart's craft beers are brewed by a unit of Genesee Brewing, Rochester, N.Y., maker of Genny Light, which produces well over that limit, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Adams contends the craft designation made him overpay for beer priced at $14 for a 12 pack at Walmart. His class-action suit seeks an injunction preventing Walmart from further merchandising the brews as craft, plus unspecified money damages for himself and others. "We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect," said a Walmart spokesman in an email statement. "While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations." From the Super Bowl files … Mr. Clean can dance in the Super Bowl, but apparently not with the Pine-Sol lady on Valentine's Day. Pine-Sol, a Clorox Co. brand, issued a Twitter challenge during the Super Bowl for a Valentine's Day dance-off pitting longtime pitchwoman Denise Amos against the animated mascot of Mr. Clean, a Procter & Gamble' brand. Mr. Clean didn't show up. "The interesting part about Super Bowl advertising, is that when brands announce their plans ahead of time, it gives the competition some time to strategize," said Sacha Connor, director of marketing for Pine-Sol. "So when we saw that Mr. Clean had a Super Bowl spot and it involved Mr. Clean dancing, we thought we could insert Pine-Sol into that conversation." Pine-Sol #PowerMoves tweet to Mr. Clean Credit: Pine-Sol via Twitter Pine-Sol got more than 226,000 respondents to a Twitter poll in which 86% said Mr. Clean should dance with Ms. Amos. Despite snubbing the invitation, Mr. Clean did OK in social media himself. The brand came in No. 2 (to Bud Light) among Super Bowl advertisers in overall social engagements (such as likes and comments), No. 5 in positive engagements, and No. 1 in terms of both comments and amplification (shares and retweets) through Super Bowl Sunday, according to Origami Logic. Surprisingly given what it deals with, kitty litter has become hotbed of innovation and marketing in recent years. Consider Clorox Co.'s Fresh Step Odor Shield ClumpLock products with Febreze, or Katherine Heigl as a kitty psychologist pitching Oil-Dri Corp.'s Cat's Pride in TV ads last year. Now Church & Dwight Co. aims to do everyone one better with Arm & Hammer Slide, which, according to new ads from Ferrara & Co., Princeton, N.J., just slides right out of the box for easy cleaning -- just like grease through a goose. More on Clorox: Heidi Dorosin, a marketing executive behind Clorox's "Bleachable Moments" advertising, has a new job dealing with bleachable moments of a completely different kind. As new chief marketing officer of Madison Reed, she's working with an up-and-coming direct marketer of at-home hair colorants free of many irritating and controversial chemicals often found in similar products, including ammonia, parabens, resorcinol and phthalates. While the business is mainly online, Madison Reed in December opened its first retail location, a Color Bar in Manhattan. At Clorox Co., where she spent 18 years, Ms. Dorosin, was most recently general manager and VP-marketing of the $1.5 billion namesake business. Catching up on some recent agency wins … Havas New York has had a busy start to the year, winning Mattress Firm's online-only Dream Bed brand and bringing on TBWA veteran Dan Goldstein as chief strategy officer. For Dream Bed, Havas is handling media, creative, data and technology, with the first work expected to be in market by early summer. The brand previously handled its marketing efforts in-house. Mr. Goldstein, who started at the shop earlier this month after spending the last four years working in the startup space, is reporting to Havas New York CEO Laura Maness. Salty snack maker Wise Foods has picked Kastner & Partners, North America, as its lead creative agency. Kastner & Partners said it aims to re-energize the 96-year old snack brand, known for products including Wise potato chips and Cheez Doodles, with work aimed at attracting new, younger consumers. The agency said it will handle creative, partnerships and sponsorships, branded experiences, events, video and content production. Lastly, food marketers should pay attention to this … The myriad phrases on food packaging including best before, best by, expires on, sell by and use by, have baffled consumers for years. Now, two major food industry lobbying groups are working to clear up the confusion by focusing on two phrases. The voluntary plan, announced Wednesday by the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, suggests using either "BEST If Used By" to describe product quality or the more serious "USE By" for any products for which there are food safety concerns or are highly perishable and therefore should be eaten by a certain date or disposed of. The FMI and GMA, which represent food retailers and food, beverage and consumer packaged goods makers, respectively, urged companies to update their phrasing as soon as possible, with a push for widespread adoption by the summer of 2018. The decision to focus on the two phrases may also help cut down on food waste, an issue the industry is trying to tackle. "Eliminating confusion for consumers by using common product date wording is a win-win because it means more products will be used instead of thrown away in error," said Jack Jeffers, VP-quality at Dean Foods, who led GMA's work on this issue. "It's much better that these products stay in the kitchen – and out of landfills." The plan was supported by a mix of companies, including the country's largest food seller. "Research shows that the multitude of date labels that appear on foods today are a source of confusion for many consumers," said Frank Yiannas, VP-food safety & health at Walmart.

Around 11:30pm Tuesday, Goldsboro Police received a tip from an employee at a bail bonds company that Edwin Luis Ortiz Jr. had multiple outstanding warrants and was inside a truck in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on US 70 West. Police were told the 30 year-old man was possibly in the possession of stolen guns and that he had threatened employees at the bail bonds agency. Police and Wayne County deputies approached Ortiz and discovered he was asleep in the truck. When Ortiz woke up, he locked the doors to the truck, started the ignition and refused to comply with commands to exit the vehicle. Ortiz also shook his head, police said, indicating he was not complying.  At the same time he was reaching around inside the truck. Without warning, he crashed the stolen truck into two unoccupied police cruisers. Ortiz was taken into custody. He was transported to Wayne Memorial Hospital for a laceration he sustained during his removal from the truck. After being released from the hospital Wednesday morning he was served with outstanding warrants from Duplin County for felony breaking and entering, larceny, and possession of stolen goods. He was also served with an outstanding Wayne County warrant for probation violation. He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon against a government officials, resist delay and obstruct, possession of a stolen vehicle, and reckless driving.  The truck he was operating had been reportedly stolen last Thursday in Wayne County. He received a total bond of $180,000.

The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Wal-Mart says Madison Heights, Michigan-based Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay based in Michigan. Wal-Mart, which is trying to better compete with online leader Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce player with strong industry relationships. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart also purchased online marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Time Ashley Ayers looks at clothes Nov. 16, 2016, with her service dog in a Moosejaw store in the Detroit suburb of Rochester Hills, Mich. (Photo: Rachel Woolf, Detroit Free Press) 6684 CONNECTTWEET 207 LINKEDIN 42 COMMENTEMAILMORE MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. — Walmart is buying Moosejaw, a company based here that specializes in outdoor recreation apparel and gear, in a bid to strengthen the global retail juggernaut's online offerings for $51 million in cash, the companies announced Wednesday. Walmart (WMT) said it will continue to operate the website and 10 stores for Moosejaw, known for its quirky, cutting-edge marketing, as a standalone site and separate retail outlets. Employees will remain in Michigan. "From the customer's perspective, they really won't see much change in Moosejaw.com or our stores," said Eoin Comerford, Moosejaw's chief executive officer. "We are going to continue to be an outdoor specialty retailer of premium brands. "You are going to have the same Moosejaw voice and the same Moosejaw madness is going to be very prevalent," he said. ► Related: Walmart sued for allegedly selling craft beer that isn't craft beer What will change: The company intends to amplify its marketing, he said. Still, balancing what will be different, so the two companies can benefit from the deal, and what will remain the same, so that the acquisition does not harm the Moosejaw brand or erode its customer base, is the central challenge that the both companies will wrestle with going forward. “Moosejaw is considered to be a pioneer, early adapter of social marketing. ... It has to totally be related to expertise, the culture approach to social commerce.”Ken Nisch, JGA consulting Over the long term, Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., hopes to leverage the privately held Michigan retailer's online sales knowledge and marketing of apparel and accessories and aims to open opportunities for Moosejaw suppliers to expand their reach on Walmart sites. But the company does not plan to sell Moosejaw-branded merchandise in Wal-Mart stores. "You won't go into Walmart and see Moosejaw T-shirts," Comerford said. "The customers are quite different." Walmart purchased Moosejaw from private equity partners Parallel Investment Partners and W Capital Partners. Walmart, which has more than 11,000 stores, has been focusing on growing online sales, which has included a buying spree of online outlets in the past year to boost its e-commerce portfolio and compete with retailers such as Amazon. Walmart, whose stock was down 14 cents to $68.53 at about 2 p.m. ET, is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. Last year, Walmart bought Jet, a Hoboken, N.J., start-up, which seeks to offer online shoppers items that few retailers offer, for about $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Walmart shares. Walmart said the two company websites — Walmart.com and Jet.com — would operate as separate brands but would leverage technology and talent. Jet offered more urban and millennial customers. ► Related: Walmart sued for firing of employee with Down syndrome In January, Walmart announced it also was acquiring ShoeBuy.com for $70 million, a move aimed at enhancing its footwear sales. The same month, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon highlighted a new e-commerce strategy for the company that is built around a retail future in which customers are ordering products from mobile devices and expect to have it delivered or pick up the same day, or in a few hours or minutes. “You won't go into Walmart and see Moosejaw T-shirts. The customers are quite different.”Eoin Comerford, Moosejaw "It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes — and in some areas even lead the way — or they’ll fall behind and disappear," he said at the time. Comerford's new duties include overseeing Walmart's outdoor e-commerce, including what it sells on Walmart.com and Jet.com. Chairman Ken Nisch of JGA, a Southfield, Mich., consulting firm —estimated that 80% to 85% of Moosejaw's sales are online. "Moosejaw is considered to be a pioneer, early adapter of social marketing," he said. "It's not a huge company, which makes it interesting from Walmart's standpoint. "They are not doing it for incremental sales. It has to totally be related to expertise, the culture approach to social commerce," Nisch said. "The addition of Moosejaw's sales to Walmart is not even a pinprick." Moreover, demographics of the two retailers' customers are quite different: Walmart customers tend to be more working-class mainstream while Moosejaw's are more affluent and tend to be younger. As a general comparison, he said Walmart's shoppers are hunters while Moosejaw's are hikers. ► Related: Walmart layoffs just the latest cuts in retail industry Founded in 1992 by long-time friends Robert Wolfe and David Jaffe, Moosejaw now has about 350 employees. Wolfe was a University of Michigan graduate, and Jaff, a University of Wisconsin grad. The duo originally planned to become wilderness guides and take people on camping trips, but instead they decided that more money could be made in selling camping equipment so they opened Moosejaw Mountaineering and Backcountry Travel in Keego Harbor, Mich., near Pontiac. At the time they started the company, Wolfe was just 21, and his retail experience was mostly hawking T-shirts at University of Michigan football and basketball games. ► Related: Walmart stops selling Black Lives Matter 'bulletproof' shirts after police complaint In their first year, the business exceeded their expectations. But by 2007,  the founders had sold their interest in the company to private equity firms. Yet even after its founders exited, Moosejaw held on to the fun-loving culture that touted its stores as places to get dating advice and play hand games such as rock-paper-scissors. It did not change the tongue-and-cheek self-description on its website, which called the company "the greatest place in the world to work, according to the owner's mom." ► Related: Walmart program: Stash cash in savings account, win prizes It also kept offering its zany promotions, known as Moosejaw Madness, that, among other edgy concepts had included a digital mobile app that let customers see what Moosejaw catalog models were wearing under their clothes when they hovered over the images, and a "break-up service" for couples too timid to end their own relationships. In 2012, Moosejaw opened a temporary retail outlet in downtown Detroit about 15 miles from company headquarters for the Christmas shopping season. But, whether Moosejaw ultimately will be able to maintain its distinctive voice and culture under Walmart is unclear. The goal is to take what we can from Walmart, and use it to amplify Moosejaw, Comerford said, "but not have it become a mini Walmart."

The desire to pay slightly more in exchange for beer that doesn’t taste like it was watered down with the bitter tears of Adolph Coors’ ghost is responsible for the craft beer market growing by double digits for eight of the last 10 years, accounting for more than a tenth of total U.S. beer sales beginning in 2015. So it’s understandable that other companies might want to get into such a seemingly lucrative market. Unfortunately, it requires actually brewing craft beer, not just slapping a new label on your shitty mass-produced beer and jacking up the price. But such nuances are apparently beyond the ken of Walmart (new tagline: “Walmart—we figured out how to make lettuce give you diabetes!”), as USA Today reports the retail chain is being sued for selling fake craft beer in an effort to get consumers to pay more for the product. Walmart announced last year that it had begun selling its own line of craft beers, claiming it was ”working in ‘collaboration’ with Trouble Brewing to brew four styles of craft beer.” Which would be a smart business move, except for the part where “Trouble Brewing” doesn’t actually exist. According to government filings, the beer is made by WX Brands from a location in Costa Rica, where a company named “Genesee Brewing” makes beer identified as “cheap college-party staples.” USA Today, throwing the kind of shade normally reserved for drag competitions, notes one taste-tester for Walmart’s phony craft beer described the flavor as “good for flip cup.” According to the lawsuit, the bullshit “Trouble Brewing” beer doesn’t meet any of the criteria for craft beer, let alone explain why you’re paying more for anything Walmart makes, since that kind of flies in the face of the retail giant’s whole raison d’etre. For example, to qualify, it would need to be more 25 percent owned by a craft brewer and making fewer than 6 million barrels of beer a year, both of which are conditions Walmart reportedly fails with flying colors. The lawsuit is seeking compensatory damages for anyone who shelled out dough for Trouble Brewing—however, it should really also include payments for anyone who was forced to listen to a craft beer snob at a party talking about how the hops he uses are treated with vanilla and jasmine or whatever. That’s not specific to Trouble Brewing, of course, but it is super annoying. Submit your Newswire tips here.

(Albany County Jail) Thomas Smith. (Albany County Jail) Thomas Smith, known for being fired, gets 15 years in bank robberies 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Albany A parolee who previously made headlines when he was fired by Walmart was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in state prison for bank robbery, District Attorney David Soares' office said. Thomas T. Smith, 53, pleaded guilty Dec. 14 to one count of robbery, an armed violent felony. Albany County Supreme Court Judge Thomas A. Breslin also sentenced Smith to five years of post-release supervision. In September, Smith was arrested after an Albany police detective fired a round into the window of his vehicle in a neighborhood near the Port of Albany. Then-Police Chief Brendan Cox said the detective reported Smith's car was backing toward him when he opened fire. No one was injured. At the time, Smith was on parole for a 2002 robbery of a KeyBank branch in Latham. He had served more than 13 years of a 15-year sentence. In 2015, Smith was part of a protracted battle with Walmart officials after he was fired for redeeming a few dollars in empty cans left unclaimed outside the East Greenbush store. Smith said he was never told he could not take unclaimed cans, but Walmart officials contended it was theft. Alice Green, executive director of the Center for Law and Justice, and labor leaders organized demonstrations on Smith's behalf at Walmart to protest his firing, which went viral on social media and made national headlines. Smith's guilty plea satisfied charges in four bank robberies from July through September in Albany: July 29: Smith, disguised in a wig, handed tellers at the First Niagara Bank, 120 State St., a note demanding money. He was pointing his hand in a pocket, insinuating that he had a weapon, and escaped with $1,500. A discarded disguise was found near the bank. Aug. 19: Smith, wearing a hat and sunglasses, demanded money at the Citizens Bank, 111 Washington Ave. He threatened tellers that he had a gun and escaped with $1,300. Sept. 1: Smith demanded money from tellers at the First Niagara Bank, 899 Western Ave., and slapped one teller in the face. Smith escaped with $3,420. Sept. 12: Smith, wearing a construction worker hat, handed tellers at the First Niagara Bank, 120 State St., a note demanding money. He escaped with $1,500 and a discarded construction helmet was found nearby.

Moosejaw sells popular outdoors gear, apparel and merchandise from brands like Patagonia and North Face at its 10 physical stores. Walmart's real interest here, though, would appear to be online. Moosejaw is an established e-commerce player in apparel and accessories. Walmart said that Moosejaw's CEO and more than 350 employees will continue to operate out of Michigan, where they'll keep on overseeing their site and physical stores as "a standalone and complementary brand" in Walmart's growing e-commerce portfolio.

Moosejaw sells outdoor related items, including winter jackets, clothing, footwear, backpacking, climbing and general fitness apparel through its 10 physical stores in the state of Michigan and the Midwest, as well as through its online website. Coincidence or not, Wal-Mart's acquisition comes at a time when its largest rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) appears to be preparing for a major push of its own into the clothing and apparel market. As part of Wal-Mart's acquisition, Moosejaw will continue operating its website and stores and will be run as a standalone entity. The acquisition is expected to be complementary to Wal-Mart's brand and its other e-commerce sites. Related Link: Wal-Mart Cans Its Two-Day Shipping Charges Wal-Mart also cited the strong apparel and accessories category which is, in fact, the one category for digital commerce. As such, the acquisition gives the retailer the experience of a well-established e-commerce player that has intimate knowledge of the active outdoor category. In addition, Moosejaw's suppliers will be given the option of expanding their consumer reach through Wal-Mart's other e-commerce sites, including the recently acquired property Jet.com.

The world's largest retailer said Wednesday that its online division spent roughly $51 million to acquire Moosejaw, a web retailer that specializes in outdoor apparel and goods. Moosejaw's "strong heritage" in the outdoor space and its relationships with more than 400 "cherished" brands, make it a good addition to Wal-Mart's portfolio, spokesman Ravi Jariwala told CNBC. Those brands include Patagonia and The North Face, whose merchandise Wal-Mart currently does not sell. However, Moosejaw suppliers that are interested in selling their products on Wal-Mart's other websites (including Walmart.com) will have the option to do so, Jariwala said. Wal-Mart shares were trading slightly lower, near $68.49, Wednesday morning. The company has added several tools to its online arsenal since late 2016. It started with the $3 billion purchase of Jet.com in August, which brought in Jet Chief Marc Lore and led to a reshuffling of Wal-Mart's digital team. Then, in late December, Jet acquired the online footwear retailer ShoeBuy for roughly $70 million. Jariwala said Wal-Mart will both continue looking for acquisition opportunities and push for organic growth. Last month, the company scrapped its subscription ShippingPass program in favor of free two-day shipping when shoppers spend $35. "The strategy is to grow [e-commerce]," Jariwala said. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 20.6 percent in the third quarter, marking an acceleration from the prior three-month period. Wal-Mart is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Share story By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO The Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart has acquired the outdoor clothing and gear seller Moosejaw for $51 million as it expands its online offerings. The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Wal-Mart says Madison Heights, Michigan-based Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay based in Michigan. Wal-Mart, which is trying to better compete with online leader Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce player with strong industry relationships. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart also purchased online marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week.

Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 Walmart tends to do better when it comes to essentials, while Amazon has a greater selection. (Photo: Walmart) 13975 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE (NEWSER) – Sensing the way the beer winds were blowing, Walmart started selling its own line of craft beers early last year, the Washington Post reports. Now the retail giant is being accused of selling fake craft beers in order to trick customers into paying more in a lawsuit that calls Walmart's craft beers "wholesale fiction." Walmart says it's working in "collaboration" with Trouble Brewing to brew four styles of craft beer. But here's the catch: There's no such US brewery. Government filings say the beer is actually made by WX Brands, and the address listed is for Genesee Brewing, which is based in Costa Rica and makes "cheap college-party staples." So it's little surprise one taste-tester describes Walmart's Red Flag Amber as "good for flip cup." The four Trouble Brewing craft beers are stocked at more than 3,000 Walmarts in 45 states, where Consumerist reports they're placed on shelves with other craft beers. But the lawsuit alleges the beers—whose packaging gives no evidence Walmart has anything to do with them—don't meet any of the standards for craft beers listed by the Brewers Association, according to Courthouse News. Those standards include being less than 25% owned by a non-craft brewer and making fewer than 6 million barrels of beer per year. An attorney believes WX Brands/Genesee Brewing makes 6 million barrels of beer for Walmart's Trouble Brewing brand alone. The lawsuit, filed in Ohio, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for anyone in the state who's purchased a Trouble Brewing beer.

By Pete Born on February 15, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk from WWD issue 02/16/2017 Download PDF Drew Barrymore Joshua Scott Drew Barrymore’s Flower Beauty had a growth spurt this week when it launched an e-commerce operation on Valentine’s Day and rolled out distribution to Mexico, its first foreign expansion outside the U.S. Founded by Barrymore and product developer Maesa Inc., the company has distributed solely through Wal-Mart Stores Inc., building up a door count of 2,000. The idea is to make the brand accessible to consumers living too distant from those stores which carry Flower merchandise. But also it is greatly extending its reach south of the border with the addition of 300 Wal-Mart doors in Mexico, according to David Hutchinson, senior vice president of Maesa. This story first appeared in the February 16, 2017 issue of WWD.  Subscribe Today. “We’ve been eager to be in that country and in that marketplace,” said Barrymore, who is Flower’s creative director and founder. “We will be there sometime in March,” she noted, alluding to plans for a launch event in Mexico City. Barrymore added that she has had the multicultural customer in mind since launching the brand. “That is the woman that we’ve been conceiving shades and colors for and have had such inclusive love for since Day One at Flower Beauty. Now that we’ve gotten on our feet and we are in our fifth and most successful year [industry sources project retail sales of $30 million this year], we want to broaden out and really go after that woman, because she’s been there for us since the beginning. That is a customer and girl and woman we have really crafted and created our line toward,” she said, adding that this effort has manifested itself in skin tones of lips and cheeks and in the marketing. “Now we want to go out there and show it to her.” Barrymore describes her beauty brand as “affordable luxury at mass.” Price points range from $6.98 — for an eyeliner, mascara or concealer — to $17 for a travel brush set. Barrymore hinted there will be other market expansions. “We have a few actually that are possibly sooner than later,” she said, mentioning Australia as a possibility. She also made an exploratory trip to South Korea and returned with some usable ideas. “I really loved the brightening aspect of their makeup. As a woman who gets a little sun damage throughout the year, I found that using their foundation actually evened out my skin without makeup, and that to me is something I would really love to bring over.” She also appeared to have become a believer in Korea’s three-step masks. “For those of us who don’t have time to go to the facialist — ever — it’s something you can do at home for 30 minutes.” She acknowledged that Flower is “talking about masks for Flower.” The company also has been building its assortment. “We have already had great success in palettes that we have launched in January this year,” said Hutchinson, referring to eye shadow, contouring and strobing palettes, as part of an addition of 13 items. Last fall, a Flower Sunshine eau de parfum was launched, with price points of $19.97 for one oz. and $8.98 for an 8-oz. mist. The brand now consists of 180 stockkeeping units, Hutchinson said, and another 40 to 60 items will be added in the second half. The products will populate the main color cosmetics categories — lip, eye and face. “It’s always my goal to explore skin care,” Barrymore said. “But we really wanted to get our color cosmetics game in the right place. Slow and steady wins the race. “With skin care you really have to have a point of difference and a point of view,” she added. The launch of the e-commerce platform was driven by a number of promotions, such as a free makeup clutch with orders of $40 or more and free shipping for those over $30. There will also be a special offer of a free lipstick for the first 100 orders on the web site, along with a targeted Facebook advertising campaign — not to mention the power of Barrymore’s Instagram account, with its six million followers. The company has created a Flower Pots Powder Brush in Deep Peony as an exclusive shade on the site. Looking ahead, Barrymore will be doing text-based and video tutorials offering makeup tips. The company also will develop exclusive limited-edition color products to sell later this year. Hutchinson said the overarching ambition for the e-commerce operation is to turn the web site into a destination and “to develop long-term relationships with fans of the brand.” Barrymore observed, “this is the way people shop, whether to replenish or explore. We are taking power into our own hands,” she added, noting Flower will be able to merchandise a larger shade range than is permitted in-store. One of the unusual aspects of the brand is that a celebrity targeted the Wal-Mart shopper, instead of the usual luxury or fashion customer. The point is especially poignant in such a highly charged political year, focusing on the needs of the middle class. Recalling the places she has lived and worked, Barrymore said, “I always had a sense of the collective vastness of our country. That’s as true to me now as it ever has been.” You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

Wal-Mart said it will continue to operate the Moosejaw website as a standalone site and  its10 stores as separate retail outlets. Its 350 employees will remain in Michigan. Related: Why you'll love Woodward's newest retail spot Ikea starts wedding, birthday registry "From the customer's perspective, they really won't see much change in Moosejaw.com or our stores," Eoin Comerford, Moosejaw's CEO, told the Free Press. "We are going to continue to be an outdoor specialty retailer of premium brands. You are going to have the same Moosejaw voice and the same Moosejaw Madness is going to be very prevalent." What will change, Comerford said, is that the company intends to "amplify our marketing presence." Still, balancing what will be different, so that the two companies can benefit from the deal, and what will remain the same, so that the acquisition does not harm the Moosejaw brand or erode its customer base, is the central challenge that the both companies will be wrestling with going forward. Over the long term, Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., hopes to leverage the privately held Michigan retailer's online sales knowledge and marketing of apparel and accessories and  open opportunities for Moosejaw suppliers to expand their reach on Wal-Mart sites. But, the company does not plan to sell Moosejaw-branded merchandise in Wal-Mart stores. "You won't go into Wal-Mart and see Moosejaw T-shirts," Comerford said. "The customers are quite different." Wal-Mart purchased Moosejaw from private equity partners Parallel Investment Partners and W Capital Partners.

It is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. Last year, Wal-Mart bought Jet, a Hoboken, N.J., start-up, that seeks to offer online shoppers items that few retailers offer for about $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart said the two company websites — Walmart.com and Jet.com — would operate as separate brands, but would leverage technology and talent. Jet offered more urban and millennial customers. In January, Wal-Mart announced it also was acquiring ShoeBuy.com for $70 million, a move aimed at enhancing its footwear sales. The same month, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon highlighted a new e-commerce strategy for the company that is built around a vision of a retail future in which customers order products from mobile devices and expect to have it delivered or pick up the same day, or in a few hours or minutes. "It’s up to retailers to adapt to these changes — and in some areas even lead the way — or they’ll fall behind and disappear," he said at the time. Comerford's new duties include overseeing Wal-Mart's outdoor e-commerce, including what it sells on Walmart.com and Jet.com. Ken Nisch — chairman of JGA, a Southfield consulting firm — estimated that 80% to 85% of Moosjaw's sales are online. "Moosejaw is considered to be a pioneer, early adapter of social marketing," he said. "It's not a huge company, which makes it interesting from Wal-Mart's standpoint. They are not doing it for incremental sales. It has to totally be related to expertise, the culture approach to social commerce. The addition of Moosejaw's sales to Wal-Mart is not even a pinprick." Moreover, he added, the demographics of the customers of the two retailers are quite different: Wal-Mart customers tend to be more working-class mainstream while Moosejaw's are more affluent and tend to be younger. As a general comparison, he said, Wal-Mart's shoppers are hunters, while Moosejaw's are hikers.

Wolfe was a University of Michigan graduate, and Jaff, a University of Wisconsin grad. The duo originally planned to become wilderness guides and take people on camping trips, but instead, they decided that there was more money to be made in selling camping equipment so they opened Moosejaw Mountaineering and Backcountry Travel in Keego Harbor. At the time they started the company, Wolfe was just 21, and his retail experience was mostly hawking T-shirts at U-M football and basketball games. In their first year, the business exceeded their expectations. By 2007, however, the founders had sold their interest in the company to private equity. But even after its founders exited, Moosejaw held on to the fun-loving culture that touted its stores as places to get dating advice and play hand games such as rock-paper-scissors. It did not change the tongue-and-cheek self-description on its website, which called the company "the greatest place in the world to work according to the owner's mom." It also kept offering its zany promotions, known as Moosejaw Madness, that, among other edgy concepts, had included a digital mobile app that let customers see what Moosejaw catalog models were wearing under their clothes when they hovered over the images, and a break-up service for couples too timid to end their own relationships. In 2012, Moosejaw opened a temporary retail outlet in downtown Detroit for the Christmas shopping season. But, whether Moosejaw ultimately will be able to maintain its distinctive voice and culture under Wal-Mart is unclear. The goal, Comerford said, is to take what we can from Wal-Mart, and use it to amplify Moosejaw, "but not have it become a mini Wal-Mart."

Walmart trains personal shoppers to choose items for customers. It's part of the company's plans to offer the service nationwide. (Walmart) Print Email Charley Hannagan | channagan@syracuse.com By Charley Hannagan | channagan@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 15, 2017 at 8:24 AM comments Camillus, N.Y. -- The Walmart in Camillus could be the company's first store in New York state to offer online grocery ordering with pickup at the store. The Camillus Planning Board Monday approved Walmart's request to build a canopy with a dedicated grocery pickup spot on the west side of its store at 5399 W. Genesee St.  The changes will accommodate customers who order their groceries online and then come to the store at a designated time to pick them up. None of the 116 Walmart stores in New York currently offer the service, the company said in an email Tuesday. The company did not say when the service will begin in Camillus. The Camillus store's expansion into online grocery pickup is part of Walmart's plans to offer the service at stores nationwide.The company began offering the service in select markets in 2016. Here's how it works. Using either the Walmart app or going to the company's website at Walmart.com/grocery, customers choose from 30,000 items, pay for the order and set a time to pick it up. The minimum order is $30. Trained personal shoppers go through the aisles choosing produce, meat and other groceries to fill the order. The items are kept cool or frozen until the customer arrives. The customer arrives at the store, parks in a designated spot and calls a special phone number. Store associates then come out and load the order into the customer's car. Same-day pickup is available. Orders placed by 1 a.m. will be available for pickup from 8 a.m. and orders placed by 10 a.m. will be available from 4 p.m. Customers can also schedule grocery pickups up to three weeks in advance. Walmart representatives told Camillus planning board members that they expect the free service to be used by 10 to 12 customers a day over a 12-hour period. Walmart has long sold non-grocery items online and ordering groceries online for delivery or pickup is not a new concept. Walmart faces competition in the online grocery segment from Amazon and Google. Wegman's offers an online service for $5.95 per order at its Pittsford store and six stores in New Jersey. Walmart's service will be free, unlike similar services offered by competitors. Walmart executives say they expect the service will be used by parents with small children who may not have the time to trudge through a grocery store with toddlers in tow. Senior citizens or the disabled are also potential customers, they said. Walmart's grocery sales represented 56 percent of its overall sales for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2016, according to the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The market for online grocery ordering is small. Researchers told The Washington Post that ecommerce represents 2 percent or less of grocery sales overall. That might not be true for too much longer. In January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it will test a pilot program this summer that will allow seven online grocery providers, including Amazon, to accept food stamps. Amazon, FreshDirect, Hart's Local Grocers based in Rochester, and Dash's Market based in Buffalo will pilot the service in New York state. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, provides 43 million people with food assistance, the USDA said.  CBS Moneywatch estimated the SNAP program represents $66.6 billion in annual benefits. It represents a big increase for grocery ecommerce if even a fraction of SNAP participants move to online ordering. As with the core program, SNAP participants will only be able to use their benefits to purchase eligible items online - not to pay for service or delivery charges.

The megaretailer still has key advantages, but e-commerce creates a major risk. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 15, 2017 at 8:18AM Retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has long enjoyed a significant competitive advantage thanks to its massive scale. Wal-Mart is able to get the best prices from its suppliers and pass those savings onto its customers, making it next to impossible for traditional retailers to compete on price. But the continued rise of e-commerce has changed the equation, putting Wal-Mart in a position where it's playing catch-up with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart has gotten far more serious about e-commerce in recent years, acquiring Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3 billion, rolling out an online grocery pick-up and delivery service, and just recently launching free two-day shipping in an effort to undercut Amazon Prime. But it remains well behind the e-commerce leader. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's U.S. store business is still performing well, producing a long streak of positive comparable-sales growth thanks in part to initiatives like higher wages and better training for employees. But that business will no doubt begin to feel pressure as online sales grow as a percentage of total retail sales. Profits have taken a dive as Wal-Mart invests in e-commerce and in-store initiatives, and an earnings recovery will require these investments to pay off in the long run. With the retail business changing rapidly, is Wal-Mart stock a safe bet? And what about the dividend? With slumping profits, is the quarterly payout at risk? A solid dividend Wal-Mart has not historically been a great dividend stock, in part because the stock price was soaring right along with the dividend prior to 2000. The yield was consistently below 1% until the mid-2000s, when the stock price began to stagnate. The yield has steadily risen since then, currently sitting right around 3%. WMT Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning that it has raised its dividend annually for at least 25 years. In Wal-Mart's case, the dividend has been increased annually since the very first payment in 1974. This long track record doesn't guarantee that the dividend will continue to increase going forward, but it shows that the company has been disciplined over the years in regards to capital allocation. Wal-Mart's current quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, with a total annual payout of $2 per share. Based on its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2017, results for which the company will report on Feb. 21, the payout ratio is currently around 47%. This gives Wal-Mart some breathing room, even though earnings will be down compared to previous years. Wal-Mart's dividend growth will likely be slow as the company diverts its resources to building out its e-commerce business. But I suspect that it will remain a dividend aristocrat for the foreseeable future. Elevated risks The risk of future profit declines is certainly higher today than it was before the company needed to care very much about e-commerce. Not only is there the threat of declining in-store sales as consumers shift online, but Wal-Mart is competing in e-commerce against a company that has been operating with razor-thin margins, and sometimes no margins at all, since its founding. Amazon generates lower margins than Wal-Mart, but Amazon also spends prodigiously on everything from content for its streaming service to a $1.5 billion air hub to help shuttle around merchandise. Wal-Mart will almost certainly be more focused and disciplined with its e-commerce investments, which should help keep the bottom line intact. The worst-case scenario for Wal-Mart would be a failure to grow e-commerce sales rapidly despite its major investments coupled with declining in-store sales. That scenario would almost certainly lead to earnings stagnation or decline, eventually putting the dividend at risk. The best-case scenario, strong e-commerce sales growth and solid store performance, would eventually lead to earnings growth. Wal-Mart stock trades for around 16 times the company's guidance for full-year adjusted earnings. That's not bargain territory, but it does represent a discount to the overall market. Any company going through a major transition is inherently risky, but it looks like the steps Wal-Mart is taking are the right ones. Wal-Mart stock comes with risks, but not nearly as many as most other retailers. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.

"Discussions are underway with Walmart about a shipping operation contract," said Yoo Chang-keun, CEO of HMM. The company has become the largest Korean shipper after the exit of previous business bellwether Hanjin. Yoo also denied the recent news reports that Walmart has severed all its contracts with Korean carriers after the downfall of Hanjin Shipping, which caused substantial financial damages to the U.S. retail giant. Walmart also told The Korea Times that recent news articles are "not legitimate." "The rumors and recent reports of Walmart refusing to do business with Korean shipping carriers are simply untrue," Walmart Global Corporate Affairs Communication Director Marilee McInnis said. "While we are no longer doing business with Hanjin Shipping because of their recent bankruptcy, we are currently speaking to another Korean carrier regarding our shipping needs." She did not mention who specifically Walmart is communicating with, but HMM said that it is in discussions with the former Hanjin Shipping's consignor. "It is still at the discussion level. So, I can't say anything further about the discussions between the two parties," an HMM official said. "We are the only shipping company who is capable of swiftly replacing Hanjin Shipping's operation for Walmart's huge freight volume in the region." Walmart, which has been one of Hanjin Shipping's major consignors for more than 20 years since the 1990s, is believed to have been hit hard by the ailing shipping company filing for court receivership. Hanjin had reportedly handled about 10 percent of Walmart's total freight volume every year, which means that the Seoul-based company's amount was up to 30,000 containers. The annual shipping fee mounted to nearly 40 billion won ($35 million). "Earlier this week, HMM's credit rating was upgraded from D to BB as the market recognized the government and creditors' strong support for the company. I believe the credit adjustment played an important role behind Walmart's decision to choose HMM as a bidder for the service," the official said. Sources claimed Monday that Walmart sent an email to Hanjin Shipping's local unit in the United States in December, saying, "Thank you for doing business with us. It is our company's policy not to deal with any Korean shipping line from now on. It is not because of Hanjin Shipping but because we don't trust the Korean government." Walmart's denial of the allegations is considered to be a positive sign for Korean carriers, but experts suggested the possibility that such rumors were intentionally spread by foreign competitors of HMM. "It is possible they spread such stories within the industry in order to gain the upper hand in contract negotiations between a consignor and a carrier," he said. jhoo@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter North Korean leader's half-brother killed by 'poison needles' in Malaysia Animal rights activists demand dolphin import ban One assassination suspect detained in Malaysia; 'several' others on the run Who killed N.

Buffett ditches supermarket for $900m Simon English Wednesday 15 February 2017 12:18 GMT Click to follow The Evening Standard Warren Buffett has bailed out of Asda-owner Walmart The most successful investor in the world has ditched nearly all of his shares in Walmart and upped his bet on Apple. Warren Buffett has just sold  $900 million (£720 million) worth of Walmart, the owner of Asda in the UK, and pumped the money into the iPhones maker and airlines stocks. The switch will be noted with concern in retail circles given Buffett’s influence and track record, with some seeing the move as an admission Amazon cannot be stopped. Buffett, the third-richest man in the world, famously bought Tesco back in 2006, at one point having a 5% stake in the supermarket. He later admitted this had been a “huge mistake” and sold the £1.5 billion holding at a big loss. Regulatory filings in the US show his Berkshire Hathaway holding company quadrupled its stake in Apple from 15.2 million shares to  57.4 million. That stake is worth towards $8 billion, with Apple shares at record highs. Amazon’s market value is  $356 billion, compared with Walmart’s $298 billion. Last year, Buffett acknowledged traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were struggling in the face of competition from the e-commerce giant. “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,” Buffett said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in 2016. The so-called Sage of Omaha is the subject of an HBO documentary about his life called Becoming Warren Buffett. “I like numbers,” he tells the film-makers.

/PRNewswire/ -- Amid announcements and changes in the leadership of its online component, Walmart will be hosting its Supplier Growth Summit on Feb. 15-16 in Rogers. Eric Howerton, CEO of local digital marketing agency WhyteSpyder, knows that the agenda will likely include Walmart's push for better online integration and improved manufacturer-provided web content for every product they sell. The way Howerton puts it, "You're no longer going to buy an item at a Walmart store or Walmart.com, you're just buying at Walmart." Continue Reading Amid announcements and changes in the leadership of its online component, Walmart will be hosting its Supplier Growth Summit on Feb. 15-16 in Rogers. Eric Howerton, CEO of local digital marketing agency WhyteSpyder, knows that the agenda will likely include Walmart's push for better online integration and improved manufacturer-provided web content for every product they sell. Please visit http://www.whytespyder.com/stream/ to see our lifestream Friday Feb. 17, 2017. Please visit http://www.whytespyder.com/stream/ to see our lifestream Friday Feb. 17, 2017. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon calls this integration between site and store an "omnichannel plan," that aims to give shoppers a "seamless shopping experience… to save them time and money." To execute this, McMillon is asking manufacturers to supply unique content for each item they sell at Walmart. "We're no longer in brand storytelling," according to Howerton, "We're in item storytelling." Research has shown that more than 80% of U.S. consumers conduct online research before making purchases, and a similar percentage uses mobile phones or other devices to make their purchasing decisions. Howerton points out, however, that nearly 90% of retail sales still take place at the brick-and-mortar level, in stores. Howerton attributes new developments in in-store technology, like virtual or augmented reality, to the narrowing divide between in-store and online shopping. Brands that produce content for each of their items across all channels consumers use will maintain an edge against competitors and see increased sales. "Whoever figures out the data and content… will win this omnichannel race," Howerton said. On Feb. 17 and Feb. 20 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., WhyteSpyder will be hosting a Q&A livestream to answer any questions suppliers may have following the Walmart summit meeting. Eric Howerton and WhyteSpyder Sr. Director of Account Services Joyce Grippi will field questions from their Fayetteville studio regarding ecommerce, omnichannel marketing, item-level storytelling, and the future of retail.

Graham  BAY CITY, MI -- The day before her trial was to begin, a 56-year-old Bay City woman accused of crashing into a little girl in a Walmart parking lot then driving away has accepted a plea deal. Elicia E. Graham on Monday, Feb. 13, appeared before Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran and pleaded no contest to one count of attempted assault with a dangerous weapon. The charge is a two-year high court misdemeanor. In exchange for her plea, the prosecution agreed to dismiss single counts of operating a motor vehicle while license suspended, revoked or denied causing injury and failure to stop at the scene of a collision resulting in serious impairment or death. Both charges are punishable by up to five years in prison. Girl, 8, testifies car 'disappeared' after striking her at Walmart By pleading no contest, Graham did not verbally admit to having committed a crime. Sheeran had to rely on police reports and court records to enter a conviction on the record. Judge Sheeran is to sentence Graham at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, March 27. Woman charged with 2 felonies in hit-and-run of child Graham's crime occurred the afternoon of Dec. 9, 2015. Andrew Bailor in an April preliminary examination testified he and his 8-year-old daughter Trinity Bailor visited the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township to do some shopping. Bailor was driving his 2005 Lincoln Aviator as he scouted for a parking spot. The Bailors found a spot, but it had a shopping cart in it. Trinity exited the Aviator to move the cart to a nearby corral. Simultaneously, Bailor was backing up his truck. When he put the truck back in drive, he looked forward and saw another vehicle strike his daughter, he testified. The car was traveling east, away from the store, Bailor said. "When I saw it, I had thought she went underneath the car, is what it looked like to me," Bailor said. "It was just so fast." Trinity and the cart she was pushing were struck by the front passenger side of the car, Bailor said. "Initially, (the driver) kept on driving and then she had stopped maybe 40 yards, 50 yards down the travel lane and just kind of sat there momentarily," Bailor said. He said he briefly made his way to the car and may have shouted at it, then quickly turned his attention back to his daughter. He said there were several people gathered and he assumed they were watching the car. He also said he recalled a face in the driver's seat of the car look back at him in a side mirror, though he couldn't tell if the person was male or female. He did not see anyone exit the vehicle, he testified. Trinity Bailor "had a couple of tips of her fingers pulled off by the shopping cart I think. She was bleeding pretty heavily and screaming profusely," her dad testified. Bailor took his daughter to the McLaren Bay Region hospital's emergency room. She was treated for three broken fingers, a broken thumb, two severed fingertips, missing fingernails, and road rash on her back and leg, her dad said. "She was scared more than anything," he said. Trinity had her fingertips sewn back on, Bailor said. Trinity testified she remembered being with her dad at Walmart and that she left their truck to move a shopping cart from a parking space. "I was trying to put it the cart corral," she said. "I was going to stop and look both ways. The car just hit the cart and it flung, like, to the right. I think it fell on top of me or something. I got hurt real bad. I was like shaking and could barely stand." She said she fell to the ground and the car kept going. "It just disappeared," she said. She described the car as a blur before it hit her. She said she did not see who was driving it. Michigan State Police reviewed Walmart's surveillance camera footage, which captured the collision. With help from the store's Loss Prevention officers, troopers identified Graham as the offending driver, as she had made a debit card purchase just before the incident.  Mike Ilitch Public visitation for Mike Ilitch at Fox Theatre Wednesday Little Caesars Pizza founder, sportsman Mike Ilitch dies at 87 Fans leave messages for 'king of Detroit' outside Comerica Park Justin Verlander: 'He changed my life dramatically' Complete coverage » Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

The billionaire sold off $900 million of Walmart stock cutting his share by 89.26 percent, according to GuruFocas that tracks the buying and selling of stocks. Buffett also sold all but 0.01 percent of the US telecom firm Verizon. Read more Warren Buffett biggest loser in Wells Fargo debacle The move reportedly leaves America's biggest retailer playing catch-up with e-commerce rivals such as Amazon, whose market value is now $356 billion against Walmart’s $298 billion. Walmart shares have declined 21 percent, compared with an 119 percent surge in Amazon since the end of 2014. Since it started to invest billions in e-commerce, Walmart has only managed to obtain a tiny share of the market compared with Amazon. Its online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. Though, Walmart’s overall sales are still four times bigger than Amazon's revenue. Last year, Buffett acknowledged the competition between brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers is extremely high with the latter likely to win the battle. “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people, and it will disrupt more,” Buffett said at his annual shareholders' meeting as quoted by Bloomberg. Berkshire Hathaway became one of the most active purchasers in last year's fourth quarter. Buffett’s conglomerate almost quadrupled its stake in Apple and increased holdings sevenfold in the four biggest US airlines.

The new stake makes Berkshire one of Apple's ten largest investors. Buffett’s company also invested $2.1 billion in each of the four biggest US carriers: American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings.

Amazon's market value is now $356 billion, compared with Walmart's $298 billion. Buffett last year acknowledged that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were struggling in the face of competition from the e-commerce giant.  "It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more," Buffett said at his annual shareholders' meeting in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Buffett's been paring his stake in Walmart since then. He first bought shares in the retailer back in 2005. He also noted that Amazon's competitors, "including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it." Since the end of 2014, Walmart shares have fallen 21% compared with a 119% jump in Amazon.© Provided by Business Insider walmart amazon stock chart Former Walmart CEO Mike Duke admitted in 2012 that his biggest regret as CEO was not investing more in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon.  "I wish we had moved faster. We've proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn't move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce," Duke said at the time. "Right now we're making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area."  While Walmart has since invested billions in e-commerce, it still holds a tiny share of the market compared with Amazon.  Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. © Provided by Business Insider Pickup with Fuel - Walmart Buffett's retail instincts have proven correct before when he  correctly predicted the downfall of Sears and Kmart in 2005.  "Retailing is like shooting at a moving target," Buffett said. "Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?" © Provided by Business Insider Warren Buffett Sears has since closed hundreds of stores and seems to be headed for bankruptcy. Macy's and JCPenney are also closing hundreds of stores across America.  While Walmart's footprint hasn't shrunk, many analysts say America is still over-stored.  The US has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia — the next two countries with the highest retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar report from October.

Tweet Email Print Favorite Saving… Share Ask a Mexican!  By Gustavo Arellano click to enlarge Dear Mexican: My parents were born in Mexico. I was born in Dallas, Texas. This makes me a first-generation American, right? So, if my best friend's dad was born in Mexico, and her mother is a Chicana, does this make her a first-generation American or a second-generation American? —Just Curious Dear Pocha: In the eyes of the current attorney general, both you and your friend are Mexicans. ¡Trucha! When do you think Baja California and other locations in the madre-land with lots of American expatriates become U.S. territories or better yet, states? I would be very eager to live in a beautiful coastal area surrounded by people with nice cars and the world's most powerful military to back them up, I think the Mexicans would, too. —Americano-Mexicano Dear Gabacho: Be careful what you wish for. If the United States and Mexico ever went to war, snowbirds like yourself would be the first people targeted by Mexicans. Don't believe me? Ask the Chinese during the Mexican Revolution. Better make plans to move to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or whatever other Latin American country gabachos retirees like to set up colonies in nowadays where they refuse to learn Spanish besides "gringo," "cerveza" and "Soy americano." Why do Mexican women, who are basically good drivers, turn into morons when they turn into the Walmart parking lot? Also, here in New Mexico, you get the guys who sneer at you, pull into traffic in front of you at the last possible second, then slow down to 15 miles an hour. I've never seen this anywhere else. Are they Mexicans or just those "I am Espanish!" assholes showing off their inferiority complex? —Califa Motorhead Dear Pocho: With all due respect, EVERYONE turns into morons at the Walmart parking lot—hell, at Walmart, period. But what I got surprised by in researching your pregunta is how relatively few Mexis shop there. A 2014 study by Kantar Retail found only about 10 percent of Walmart shoppers were Latinos (read: mostly Mexican), with raza preferring Dollar General and Family Dollar stores by far. I guess it makes sense: Mexicans prefer swap meets and yard sales when looking for low prices. But the stats are incomplete: in a graphic, Kantar excluded New Mexico. They gave no reason, but I know the answer, which also answers your queja about slow-driving men: The Land of Enchantment is where all preconceived notions about Mexicans go to claim they're pure-blooded Spaniards going back to Cabeza de Vaca—but definitely not related to Estevanico! What is the deal with Mexicans and their fear of U.S. banks? A recent home invasion netted the robbers $2,000 that the Mexicans who lived there were using for their next house payment. When I mentioned this to a Mexicana friend, she told me she was once robbed of $15,000 that she was keeping at her apt for a house payment. Doesn't word reach the wabs from their relatives in El Norte that USA bank accounts are insured to $100,000? —Huero in the Barrio Dear Gabacho: Ask Washington Mutual.

SHARE Couple finds bloodied man in their house After apparent self-slashing, police tase him in basement By Erin McIntyre Wednesday, February 15, 2017 Kevin and Iris Foltz were having a pleasant Valentine’s Day. They were both on vacation from their jobs at Walmart, had stopped at Texas Roadhouse for dinner and picked up Starbucks on the way home, and were ready to settle in for the night around 9 p.m. But when they entered their house at 1434 Rood Ave., something wasn’t right. They saw that the door to the basement was busted open and splintered. Dark pools and smears mottled the kitchen linoleum and there was something dripping off the counter. Kevin yelled, “Hello?” into the house and a mumbling noise answered from downstairs. He looked down and saw red footprints leading down into the basement. He turned to Iris and told her to get out of the house, and she called 911. Within minutes, police arrived and they found a man wielding a knife at the bottom of the stairs leading to the basement. According to Grand Junction Police Department spokeswoman Heidi Davidson, the man threatened officers and didn’t drop the knife, though he was ordered several times to do so. Officers used a Taser to take him into custody, and then he was transported to St. Mary’s Hospital for treatment of self-inflicted injuries, Davidson said. The incident is still under investigation and charges are pending against the man, whose identity was not released on Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, disaster cleanup crews came and went from the basement as the Foltzes sat in their living room. Their cat, Princess Jasmine, sequestered herself in the bedroom. The kitchen was spattered with the intruder’s blood, the knife block on the counter sitting empty with a set of car keys by the coffee pot that didn’t belong. The Foltzes presumed the keys belonged to the man whose blood was smeared from their kitchen down the stairway, through their basement, and that their knives were confiscated by the police as evidence. They came back after spending a night in a hotel, to find the situation downstairs was even worse than in the kitchen. Kevin said he was shocked at the sheer volume of blood downstairs and could not believe the man was still alive. It’s the craziest thing that has happened at their house since they moved in 24 years ago. Sure, they’ve had random people urinate in the yard, and one time they had the tires stolen off a vehicle sitting in the driveway. But nothing like this. It’s a Valentine’s Day the Foltzes will never forget, but they aren’t angry about what happened, though they will likely incur costs for repairs, carpet removal and hazardous materials cleaning. They also said they aren’t scared to be at home, despite the intrusion. “I still feel safe,” Kevin said. “I think the gentleman was having some type of mental episode. I think he needs help. I hope he gets help.” They’re thankful they weren’t home when it happened and that the man is apparently still alive, though the amount of blood in the home makes them wonder. “I’m glad it was our house and not their house,” Kevin said, pointing at the next-door neighbor’s place. “They have young kids next door. It could have been a lot worse.” COMMENTS TOP JOBS Human Resource Coordinator/administrative Assistant Human Resource Coordinator/AdministrativeAssistantThe Clifton...

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. "What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence -- and I take domestic violence very seriously," Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him. Police Chief John Mina said the suspect "basically opened fire on her" as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton's death. Hundreds of tips poured in and a reward ballooned to $100,000 in the search. The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando's Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured. Authorities said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to one eye in the process. Loyd said he didn't resist. Orlando police said it would investigate the amount of force used to apprehend Loyd. Ayala said that case hasn't been handed over to her office. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing; she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon's death are first-degree murder with a firearm; killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother; attempted first degree-murder with a firearm; two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm; and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; carjacking with a firearm; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It's unclear whether Ayala's office would be able to seek the death penalty. In January 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled that the process used to condemn a Florida death row inmate was unconstitutional because a judge rather than a jury was the final arbiter of fact in sentencing. The 8-1 ruling came in a challenge filed by death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, who had been convicted of murdering restaurant co-worker Cynthia Harrison in 1998. The case was sent back to the Florida Supreme Court. Florida legislators then overhauled the law and allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death if 10 of 12 jurors recommended it. Last fall, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence required a unanimous jury vote, striking down the new law. A bill requiring that a jury unanimously recommend the death sentence is currently in the Legislature, CNN affiliate News 13 Orlando reported. If the jury is not unanimous, it can recommend a life sentence without parole. Ayala said prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of the bill, but will proceed with the case as planned.

Below is his speech in its entirety: Good evening. I want to thank you for attending this, my seventh, State of the Town address. I would like to recognize all of my fellow elected officials here tonight. I greatly appreciate your hard work, dedication and loyalty to our Town. I especially want to thank Rotary Club President Beth Hanlon for hosting this event and all those from Riverhead Kiwanis Club and Riverhead Lions Club for attending this event. It is always exciting to be given the opportunity to address so many of Riverhead’s leading voices in a discussion about the future of this great town. As always, the State of the Town message is about where we have been and where we are going as a town and as a people. In each State of the Town we outline our shared agenda, we measure our progress, we state our priorities, we look ahead, and we remember our past. However, first and foremost we stay positive about the town and we stay positive about each other. We don’t let the complaining creep in. Verse 16 in the Letter of Jude reminds us, “[t]hese people are complainers, disgruntled ones who live by their desires; their mouths utter bombast as they fawn over people to gain advantage.” Our job is to cause everyone to work together, regardless of how difficult it may seem in the present moment, for the good of the town and our residents. We as a town need to be thankful in all circumstances. President Harry S. Truman once said, “[i]t is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.” My message tonight runs down two threads. First we must remember the past, we should be proud our successes and must also recognize and learn from our failures. Second, we look to the future and chart a course for 2017. 2016 was an amazingly successful year. It is difficult to comprehend how much we accomplished last year. The success of this town, as any other town, depends more on its people and their efforts than it does the elected official. In fact, the elected official plays a very small part in the success of the town. I am reminded of John’s Gospel (Chapter 4 verses 36 through 41) [t]he reaper is already receiving his payment and gathering crops for an eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper can rejoice together. For here the saying is verified that one sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap what you have not worked; for others have done the work and you are sharing the fruits of their work. Truly, we as a town are sharing fruits of others labors. It is important for us to remember that we must “bear one another’s burdens… for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deluding himself. (Galatians 6, 2-4.) Let’s talk briefly about last year’s State of the Town message. One of the first initiatives that I spoke about last year was to create zoning for First Baptist Church to build the Community Life Center. You’ve heard me say this previously, this facility is a YMCA on steroids. I am happy to report that the Town of Riverhead adopted the zoning last year that will make the Community Life Center a reality. This has been a decades-long journey for the members of First Baptist Church as it is taken so many twists and turns. I am so proud and humbled by the work of the Coverdales and the Pastor Liggon and every other member of the church. “It is amazing what you can accomplish when you do not care who gets the credit.” First Baptist Church gets the credit for this accomplishment. I am also happy to report that at least half of the 4/12 initiative that we had spoken about last year was adopted. The Town of Riverhead retroactively imposed term limits of 12 years on the town council and the town supervisor. Unfortunately, the initiative to move the supervisor’s term from two years to four years was overwhelmingly rejected by the residents. But it is with a happy heart that I can report that term limits were passed in the Town of Riverhead. Now term limits did not pass unanimously. Councilman John Dunleavy voted against the code and is fond of saying I fired him. I guess in some way that is true, but there is something I know that is even more true than that. John and his wife Marie are the “salt of the earth” and the “light of the world.” The lives of John and Marie are defined by service and dedication embodied in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. The Dunleavy’s eyes have been, as our eyes must be, steering on a fixed point ahead and not changing direction with every short-term twist and turn of the road. John and Marie’s volunteerism with the Riverhead Volunteer Ambulance Corps, the Lions Club, East End Arts Council, St. Isidore’s Church, the American Legion and their own Homeowners’ Association shows their dedication to the Town we all call home. Downtown Riverhead has made amazing strides in 2016. Henry Ford once said “[c]oming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.” In downtown Riverhead, we have come together and made amazing progress. The progress is evident in the questions we have to answer about things like parking. The success is imminent by working together on projects such as David Gallo’s mixed-use apartment building on the corner of McDermott Avenue and East Main Street. I am happy to report that David Gallo has submitted his commercial site plan and special permit application to construct 117 workforce housing units and 12,000 square feet of new retail space on the corner of McDermott Avenue and East Main Street. This project was discussed after the 2011 general election and it took five years to bring it to fruition. Truly 2016 was an amazingly successful year for Main Street. I am happy to congratulate David Gallo and his partners. I want to especially thank Connie Lassandro for introducing David Gallo to Riverhead. Right next-door to the David Gallo project is the old or should I say was the old Sears building. Another wonderful thing happened in 2016 — the crumbling Sears building has been demolished to make way for another exciting mixed use project which will incorporate green space and open space flowing to the East End Arts property. I look forward to seeing the site plan submission in 2017. If these two projects weren’t enough, Conifer has broken ground on West Main Street and is in the process of building 45 new art space apartments. This project brings a creativity and vitality to West Main Street that we have never seen before. Now if you can believe it, there is one more amazing project that was mentioned in the State of the Town last year that has come to fruition. The approval and the construction of a brand new 20-room boutique hotel known as the Preston House immediately across the street from the Hyatt Hotel. I wish to credit Joe Petrocelli for restoring the historic Preston House. We are keeping our Division of Land Management busy and I am grateful for all of their hard work. Jeff Murphree, Brad Hammond and their staff have consistently risen to the occasion. Thank you. It is amazing what can be accomplished when you don’t take the credit. I am truly humbled and inspired by David Gallo, Robert Muchnick, Joe Petrocelli along with the fine men and women of Conifer arts space project all working together to make Main Street a success. Our Main Street will be transformed from a downtown business district long hindered by blight — to a vibrant community filled with young men, women and families who will take back the streets to make it feel safe and keep the shops and stores open and thriving. It is not me nor the Town Board that did this, but insightful visionaries. Truly this town is blessed. Also discussed last year in the State of the Town message was the coming of a new multiplex movie theater by Regal Cinemas. I am again happy to report that with the help of Councilwoman Jodi Giglio we have amended the zoning and the parking requirements to allow movie theater uses on Route 58. Regal Cinemas Board of Directors voted to sign the lease with Phillips International to finally bring a movie theater to the old Wal-Mart shopping center. The former Wal-Mart building will be torn down and rising up from the rubble will be a beautiful state of the art multiplex. 2016 was an amazing year. I would be remiss if I did not mention what is on the horizon at Peconic Bay Medical Center. With the help of our planning staff and our Town Attorney, Bob Kozakiewicz, we were able to write new zoning and get a site plan approved in record time for PBMC’s expansion which will include a cardiac catheterization lab. Northwell Health has estimated the cost of this much needed expansion at $43,000,000 and as we all know, not having a facility with this technology nearby could potentially mean the difference between life and death. This is what true collaboration looks like. Our residents will greatly benefit from this project and we look forward to getting it across the finish line. Moving further east in Jamesport we discussed the old Froelich farm also known as Sharper’s Hill. Suffolk County completed the appraisal of the property in 2016. I am prayerfully optimistic that the owners of Sharper’s Hill will accept the county offer and preserve the property. Preservation of this important parcel insures the rural character of Jamesport forever. I want to thank legislator Al Krupski for making the preservation of property possible. In fact, the only substantial element proposed in the 2016 State of the Town speech that was not done was the Aquebogue Jamesport corridor study. The study did not take place due solely to the vocal opposition of the Jamesport Civic Association. The Town Board heard the voices of the Jamesport and Aquebogue residents and would like to thank them for participating in this effort. Finally, the last extremely important measure in the 2016 State of the Town was the finalization of the EPCAL Environmental Impact Statement and the filing of the subdivision map. The Environmental Impact Statement was accepted, we adopted the zoning, the update to the Master Plan and update to the Urban Renewal Plan. The Planning Board held its public hearing for the subdivision and they are poised to adopt the final subdivision map. The only remaining issues are two permits from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the permit from Suffolk County Health Department. We have had numerous meetings with both the New York State DEC and the Suffolk County Health Department. We do not believe that any of these permits will be an issue. We should obtain these approvals this year. Again a truly amazing 2016. Over the past seven years I have focused inarguably upon three of the most burdensome issues confronting the Town of Riverhead. Three of the most important things that are going on in the Town of Riverhead. Three things that I ran on in 2009. These same three issues have consistently gotten better and better over the past seven years. First let’s start with the Town’s finances: I am again happy to report that the Town of Riverhead’s budget is balanced. There is no reliance on one shot revenues. We are paying as we go. In fact we have enough revenue at this point to cover the landfill debt service which was not an easy task. I am grateful for Bill Rothaar, his staff and the Town Board’s support in getting through this arduous process. I am a firm supporter of the New York State tax cap, but, as I have said again and again the tax cap does not work without attendant mandate relief from the State of New York. Both the State of New York and the County of Suffolk continue to push unfunded mandates down to the towns. New for this year, the State of New York is attempting to change our MS-4 permit for storm-water. These proposed conditions will add significant costs to an already strained budget. The monitoring alone will necessitate the hiring of an additional town engineer. The real financial strain will be borne by the highway department. The proposed regulations will require that streets in impaired water sheds to be swept monthly. In addition, high priority storm water catch basins be cleaned annually. We have 3,000 catch basins in which at least 1,500 would have to be every year. Currently, we clean 215 catch basins. I know the men and women that work in the Highway Department are second to none, but this burden would require the town to hire up to 8 additional highway workers at an initial cost of $675,000.00 per year in order to comply with these requirements. Further, the highway department will have to purchase an additional vacuum truck ($350,000.00) and an additional street sweeper ($250,000.00). The first year’s budget increase is conservatively estimated at $1,350,000.00. That my friends equates to a 19% tax increase to the Highway Department before we even turn the lights on January 1. We cannot continue to allow the State to push unfunded mandates down on the municipalities, while at the same time tout how the State remains under the tax cap. Town’s don’t print money. I want to thank Drew Dillingham for shedding light on this matter. His insight is invaluable. In 2017, we will fight hard on behalf of our residents to halt this extraordinary unfunded mandate. Not to be outdone, the County of Suffolk is looking for special state legislation to add $1.00 per 1,000 gallons of municipal water used for all residents that use public water. The money will be used for advanced wastewater treatment systems. While this is a laudable goal that I support, the problem is this fee will amount to a 57% increase in water rates while providing no money for water district improvements. The two biggest problems with this legislation is that residents and businesses in sewer districts who already pay a fee to have their wastewater treated are not exempt from the fee and the money is payable to Suffolk County. The County has a terrible record of managing, or I should say raiding sewer trust funds. The Town can only stay within the tax cap if the State and the County give us a fighting chance. The Town of Riverhead strives to stay within the tax cap while maintaining all levels of service including maintaining one of the finest police departments in the county. That being said, in 2016 alone the health insurance for the municipal employees went up more than the tax cap allowed. Unfortunately, this is not sustainable. The State of New York and the County of Suffolk must work with local government to reduce unfunded mandates. If Albany and Hauppauge are unwilling to reduce unfunded mandates then it is the job of the local elected official illuminate them. The County of Suffolk created an unfunded mandate for the Town of Riverhead when they undertook a study entitled Total Maximum Daily Load in Nitrogen in the Peconic Estuary. In response to this study the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation amended our State Elimination Discharge Permit for the Riverhead Sewage Treatment Plant reducing our overall nitrogen discharge by more than 75%. This was a worthwhile study, however, the new permit required the Town of Riverhead to upgrade the Riverhead Sewage Treatment Plant to treat to the limits of technology. So a Sewage Treatment Plant that was upgraded as recently as 2003 now had to undergo a $23.5 million upgrade. The plant upgrade was completed in 2016 and is functioning better then its design standards. I am proud to stand here today and let everyone know that we operate the most technologically advanced wastewater treatment plant in New York State at the present moment. Some of you may know, that during the growing season the effluent from our plant is used to irrigate the Indian Island Golf Course. Interestingly, the water from the plant is cleaner then the groundwater the County previously irrigated the golf course with. This is a first in New York State and will be a model going forward. We are proud of Michael Reichel and Frank Russo as well as all the fine men and women in the Sewer Department that made this plant a reality. We are also grateful to the County of Suffolk for an $8 million grant awarded to the town which was paid from the Suffolk County Sewer Stabilization Fund. We are also grateful to New York State for the $2 million grant for the golf course irrigation part of this project. Unfortunately, even after these two grants the town had to sell $13.5 million in bonds for the plant upgrade. The bond payment and additional operational costs represents roughly a 400% sewer rent/tax increase to the average business and home owner in the Riverhead Sewer District. The Town of Riverhead operates a regional sewage treatment plant pulling in sewer waste from Route 58, the neighborhood surrounding downtown Riverhead along with the Suffolk County Sewer District encompassing the entire county jail court complex in Southampton. Additionally, Riverhead also operates the only scavenger waste plant on the East End of Long Island. A regional facility in every sense of the word. The Town of Riverhead seeks to be treated in the same manner Suffolk County Sewer Districts are treated in the five west end towns. New York State Tax Law provides for the collection of state sales and compensating use tax in the County of Suffolk of one quarter of one percent (.25%) within the territorial limits of the County for distribution to the towns and villages which have established sewer districts to stabilize the assessments or taxes within such districts. The monies collected by such sales tax are paid over by New York State to Suffolk County for distribution by the County to the duly established town sewer districts located within the territorial limits of Suffolk County. The problem is, Suffolk County has not promulgated any process or rules or regulations for the administration of the funds collected through the tax law for distribution to town and village sewer districts. Thus, leaving town and village sewer districts unable to provide rate stabilization. However, if you are in a Suffolk County sewer district in one of the five west end towns, the County has determined that if the annual increase of sewer rent/tax exceeds three percent (3%) the amount above three percent (3%) will be paid out of the sewer stabilization fund. Due to the construction of the upgraded treatment plant required by the County study published in 2007 the amount necessary to stabilize the assessment or tax of the resident users of the Riverhead Sewer District at the three percent (3%) level for 2016 was $681,828. In March of 2016, the County paid the Riverhead Sewer District $144,688 from monies collected from the sewer stabilization fund leaving a shortfall of $537,140 to the Town of Riverhead. This shortfall makes it impossible for the town to stabilize the sewer rents/rates. Based upon the debt service and the increased costs associated with the operation of the upgraded sewage treatment plant, the amount payable by the County to stabilize the 2017 sewer rent/tax at three percent (3%) is $1,466,712. The County of Suffolk is sitting on at least $100,000,000 that should be used in part to stabilize all town and village sewer treatment facilities. These funds may be used for no other purpose by the County of Suffolk other than to stabilize the assessment and taxes of sewer districts within the County. Under the standard of due process and equal protection under the law Suffolk County must turn the requested funds over to the Town of Riverhead. Again, all we ask is to be treated equally. It is never a good idea for one municipality to use taxpayer funds to sue another municipality but sometimes, just sometimes it is necessary. One of the initiatives discussed in 2016 was to obtain the services of CMA to provide a five-year financial management plan for the Town of Riverhead. I am happy to report that the five year financial plan is done. One of the last pressing financial burdens of the Town of Riverhead is balancing the Community Preservation Fund. I have discussed many times previous town boards overspent our Community Preservation Fund. In 2016, the Town of Riverhead was successful in having the State of New York adopt legislation that enables the Town of Riverhead to refinance our CPF debt with a new repayment period of up to 40 years. This legislation combined with the extension of the CPF program passed by 70% of town voters will enable the Town of Riverhead to refinance the debt so that the principal and interest payments are directly in line with the income we receive through the CPF program. Once this is accomplished in 2017 every single budget line in the Town of Riverhead is balanced. It was a difficult task to balance the Town of Riverhead’s finances in seven short years. In 2010, the town of Riverhead’s general fund and the CPF fund we’re out of balance each buy 12%. This is the same percentage that the County of Suffolk budgets were out of balance in 2010.It is an amazing thing to stand here tonight and tell you that we have conquered the financial mountain. The town is on firm financial footing and it is time to start building our fund balance. The second of the most pressing issues the Town of Riverhead has faced over the past several decades was downtown Riverhead. For years downtown Riverhead languished, stores closed, buildings emptied, and you could park almost anywhere. Fast forward to today and you hear that we are beginning to have a parking problem. Over the past eight years the public private investment in downtown has been astonishing. As recently as last week the State of New York announced another $500,000 to be split equally between David Gallo’s multimillion dollar project and Michael Butler’s innovative 10,000 square foot Riverhead Food Market and Production Center. This comes on the heels of a $250,000 grant from the State Office of Community Renewal to create housing above existing retail stores. Between the State and the County, downtown Riverhead received approximately $10,000,000 in grants and financial assistance. Thank you to Chris Kempner, Joe Maiorana, Frank Messina and Dan Thompson from the Community Development Agency for your commitment to downtown Riverhead. One the issues I want to discuss is crime. Overall crime is down throughout the town, including our downtown area. The reduction in crime is a direct result of the work our fine men and women do in the Riverhead Police Department. They and we are doing everything possible to reduce crime from community policing to the East End Drug Task Force, but, more is necessary. Our police department cannot do it alone. One of the things we realized over the past eight years is that in order to make it downtown safe we have to bring people downtown. You see, people who come to downtown to shop and live their lives; going to the bakeries, the delis, the restaurants and the shops doing what it is that normal people do — you see, these folks, these are the eyes, ears and feet on the ground. The largest deterrent of crime that any municipality can undertake. Before Summerwind was built we had complaints on a regular basis in the back parking lot behind their building all concerning quality of life crimes. Once Summerwind opened their residents would not and did not tolerate that kind of nonsense. Just the presence of Summerwind’s residents pushed the criminal element out. The park along the riverfront became a vibrant, joyful place to visit. When David Gallo’s building rises up on McDermott Avenue we will also see the positive effects of new residents on East Main Street. The downtown renaissance coupled with aggressive code enforcement and an ever vigilant Riverhead police force will make downtown Riverhead one of the safest neighborhoods in Riverhead town. With the amazing growth we are about to see on Main Street, it is incumbent upon the town board to move quickly to create new parking lots along East and West Main Streets. Perhaps the most problematic parking issue exists behind Digger O’Dell’s on the west end of town and the Aquarium on the east end of town. I am happy to report that Councilman Tim Hubbard has been appointed as the new parking district liaison. We have great confidence that Councilman Hubbard along with the Parking District Committee will present a parking plan that will allow the town to continue our revitalization of downtown Riverhead. It is my belief that by this time next year when these new buildings are constructed and occupied the transformation of downtown will be surreal. The final frontier, EPCAL. We have spoken about EPCAL in almost every State of the Town message. The subdivision is largely complete. We have several suitors looking to purchase the subdivision map. We are currently negotiating with Suffolk Industrial Corporation on a $45 million acquisition of the 600 developable acres of EPCAL. It is our goal to close on the property in 2017. This one closing will add an estimated $43 million to the general fund. We must use this money wisely. We must take this money and put it in a special debt service reserve account which will be used to pay off the remaining landfill debt. By doing this, it is my sincere belief we will be able to roll back the tax increases of 2015 and 2016. The Town Board cannot spend the $43 million dollars without providing tax relief to the residences and businesses of the Town of Riverhead. It was at EPCAL, that America launched the greatest fighter jets and airplanes the world has ever seen. It was at Grumman, that inspiration, ingenuity, creativity and originality came together to protect our democracy and freedom. The people of Riverhead, built the machines and gave rise to the ideas and aircraft that touched the Moon and the stars, the skies and the heavens. I am excited to let you know that as Luminati Aerospace ushers in a new chapter in Riverhead’s love affair with aviation as they plan for the first launch of an aircraft taken from concept to design to manufacture all at EPCAL. Exciting times my friends. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?” Riverhead is an amazing town filled with amazing people as I look around I would like to honor those that have done for others. As we have discussed, Riverhead designed and operates one of the most technologically advanced Sewage Treatment Plant in New York State under the guidance of Michael Reichel our Sewer District Superintendent. What you may not know is the genius behind irrigating the Indian Island Golf course was borne of Michael Reichel. Doing for others by protecting the environment. Michael Butler is an unassuming man if you met him on Main Street you wouldn’t know that he was the mastermind behind purchasing East Main Street’s largest and longest vacant structure, the Woolworth Building. As if that renovation was not enough, Mr. Butler is in the process of purchasing the old West Marine Building to bring us the Riverhead Food Hall and Production Center. A trendy upscale food market with a view of the Peconic River. Doing for others by taking a chance on Main Street. What does a Councilman, a Deacon and a Pastor all have in common? Their love for the Congregational Church of downtown Riverhead. Councilman and former Deacon Wooten working with Pastor Sean Murray and the Town’s Community Development Agency to obtain a $71,000.00 grant from the Lyon Gardner foundation to complete the $500,000.00 transformation of the First Congregational Church of Riverhead. God’s work helping others. Not to be on outdone, Councilwomen Jodi Giglio and the Alternate Transportation Committee, again, working with the Community Development Agency obtained over $700,000.00 in grants to complete the very popular Veterans Memorial multipurpose trail around EPCAL. There are many unsung heroes in Town Hall one of them is Annemarie Prudenti. Ms. Prudenti has been the author of at least two pieces of special state legislation that were passed by the State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Cuomo. The latest such piece of legislation allows the town of Riverhead to refinance $42.5 million in debt owed by the Community Preservation Fund. This state statute allows the town to do what it normally could not do. Refinance debt for a longer period of time. The residents of the Town of Riverhead are indebted to Annemarie Prudenti for her service and dedication to this town. We have gone from sewage treatment to food halls to now one of my favorite subjects — bunker. Over the past several years of town of Riverhead has faced massive fish kills in the Peconic River. Last year the town was able to avert a fish kill through the efforts of several individuals two of which I want to mention here today. The first hero in an effort to avert a fish kill was Jim Gilmore from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Mr. Gilmore worked with the Mid Atlantic Marine Fisheries Council to obtain additional quota to allow the harvest of the bunker before they died. This additional quota enabled the next hero, Mr. William Caldwell to spring into action to harvest the additional quota to avert fish kills in the Peconic River. Mr. Caldwell harvested over 700,000 pounds of live bunker from the Peconic River all right at the doorstep of Corwell Avenue. Mr. Caldwell’s efforts allowed the massive numbers of bunker to move freely up and down the river avoiding a bottleneck that previously trapped and killed the bunker. Without the efforts of both Mr. Gilmore and the muscle of Mr. Caldwell the Peconic River would not have been a pleasant place this past spring. I want to recognize and commend the men and women of the Riverhead Water District especially Mr. Mark Conklin Water District Superintendent. Mr. Conklin works tirelessly in the Riverhead Water District to give the residents pure clean water. This past year, Long Island was in a severe drought and the Town of Riverhead pumped record amounts of water. During the months of July and August the Water District’s 17 wells ran nonstop setting records which on some days exceeded 20,000,000 gallons of water a day. In fact, total water usage for July and August was more than 900 million gallons—an all-time record. I want to thank Mr. Conklin and the employees of the water district for those tireless hours to ensure that we had good clean water for the residents of Riverhead. Finally, we must recognize, Superintendent Ray Coyne and Senior Services Director Judy Doll for their efforts in merging the town’s recreation department and senior park department into the Office of Intergenerational Services. This new department will not only provide more services to the seniors of the Town of Riverhead but it will also provide more recreational opportunities to all of the residents of Riverhead. The new Intergenerational Department will be housed in the senior services building on Shadetree Lane in Aquebogue. In addition, we will be opening a new intergenerational center on Columbus Avenue in Stotsky Park. Truly these two individuals have bridged the gap. I want to take a moment to thank my partners on the Riverhead Town Board, Councilman James Wooten, Councilwoman Jodi Giglio, Councilman Timothy Hubbard and Councilman John Dunleavy. I also want to recognize our staff who are the lifeblood of the Town. As the elected officials, we set the policy, approve the budget and provide direction. The Town employees carry out that direction and makes things happen. Your hard work is truly appreciated. I want to thank my staff: Heidi, Jill, Carol and Larry for always standing by me. I am truly blessed by having people of your caliber standing with me. Finally, I want to thank the members of my family was Zachary, Timothy and Gregory and especially my wife Cathleen for allowing me to serve as Town Supervisor. I could not do the job without the full blessing and support of my family and it is through their love and support and faith that we continue to make this town the greatest town in Suffolk County. All the glory and honor go to God. I thank the Father for placing me back in this position. I ask that you the residents and business owners of Riverhead pray for me that I may honor God by and through my service to this town. I am truly grateful for all that we have accomplished together. However, there is still more work to do before Riverhead reaches its full potential. I would like to leave you with one final verse from the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 1:18): “Come Now and Let Us Reason Together.” Photo: Riverhead Town Supervisor Sean Walter giving his annual ‘State of the Town’ address Wednesday night in Polish Town.

Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. "What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence -- and I take domestic violence very seriously," Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him. Police Chief John Mina said the suspect "basically opened fire on her" as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton's death. Hundreds of tips poured in and a reward ballooned to $100,000 in the search. The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando's Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured. Authorities said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to one eye in the process. Loyd said he didn't resist. Orlando police said it would investigate the amount of force used to apprehend Loyd. Ayala said that case hasn't been handed over to her office. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing; she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon's death are first-degree murder with a firearm; killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother; attempted first degree-murder with a firearm; two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm; and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; carjacking with a firearm; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It's unclear whether Ayala's office would be able to seek the death penalty. In January 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled that the process used to condemn a Florida death row inmate was unconstitutional because a judge rather than a jury was the final arbiter of fact in sentencing. The 8-1 ruling came in a challenge filed by death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, who had been convicted of murdering restaurant co-worker Cynthia Harrison in 1998. The case was sent back to the Florida Supreme Court. Florida legislators then overhauled the law and allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death if 10 of 12 jurors recommended it. Last fall, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence required a unanimous jury vote, striking down the new law. A bill requiring that a jury unanimously recommend the death sentence is currently in the Legislature, CNN affiliate News 13 Orlando reported. If the jury is not unanimous, it can recommend a life sentence without parole. Ayala said prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of the bill, but will proceed with the case as planned.

Here are the best deals on water filters, reverse osmosis systems and emergency water filters. Appliances by Richard Baguley February 15, 2017 10:17 AM PST Welcome to Home Deals, where we pick out the best deals on things you need for your home, garden and beyond. Like our cousin, the Cheapskate, we'll give you a regular selection of smoking-hot deals, but for house and home. This week, we look at the best deals on water filters. Water. We all drink it, ranging from straight from the tap to fancy imported sparkling. However you take your water, there are deals out there that can help you improve the quality of your water without splashing out. In the US, we are lucky. Unlike many places in the world, the water that comes out of our taps is clean, healthy and very drinkable. That's not to say that it couldn't do with a bit of improvement, though: most domestic water supplies contain small amounts of lead and other chemicals, plus bacteria and other unwanted guests. That's where a water filter comes in: by filtering the water, it can get rid of most of these bits of ickiness. The PUR Classic 11-Cup pitcher, on sale for $15 at AirFilters.com. PUR The easiest way to add this extra filtration is a pitcher filter. You fill the top chamber with water, which passes through a filter and is stored in the bottom. They vary in size from small jugs like the Brita 5-cup ($8.84 at Walmart), up to larger models like the Pur Classic 11-cup ($15 from AirFilters.com), to the Zerowater 23-cup dispenser ($34.99 from Walmart again). You can even put these in the fridge for on-demand, cool, clean water. The downside of these models is that they are big and bulky, and you need to remember to change the filter often: they become ineffective over time. The Zerowater model has an interesting solution to this: it includes a total dissolved solids (TDS) meter, which measures how much gunk is dissolved in the water. If you use this to check the filtered water regularly, you can figure out when to change the filter. The cost of these filters varies: the best price we could find for the Brita filters was $38.95 for 10 from Amazon, so each filter cost just under $4. The Zerowater filters are a little more expensive: a four-pack will cost you $62 from Amazon. However, Zerowater claims that their filters remove more gunk than others. For the ultimate in clean water, you want a reverse osmosis (RO) system. These use the pressure of the water to force impurities out, producing water that is as close to pure distilled water as you can get at home. If you are chemically sensitive or prone to infections, these complex devices can make life much easier. I have one because I have a fish tank, and reverse osmosis removes the chlorides, salts and metals that can poison fish, but which sneak into the local water supply. By running the water I fill my tank with through, this, I make sure my fish get clean water that keeps them happy. I use a six-stage system that uses several filters plus a UV light that kills bacteria, These systems are not cheap, though: the best deal I could find on this was $223 at Home Depot. There is also a hidden cost: filters. You have to replace the filters on a regular basis, and a full set that should last about a year will cost you about $70. You don't need to get as fancy as me to get an RO system, though. There are cheaper options that use the same technology, but just without as many filter stages, like the Yescom five-stage system that NewEgg has for $124.95. It's always a good idea to have a backup plan, like this Etekcity portable water purifier that is on sale for $15.99 at Amazon. This neat little device has three stages of filtration that can remove over 99 percent of bacteria and other bad stuff. Designed for camping use, this can filter up to 1,500 liters (about 395 gallons) of water, so it's not a bad idea to have one of these under your sink or in your car in case your local water supply gets contaminated and you have no other water source.

The 86-year-old, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple late last year, raising his company’s holding from 15.2m shares to 57.4m. The iPhone maker’s shares hit a record high yesterday of $136.27 (£109.49) making his stake worth £6.3bn. Planning ahead: Warren Buffett, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple His firm Berkshire Hathaway also offloaded £723m of Walmart stock – a shift some will view as an admission the industry is in decline. The American dubbed the Sage of Omaha has focused on the threat from online retailers such as Amazon. Buffett told shareholders in Omaha last year: ‘It’s a big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more.’ The tycoon also upped his stakes in airline companies, including £1.7bn in each of American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings.

The retailer agreed to pay $1 million to settle claims that it sold plastic products that were misleadingly labeled, in violation of California law. California law that bans products labeled “biodegradable” and requires those labeled “compostable” to meet ASTM compostability standards. More than 20 California district attorney’s offices brought the case against Walmart. Other states are following California’s lead, Resource Recycling reports. As states adopt similar laws, “then certainly you’ll see cases being brought using that legislation,” Cary Oshins, associate director of the US Composting Council, told the magazine. The US Composting Council has written model legislation for regulating labels. And Bob Lilienfeld, who works with the American Institute for Packaging and the Environment, suggests companies play it safe by complying with California’s law across all labels and products: “Your best course of action is to follow the toughest state regulation you can find,” he said. This is not only an issue at the state level, however. The Federal Trade Commission has also been cracking down on false and misleading environmental claims, including biodegradable plastic claims.   Categories Compliance, FeatureTags biodegradable, compostable, Sustainable Packaging & Paper, Walmart Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: India could be the second country to see Amazon brick-and-mortar stores, with the Seattle-based company having sought the government’s approval to open food-only outlets along with an online platform to sell these locally produced items. The US giant plans to undertake “retail trading of food products (produced or manufactured in India) to customers at any location through any channel, offline or online, including e-commerce, across India,” according to a person who saw the application filed by Singapore-based Amazon Corporate Holding Pvt Ltd, which will hold 99 per cent of the proposed entity with the rest owned by Amazon.com Inc, Mauritius. The subsidiary seeks to invest Rs 3,500 crore over the next five years and sell third-party or its own private labels of locally produced and packaged food products. Amazon’s first grocery store in the US will open to the public this year.“We are excited by the government’s continued efforts to encourage FDI in India for a stronger food supply chain,” Amazon India said in a statement. “We have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision.” “What might work well is opening some concept stores to showcase some of the products,” said Abhishek Malhotra, a partner at AT Kearney. “Opening some stores in select locations, airports, high streets, malls to showcase the breadth of the offering — that might be done. In this case, it gives the flexibility to do that.” First global bigwig to show interest The US company debuted in physical stores in November 2015, when it opened the first Amazon bookstore in Seattle, followed by outlets in Portland and San Diego. Amazon will roll out its ninth bookstore in San Francisco’s Bay Area later this year. Amazon, which posted a 27 per cent increase in net sales to $136 billion in 2016, is currently preparing to open its first grocery in Seattle. The store, branded Amazon Go, uses technology to offer customers a checkout-free experience. “Amazon Go is a great model — you just walk through and as the future evolves and it becomes more and more digital, it gives them the flexibility to do both,” said Malhotra. India is a focus area for Amazon, which is the first global bigwig to take advantage of a June legislation that carved out a food-only retailing segment, allowing 100 per cent foreign direct investment for companies selling locally sourced and produced food items. Such ventures can sell through both brick-and-mortar stores and their online portals. Most other global retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc, have cold-shouldered India’s ambitious liberalisation move aimed at creating millions of jobs and helping farmers. Walmart is said to have told Indian government officials that dealing only in wafer thin margin food articles does not make business sense and non-food items should be included. Relief for government Amazon’s application has come as a relief for the government whose high-decibel campaign to attract global retailers and manufacturers was otherwise seen as flopping. Last year, top government officials invited representatives from Walmart, Nestle, Heinz and Thailand’s CP Foods to generate investments under the new category. Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a proponent of FDI in food retailing, led a team of officials to London and met representatives of British companies including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Harrods, Marks & Spencer and Cobra Beer to drum up support for the policy without any luck. It was only late last year that some positive responses started, with applications from hyper-local grocery delivery companies Big Basket and Grofers. Amazon has told the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion that it plans to develop infrastructure, including warehouses and distribution facilities such as a temperature-controlled supply chain to undertake farm-to-fork retailing of food items, according to the person familiar with its application. The DIPP formulates FDI policy in India and approves and facilitates investments. Amazon said the proposed venture could help yield better returns for farmers by reducing waste and cutting legions of intermediaries generally involved in the food supply chain. Amazon currently operates an online marketplace in India. Operators of such businesses can only offer their platforms to other Indian owned entities to sell products and cannot themselves be involved in retailing. Local rivals Flipkart, the country’s largest e-commerce company, and Snapdeal also operate such platforms. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski By Nandita Bose Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has acquired online outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw for $51 million in an all-cash deal, the company said on Wednesday, as it works to boost its competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Moosejaw will be Wal-Mart's third acquisition in just over six months. In August 2016, the world's largest retailer paid more than $3 billion to acquire online startup Jet.com and in late December, Jet.com acquired online footwear retailer ShoeBuy for approximately $70 million. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, the retailer acquired more than 15 startups. Wal-Mart has not disclosed what it spent on each of those acquisitions, but said it spent a total of $3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in the four fiscal years to January 2017. Moosejaw is a Michigan-based online retailer with 10 brick-and-mortar stores. It sells outdoor gear and apparel from makers including Patagonia and North Face and has "strong relationships" with these brands, Wal-Mart said in a statement. "Apparel and accessories is now the number one category for digital commerce, according to comScore Inc (SCOR.PK), and we gain the experience of another well-established e-commerce player, this time in the active outdoor category," Wal-Mart's statement said. Moosejaw will continue to operate its site and stores separately and will be run as a standalone brand. Wal-Mart has been working aggressively to close the gap with rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) under the leadership of Chief Executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore. In October it said it will slow the pace of new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business. Lore, who joined Wal-Mart when it purchased the company he founded, Jet.com, has been charged with revitalizing Wal-Mart's online business and has introduced changes such as free two-day shipping. On Monday, Reuters reported that Wal-Mart for the first time will combine its own buying for products sold at its stores with purchases it makes for its website, a significant move to stamp out duplicate efforts as it consolidates buying operations. Wal-Mart's online sales account for about 3 percent of total sales. It is looking for online sales growth of 20 to 30 percent in the second half of this year, and for even faster growth in the next few years.

REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski By Nandita Bose Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has acquired online outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw for $51 million in an all-cash deal, the company said on Wednesday, as it works to boost its competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Moosejaw will be Wal-Mart's third acquisition in just over six months. In August 2016, the world's largest retailer paid more than $3 billion to acquire online startup Jet.com and in late December, Jet.com acquired online footwear retailer ShoeBuy for approximately $70 million. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, the retailer acquired more than 15 startups. Wal-Mart has not disclosed what it spent on each of those acquisitions, but said it spent a total of $3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in the four fiscal years to January 2017. Moosejaw is a Michigan-based online retailer with 10 brick-and-mortar stores. It sells outdoor gear and apparel from makers including Patagonia and North Face and has "strong relationships" with these brands, Wal-Mart said in a statement.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The retail giant confirmed the news Wednesday (Feb. 15) in a blog on its website, just one month after Walmart sister company Jet.com acquired online footwear business ShoeBuy. Moosejaw, founded in 1992 and headquartered in Madison Heights, Mich., is an omni-channel retailer with a large online presence and a small brick-and-mortar presence of 10 stores located throughout the Midwest and its home state of Michigan. Wal-Mart said Moosejaw will continue to operate as a standalone business and subsidiary of the retail giant. Wal-Mart sees Moosejaw as another way the retailer can participate in the fastest growing online category of apparel and accessories, according to ComScore. The company noted in the blog post that the deal will help “gain the experience of another well-established e-commerce player, this time in the active outdoor category.” Moosejaw CEO Eoin Comerford and his executive team and some 350 employees will continue to be based in Michigan and report to the Walmart U.S. e-commerce retail organization based in San Bruno, Calif. Aside from the talent, Wal-Mart also sees Moosejaw as a way to expand its relationships in the specialty apparel space. The retailer also cites Moosejaw’s adeptness in customer experience as a bonus in the deal as Wal-Mart seeks to enhance the customer experiences of its massive shopping base. Not much is known about Moosejaw, but the retailer was recently mentioned among Internet Retailer’s 2017 “Hot 100” list for its design, a list that Walmart.com did not make its own right. Moosejaw carries more than 120,000 items from more than 400 brands, including Patagonia, The North Face and Marmot. Wal-Mart is keenly aware of this extensive assortment of apparel and outdoor gear used in hiking, climbing, swimming and biking, categories that are strong sellers online. This is Wal-Mart’s third online acquisition in five months and Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala told the media the retailer will continue to look for acquisition opportunities, as well as push for organic growth as a key e-commerce strategy. During Wal-Mart’s third quarter, the company saw its e-commerce sales improve 20.6%, an improvement executives were eager to see. The retail giant will report its fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday (Feb. 21). Analysts largely approve of buying approach Wal-Mart is taking to grow its market share against Amazon.com. “Wal-Mart is aggressively building category-specific digital scale, pure and simple,” said Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail. “Its acquisition of Jet.com laid the foundation, now Walmart is free to roam the world in search of niche players, and the valuable user and shopper bases that come with them.” Spieckerman also approved of Wal-Mart’s keeping these acquisitions somewhat separate from the mothership. “As Wal-Mart racks up acquisitions, it also gathers steam in digital search as shoppers seek out specific categories and brands,” she said. “By keeping these entities at a bit of a distance, and leaving leadership and headquarters locations intact, Wal-Mart ensures that its brand doesn’t dilute the magic that these acquired companies have created. Expect more where this came from. Moosejaw is only the beginning.” Comments comments Previous post Health Beat: UAMS research moves one step closer to Lou Gehrig’s disease cure Next post Bill advances requiring campuses to allow concealed carry Newsletter Sign up to get latest from TB&P in your inbox!

(AP) By Rob Williams   |   Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 11:11 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., sold off 90 percent of its holdings of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the biggest private employer in the U.S. The stock sale left Berkshire with about 1 million shares at the end of December, begging the question: Does Buffett see no future for the world’s biggest retailer? As mobile technology allows consumers greater power to comparison-shop while walking through brick-and-mortar stores, online retailers have the ability to intrude into Wal-Mart’s aisles of electronics, hardware and appliances. Meanwhile, dollar stores are going after low-income, cash-paying customers who don't have bank accounts or credit cards. Mark Astrachan, a retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., estimates that Wal-Mart’s sales will grow 1 percent to 2 percent this year among stores that have been open for at least 12 months. He doesn’t see much upside to the stock, with a 12-month price target of $70 based on estimates of Wal-Mart’s earnings growth. Wal-Mart fell 0.3 percent to $68.47 a share by mid-day Wednesday. Astrachan said the most important way for Wal-Mart to resist the threat of Internet retailing giant Amazon.com Inc. is with grocery sales. “Although we believe Amazon is a competitive threat over the long term, Wal-Mart’s exposure to categories that are less sensitive to online selling, particularly grocery, insulates results in the near-to-medium term,” Astrachan said in a Jan. 19 report obtained by Newsmax Finance. “Longer term, successfully combining brick-and-mortar stores with a solid online platform should help Wal-Mart stay relevant against Amazon and other online retailers.” Wal-Mart plans to radically change the way its customers grocery shop as the big-box giant aggressively expands its online pickup services around the country. While tech and e-commerce companies like Google and Amazon are considering grocery-delivery models, Wal-Mart's advantage is having a network of 4,600 stores as a starting point, according to The Washington Post. In the last year, Wal-Mart has grown its online grocery pickup program from five markets to more than 80 around the nation, the newspaper noted. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." Wal-Mart also sought to bolster its online presence in August when it signed a $3.3 billion deal to purchase young online retailer Jet.com Inc., according to The Wall Street Journal. Berkshire's stock holdings were revealed on Monday in a government filing.   Related Stories: Buffett Dumps Wal-Mart Stock, Builds Airline and Apple Bets Buffett's Shrinking Wal-Mart Stake Signals Amazon Holiday Threat           © 2017 Newsmax Finance.

Tech Industry by Ry Crist February 15, 2017 7:40 AM PST @rycrist Walmart is adding another e-commerce asset to its shopping cart today, with the $51 million acquisition of Michigan-based retailer Moosejaw. Enlarge Image Steve Heap, Getty Images/Canopy Founded in 1992, Moosejaw sells popular outdoors gear, apparel and merchandise from brands like Patagonia and North Face at its 10 physical stores. Walmart's real interest here, though, would appear to be online. Moosejaw is an established e-commerce player in apparel and accessories -- which, a Walmart spokesperson pointed out, is now the No. 1 category in digital commerce, according to ComScore. That business will fold right into Jet.com, which Walmart acquired last year for $3.3 billion in a big push to take on Amazon. While the Moosejaw purchase is just a small part of that strategy, it still shows that Walmart remains committed to making online gains in 2017. To that end, Jet.com purchased ShoeBuy for $70 million just last month in a bid to compete with the category-leading Zappos. Walmart said that Moosejaw's CEO and more than 350 employees will continue to operate out of Michigan, where they'll keep on overseeing their site and physical stores as "a standalone and complementary brand" in Walmart's growing e-commerce portfolio.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 11:33am   Comments Share: Related WMT After Setting New Highs, Markets Prepare For A Date With Janet Yellen Galentine's Day: Lilith Fair, Minus The Angst Wal-Mart picks up Moosejaw (Seeking Alpha) Retail industry bellwether Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) will report its fourth-quarter results on February 21 amid a slew of disappointing holiday sales updates from its peers. Cautious retail investors would look at how far the choppy industrial backdrop has impacted the world's largest retailer. “While we think WMT fared better than most (improved customer experience/service, incremental price investments), we are trimming our U.S. comp to +0.8 percent E (Sam's remains at +1.2 percent E),” Baird analyst Peter Benedict wrote in a note. Expectations: Company And Analyst Weigh In That said, Benedict expects relatively an in-line EPS as his $1.27 estimate compares to the Street's $1.29 and guidance of $1.18–$1.33. Though bears are watching the impact on traffic from higher gas prices, the analyst said the company would benefit from moderating food deflation. Related Link: Bernstein Calls Dollar General 'Our Strategic Winner,' Attractive Takeover Target For Amazon The analyst sees accelerating growth in Wal-Mart’s e-commerce platform across 2H16 and beyond, given investments in Jet.com, marketplace and online grocery. Benedict also pointed out that Wal-Mart’s move to free two-day shipping ($35 threshold, down from $50) is a compelling offer that underscores its commitment to address/elevate its convenience proposition. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart projects flat EPS for FY 2017. The analyst believes the Street's total sales estimate of +1.9 percent (vs. FY 2016's 3 percent) seems to set an appropriate/achievable bar. “While operating profit will remain under pressure near term, the pace of decline is expected to moderate this year,” Benedict continued. Outperform Rating, Justification As such, Benedict reiterated its Outperform rating and $80 price target on the shares, citing the company’s defensive positioning within a choppy consumer/retail backdrop. “We continue to believe CEO Doug McMillon's bold strategy of transforming WMT into a durable, fully integrated omni-channel retailer is the right one for the business and investors,” Benedict added. At last check, shares of Wal-Mart were down 0.31 percent to $68.45.

The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which has been aggressively expanding. Both offer low prices by focusing on store-label products rather than name brands. Aldi has also been adding items to include gluten-free products and fresh produce. Lidl's first 20 U.S. stores will be opening in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its first U.S. headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. Lidl operates about 10,000 stores in 27 countries. Both Lidl and Aldi have been aggressively expanding in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a fierce price war has hurt Wal-Mart's Asda business as well as traditional local retailers. Aldi, which opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976, now has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. and plans to increase that to nearly 2,000 by the end of 2018. It announced earlier this month that it's spending $1.6 billion on remodeling more than 1,300 of them. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

INSIDERS POLL: MORGAN WOULD BE STRONGEST CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR Unpredictable, politically incorrect, pugnacious, and very, very rich.

QUESTIONS OVER DEATH OF KIM JONG UN'S HALF BROTHER It looks like a perfectly staged assassination, straight out of the pages of a spy novel: Kim Jong Nam, the estranged, exiled half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, falls ill at a Malaysian airport, complains of being sprayed with some sort of chemical, and drops dead. But, as with many things about the motives of cloistered North Korea, the unknowns currently far outweigh the certainties. PLANNING A VISIT TO CUBA? YOU BETTER FIND A GUY TO HELP YOU [Photo from Diane Persall] Anyone traveling on their own in Cuba needs to "know a guy." Could be a woman, but enterprising locals typically offer a guy. Looking for a casa particular, a comfy room rented by friendly, licensed homeowners? Someone knows a guy to make it happen. Want to spin backward through time and Havana in a vintage automobile? Guys arrange that, too.  Steve Persall writes about his recent visit to the island nation. CAN CHRIS SALE DO FOR THE RED SOX WHAT DAVID PRICE COULD NOT? Chris Sale wants to win. He said that Tuesday during his press conference following his first official workout as a Red Sox. Repeatedly. "I've said it 157 times," Sale said. That's an exaggeration, but he used the word often when talking about the offseason trade that brought him from the Chicago White Sox to Boston and about joining a team that dealt two top prospects for the left-handed pitcher to, well, win. RUMOR IS TOP DOG AT WESTMINSTER Quite a rally for Rumor, and German Shepherds, too. Rumor was crowned America's top dog Tuesday night when, a year after a near miss, she came out of retirement to win best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club.

(Flickr) CINCINNATI, OH (FOX19) - Legal trouble for America's largest retailer could be brewing over whether or not its new line of craft beer is bogus. On Friday, Matthew Adam of Cincinnati filed a lawsuit against Walmart alleging its craft beer under the Trouble Brewing label fails to meet the qualifications for craft beer.  The mega-retailer has already faced questions from craft beer purists for labeling its own brews as "craft" beer. The suit outlines a brewery must “(a) produce less than six million barrels of beer annually; (b) be less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer; and (c) make beer using only traditional or innovative brewing ingredients.” "Defendant's craft beer has never been a 'craft beer,' nor has it been produced by a craft brewery," the lawsuit says. "Rather, it is a wholesale fiction created by the defendant that was designed to deceive consumers into purchasing the craft beer at a higher, inflated price." Adams requests an injunction to prevent Walmart from advertising its brews as craft beer and that the company pay unspecified punitive damages. According to the lawsuit, Trouble Brewing does not exist. The applicant listed on filings with the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is Winery Exchange Inc, which has since turned into WX Brands. The suit goes on to say WX Brands produces beer on a scale larger than would be considered "small" by enthusiasts.  "Consumers generally believe that 'craft beer' products are of higher quality than mass produced counterparts," the suit reads. "Due to the Defendant's scheme to defraud the market, members of the general public were fraudulently induced to purchase craft beer at inflated prices."  Copyright 2017 WXIX. All rights reserved.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

S. News & World Report has ranked northwest Arkansas among the top five places to live in the country. That's nice, but what counts is whether the people who live there like it. And what's not to like? That quadrant of the state has Bentonville, world capital of the Wal-Mart empire of retailing, and for culture-vultures there's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, to mention just a couple of its Ozarkian attractions. Mayor of Fayetteville Lioneld Jordan notes that the region also has a "welcoming spirit," which pays dividends in jobs and start-ups. The Walton Family Foundation, another of the region's and the state's great assets, points out that northwest Arkansas' "expanding green space, parks and trails, its first-class performing arts center and active local food movement all helped northwest Arkansas stand out." Steve Clark, former just about everything, is still around, but nowadays he's president of Fayetteville's chamber of commerce. "When you look at [U. S. News & World Report's] rankings," he says, "one of the reasons we get up there at a pretty high rate is new jobs we are creating and the [low] cost of living." But will success spoil Fayetteville as a place that draws the next, updated generation of post-hippies from all over the state and country? Not to worry, says Steve Clark. "Every 12 months," he notes, "we bring 5,000 new faces into Fayetteville. Those 5,000 faces come from all parts of the nation and the world, so they bring some funky with them when they come," along with backpacks and digital accouterments. As shown by the Keep Fayetteville Funky bumper-stickers around town on cars and scooters. "Economic development in the 21st century," says Steve Clark, "is about talent and sense of place. Every day it gets easier for that talent to live anywhere in the world." And to lose the sense of place that drew these wanderers to northwest Arkansas in the first place. See the sad example of a city like Austin, the one in Texas, which used to be a livable place, too, before it grew too big for its much-patched old britches. Consider this: The annual salary reported on average in northwest Arkansas is $43,570 and the median price of a house is $182,508, while in Los Angeles, the average annual salary is $51,766 and the median cost of housing is an impressive $487,716. So while salaries are higher in Los Angeles, the price of housing there is going up at a rate at least twice as high. No wonder folks are flocking to Arkansas. Talk about a Weimaresque rate of inflation, L.A.'s got it, while our L.A. (lower Arkansas) still awaits the development of its full potential. Duck-hunting and deer season can only go so far when it comes to attracting industry and visitors. But comparisons, statistical and otherwise, are odious, for they leave out the most relevant factor: Homo sapiens arkansis, known in these parts by a variety of less scientific-sounding appellations from Arkie to Arkansan to Arkansawyer. Take your pick. It's still a free country, or was last time some of us dared look about in this Year One of the Age of Trump. Discriminating wanderers have been making it to Arkansas since the likes of Hernando de Soto, for a skull found on a sandbar in the Red River a couple of years ago indicates that a Caddo Indian made his way up or maybe down the river back in the 17th century. It's not known whether he had a subscription to U.S. News & World Report, but then as now word-of-mouth and some personal advice may carry far more weight than distant reports, no matter how pseudo-authoritative. The wandering tradition goes on today, for a party of dove hunters discovered the skull while meandering along the Red River a coupla-three years ago. After the skull first went to the state's crime lab in Little Rock, it was sent to the Center for Human Identification at the University of North Texas in Denton back in 2014, where the university's Forensic Anthropology Department could follow the trail left by this skull. Oh, if only it could talk, as doubtless it once did. To quote an anthropologist-cum-moralist named Hamlet on the fate of an old friend and mentor: "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? Your songs? Your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that." But what else is there to do but laugh at man's--and woman's--vanity even in the face of the angel of death? For we are creatures of life and light. Even when our spark goes out, we leave behind memories that haunt and cheer by turn, but are never quite extinguished. Thank you, alert reader My thanks go to Alert Reader, who noted that I had confused George Orwell's 1984 with his fable Animal Farm in a recent column. And my apologies to ever indulgent readers of this inky wretch's efforts. ------------v------------ Paul Greenberg is the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer and columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

News Business Business News Warren Buffett quadruples investment in Apple and boosts stakes in airlines To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Jonathan Stempel Wednesday 15 February 2017 12:34 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The billionaire investor also boosted stakes seed maker Monsanto and Sirius Getty Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year's fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple and increasing its stake sevenfold in the four biggest US airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of 31 December that would now be worth $7.74bn, up from just 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier. Berkshire also reported a $9.3bn airline stake, with investments topping $2.1bn in each of American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Continental. Read more Donald Trump tried to call out Warren Buffett It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings and seed company Monsanto, which is being bought by Germany's Bayer. Though it is unclear who made which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12bn of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola and International Business Machines are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years.

The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple's 10 biggest investors. “I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position,” said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11bn of assets, including 12 per cent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on 14 December. The plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 per cent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1bn paper profit in 2017 alone. Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals. GREG WOOD/AFP/Getty Images 3/32 Tim Cook met Theresa May and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit - Thursday February 9 The chief executive of Apple has told Prime Minister Theresa May that he is “very optimistic” about the UK’s future outside of the European Union. Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 4/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The investigation comes after online fashion retailer Asos was accused last year of exploitative working practises with staff reportedly unable to take regular water and toilet breaks for fears of missing targets. The company denied those allegations. Getty Images 7/32 Tesco to buy wholesaler Booker in £3.7bn deal to create 'UK's leading food business' - Friday January 27 Britain's biggest retailer announced that it was merging with Booker, the UK's top food wholesaler, in a £3.7bn deal. In a joint statement, the two companies said that the combined group would bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers, and colleagues, and deliver “significant value to shareholders”. Tesco 8/32 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed. Alison Cooper received a total pay package of £5.5m in the last financial year, up from £3.6m the year before. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February.

In morning trading in the US, the index added around 0.5 percent to surpass the psychologically important threshold and take its gains since this time last year to 23.8 per cent according to Thomson Reuters data. Thomson Reuters Eikon 10/32 HSBC to close 62 high street branches in 2017 resulting in up to 180 job cuts - Tuesday January 24 HSBC plans to close 62 branches this year, resulting in up to 180 job losses, in response to the rising popularity of online and mobile banking, the bank announced on Tuesday. In a statement, HSBC said that over the past five years, the number of customers using HSBC branches had fallen by almost 40 per cent and 93 per cent of customers’ contact with the bank is now done on the telephone, internet or via smartphone. A total of 97 per cent of cash withdrawals are made via an ATM. Getty Images 11/32 Theresa May criticised by top economists for trying to ‘have her cake and eat it' with Brexit - Wednesday January 18 Top economists and strategists have warned that Theresa May’s vision of Brexit lacks credibility and clarity, a day after the Prime Minister delivered an agenda-setting speech on Britain’s future outside the EU.

Rex It had been widely believed that Berkshire's initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1bn for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, once a Combs investment. “It's quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren,” Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy – though, he has said, profitable – investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was “in large part” his decision to dive back into airlines. “The industry was once balkanised, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realise that an empty seat is a perishable asset,” Russo said. “More planes are travelling more full.” Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8bn stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores.

About 15 years ago, or maybe a little less, the Boyd Acres neighborhood on Bend’s north end faced emerging issues that could have radically altered traffic and development patterns in the area. A Wal-Mart Supercenter had been proposed on Cooley Road. Juniper Ridge was considered the most likely site of Central Oregon’s first four-year university. And the Oregon Department of Transportation was planning a new interchange where U.S. Highway 20 and U.S. Highway 97 come together. Years later, nothing much has happened on any of those fronts. The Wal-Mart proposal has been on hold for years, OSU-Cascades’ campus is open on the opposite side of town and development at Juniper Ridge remains sparse, while ODOT is still years and hundreds of millions of dollars away from building an interchange. So last week, when Boyd Acres Neighborhood Association board members gathered around a table at a strip mall cafe along N. Third Street to plot out their requests of city government, they focused entirely on the main east-west route through the neighborhood — Empire Avenue. As one of a few neighborhoods in Bend that includes “a little bit of everything,” in the words of association board member Joette Storm, the area is well-positioned to become the kind of self-contained, walkable and bikable neighborhood the city is trying to encourage. Getting Empire Avenue right is a big part of that, Storm said, particularly when the city decides to move forward on its longer-term plan to extend Empire through to NE 27th Street. Better bike and pedestrian routes along Empire and a Cascades East Transit route along the street are needed. Roundabouts are needed where Empire intersects Boyd Acres Road, and at Purcell Avenue where Empire now ends in a T-intersection. Board member Larry Kierulff, who served back when the association’s plate was piled high with bigger issues, said taking a narrower focus makes it more likely that the association can get results that make a difference in residents’ day-to-day lives. “We’d like to see improvements in our lifetimes, you know?” Kierulff said. One of the largest neighborhoods in the city, Boyd Acres straddles both sides of U.S. Highway 97 and U.S. Highway 20 and is named after Charles Boyd, who came to the region in 1904 and began ranching cattle on 6 acres along the Deschutes River. Boyd’s ranch eventually grew to 600 acres. The buildings that once formed the core of his operations were moved a short distance in the late 1970s and now sit just north of the Bend River Promenade. The Swalley, North Unit and the Pilot Butte canals all split off from the Deschutes River just outside Boyd Acres and traverse the neighborhood, including the stretch of the Pilot Butte Canal that was added to the National Register of Historic Places early last year. The Riverhouse and its convention center are here, as is the Deschutes County jail, the Bend River Promenade and the Cascade Village Shopping Center. One of the Bend Park & Recreation District’s largest parks, Pine Nursery, is tucked into the neighborhood’s southeast corner, while the district’s still-in-development Riley Ranch Nature Preserve is just past the neighborhood’s western boundary. Both board member Joette Storm and board president Don Leonard said one of the biggest factors in their decisions to move to Boyd Acres was a desire to live in a newer house and to avoid the maintenance demands associated with older construction. Though some older homes remain scattered across the neighborhood, the majority were built after 2000. Construction flatlined during the recession, Storm said, and with the prospect of new development out of the picture, interest in the neighborhood association dwindled. Now that construction is picking up — and in a big way, with 130 apartment units along Empire set to be complete by summer — she said residents are again starting to take notice. Jeff Silverman is one of those new residents, having moved to the area in June and joining the board a short time later. He said he’s been charmed by his interactions with his neighbors, even small things like maintaining eye contact when passing on the street, and wanted to do what he could to encourage that openness. “I’ve never lived in a neighborhood that’s so friendly, engaged and supportive,” he said. “So when the opportunity arose, I readily said yes.” Leonard said the association still needs to do a better job of reaching out to residents living west of Highway 97, where issues like development and traffic along Empire Avenue are less pressing. To that end, the association has made a point of inviting city officials to address their monthly meetings, giving neighborhood residents an opportunity to learn about city-wide issues and neighborhood concerns. Storm said new arrivals to the neighborhood have at times been surprised to discover the degree of access to decision makers they have in Bend, and are warming up — albeit slowly — to recognizing how the association can help amplify their voices. “If you come here from a bigger place, you may have some misconceptions about what’s possible,” she said. — Reporter: 541-383-0387, shammers@bendbulletin.com This is part of a series on Bend’s 13 neighborhood associations and the issues facing the residents of those neighborhoods.

Fun fact There are no brew pubs in Boyd Acres — Bridge 99 Brewery has a small tasting room at its facility on Layton Avenue — but the neighborhood produces much of Bend’s beer. Bridge 99, 10 Barrel, Boneyard, Crux, North Rim, Oblivion and Monkless Belgian Ales all do the bulk of their brewing in the industrial park off Empire Avenue. A tasting room is in the works at the 10 Barrel brewery along Northeast 18th Street. 16411145 View next article in Local/State     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 15 February 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Netflix, Amazon fuel LA office demand as streaming flourishes by nicole piper Boom times: The space streaming companies like Netflix and Amazon lease has evolved from the small offices of a few years ago to the giant production facilities typically associated with traditional Hollywood studios. — AFP House of Cards needs more room.  Netflix Inc, the streaming service that’s home to the political drama, last month leased an entire five-story office building in Hollywood, less than three months after signing a decade-long deal for adjacent stages and production offices, bringing its total space in the Sunset Bronson Studios complex to more than 500,000 square feet (46,500 square meters) – roughly the size of five Wal-Mart stores.  The surge in online television viewing is spurring a wave of big real estate deals, as companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc and Google snap up space to cope with increased production demands. The amount of office space the entertainment industry occupies in Los Angeles County has climbed to the most this decade, with media tenants in 25.5 million square feet, up 2.99 million square feet from five years earlier, according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc.  The space the streaming companies lease has evolved from the small offices of a few years ago to the giant production facilities typically associated with traditional Hollywood studios.  “The sort of boom around those marketplaces has been specific to the digital media and the entertainment world converging with the technology world,” said Victor Coleman, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties Inc, Netflix’s landlord at Sunset Bronson Studios.  The surge in leasing by entertainment companies reaches from downtown L.A. and Hollywood to Playa Vista, once a stretch of marshland between Los Angeles International Airport and Venice that’s become known as “Silicon Beach” because of an influx of media companies and digital startups. Entertainment-industry growth has helped an office market hurt by a years-long exodus of traditional users of corporate space, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and defence contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which moved to Virginia.  Like Netflix, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures set up offices in Hollywood, while Amazon Studios is in Santa Monica and producers of original shows for Hulu’s service have used space at Culver City’s historic Culver Studios, where classics such as Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane were filmed.   Netflix’s expanded Southern California facilities will be spread across multiple buildings at Sunset Bronson Studios, former home of Warner Bros. Studios, where The Jazz Singer, the movie industry’s first “talkie,” was filmed in 1927.  “What’s going on in LA now is very similar to what we saw many years ago, when the cable companies were growing rapidly,” said Jeff Pion, a vice chairman at Los Angeles-based CBRE. Rising demand for digital content, and the additional production that comes with it, mirrors the era when cable subscriptions climbed and new TV channels brought viewers more options, he said.  Google, Facebook  Hollywood isn’t alone in offering historic facilities to new-media companies. Playa Vista – where companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and Yahoo! Inc now have space – is on land that once was an airstrip for pilot and movie producer Howard Hughes, an allure not lost on its current tenants.  “Everyone wants to work where Howard Hughes was,” said Alison Girard, Brookfield Residential’s director of marketing for Playa Vista. “They want to come to a place with a story.”  Google was one of the first companies to migrate south from Silicon Valley in 2003, initially setting up shop in Santa Monica before moving to Venice Beach. In 2014, it acquired 12 acres (4.9 hectares) in Playa Vista, including the hangar where Hughes built his “Spruce Goose” airplane.  Google’s YouTube unit also has about 41,000 square feet next door under a long-term lease. Last week, real estate developer Tishman Speyer announced that it leased more than 50,000 square feet of creative office space in Playa Vista to Loyola Marymount University for its School of Film and Television graduate programs.  Demand for space is being bolstered by both commercial and critical successes for the streaming services. Netflix signed up a record 7.05 million new customers in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ estimates for domestic and international growth to cap the company’s first year as a global online-TV service. Its show House of Cards, an Emmy nominee for outstanding drama series last year, returns for a fifth season in May.  Amazon, meanwhile, last month made history by becoming the first online-video service to receive an Academy Awards best picture nomination, for Manchester by the Sea, which secured a total of six Oscar nominations.  Running Dogs  Entertainment companies have very different demands from those of older LA tenants like Hilton, Northrop and Occidental Petroleum Co, which moved to Houston in 2015. In Playa Vista, offices are spacious and relaxed, with young people in leggings and beanies working on their laptops while lounging on couches, sunk into beanbag chairs or perched on bar stools. Neon signs with inspirational phrases hang on the walls, while sliding doors link indoor dining rooms to outdoor patios strewn with hammocks and foliage. Employees’ dogs run from room to room.  “Our mom and dads’ office space is not the office space we want to work in today,” said Brookfield’s Girard, adding that the style once favoured mostly by technology and media companies is catching on with traditional office tenants. “Now banks and lawyers want creative space too.”  YouTube proximity  Streaming service and content producer Fullscreen Inc moved into its Playa Vista offices almost two years ago, and CEO George Strompolos said the open floor plan and modern amenities fostered the kind of creativity that drives the company’s business model. Proximity to YouTube and other similar companies was also a big draw.  “We kind of liked the idea of what was brewing with the Silicon Beach community,” Strompolos said. “We like our neighbours, most of which are collaborators, some of which are competitors. It keeps it interesting.”  Cheryl Idell, West Coast lead of marketing firm MindShare, which moved from Santa Monica to Playa Vista in June 2015, also said the open spaces allow for collaboration and a more relaxed environment. CBRE’s Pion predicted that older media companies such as CBS Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc will start to retool their offices to offer the type of amenities millennials have come to expect, and some companies have already taken steps in that direction.  Warner Music Group leased a 257,000-square-foot renovated Ford auto plant in downtown LA’s trendy Arts District, and Viacom Inc has consolidated its West Coast operations, which were scattered across the region, from Burbank to Santa Monica, into one central Hollywood office building leased from Kilroy Realty Corp.  New model  “You’ve got all the existing studio companies, which is Sony, Fox, Disney and Warner Bros., and they’re not just going to say, 'OK, we’re going to stick to the old model,’” said Coleman, the Hudson Pacific CEO, whose company had 42.2% of its tenants in the tech industry and 13.6% in entertainment last year.  The expansion of streaming companies’ office space has coincided with LA’s efforts to attract more production. Last year, revised incentives were introduced, which led to 6.2% more shooting days than in 2015, while the number of feature films shot in LA jumped 12%, according to FilmL.A. Inc, the official film office for the city and county.  New media, however, has used few tax incentives, with only Hulu’s Citizen, Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why and Amazon’s Good Girls Revolt, which has been cancelled, receiving subsidies last year, said Philip Sokoloski, a FilmL.A. spokesman.  The convergence of entertainment and tech has created new outlets for production while also leading to greater use of office space. Technological advancements have scaled down the number of people required to work on sound stages and boosted demand for offices as employees move behind computers. Still, not all buildings are benefiting.  Traditional office properties are still coping with high vacancies, with younger workers expecting the catered food, open floor plans and ultra-casual dress codes that are rare in towers home to accounting and law firms.  David Simon, executive vice president of Southern California for Los Angeles-based Kilroy, Viacom’s landlord, said some traditional office buildings “can be transformed” for companies seeking looser, more creative space – as long as landlords have “the right vision and the right capital.” In the meantime, media and tech tenants will continue to seek space in places like Hollywood and the Arts District as they seek to produce content in the entertainment capital of the world.  “They’re all looking, and they’re all coming,” Hudson Pacific’s Coleman said. “We’re in a pretty strong wind tunnel and we’ve got it blowing behind us.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Facebook shutters hundreds of Oculus VR demo stations at Best Buy stores Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Others Also Read Spanish giants to host coaching clinics at college in Negri Sembilan Only hard work can save Foxes from drop, says Pearson Cops: Detained taxi driver is boyfriend of second woman advertisement Latest News Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

An heiress serve. Dot com. If you missed it earlier Rick Carlisle and at some praise for the Boston Celtic went to the speed as mavericks last night or white or personal and to say the best coach in the NBA that Carl is he's he's a guard Austin show little politics in this. Options as is Rick Carlisle said doctor Christensen the upper. It is up let's vote Mike did wanted to instead this cut obeyed Michael hall as we. They're very good offensive team one of the best and they had a poor they are legitimate chance to get to the finals without team pot east. It's it's it's a very very good basketball team. You know we're sitting here around say Memorial Day. And the Celtics are still play yeah. Go getting close to June and there's still playing meaningful basketball game Tuesday. Michaels I didn't listen to you in February. In America listens if you have it in the NBA five days or go to player they don't have a chance of beating Cleveland they had the home court advantage. While conference finals. Well I understand at least you have a legitimate guy and a quarter down Rick Carlisle August 2 or third that's ultimately in the league. College last night number three Kansas stormed back from a late deficit to beat West Virginia needed overtime thriller but late in the game. When the jayhawks were down some of the fans are to leave the game that didn't sit for a while the experienced it myself. You have to talk about it clips talent field out people who are leaving early believing I would do a blue. Who should know since Dolan. Well when all the quality bells will look. Oh just what confuse what's going out. People actually pull up. Exactly and I walked out of the suits. QB just the front were concerned the. Parade to. I don't last long yeah. Yeah walking out on the kids is what they are these kids are better now that by tells national broadcaster that's correct you show. So. If this is gonna make that comment is probably should be right now they might ultimately can't figure out oil. Or oil slick is well oiled. All of them to be acutely to my town. Bill Walton tonight. The pistons don't adjust to them. But there. Has to be politically. It's just the duo now I don't think I don't want to come back. Reform Bill Walton talk about how many minutes 10%. Less let the actress. Christina. Talk about the dead. To rid of that at all analyst at the target is gonna talk about how weak should be legalized nationally. But what happened and he's gonna talk about his kids you'll feel like it was gets but it is a big passes while fuel dies that'll that'll total. That. Big news for that and I'd bills analyses were not document HBO about the life and times. On wrestler on for the guy that likely means two hours worth of jams like these. The reaction of the average person. When they see you like when you go into a bar or something. Un bureau they the Iraq. Do you find that people are are. Frightened by you are or do they wanna pick a fight with you never. What do what do they say when human years or when they see you. You can root groups of them are here. What about traveling you hotel beds they need a problem at all. The walls. Some women who defend any harm missiles there. Don't. Students from doors and room. My favorite story of under the giant. Is there's a hotel new York and a couple people confirmed he got to write programs. Two rooms one no sleep and do redo and the other one strictly to use the bath. And he couldn't use the toilets. So. He had to it'd drop Duke's. In the top. Line. By line is it was confirmed by multiple sources. I don't yet. Like that all that. Then it.

The great enjoy your dinner guys. For the first out of the patriots came back he would answerable 51 bill. Appeared ESP and it finally had the chance to comment on oracle Bristol ease the oracle pull it complementary. Of the patriots and Tom Brady well kinda. Well they've obviously done a tremendous job. It's hard to compare. On. Times in it in time you know it's hard to compare generations. But I'll say this about Tom Brady. I don't think I've ever seen in my lifetime. At quarterback who has more killer instinct that Tom Brady if you handed him a gift. Which is what the falcons this. He doesn't cashing in at Wal-Mart he goes right to Tiffany's. Neiman Marcus I. It's gonna take your wallet your ring your watch everything that ferries that take you will take for you and he does it. Virtually every other week in the National Football League no one's ever been better. And bringing his team to a fever pitch and taking advantage of mistakes that the opposition makes. Well that's high praise given. Your history and working alongside Peyton Manning who did so many of the same things that. Is it fair to say that there's just attack he does it take above at the next level when it comes to taking advantage of opportunity. Audio no question about that and his team believes in them so much that they will perform. Above and beyond. In that situation. And you know lady luck always seems to be on their side you know why because they create their own life. Once people give them that if they are going cash it and they believe in him. Super Bowl as a gift when he walked Wendy yes jolt take Tutsis. Oracle and Bristol. The woody woody couple minutes Albert Young was having the killer at stake. Well that Hillary figured everybody and what you get them fixed yet so basically the dog cat it and it Wal-Mart yet. As the game one of the art institute is weird cases of which one of those businesses where the most. Wal-Mart I don't know enough. Wal-Mart down. Two went. It away. I did it better I don't like it. Gift walk and play lock all. And justly if the giants of the law. Speaker that's admirable still lot of chatter out there about members the patriots not attending the forthcoming. White House ceremony but former NFL tied at Gonzales. The players should attend especially. If they don't like Donald from. I think you know they don't wanna go to their right for me I think it's. Plums go there and didn't think them that opportunity. It's your boys to get her I don't think we need people like I would never talk to them when it's Heidi do you expect move forward. No and actually. The chance to talk to look good sequence. So we'll talk to my littlest pet it and we're probably not good. Boy that they still. The group moon. Knowledge of you don't have the opportunity thoughts over the Atlantic sit out today of about 225 seconds policy. Talk falsely or when he's you include Louise do you think it is dividends paid about. The patriots just erupted. Yeah they all. They God's eyes both of them yeah I don't or we mentioned earlier that operates a part mates hourlong podcast with Peter King on the edit QB site. Part one Davies today they discussed the horrible 51 in depth including the ridiculous catch Julio Jones made late in the game. Did you see the Julio Jones catch. I saw Matt step up as watching him in houses right on our sideline that he wrote an open the pocket it will right. Threw the ball which then I kind of looked through much of bodies. And I saw him obviously make the catch and I saw both of rats running in signal catch. And I said there's no way and he every kid like there's no way he caught that ball. And she looked up on those screens. And then they showed it once or twice a Mike it forget it into. I've only. They have great recording equipment. That's no doubt heard clear grizzard a little strong somewhere in Montana somewhere around disclosed even now don't you trust them and against reform I can't just reported overnight now on on idea I don't think it's like the middle no. And I thought hey it could take again bearcats. You know that to get it feels that the car. Maybe if I get out of here the party going us you know breeders' go up item line twelve miles up the road you won't see any signs at twelve miles up the road again after a quick right gap and there's like a little like bed and breakfast lunch just a great spot a spot.

(KTRK) KTRK Tuesday, February 14, 2017 06:39PM TOMBALL (KTRK) -- A new Walmart is set to open Wednesday with high-tech features, but many in the area believe the store will change the place they've considered home. Residents near the location on Kuykendahl Road signed a petition against the building of the store. A Facebook page was also created to fight the issue. Others in the area are welcoming the new Walmart. "There are a lot of families that live here and say the mother is making spaghetti, or corn muffins, or whatever and she runs out of ingredients, if she has an older child they can walk right over there," Linda said. She has concerns about the possibility of increased crime in the area. "Everybody needs to be aware of their surroundings," she added.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Time to dive back into anonymous mail Thursday Feb 16, 2017 at 1:01 AM It’s that wonderful time of the year when a reader sends in a letter with no return address, no signature and spouting nothing but hate. Once again, this is an anonymous letter sent to the Daily Globe. The letter refers to a Sunday article, which already questions the intelligence of the reader, as the Daily Globe does not have a Sunday edition. It’s the first sentence in the letter. I wish the author had stopped there, because we already knew from that first sentence that whatever came next would have no intelligent argument. None. Zero. Proven by what came next. It is a two-page diatribe about Hispanics and Muslims — although called Mexicans and Somalians by the author — which accuses Muslim women of shoplifting everything they can from Walmart. They accuse Hispanics of procreation without marriage so the women and children can remain on welfare and also go on to say shopping in our community and in Garden City is hard to do as Hispanics don’t speak English. The author goes on about others receiving free health care for Hispanics and Muslims and free school lunches. The author is upset because "the women and children all have smart phones," but "I can’t afford a smart phone." The author is also upset that "Mexican men send money back to Mexico." Shouldn’t anyone who works be allowed to send their money anywhere they want to? The most ridiculous statement in the letter is this: "Us Americans that have worked all our lives should be the ones getting welfare. We paid into our country for years. They shouldn’t get welfare or anything, let them work or go back where they came from." So, Americans should get welfare while immigrants should do all the work? I’m confused. We don’t pay into welfare, we work all our lives and pay into Social Security. Then, when we retire, we get that money back. I have no idea how the two are considered the same thing. The problem I have is the generalization of an entire group. Many of my neighbors are Hispanic and work hard for their money. They work in local businesses, buy groceries in local stores and frequent our movie theater, stores, restaurants and so on. They are not on welfare. Some of the hardest working people I’ve ever met are Somalian. Yes, most are Muslim, but that doesn’t take anything away from their work ethic. Now, my guess to the letter writer’s focus is because they live in Dodge City and see the many different races, religions and nationalities in our community. Instead of embracing cultural difference, they see changes to a community they don’t like and blame all the changes on others. I had an argument with a friend earlier this week. He believes Trump being elected president has allowed racism to come back. I say racism never left. An African-American male looks at the world different than a caucasian male. A Muslim applauds freedom of religion, but also knows many in America look at them as nothing more than terrorists. The reality is racism never left our nation. The situation is better as younger generations embrace one another and understand we are all human, no matter where we came from. Focus has shifted somewhat in the nation, however. We want to ban Muslims from coming here. We want to build a wall to stop Mexicans from coming into our country. I have a hard time with either concept. Yes, I am caucasian and Christian. I don’t discriminate. Christianity tells us to accept others and to treat all as we want to be treated, yet some spiritual leaders have forgotten that part of the Bible. Racism has never left our nation. Acceptance of others has creeped into our consciousness, but it hasn’t reached all Americans. As a nation, we must embrace our fellow man. A citizen of the US must accept all other citizens of our nation, no matter where they originated. We must accept all religions. We must accept the differences in us all and defend our fellow citizens’ rights to be different. After all, united we stand, divided we fall.

(@philwahba) From Tom's Reading List Financial Times: Trump and the tax plan that threatens to divide corporate America — "Republicans are still promising the most sweeping changes since the Reagan reforms of 1986. But the only firm proposal on the table  — from the House of Representatives — includes a 20 per cent tax on imports." Forbes: OMG! House Republicans are preparing to hit consumers with a horrible new tax that will harm Trump and hurt the economy  — "Importers will no longer be allowed to deduct an item as a business expense. To simplify things, let's say a store imports a pair of sneakers for $40 and then sells them for $50, making a $10 profit on which it would owe taxes. Under the Republican plan, however, the retailer wouldn't be able to deduct the $40 it paid for the sneakers. In fact, it would owe taxes on the entire $50! And who, ultimately, pays this tax? You, the consumer, in the form of higher prices or fewer choices of where you can shop." Tax Policy Center: Understanding the Republicans’ corporate tax reform proposals — "Rough estimates suggest that setting the DBCFT rate at around 30 percent for all businesses would eliminate the revenue shortfall ... The corporate tax is ripe for reform. The DBFCT is an excellent way to kick-start the needed discussion." This program aired on February 16, 2017. +Join the discussion Share View comment(s) Support the news   Next Up Where to now?

(WOFL FOX 35) - A controversial proposal that would allow liquor to be sold in grocery stores was nearly capped in its first House committee as lawmakers expressed concerns about who could handle the bottles. The House Career & Competition Subcommittee voted 8-7 Wednesday to approve the proposal (HB 81), but Rep. Bryan Avila, the bill's sponsor, said he would try to change the plan before its next committee vetting. “There is plenty of time to make sure we get the right fit in place,” Avila, R-Hialeah, told reporters after the meeting. The contentious and heavily lobbied proposal --- sought by Wal-Mart and Target, and opposed by Lakeland-based Publix and Orlando-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits --- seeks to end a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, an issue commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." A wider ranging measure (SB 106) that also seeks to end the separation is ready for a full Senate vote. Proponents contend abolishing the law is necessary to provide more convenience to shoppers, reduce regulations and save businesses money. Opponents argue, among other things, that the change will drive independent liquor stores of business and result in minors illegally getting access to liquor. Rep. Jay Trumbull, R-Panama City, voted for the bill but said he'd support changes that would limit the ability of convenience stores to obtain liquor licenses and restrict access to small liquor bottles. Trumbull also said the bill's implementation date --- July 1, 2017 --- should be delayed “to give people the ability to react to what is coming down the pike.” Rep. Julio Gonzalez, a Venice Republican who voted against the plan, said he hasn't heard from a single individual complaining about an inability to get liquor in Florida. And he said the measure should be closer to a compromise struck last year, but which failed to pass, that would have maintained a current prohibition banning anyone under the age of 21 from handling or selling alcohol. “I think (this) bill is even worse,” Gonzalez said.  “Now you're telling me that a 16-year-old can sell alcohol, under supervision.” Also voting against the bill, Rep. Randy Fine said that while he's “okay with sin,” those pushing for the proposal are simply seeking to increase liquor sales. “I predict that you will see a 50- or 100- or 200-percent increase,” in liquor sales, said Fine, R-Palm Bay. “Why? Because today, people can't make an impulse purchase of hard liquor. You actually have to choose to go to the liquor store.” Target lobbyist Jason Unger said the Minnesota-based company wants to provide shoppers with more convenience. And Monesia Brown, who represents Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is trying to be innovative. “When online sales in 2016 exceeded in-store purchases, and we expect that trend to continue, it is critical that we pursue opportunities to meet customers where they are,” Brown said. Publix lobbyist Lindsey Napier said there is no demand for the change that would alter the business model of the company that has spent millions to operate its separate grocery and liquor stores. “This bill seeks to change that level playing field into a system that suits the business models of large big box stores and gives them an advantage over other businesses,” Napier said. “To try to incorporate liquor items into our stores, to compete, we would have to lose a lot of other inventory that big box stores do not.”       Information from The News Service of Florida.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Rare Florida panther spotted in The Villages Changes ahead for grocery store liquor sales bill Palm Bay man injured in shooting involving police 3 teens charged with stealing guns during school Woman locked inside CVS after store closes Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Out of that 34,000 more than 7,500 stayed in Fayetteville making it the most popular place to stay in the state. The company said Little Rock saw more than 4,100 guests and Hot Springs had nearly 3,400. Melissa Thomey used to live in Hot Springs, but now has an Airbnb space in her home on North Washington Avenue. “Actually I’m shocked and I figured Hot Springs would have had more people," said Thomey, "But you get the university, you get people coming for Walmart. I get quite a few people coming in to work. There’s Crystal Bridges, there’s hiking, there’s just a lot to do up here.” When she decided to rent her extra space on the site, she said she did not realize how many people used it. She says many of her guests come from surrounding states like Texas or Oklahoma. Thomey explained many are in the area just to get away or to do something with the university. Hosts Andrew D'Acquisto and Doris Nellon said the same thing. They have rented their extra South Hill apartment for the past six months. They said the space they, and others on the site, provide can give something that maybe a hotel could not. “When they are here maybe they feel more like they belong, you know that they’re at home," said D'Acquisto. The couple said seeing these high numbers is a good thing for the state. “Arkansas is like a well kept secret in the U.S. A lot of people are finding out that Arkansas is the natural state," said Nellon, "There’s just so many things to do here in our state.” Airbnb said Fayetteville earned close to $907,000, with Little Rock following at $456,200, and Hot Springs earning $362,900.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which has been aggressively expanding. Both offer low prices by focusing on store-label products rather than name brands. Aldi has also been adding items to include gluten-free products and fresh produce. Lidl’s first 20 U.S. stores will open in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its U.S. headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. Lidl operates about 10,000 stores in 27 countries. Both Lidl and Aldi have been aggressively expanding in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a fierce price war has hurt Wal-Mart’s Asda business as well as traditional local retailers. Aldi, which opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976, now has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. and plans to increase that to nearly 2,000 by the end of 2018.

She was revived and taken to the hospital. There was no evidence of drug use at the home, but the woman, 20, later said she had snorted heroin. She said she had not used in a month but when she was at the Sunoco on SOM Center Road earlier in the day, she saw a man that resembled a drug dealer and asked him if he had any heroin. She said she bought $20 worth of it from him. When asked how he looked like a drug dealer, she told police "he just looked like one." Officers spoke to the clerk at Sunoco and he said he did not remember seeing the woman or the suspect she described. Theft, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to the Giant Eagle parking lot Feb. 6 for a report of four shoplifters who were loading $583.62 worth of groceries into a taxi. An employee said the suspects gave the groceries back and then asked why employees were still calling police. Each of the Cleveland residents, two men and two women, were charged with theft. Most said they were stealing to help pay bills. The taxi driver said he picked the group up in Cleveland. He said he has picked them up on previous occasions and they always ask to be taken to Giant Eagle stores. Assault, Marsol Road: A Mayfield Heights man, 21, was arrested for assault and resisting arrest in the Drake apartment parking lot Feb. 5. Officers had responded to the area after a report of an unspecified disturbance between the man and his girlfriend in their apartment. Forgery, Mayfield Road: The owner of Best Gyros said Feb. 4 a former employee had passed two fraudulent checks. They were cashed in the same amount as the man's final paycheck, which was issued in December. Officers said the check numbers and dates had been altered on the fraudulent checks. The suspect is a Willoughby Hills man, 33, who has two active warrants and a criminal history. The incident is under review by the detective bureau. Theft, SOM Center Road: Toys R Us employees reported Feb. 5 a man stole a battery-operated dirt bike and ran from them with it when they approached him in the parking lot. Responding officers located the suspect in Walmart, where he had entered and left the dirt bike at the front of the store. The Cleveland man, 41, was arrested for the theft, valued at $499. Impaired driving, Interstate-271: Officers located a vehicle stuck in the snow around 2 a.m. Feb. 1 and determined it had been driving south in the northbound lanes. The driver, a 23-year-old Broadview Heights woman, was subsequently arrested for OVI and reasonable control. A prescription bottle, containing suspected marijuana, was located in the vehicle's center console. Pandering obscenity involving a minor, Fruitland Avenue: A woman said Jan. 31 her eight-year-old son was receiving text messages on his cell phone from an unknown person who was asking him to send pictures of his genitals. In one text message, the sender indicates he is 11-years-old. The boy said the sender of the message is someone he met while playing a video game on Xbox Live and he gave him his phone number. Officers told the woman they would pay special attention to her residence and the matter would be thoroughly investigated. Traffic offense, Sunset Road: Officers stopped a man's vehicle while he was pulling it into his driveway Jan. 30 because they were aware he had an active warrant out of Warrensville Heights. The vehicle became stuck in snow in the apron of the driveway. Officers began speaking with the man, 41, at the rear of the vehicle. However, at one point, he hurried back to the vehicle and grabbed something and placed it into his pocket. He then tried to get into his home and wrestled with officers as they tried to stop him. Two bindles of suspected narcotics were located inside his pockets. The man was subsequently cited for driving under suspension and no operator's license. His wife came outside to see what was happening and she was also found to have an active warrant from the same city. They were both arrested and turned over to Warrensville Heights police. Charges for resisting arrest are expected to be added against the man. Theft, SOM Center Road: A Five Guys Burgers & Fries employee reported Jan. 30 she had $148 stolen from her wallet while she was at work. She said a manager had secured the wallet in the store's safe during her shift because she did have a pocket on her pants. A second manager, a 24-year-old East Cleveland woman, has been arrested in connection with the theft. Theft, Teal Trace: A woman reported Jan. 28 she believed personal checks had been stolen from her mailbox because she learned somebody had cashed one of them for $350. The check had been made out to a man, whom she believed to be a neighbor. Officers spoke to that man, 41, who initially claimed a friend that was staying with him stole the checks. When officers questioned him about inconsistencies in his story, he admitted he stole the checks and deposited one of them. He said was a recovering alcoholic and relapsed the previous week and that was why he stole the checks. He was subsequently charged with theft. Violation of a temporary protection order, Commonwealth Avenue: A woman said Jan. 30 her husband was in violation of a temporary protection order by sending her unwanted text messages and making a derogatory comment on Facebook about her being a stripper. A warrant was subsequently filed against the Willoughby man, 28, for violation of a protection order. See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

It’s a career choice Mann stands by to this day, as his love for basketball has reemerged alongside his strong faith. "It wasn’t a popular decision, but it was something that I felt led in my heart to do," said Marcus Mann. "So I just followed through with it." Since saying goodbye to the NBA the day before his career was set to begin, the former Mississippi Valley State star has spent the last two decades nurturing lives across Mississippi, including the last three years as a pastor in his hometown of Carthage.   And while the “what ifs” have naturally crept in, he’s put at ease by recalling all the people he's inspired along the way. "We walk in Walmart and a guy will walk up and say ‘Mr. Mann, Mr. Mann, do you remember when you said this and when you said that," Mann recalled. "You know it gives you that sense of joy in your heart that 'hey I did impact somebody’s life'." But now, competitive basketball is back in his life and when his story inevitably resurfaces, it is followed by a much different reaction. "Now it’s more like a ‘wow’ moment," Mann explained. "Especially with my daughter Myah, a lot of her friends will be like ‘Your dad played in the NBA?’." Mann can now be found in the stands at every Brandon High School game. With his only daughter Myah playing her first full varsity season, that spark has returned. "She started out playing soccer, but then one day she was like ‘Dad, I think I want to play basketball.’," Mann said. "And I started smiling from within I was like 'here we go!'. It’s brought me back to that love that I had for the game." Myah Mann: "He always supports me," Myah Mann says about her dad. "Any game I have he’s always there. So basketball you know kind of makes us close and that’s really what we like to do it. Watch and talk about basketball." College and beyond, the father-daughter duo has high hopes for where basketball may take Myah. But in the meantime, he’ll continue to reap the greater benefits of what the game could never provide. "No matter what people may think, no matter what people may say, I’m confident in where I am," said Mann. "I’m happy in where I am, and at this point in my life I’m where I’m supposed to be."   Copyright 2017 MSNewsNow.

Trending Now: Read today's most popular stories on CapitalGazette.com News Government Decision expected next week in robocall case County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka By Matthew Cole / Staff County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka (By Matthew Cole / Staff) Megan BrockettContact Reportermbrockett@capgaznews.com Defense motions rejected on day of final arguments in robocall case A District Court judge denied motions Wednesday for an acquittal and dismissal in the trial of Dennis Fusaro and Stephen Waters, Republican strategists charged with violating Maryland election law in connection with robocalls during a 2014 Anne Arundel County Council race. Judge John P. McKenna Jr. is expected to issue a decision in the misdemeanor case early next week, following closing arguments Wednesday in Annapolis. After hearing lengthy arguments from both sides Wednesday, McKenna ruled that circumstantial evidence presented by the state could support a conviction in the case, denying the defense's motion for acquittal. He also ruled against the defense's argument for dismissal, saying in part that robocalls are covered in the state statute that outlines election law requirements. Fusaro, the former campaign manager of County Councilman Michael Anthony Peroutka, and Waters, a Republican political consultant based in Virginia, are charged with violating and conspiring to violate the authority line requirements of Maryland election laws. The charges stem from an October 2014 robocall made to about 5,000 Anne Arundel County residents. The call referred to Peroutka's Democratic opponent in the District 5 race, Patrick Armstrong of Severna Park. Two men charged in 2014 robocall that targeted Peroutka's opponent Amanda Yeager Councilman says he had 'no prior knowledge' of call Councilman says he had 'no prior knowledge' of call (Amanda Yeager) Witnesses for the prosecution and other critics of the call have said they believe it was intended was to smear Armstrong, who is gay, and steer undecided voters away from him. The robocall states it was paid for by a group called Marylanders for Transgenders, which the prosecution has said does not exist. In closing arguments Wednesday, Deputy State Prosecutor Thomas M. "Mike" McDonough said Fusaro and Waters were clearly behind the call. McDonough pointed to surveillance camera video that shows the pair at a Wal-Mart days before the robocall went out. The video footage shows Fusaro buying a chocolate bar and getting cash back from the register. McDonough said that cash was then given to Waters, whom the footage shows shortly afterward buying a prepaid cellphone and handing what looks to be the change and receipt off camera, to where Fusaro was standing. McDonough said evidence and testimony show that the number of the purchased cellphone is the number that appeared on residents' caller IDs when the robocalls went out. The deputy state prosecutor argued Wednesday that Fusaro, who was promised a $2,000 victory bonus by Peroutka if he won, was the one who wanted the robocall to go out. Fusaro knew Peroutka would not have approved the call, McDonough said, and as a result went to his friend Waters to set it up. The attorneys for the defendants argued that the state has no proof Fusaro had anything to do with the robocall, but only that he went to a Wal-Mart with a friend, who had no apparent tie to the Peroutka campaign, and was there for the purchase of a phone. In order for the charges to stand, the defense said, the state would have to prove some type of agreement existed between Fusaro and Waters regarding the call. "All they have is a video," defense attorney Mandeep S. Chhabra said. The defense team made extensive arguments Wednesday on both the constitutionality of the case as it relates to free speech and on technical issues, such as whether robocalls constitute campaign material, as defined by the state. After McKenna's rulings on the defense's motions, much of the defense team's closing argument focused on the question of willfulness. The defense argued there are no Maryland statutes that address robocalls and how they must be handled when it comes to election laws. The defendants, as a result, could not have willfully committed a violation of the law, the defense said. McKenna is expected to issue a decision on the case Tuesday afternoon.

Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton's administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China's economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton's approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push "permanent normal trade relations" with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China's human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it's cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China's huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, "regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments." These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, "with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated." And "offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize." Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We're seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time's Joe Klein, to ask: "Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?" In addressing those questions, it's helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it's probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I'm a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of "earned success." It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump's trade policies, and that the answers to Joe Klein's questions aren't so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101. — Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for The Washington Examiner, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News Channel contributor and a co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

(Photo: Pool / Getty Images) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Target Corp. CEO Brian Cornell and Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly joined a half-dozen other retail executives to express “grave concerns” to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday about a proposed border adjustment tax that the retail industry says will increase costs to consumers, according to a source familiar with the closed-door meeting. The tax, a piece of a larger House Republican tax reform plan, aims to discourage companies from buying or manufacturing products outside the U.S. The border adjustment forces companies to pay taxes on the full purchase price of imported items its sells and not just on profits from those sales. It could add 20 percent to cost of imported inventory, analysts believe, forcing prices up and revenue down. In a statement Wednesday, Target said the border adjustment tax “will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials. If enacted, ... (it) would have profound implications for our guests and business.” As they came and went, Cornell and Joly were both tight-lipped about their visits to the White House and Capitol Hill. Neither man responded to reporters’ questions on the way into the West Wing meeting with Trump. Cornell came to a very brief post-meeting press appearance but did not speak. Joly did not attend the press gathering. In a lighthearted aside, a video taken as the CEOs introduced themselves showed Trump pausing after Cornell introduced himself from Target. “Tar-zhay, right?” the president said with a smile. Still, the business that brought the retail leaders to Washington was serious. “Anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America,” the Target statement said. The border tax adjustment hits companies like Target and Best Buy very hard because they import so much of their inventory. Analysts say Target is more vulnerable than its major competitor, Wal-Mart, because the retailer relies more on the sales of foreign-made clothing and housewares, while Wal-Mart does a larger business in groceries that are not imported. But the tax weighs on all retailers who import significantly. That’s why the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group set up this week’s intervention. Cornell, Joly, and CEOs Bill Rhodes of AutoZone, Marvin Ellison of J.C. Penney Co., Art Peck of Gap Inc., Stefano Pesina of Walgreen Boots Alliance, Greg Sandfort of Tractor Supply and Jill Soltau of Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Store headed from the White House to the Capitol for scheduled meetings with heads of the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who oversaw the comprehensive tax reform proposal. The move toward a more protectionist economy was one of the president’s main campaign promises. The “America first” theme of his inaugural speech bolstered that goal. The Republican tax reform pushes in the same direction. While adding taxes on the sale of imported inventory, it removes taxes on U.S. exports. It also cuts the U.S. corporate tax rate to keep companies from relocating headquarters to countries with lower tax rates. In theory, the reform plan assumes that a better trade balance and a stronger dollar will offset consumer and business cost increases caused by the border adjustment tax. But in recent statements Trump has indicated some reservations about the tax. In a tweet Wednesday he called the meeting with the retail CEOs “a great listening session.” He also promised a new tax reform proposal soon: “We’re going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category. Including personal and business.” The unintended consequences of a border adjustment tax could include hits to the bottom lines of publicly traded companies that are big importers, said Luis Resendiz, who has advised international businesses for 20 years at the Minneapolis law firm of Fredrikson & Byron. Paying $12 for the Target T-shirt that used to cost $10 or paying $1,200 for the Best Buy high definition TV that used to cost $1,000 could lead to reduced sales, he said. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2llq1MC TOP VIDEOS Joe Nardone, CEO, Wayne County Airport Authority, tours DTW 2:25 Mike Ilitch: 'I fell in love with Midwestern friendliness' 2:40 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Walking the floor at the NAIAS Charity Preview 1:00 Biden admires Detroit, 'an iconic city' 2:15 Chinese automaker GAC reveals three new vehicles 1:57 Mercedes-Benz introduces new cars 2:48 Infiniti introduces QX50 concept 1:19 2018 Honda Odyssey introduced 0:54 Nissan introduces Vmotion 2.0 concept, Rogue Sport SUV 1:25 Paul Ryan CIA chief meets Palestinians’ Abbas in first top-level talks Karin Laub Trump signs Michigan Rep.

The comments by Ninth Judicial Circuit State's Attorney Aramis D. Ayala suggest that she could seek the death penalty for Loyd, who is accused of killing a woman pregnant with his child in December and then fatally shooting a police officer during a manhunt in January. But Ayala said no decision has been made. "We are eagerly anticipating a new statute from the Florida Legislature. And at that point, we will evaluate and determine whether we are seeking death on Markeith Loyd," Ayala said at a news conference Wednesday. Markeith Loyd, center, is escorted under heavy guard after a court hearing Jan. 26 in Orlando. Florida. Red Huber / AP - pool Loyd, 41, was indicted Wednesday on first-degree murder charges in the Dec. 13 killing of Sade Dixon, 24, and the Jan. 9 shooting death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, whom authorities said Loyd killed in a Wal-Mart parking lot.

Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including three counts of first-degree murder, in the deaths of Dixon, Clayton and Dixson's unborn child, NBC affiliate WESH reported. When Loyd was arrested on Jan. 17, police video from a helicopter appeared to show two law enforcement officers kicking him as he was on the ground, and he has appeared in court with a large bandage over his left eye.

Ayala said Wednesday that the investigation is ongoing. Orlando Police Chief John Mina has said Loyd tossed two handguns to the ground before he was arrested, refused to put his hands behind his back when on the ground and was considered extremely dangerous. "In the video he's — it does look like he's having trouble crawling to where the officers are. The officers were very concerned about what was underneath him," Mina said in January. After Loyd was handcuffed and officers removed his body armor, they found a large bag of ammunition on him, "so they didn't know what was under there," he said.

Patrise Young, 37, of Port Arthur is sought for aggravated assault on a police officer for an incident that happened Sunday at Cedar Ridge Apartments. The incident began in Bridge City where a woman reportedly stole a TV from a Walmart. Bridge City Police Department contacted Port Arthur Police Department with the license plate of the vehicle that was registered to a Port Arthur woman, according to information from police. Officers located the teal colored 2000 Honda Civic with Texas plates JFH0274 at Cedar Ridge Apartments. “As they (officers) were speaking with her she jumped back in her car and accelerated as the officer was trying to remove her from the vehicle,” PAPD Officer Mike Hebert said. “As she jumped in he was thrown to the ground from the jolt of the car and all indication shows she ran over the officers legs.” The officer, Ashton Moss, has been employed with the department since 2016. He underwent surgery on the night of the incident and is still recovering from serious, non-life threatening injuries. The Honda Civic was last seen northbound on U.S. 69. The front door to the car is partly open and unable to be closed due to damage. “This went form routine to a very violent encounter in a mater of seconds,” Hebert said. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Patrise Young is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 833-TIPS. Print Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By Nina Culver ninac@spokesman.com(509) 459-5473 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS True love doesn’t usually result in felony charges, but it did for one man who led deputies on a high speed chase from the West Plains to Spokane Tuesday. Woodrow B. Bearchild, 31, told deputies after he was captured that he ran because he wanted to practice his driving skills and because he wanted to spend more time with his girlfriend on Valentine’s Day. A deputy spotted a Dodge Caravan registered to a wanted man in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Airway Heights and attempted to pull it over as it drove away. Instead the driver, later identified as Bearchild, sped through Airway Heights and then took Highway 2 to Interstate 90. He repeatedly ran red lights as he led police as far east as Market Street and as far north as Francis Avenue before his car broke down and police stopped him near Jackson Ave. and Washington, according to court documents. Deputies reportedly found a dozen hypodermic needles under the front seat, one of them filled with heroin, according to court documents. Bearchild was arrested on a felony Department of Corrections warrant and on new charges of possession of a controlled substance and attempting to elude police. The Caravan was registered to Bearchild’s father, who also has a warrant out for his arrest, said Sheriff’s Office spokesman Deputy Mark Gregory.

Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. By Darran Simon CNN (CNN) -- A central Florida grand jury has indicted Markeith Loyd in the shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend in December and Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. "What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence -- and I take domestic violence very seriously," Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence. Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt. Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him. Police Chief John Mina said the suspect "basically opened fire on her" as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton's death. Hundreds of tips poured in and a reward ballooned to $100,000 in the search. The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando's Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured. Authorities said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to one eye in the process. Loyd said he didn't resist. Orlando police said it would investigate the amount of force used to apprehend Loyd. Ayala said that case hasn't been handed over to her office. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing; she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon's death are first-degree murder with a firearm; killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother; attempted first degree-murder with a firearm; two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm; and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; carjacking with a firearm; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It's unclear whether Ayala's office would be able to seek the death penalty. In January 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled that the process used to condemn a Florida death row inmate was unconstitutional because a judge rather than a jury was the final arbiter of fact in sentencing. The 8-1 ruling came in a challenge filed by death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, who had been convicted of murdering restaurant co-worker Cynthia Harrison in 1998. The case was sent back to the Florida Supreme Court. Florida legislators then overhauled the law and allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death if 10 of 12 jurors recommended it. Last fall, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence required a unanimous jury vote, striking down the new law. A bill requiring that a jury unanimously recommend the death sentence is currently in the Legislature, CNN affiliate News 13 Orlando reported. If the jury is not unanimous, it can recommend a life sentence without parole. Ayala said prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of the bill, but will proceed with the case as planned.

The notoriously pricey grocery chain will close nine stores after six consecutive quarters of plummeting same-store sales. It seems $6 asparagus-infused water and bouquets of California ornamental kale just aren’t flying off the shelves. There’s a bitter green irony here: The organic products the chain popularized are now more popular than ever, just not at Whole Foods. Americans bought three times more organic food in 2015 than in 2005. But now, superstores like Kroger, Walmart, and Target are selling organic food at reasonable prices that threaten Whole Foods’ claim to the all-natural throne. To compete in a crowded lower-cost organic market, the company launched a new chain in April 2016: 365 by Whole Foods Market, aka Whole Foods for Broke People. The 365 stores are cheaper to build, require less staff, and offer goods at lower prices. Whole Foods may have a squeaky clean image, but that doesn’t square with its labor practices. The company has historically quashed employees’ attempts to unionize, and it sold goat cheese produced with prison labor until last April. Still, if you’ve a hankering for “Veganic Sprouted Ancient Maize Flakes,” we’re pretty sure that Whole Foods has that market cornered. Sabrina Imbler 11 hours ago Get Briefly in your inbox Privacy Policy Make the ESA great again? REUTERS/Regis Duvignau What would it mean to “modernize” the Endangered Species Act? Nothing good, conservationists say, after a Senate Committee held a hearing on the topic on Wednesday. Republicans have long criticized the 43-year-old law because protections for species have led to restrictions on drilling, mining, and logging. Now they are gearing up to change it. In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the act had kept 99 percent of endangered or threatened species from going extinct. But Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who organized the hearing, has a much more negative take, pointing out that less than 3 percent of animals and plants added to the endangered species list have recovered enough to be delisted. At the hearing, former Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal urged updates to the law like requiring more data before species can be listed. A Wisconsin beef and grain farmer, Jim Holte, spoke about the difficulties farmers face protecting livestock from wolves, whose listings have sparked legal battles. Conservationists also testified at the hearing, arguing that the law is needed to protect species like the bald eagle. And environmental groups sent a letter to Barrasso arguing that the act is effective. But Republicans seem bent on making changes. Maybe President Trump can convince them otherwise. After all, he has very strong feelings about eagles. Emma Foehringer Merchant 12 hours ago That's a tuna cash iStockphoto Dumb management of fisheries costs us up to $83 billion a year. That’s the main finding of a new World Bank report. And the people who fish for a living are paying for it. For them, overfishing is an expensive burden. They’re forced to take boats out farther from the coast to pull up fewer fish. But there’s a simple fix: agree to rules limiting the catch and watch fishing stocks rebound. Fishing becomes a more profitable business. If people agreed to close or limit catches in overfished areas, we could see these benefits: The total mass of fish would nearly triple Yearly global catch would increase 13 percent The fishing industry would rake in 30 times its current annual profits Getting people to agree to curb their catch isn’t some idealistic fantasy, it’s becoming the norm. The report found that two-thirds of fish populations are sustainably managed. It’s time to tackle that remaining third. Nathanael Johnson 13 hours ago No monkey business Shutterstock About 700 species are already being hurt by climate change. We’re not talking about a future threat, but harm that is very much happening right now, a new paper in Nature Climate Change has found. The authors reviewed 136 studies published between 1990 and 2015, and looked at modeling from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They found some shocking results: 47 percent of the land mammals and 23 percent of the birds on the threatened list are affected negatively by climate change. “Our results suggest that populations of large numbers of threatened species are likely to be already affected by climate change, and that conservation managers, planners and policy makers must take this into account in efforts to safeguard the future of biodiversity,” the paper said. The team calculated risk by looking at factors such as body mass, population numbers, and reproductive and survival rates. Primates and marsupials were found to be the most at risk because of climate change, while rodents and insect-eaters are thought to have benefitted. Great news for Pizza Rat. Not so much for Harambe. Cody Permenter 1 day ago dakota access REUTERS/Terray Sylvester The movement to divest from Dakota Access is growing, fast. Seattle got things rolling on Feb. 7, when the city council voted to end a $3 billion contract with Wells Fargo, a major bank funding the pipeline. Now more institutions are moving to pull their money away from the pipeline’s financial backers, which include many big-name banks. The city of Davis in California voted to divest around $124 million from Wells Fargo on Feb. 8, and Minneapolis and Philadelphia were reportedly considering doing the same. Later that week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was thinking about ways his city and its pension fund could divest. It’s not just cities. The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe voted to divest from Wells Fargo. A bill proposed in the California legislature would require CalPERS, the state’s big public employee retirement fund, to end up to $4 billion in investments in companies backing the pipeline. The Swedish investment group Nordea banned fund managers from investing in Dakota Access. If you want to follow suit, there’s an app for that. A San Francisco startup helps people automatically pull investments from any company funding the pipeline. The campaign seems to be working: The crowd-sourced online tracker #DefundDAPL shows total individual divestment topping $65 million. Sabrina Imbler 2 days ago wind in their sales Deepwater Wind Some Republican politicians really do like clean energy. A week after the buzzed about conservative Carbon Tax, a bipartisan group of 20 governors sent letters to President Trump and fellow governors imploring them to consider the benefits of renewables. The Governors’ Wind and Solar Energy Coalition asked the president to modernize the energy grid, support legislation to encourage offshore wind development, put funding towards renewables research, and streamline permitting. In the letter, the group attempted to appeal to Trump’s vested interest in helping the rural communities he has promised to lift up. The Coalition cites $222 million paid to rural landowners a year by the U.S. wind industry, the $156 million paid to landowners in areas of below-average income, and that 70 percent of wind farms are located in low-income counties. But based on Trump’s well-documented aversion to wind energy (never come between a real estate mogul and his golf course development), the coalition of governors may be able to gain more traction with their colleagues in state government. The letter sent to governors cited recent renewable wins in states such as Michigan, Ohio, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado — states led by Republicans and Democrats.

A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Markeith Loyd in two first-degree murder cases, Ninth Circuit State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced. Caitlin Doornbos and Gal Tziperman LotanContact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Markeith Loyd in two first-degree murder cases, Orange-Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced. Loyd, 41, is accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, in December and Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, 42, last month. Clayton was approaching Loyd on Jan. 9 when, prosecutors say, he fatally shot her at a Wal-Mart at John Young Parkway and Princeton Avenue. Ayala also announced an internal restructuring that will create a 25-member domestic violence unit within the State Attorney’s Office. “What my office has not and will not lose sight of is that these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence,” Ayala said. Loyd is also charged with killing an unborn child by injuring the mother; attempted murder; attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and carjacking. Ayala said her office has not determined whether it will seek the death penalty. Florida does not currently have a valid death penalty statute since various courts struck down previous laws. A Florida House panel approved a new death penalty bill on Wednesday.

Orlando police released Thursday dark aerial video footage of murder suspect Markeith Loyd's capture. See more videos “We are eagerly anticipating a new statue from the legislature, and at that point we will determine whether to seek the death penalty for Markeith Loyd,” Ayala said. Loyd was arrested Jan. 14 after a week-long manhunt for him across the region. Loyd faces two counts of first-degree murder in the killings of Dixon and Clayton; one count of unlawfully killing an unborn child; attempted murder, aggravated assault, and carjacking with a firearm. He also has a misdemeanor resisting arrest without violence charge. He is also charged in a separate case from August with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, court records show. The newly-created domestic violence unit will be lead by prosecutor Michelle Latham, who has in the past handled murder cases. It will include 24 other prosecutors, victims’ advocates and paralegals, Ayala said. The Ninth Circuit had a similar unit for domestic violence cases until 2013, when Ayala’s predecessor Jeff Ashton merged it with a sex crimes unit as part of an internal restructuring. During her campaign, Ayala said the merger was part of the reason she decided to run for the office. cdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931; glotan@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5774 Caption Markeith Loyd indicted on two first-degree murder charges A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Markeith Loyd in two first-degree murder cases, Ninth Circuit State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced.

The latest hike in fuel prices – known as the gasolinazo – went up by about 20% virtually overnight on January 1. This spurred daily protests in the streets and online. During these protests, Twitter has served as both a megaphone and a platform from which people can show their anger and discontent. However, friction and conflict have increased on the site, as well as the propagation of false stories. “Youth armed with pipes and knives running through the streets of Tultepec, #EdoMex” Deleted tweet from Grupo Formula, accompanied by a photo from Egypt, in which Arabic writing can be seen in the background. One of the most important phenomena that has been observed in this fight is the circulation of rumors and hashtags that promote illegal activities such as looting and theft. These strategies two objectives: to influence the conversations and to delegitimize the protests. Alarmist messages have even been shown alongside photos from other contexts and situations, such as the deleted tweet displayed here, published by Radio Fórmula with a photo that fact-checkers later confirmed depicts a street scene in Egypt. Some of the accounts involved in these disinformation campaigns have been identified as bots (automated accounts) or trolls who had already been linked to harassment and threats against journalists and social activists. The strategy of these accounts is to reshape the natural online conversation via trending topics, interfering with the discussion. This kind of strategy has been used at different times to systematically curb or modify conversations that are not favorable to certain groups in power. #SaqueaUnWalmart (Loot a Walmart) During the protests on January 4, 2017, two hashtags were used, #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart (Loot a Walmart), which grew to be trending topics in Mexico. The following image shows the relationship between different hashtags found in the tweets published on that date. The links between hashtags represent the times when two or more hashtags were used in the same tweet, and the size of each node shows the number of times each hashtag was used. This analysis was generated using more than 15,000 downloaded tweets, posted and re-tweeted by more than 10,000 different accounts. Here we see the importance of #Gasolinazo and its relationships with the rest of the hashtags used that day. The appearance of #SaqueaUnWalmart can be read as a cluster in the system, an unnatural insertion that links up with #Gasolinazo in order to gain momentum and invade the natural conversation. The diagram also allows us to identify other hashtags associated with #SaqueaUnWalmart, which gives clues as to the strategy used to enter into the conversation. Specifically, the hashtag #Hail100cia (a play on words meaning “hail ciencia” or “hail science”) stands out. This hashtag is associated with the group of Twitter user accounts that coordinated the appearance of #SaqueaUnWalmart and has continued pushing forward new hashtags such as #GolpeDeEstadoMX (State of Mexico Coup D'état). In order to identify the real influence of the hashtag within the conversation, the accounts that were active with both tags were analyzed and graphed. This allows us to see who is posting messages and who their audience is. The following graphic shows these relationships. The size of the nodes depends on the number of times a user is mentioned within the conversations with the hashtags #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart — the more mentions, the larger the node. The active communities range from traditional media who reported on the hike in gas prices, to particular organizations — in this case the group that instigated the #SaqueaUnWalmart hashtag. At first glance it is difficult to see the relationship between said accounts within the many active accounts who adopted #Gasolinazo, but as the following image shows, the #SaqueaUnWalmart group managed to link themselves up with #Gasolinazo to position their hashtag as a trending topic. The community highlighted in red in the above diagram identifies the group of active accounts that used the hashtag #Hail100cia. This is the same group of users (trolls and bots) that interrupted the natural conversation surrounding #Gasolinazo to insert the #SaqueaUnWalmart message. This group represents only 4.19% of the total active accounts (5,302 in total used the tags #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart). However, despite their small numbers, their attack through the use of replies and mentions managed to boost #SaqueaUnWalmart so much it impinged upon the natural conversation. The battlefield Manipulating trends within a global conversation not only draws attention, but also “pops” or “deflates” the conversation as well as any pressure the real activists exert on the government and/or certain figures. These types of strategies, while not illegal, represent a new challenge in the use of digital spaces for public discourse. Other questions arise after identifying these patterns, strategies and accounts. First, what is the motivation for influencing the conversation in a certain way? Second, what people or groups benefit from this kind of behavior? Third, what are their long-term plans? And lastly, what mechanisms can be developed to curb or mitigate the artificial modification of trends? It is imperative these days to ask the right questions and keep working along this vein. Federal elections in Mexico are only a year away, and the circus of social media could easily become a battlefield between artificial discourse and society, journalists, activists and analysts. And what's more, it could make building a critical, transparent and robust public space difficult.

Typical facilities range in size from 75,000 to 125,000 square feet and include a mix of rental units in various sizes. This strategic partnership will provide SmartREIT with the opportunity to further intensify its portfolio and generate additional funds from operations. There will also be opportunities to include leasable retail in certain locations. Two locations in the Greater Toronto Area have been confirmed and plans for multiple other locations are expected to be announced in the coming months. "We view today's 3rd generation, multi-storey self-storage facilities as being a complementary use within and around our centres, requiring minimal land and parking, resulting in efficient rental income value creation," said Huw Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of SmartREIT. "This strategic alliance is a logical step as we continue to intensify our shopping centres and unlock value in under-utilized parcels of land within our portfolio. We are very pleased to partner with SmartStop, a leader in the self-storage industry with a proven expertise and track record to expand the business in partnership across Canada." "We are excited to partner with one of the largest Canadian REITs and utilize SmartREIT's prime retail properties for additional SmartStop® Self Storage locations," said H.

By Associated Press Wednesday 15 Feb 2017, 8:41 PM 12 hours ago 9,786 Views 20 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3241985 Share Tweet Email1 Image: Michel Euler/AP Photo Image: Michel Euler/AP Photo LIDL IS OPENING its first wave of stores in the US this summer ahead of schedule, with plans to open up to 100 locations across the east coast of America within a year. The details of the expansion, announced today, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which has been aggressively expanding in the US. Aldi has been challenging other US chains by adding items to include gluten-free products and fresh produce. Lidl’s first 20 US stores will be opening in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its first US headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of US stores no later than 2018. Lidl operates about 10,000 stores in 27 countries. Both Lidl and Aldi have been aggressively expanding in Europe. In Ireland, they unveiled plans last year to add another 600 employees to its workforce. It currently operates 146 stores across Ireland and has around 4,000 employees. In the United Kingdom, a fierce price war has hurt Wal-Mart’s Asda business as well as traditional local retailers. Aldi, which opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976, now has more than 1,600 stores in the US and plans to increase that to nearly 2,000 by the end of 2018. It announced earlier this month that it was spending $1.6 billion on remodeling more than 1,300 of them. With reporting from Sean Murray Read: Why do people object to Lidl and Aldi in their towns?

The border adjustment tax, part of a larger House Republican tax reform plan, aims to discourage companies from buying or manufacturing products outside the United States. The border adjustment forces companies to pay taxes on the full purchase price of imported items and not just on profits from those sales. In a statement Wednesday, Target said the tax "will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials. If enacted, ...[it] would have profound implications for our guests and business." As they came and went, Target's Brian Cornell and Best Buy's Hubert Joly were both tight-lipped about their visits to the White House and Capitol Hill. Neither man responded to reporters' questions on the way into the West Wing meeting with Trump. Cornell came to a very brief post-meeting press appearance but did not speak. Joly did not attend the press gathering. In a lighthearted aside, a video taken as the CEOs introduced themselves showed Trump pausing after Cornell introduced himself from Target. Photo By Jim Spencer, Star Tribune Bill Rhode,s CEO AutoZone, speaks to media at the White House Wednesday. Target CEO Brian Cornell is at far left. The retail executives met with President Trump to discuss their concerns about a possible border adjustment tax. "Tar-zhay, right?" the president said with a smile. Still, the business that brought the retail leaders to Washington was serious. "Anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America," the Target statement said. The border tax adjustment would hit companies like Target and Best Buy very hard because they import so much of their inventory. Analysts say Target is more vulnerable than its major competitor, Wal-Mart, because the Minnesota-based retailer relies more on the sales of foreign-made clothing and housewares, while Wal-Mart does a larger business in groceries that are not imported. The tax could add 20 percent to the cost of imported inventory, analysts believe, forcing prices up and revenue down. But the tax weighs on all retailers who import significantly. That's why the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) trade group set up this week's intervention. Cornell, Joly, and CEOs Bill Rhodes of AutoZone, Marvin Ellison of J.C. Penney Co., Art Peck of Gap Inc., Stefano Pessina of Walgreen Boots Alliance, Greg Sandfort of Tractor Supply and Jill Soltau of Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Store traveled from the White House to the Capitol for scheduled meetings with leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who oversaw the comprehensive tax reform proposal. Cornell also had meetings scheduled with Minnesota's senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. The move toward a more protectionist economy was one of the president's main campaign promises, and the "America first" theme of his inaugural speech bolstered that goal. The Republican tax reform pushes in the same direction. While adding taxes on the sale of imported inventory, it removes taxes on U.S. exports. It also cuts the U.S. corporate tax rate to keep companies from relocating headquarters to countries with lower tax rates. In theory, the reform plan assumes that a better trade balance and a stronger dollar will offset consumer and business cost increases caused by the border adjustment tax. But in recent statements Trump has indicated some reservations about the tax. In a tweet Wednesday he called the meeting with the retail CEOs "a great listening session." He also promised a new tax reform proposal soon: "We're going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category. Including personal and business." The unintended consequences of a border adjustment tax could include hits to the bottom lines of publicly traded companies that are big importers, said Luis Resendiz, who has advised international businesses for 20 years at the Minneapolis law firm of Fredrikson & Byron. Paying $12 for the Target T-shirt that used to cost $10 or paying $1,200 for the Best Buy high definition TV that used to cost $1,000 could lead to reduced sales, he said. At the same time, bringing production capacity back to America for low-tech, labor-intensive products like clothing might actually be more expensive than paying the border adjustment tax, according to Resendiz. jim.spencer@startribune.com 612-270-1266 SpencerStrib kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

EST February 15, 2017 (Photo: www.lidl.com) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST NEW YORK (AP) - The no-frills supermarket chain Lidl is opening its first wave of stores in the U.S. this summer, ahead of schedule. The Germany-based chain has plans to open up to 100 stores across the East Coast within a year. The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Walmart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which is aggressively expanding and now has more than 1,600 U.S. stores. Both offer low prices with a focus on store label products rather than name brands. Lidl currently has locations under construction in Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth.

Rachel Lindsay made headlines this week after it was announced that she was confirmed as the show's next Bachelorette and first lead Black contestant. Despite her on-air stint with Nick Viall, the 31-year-old lawyer didn't quit her day job. And although she's now confirmed to take the reigns as the new Bachelorette, she's still actively on a case. According to TMZ, Lindsay was still working on an alleged "slip and fall" case for Walmart. Considering her new reality television role commitment to searching for true love, many wonder whether she'll stay with the Cooper and Scully firm in Dallas, Texas. We've reached out to Lindsay's rep and while it couldn't be confirmed whether or not she's still actively on the case, we can confirm that Lindsay is still employed by the firm. TMZ also noted that Bachelorette alumni, Andi Dorfman was still an assistant D.A during her time on the show but took a leave of absence. Since the show, Dorfman has kicked a few bad romances to the side and wrote a New York Times best-selling book. She's now in the midst of writing her second book, Single State of Mind.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse BERLIN German discount supermarket group Lidl will open its first stores in the United States ahead of schedule this summer, it said on Wednesday, with plans for up to 100 stores within a year in a move that could shake up U.S. retailers. The group plans to open its first 20 stores in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, it said in a statement. Lidl, which runs more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries in Europe, is in the midst of a recruitment drive in the United States and had not been expected to launch there until late 2017 or 2018. Wary of the impending arrival, U.S. retailers had already been taking action. Kroger, the second-biggest U.S. grocer after Wal-Mart, has been expanding its own discount format - Ruler Foods, while organic grocer Whole Foods last year launched a lower-price store concept named "365". "Retailers are preparing themselves for Lidl's market entry. They are not falling asleep. They really take it seriously," said Milos Ryba from retail analysis firm IGD, speaking before the timing of the Lidl openings were announced. The German discount formula is not new in the United States - Aldi opened its first U.S. store in 1976 and now runs 1,600. Aldi U.S. is owned by Aldi South, while its German sister company Aldi North runs 460 Trader Joe's stores in 41 states. Last week Aldi announced it would invest $1.6 billion in its U.S. stores, planning to remodel and expand more than 1,300 stores by 2020. However, Lidl is seen as potentially more of a threat as it has moved away from Aldi's hard discount formula in recent years, introducing more brands, fresh produce and in-store bakeries, as well as sprucing up its stores and experimenting with ecommerce. That could make it more appealing in the United States, where customers tend to prefer branded goods to private labels. Lidl and Aldi have already shaken up the British supermarket sector in recent years, winning share from Britain's traditional "big four" grocers, putting increased pressure on them to lower prices and raise their game. Based in Neckarsulm in southern Germany, Lidl had sales of 64.6 billion euros ($68 billion) in the year to end February 2016. The group is owned by Dieter Schwarz, who is Germany's richest man according to several international rich lists, and is the son of Lidl's founder Josef Schwarz.

Rand Road in Palatine on Feb. 7. Joe Lewnard | Staff Photographer   Chacour Koop Follow @https://twitter.com/chacourkoop     A Palatine teen who Palatine police say shot another teen in the face last week in a case of mistaken identity is being held without bail. The teen almost suffocated at the scene and initially was in critical condition but has since been released from the hospital with a metal plate in his face, authorities said. Giovanny Unzueta, 17, of the 1200 block of East Inverrary Lane, has been charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in connection with the shooting of a 19-year-old man in the parking lot of a Palatine store, police said in a news release Wednesday. Cook County circuit court Judge Joseph Cataldo denied Unzueta bail Wednesday. His next court appearance is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. March 3 at the Cook County courthouse in Rolling Meadows. Unzueta shot from a car, hitting the Chicago man about 7:30 p.m. Feb. 7 in the parking lot outside the store at 1555 N. Rand Road, authorities said. Cmdr. Craig Lesselyoung said Unzueta shouted gang slurs after the shooting. The victim, who was in Palatine helping a cousin move, is not affiliated with a gang, police said. He was standing by a car, smoking a cigarette, while his cousin finished shopping inside the store, prosecutors said. The victim was conscious when first responders found him and rushed him to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. He was in critical condition for several days after undergoing surgery, police said. At one point during the victim's initial treatment, he was suffocating on his own blood from a severed artery in his mouth and an emergency tracheotomy had to be performed, prosecutors said. There were bone and bullet fragments embedded in the victim's jaw that could not be removed during surgery, and ultimately a permanent metal plate was inserted in his face, they said. Detectives used video surveillance and interviewed witnesses, including other customers at the store, to identify a suspect, police said. The victim identified Unzueta from a photograph Monday and the arrest was made Tuesday, prosecutors said. Lesselyoung said the investigation continues and their detectives are looking to confirm that Unzueta is the only one who will be charged. Anyone with more information is asked to call Palatine Police at (847) 359-9000 or Palatine-Inverness Crime Stoppers at (847) 590-7867. • Daily Herald staff writers Doug T.

Some feds miss out on pay raise as salary compression worsens The encouraging data released today could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively from the record-low rates of the Great Recession. Advertisement The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.50 percent, up from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. The increase in bond yields sent high-dividend stocks lower for the second day running. Utilities, real estate companies and phone companies fell. Bank stocks rose. CONSUMER PRICES US consumer prices post biggest rise in nearly 4 years WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. The Labor Department says consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, most since February 2013. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent. Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, most since March 2012. After remaining low following the 2007-2009 Great Recession, inflation is running above the Fed’s 2 percent annual target. The Fed left a key interest rate unchanged at its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting. It said it needs more time to monitor the economy but still expects to raise rates gradually. RETAIL SALES US retail sales rise in January, led by gas and restaurants WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans increased their spending at gasoline stations and restaurants in January, pushing up overall retail sales even as auto buying fell. The Commerce Department says retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, slowing down from a solid 1 percent gain in December. Higher gas prices drove a 2.3 percent sales increase at service stations. Purchases at restaurants and bars climbed 1.4 percent. But sales at auto dealers slipped 1.2 percent after jumping 2.9 percent in December. Over the past 12 months, retail sales have risen a solid 5.6 percent. The greater spending likely reflects the improving job market. Employers added 227,000 workers in January, while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.8 percent because more people started looking for jobs and were counted as unemployed. BUILDER SENTIMENT Optimism among US homebuilders weakens WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. homebuilders are feeling a bit less confident this month, reflecting a dimmer outlook on sales in the months ahead and fewer would-be buyers dropping by builders’ sales offices. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday fell to 65 this month. That’s down two points from a revised reading of 67 in January. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has been above 60 since September and reached the highest level in 11 years in December. The February number falls shy of analyst predictions. They expected the index to hit 68, according to FactSet. Builders’ view of sales now and over the next six months also fell, as did a gauge of traffic by prospective buyers. BUSINESS INVENTORIES US firms increase inventories, see sales jump in December WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. businesses stockpiled more goods in December and posted the biggest sales increase in nearly six years. The Commerce Department says that business inventories rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in December, led by an increase in stockpiles at stores that sell food and beverages. Auto and auto parts dealers trimmed inventories 0.6 percent; furniture and appliance stores also cut back. Companies also reported a 2 percent monthly sales increase, best since March 2011. Manufacturers reported that sales rose 2.2 percent in December; retailers posted a 1.2 percent gain. U.S. economic growth was hobbled much of last year by inventory cutbacks. But businesses rebuilt stockpiles in the October-December period, accounting for more than half of fourth-quarter economic growth. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION US factory output rose in January for 2nd straight month WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. manufacturers cranked out more steel, machinery and electronics last month as factories appear to be rebounding after two years of stagnation. The Federal Reserve says factory output rose 0.2 percent in January, its second straight increase. While modest, the gain is equal to the industry’s growth in all of 2016. Oil and gas drillers cut back on building new rigs after energy prices plunged two years ago. That caused orders for steel pipe and other drilling equipment to plummet. Weak overseas economies in Europe and China also cut into exports. Yet those trends have largely reversed. Mining production rose 2.8 percent last month, pushed higher by a big gain in oil and gas drilling. A broader measure of industrial production, which includes manufacturing, mining and utilities, dropped 0.3 percent. ANTHEM-CIGNA Anthem fires back at Cigna INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Anthem is countering Cigna a day after its smaller rival sued to terminate a $48 billion buyout agreement. Anthem on Wednesday sought a restraining order to block that maneuver and force it to comply with the deal, which has already been blocked by a federal judge. The rapid-fire consolidation in the health care industry appears to be hitting a wall. On Tuesday, Aetna said it was abandoning its $34 billion acquisition of Humana. That was followed by the Cigna lawsuit. Both deals drew in the Justice Department and separate federal courts ruled the deals could hurt consumers. Cigna Corp. is seeking a $1.85 billion termination fee from Anthem and more than $13 billion in damages. Anthem Inc. said Wednesday that Cigna doesn’t have a right to terminate the agreement. TRUMP-HEALTH OVERHAUL Trump administration acts to ‘stabilize’ health insurance WASHINGTON (AP) — With a new health secretary in office, the Trump administration is proposing its first regulatory changes to the health insurance markets created by President Barack Obama’s overhaul. Among the most noticeable change for consumers: a shorter sign-up window of 45 days, as opposed to three months. Administration officials said Wednesday the new regulations will help to stabilize the individual insurance market for next year. That could buy time for the Republican-led Congress to make good on its promise to repeal the Obama-era health care overhaul and replace it with a conservative approach. Many of the proposed changes reflect the wishes of the insurance industry. Even so, insurer Humana announced Tuesday it will not participate in next year in the government-run marketplaces. Human Services Secretary Tom Price was confirmed Friday. TRUMP-IRS-HEALTH OVERHAUL Following Trump order, IRS shifts on health care mandate WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS says it’s following President Donald Trump’s executive order on health care by easing enforcement of the unpopular Obama-era requirement for people to have coverage or risk fines. Trump directed federal agencies to ease the health law’s rules after he took office. An IRS spokesman says the IRS had planned to start rejecting returns this year on which the taxpayer failed to indicate whether or not he had coverage. But the IRS says it will keep processing such returns, as it has in the past. Many of the law’s supporters consider the coverage requirement essential for nudging younger, healthy people into the insurance pool to keep premiums in check. The IRS says the requirement is still the law. TRUMP-CABINET Trump’s budget pick clears initial Senate hurdle WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s choice to run the White House budget office has cleared a routine Senate hurdle. But at least two senior Republicans have voiced doubts about supporting him in Thursday’s confirmation vote. Rep. Mick Mulvaney is a tea party congressman from South Carolina who has attracted opposition from Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. McCain says Mulvaney’s record of support for the Pentagon budget is too soft. The Senate voted 52-48 along party lines to advance Mulvaney’s nomination to a final vote on Thursday. The outcome there is in some doubt. Powerful Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran of Mississippi is also unwilling to commit to supporting Mulvaney in Thursday’s up-or-down vote. Cochran met with Mulvaney on Tuesday. He said that “he’s never been a friend of the Appropriations Committee.” CHINA-TRUMP TRADEMARKS China awards Trump valuable new trademark SHANGHAI (AP) — China has awarded President Donald Trump a valuable new trademark. The win comes after a 10-year dispute and raises a host of ethical questions about the president’s foreign intellectual property. China’s Trademark Office posted the registration of Trump’s new mark, which became official Feb. 14, to its website Wednesday. It gives Trump the right to use his name for building construction services in China through 2027. This may be the first foreign trademark Trump has received as president, but it’s unlikely to be the last. He has 49 pending trademark applications in China alone. Critics say Trump’s foreign intellectual property holdings are a conflict of interest and may violate the U.S. Constitution. But Trump’s lawyer says he has taken adequate steps to distance himself from his trademark portfolio. UNDER ARMOUR-TRUMP Under Armour CEO responds to criticism of Trump praise BALTIMORE (AP) — The CEO of Baltimore-based sports apparel company Under Armour is responding to criticism he received after calling President Donald Trump “an asset to the country.” Kevin Plank wrote an open letter to Baltimore published as a full-page advertisement in The Baltimore Sun Wednesday. He wrote that his choice of words during an interview with CNBC last week “did not accurately reflect my intent.” Three celebrities the company sponsors — basketball star Stephen Curry, actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and ballerina Misty Copeland — were among those voicing concerns about his praise of Trump. Plank says the company stands for equal rights and job creation and believes “immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America.” He says the company opposes the president’s travel ban. CHESAPEAKE ENERGY-DRILLING Chesapeake Energy to boost drilling budget, rig count OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Chesapeake Energy Corp. has announced plans to increase its drilling budget and rig count in 2017, saying that confidence is growing in the hard-hit energy market. The Oklahoma City-based company said Tuesday that it would increase its capital expenditures to $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion this year. That’s compared to 2016 numbers of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion. Chesapeake CEO Doug Lawler said in a statement that the move will “position Chesapeake for significant production and earnings growth” in 2018. Chesapeake says it plans to operate an average of 17 rigs in 2017, compared to an average of 10 rigs in 2016. The company will release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 23. In November, Chesapeake reported a loss of $1.16 billion, or $1.54 per share, in its third-quarter results. BOEING-UNION VOTE Boeing workers vote on union NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant are deciding whether they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. The first round of voting began early Wednesday. A second round was set for Wednesday afternoon to accommodate all employees. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d make their jobs more difficult. South Carolina’s governor says workers should reject the effort to unionize. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said “there is no reason to put anyone in the middle” between Boeing and its workers. WAL-MART-MOOSEJAW Wal-Mart buys outdoor clothes and gear seller Moosejaw NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart has acquired the outdoor clothing and gear seller Moosejaw for $51 million as it expands its online offerings. The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Wal-Mart says Madison Heights, Michigan-based Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay based in Michigan. Wal-Mart, which is trying to better compete with online leader Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce player with strong industry relationships. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart also purchased online marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. LIDL-US STORES No-frills grocer Lidl to open first US stores this summer NEW YORK (AP) — The no-frills supermarket chain Lidl is opening its first wave of stores in the U.S. this summer, ahead of schedule. The Germany-based chain has plans to open up to 100 stores across the East Coast within a year. The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which is aggressively expanding and now has more than 1,600 U.S. stores. Both offer low prices with a focus on store label products rather than name brands. The first 20 Lidl stores will be opening in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its first U.S. headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. GROCERY BAGGING CHAMPION Ohio college student wins title as best grocery bagger (Information in the following story is from: The Medina County Gazette, http://www.medina-gazette.com) MEDINA, Ohio (AP) — A 23-year-old University of Akron accounting student has been named the nation’s top grocery bagger after claiming the Ohio title two years in a row. The Medina (meh-DY’-nuh) Gazette (http://bit.ly/2lOUoJ0 ) reports Brady Long returns to Wadsworth with a $10,000 prize after winning the National Grocers Association’s Best Bagger championship. Long packs up groceries at Buehler’s Fresh Foods. He competed against nearly two dozen others during the bagging championship in Las Vegas, where they were judged on speed, technique and other factors, including style and attitude. He says he’ll use the prize money to help him replace his current vehicle, a 1996 van.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 09:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 14:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

Around 150 part-time soldiers will move into the area around Oroville even though engineers are confident they have the situation under control. Some 200,000 residents were evacuated from the area earlier this week as a failing spillway threatened to engulf the region in water.  But on Wednesday Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said they may have to move again as a weekend of heavy storms is forecast in the area. ‘It’s important that people should be prepared to go,’ Honea told reporters. He said he hoped residents should be getting ‘their things together so if there is an evacuation order they will have the things they need and be able to get out quickly and efficiently.’ Scroll down for video  The National Guard has been called in to help in the towns surrounding the Oroville Dam (above) which continues to pump water downstream in a race against looming storms  150 troops will assist in the towns at the foot of the dam, Governor Jerry Brown said. Dozens of California Guard troops (above) had already been mobilized over the weekend but more help is needed  Honea said there had been several homes broken into in the evacuated area around the Oroville Lake Dam, but no cases of organized looting. He also warned locals to stop flying drones over the lake as they could interfere with the helicopters that are taking massive amounts of sand to fix the hole. A five mile no-fly zone has been set up around the lake. ‘Remember, if you fly, we can't fly and that will impede the ability to make critical repairs,’ he wrote on his Facebook page. ‘This is against the law and anyone caught doing this will be prosecuted.’ Residents were given just minutes to take their belongings and get out of town on Sunday afternoon. Honea stressed the urgency by writing three times on social media ‘This is not a drill.’ Panicked and angry residents sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours after the evacuation order was given. The evacuation order was lifted on Tuesday and replaced with an ‘evacuation warning’ as the threat of catastrophic flooding receded. By Wednesday morning the town’s Walmart — which had been closed since Sunday — was packed as residents bought up essential supplies fearing another evacuation order. Hundreds of thousands of residents nervously stocked up on supplies after stores, including a local Walmart, reopened on Wednesday after an evacuation order was lifted  While residents have been told it is safe to return, they must remain alert for any changes to the delicate situation. Last week they were given just one hour to flee before officials said the dam's spillway would collapse  At the newly reopened Walmart on Wednesday, shoppers didn't hold back as they stocked up in anticipation of another evacuation  A model produced by state officials estimate that the town of Oroville would be engulfed within an hour and the water would take around 12 hours to reach Yuba City, where 60,000 people live, 30 miles to the south. Engineers from California’s Department of Water Resources were releasing 750,000 gallons of water from the dam every second into the 70-mile long Feather River, which flows through Oroville and Yuba City before emptying into the Sacramento River. Bill Croyle, the department’s acting director, said the water level of the dam had fallen by 20 feet but it still needed to go down another 28 feet. It is receding by 8 inches an hour, said Croyle. The potential disaster is the result of massive spikes in water levels as a result of snow and heavy rain after years of drought, and damage to the primary and emergency spillways at the dam. Officials first noticed a massive hole in the dam's spillway last week and closed it down, leading to rapidly raising water levels. Now a huge cascade of water is flowing down the 770-foot high dam into the river below. A cemetery in Marysville, some 30 miles from the dam, remained swamped on Wednesday as engineers frantically tried to drain Lake Oroville  David McGlamery caries personal belongings back into his home along the Feather River, in Oroville, California after the evacuation order was downgraded. He had retreated to Chico with his family where he slept in a Winco parking lot June McGlamery rushes to move back into her home on Tuesday after the evacuation order was lifted, following emergency repair work to the dam. 'It's no fun living out of your car for days', she said Erica Stenholm unpacks the family vehicle upon returning home after the evacuation order was lifted for the dam spillway crisis  Erica Stenholm, Ronnie Vaughan, and Brooklyn Jackson, 7, unpack their car upon returning home after the evacuation order on Tuesday Over 100,000 cubic meters (750,000 gallons) of water per second continues to gush through the Oroville,CA, dam spillway as workers rush with helicopters and rock trucks to repair itsa emergency spillway before more storms hit  Croyle said Lake Oroville takes in around 20,000 cubic feet of water — 150,000 gallons – per second in normal conditions. During the forecast weekend storms he said that could go up to around 45,000 cubic meters or 337,000 gallons . But that is still well below the 100,000 cubic meters that is leaving the lake every second through the spillway. Croyle said the work is going so well the amount of run-off from the reservoir — the largest manmade lake in California — may even be reduced.   The rain will start on Wednesday and continue through Thursday and Friday, bringing three inches of water and winds of up to 30mph to the lake where engineers are working round the clock to repair last week's damage.  The problems: The crisis was sparked when authorities stopped allowing water down the main spillway to investigate a large hole caused by erosion (left), last week sending all of the surplus lake water to an emergency spillway (right picture, top left) which wasn't equipped to handle it. Now, water is gushing down the eroded spillway again before storms bring more rain to the reservoir above it The first storm will begin on Wednesday afternoon and could see up to half an inch of rain, and another three quarters of an inch could fall no Thursday. Up to three inches of rain could fall on the lake over the weekend, and another eight could fall in the surrounding mountains and trickle down towards it. The next big storm is now predicted for Monday which could dump two inches of rain on Oroville in just 24 hours.  'It's just another problem they don't need to have,' Jason Klapp, meteorologist at the Sacramento National Weather Service told The Los Angeles Times.  President Trump finally declared an emergency situation on Tuesday evening and approved California Governor Jerry Brown's request for federal emergency funding.   The governor expressed hope yesterday that the new administration would act quickly and favorably towards the state's increasingly dire need to repair the crumbling structure which has suffered around $100 million worth of damage.

Dam lucky: Abandoned exotic animals including kangaroos,... Share this article Share The crisis began on February 7 when part of the spillway at America's tallest dam collapsed while it was being used to drain the lake. The concrete spillway was closed while officials worked to repair the damage. But thanks to an unusually wet winter for California, which has been on a drought warning for the past five years, the lake continued to fill. By Saturday, water levels were so high water began to flow over the emergency spillway for the first time. But as water flowed over the concrete wall - the last resort to reducing water levels at the lake - the water began to erode the ground on the other side sparking fears the wall could collapse causing mass floods across the land below. Evacuation orders were issued on Sunday for around 200,0000 residents across the Oroville, Yuba City and Feather River Basin areas. Families were told to grab what they could carry, get in their cars, and go. Fleeing residents described roads blocked with hundreds of barely moving cars as people fled for safer ground.  Engineers are using rocks to patch up the ruined spillway which nearly gave way entirely on Saturday as the lake reached its maximum capacity  Helicopters fly rocks (left) and sandbags (right) for engineers to continue patching up the eroded emergency spillway Engineers are working round the clock to beef back up the eroded emergency spillway which buckled as it water overwhelmed it at the weekend An evacuation order was lifted for the towns surrounding the Oroville Dam on Tuesday as officials claimed they had done enough to repair its emergency spillway (above being patched up with boulders)  This is the potential worst case scenario for what could happen if the waters are not controlled and the dam breaks. It would take about 12 hours for the water to reach Yuba City more than 40 miles away, following the path of the Feather River more videos 1 2 3 Watch video ISIS video of boys from Yazidi area of Iraq 'on suicide mission' Watch video Deer attacks man after he rescued it from coyote trap Watch video Not your average pet!

It moved the strain on to the emergency spillway which nearly gave way Officials lifted the mandatory evacuation order on Tuesday afternoon but warned residents to remain vigilant. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea and Bill Croyle, acting director of the Department of Water Resources are seen above making the announcement  June McGlamery, who has since returned to her home, said she and her family were forced to retreat to Chico, where they initially stayed at a Winco parking lot before they were moved to a more welcoming Walmart parking lot with other evacuees of the dam crisis.  'It's no fun living out of your car for days,' says McGlamery as she unpacked her belongings back at home on Tuesday. Not everyone has returned home yet. People with special needs or those who would require extra time to evacuate were advised not to return amidst the uncertainty.  But local business owners were among the thousands who have already returned to everyday life.  Collins and Denny Market owner Mazen Hanoun, who opened his doors again yesterday, said: 'When people are here and refuse to leave I need to support those people. Milk, food, diapers. My life is none better than them. They stay, I stay' Damages to both the spillway and emergency spillway are estimated to be at the $100 million mark. The main dam itself is not affected. Engineers have now been able to shore up the spillways with boulders and rocks and are confident they will hold if the water level in Lake Oroville rises to its 901ft capacity again.  Water is being drained down the main spillway, after the repairs, at a rapid rate and at 11am on Tuesday, they had eased to 886ft, and as of 5.30am on Wednesday, had dropped again to 881ft - still someway off their plan for 850ft target for Friday when storms are expected. The Department of Water Resources, Cal Fire and the Butte County Sheriff's Office hope to reduce water levels further to 840ft by next Wednesday which would give engineers breathing space of nearly one million acre-feet of water before it overflowed down the damaged emergency spillway that is still undergoing repairs. The lake is draining at 100,000 cubic feet per second - reducing the state's second largest reservoir about one foot every three hours. But that is likely to taper off to a third by Friday according to the LA Times Officials have since downgraded the evacuation order to a warning, allowing residents of Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties to return.  Residents of Oroville,CA stock up on gas and essentials at one of the only gas stations still open in town on Tuesday People wait outside Collins and Denny Market as owner Mazen Hanoun opens the door on February 14.

The family had 5 large dogs in tow during the whole evacuation McGlamery helps his neighbor, Troy Archie, left, jumpstart his Honda CX500 motorcycle as the family returned home after the mandatory evacuation But they should be ready abandon their homes again if the situation becomes more precarious.   'This warning allows people to return to return to their homes and resume their businesses but we're telling them that they have to be vigilant. There is the prospect we could issue another order if the circumstances change,' Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a press conference on Tuesday.  Some 190,000 residents fled on Sunday and took refuge in make-shift shelters when authorities were finally forced to issue an emergency evacuation order after days of claiming the situation was safe.  The evacuees have since told of their hurried escape, describing the scene of entire communities fleeing in their packed up cars as 'pure chaos'.  A TIMELINE OF THE OROVILLE DAM DISASTER Tuesday, February 7: Authorities halt flow on the main spillway to investigate erosion  Wednesday, February 8: They reveal plans to release water over damaged spillway to test its function  Thursday, February 9: Test release of water adds to main spillway damage as expected but they plan to allow more through after heavy rain caused lake to rise Friday, February 10: More water is allowed to flow down the damaged spillway to avoid using the fragile emergency spillway  Saturday, February 11: First flow of water is allowed to pass down emergency spillway and authorities say erosion on main spillway has slowed. They repeat there is no risk to the public Noon, Sunday, February 12 : At a press conference, officials say the dam and its spillways are stable and that the emergency dam will hold steady  4.45pm, Sunday, February 12: The Department for Water Resources tweets an emergency evacuation order warning the emergency spillway is about to fail  Monday, February 13: Officials cannot say when evacuees will be able to return as they frantically work to repair the damaged main spillway  Tuesday afternoon: Evacuation order is lifted but warning stays in place as authorities say emergency spillway is stable  Wednesday:  Rainfall predicted in the evening placing extra pressure on authorities to repair the dam before water levels rise. Now they say this doesn't need to be done until Saturday and that they are on track to reach their goal.  'The peak inflows are below the 100,000 cubic ft outflow that we have right now so what that means is we'll see a small increase in water elevation but with the existing releases we should get down to 850ft sometime late Saturday, Sunday,' Bill Croyle, director of the California Department of Water Resources said.   As for the eroded emergency spillway, authorities say it has been secured by 125 crews working round the clock to fix it. They have been bringing 30 tonnes of rock to the near-collapsed barrier since Saturday on lorries and helicopters, an effort they say has made it strong enough to resist the reservoir.  The work will continue over the coming days to ensure that the wall is sufficiently lined, officials said.  The emergency situation had been in developing for a week and began last Tuesday when officials were forced to acknowledge a gaping hole in the main spillway.  They halted water flow on the spillway to investigate the damage but said at the time there was no immediate threat to the public.  The emergency spillway, which had never before been used, was then put to work but soon buckled under the pressure. Because it was backed only by land and soil, authorities were forced to admit that it would likely fail and evacuated the area suddenly on Sunday afternoon.  The sudden order after days of of public assurances that the situation was safe created pandemonium in the town of Oroville and others surrounding the dam.  Some already had their bags packed and hit the road immediately but others were left to scramble after being told for days that they were in no danger.  The chaos was described as a 'textbook example' of why the country needs to invest in infrastructure by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday as he said President Trump was keeping a 'close eye' on the situation.  He has not yet released  $162.3 million in disaster assistance that California has requested.   Evacuation centers have been set up at a fairgrounds in Chico, California, about 20 miles northwest of Oroville, but major highways leading south out of the area were jammed as residents fled the flood zone. Javier Santiago, 42, fled with his wife, two children and several friends to the Oroville Dam Visitors Center in a public park above the dam and the danger zone. With blankets, pillows and a little food, Santiago said: 'We're going to sleep in the car.'  The sudden evacuation panicked residents, who scrambled to get their belongings into cars and then grew angry as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the evacuation order was given. Raj Gill, managing a Shell station where anxious motorists got gas and snacks, said his boss told him to close the station and flee himself. But he stayed open to feed a steady line of customers. 'You can't even move,' he said. 'I'm trying to get out of here too. I'm worried about the flooding. I've seen the pictures - that's a lot of water.' A Red Cross spokeswoman said more than 500 people showed up at an evacuation center in Chico, California. The shelter ran out of blankets and cots, and a tractor-trailer with 1,000 more cots was stuck in the gridlock of traffic fleeing the potential flooding Sunday night, Red Cross shelter manager Pam Deditch said.  On Monday it was revealed officials were warned about the main spillway's fragility 12 years ago but ignored concerns.  THE STORMS THREATENING TO OVERFLOW THE LAKE   A pair of storms which will bring more rain to the area this week is piling more pressure on to emergency workers to drain the lake. The first storm will begin on Wednesday afternoon and could see up to half an inch of rain. The storm, which could still impact on water levels, has been considerably downsized since yesterday when meteorologists were predicting between one and three inches of precipitation. The area will receive up to three quarters of an inch of rain on Thursday, with more rain and showers predicted to continue into the weekend. Their biggest worry was a 'really big, strong' storm which was set to hit on Friday and was predicted to increase the total rainfall for the week to eight inches - significantly raising water levels on the lake. 'If they haven't found something really good to do by Friday, things are going to go downhill further. That could be a really strong storm, not just lots of rain but lots of wind, too,' National Weather Service meteorologist  Brandt Maxwell told USA Today. Strong winds could also hamper the repair efforts as helicopters being used to fly in boulders, rocks and slurry will not be able to fly.  National Weather Service Jason Clapp told the LA Times: 'It's just another problem they don't need to have.'  Up to three inches of rain could fall on the lake over the weekend, and another eight could fall in the surrounding mountains. The next big storm is now predicted for Monday which could dump two inches of rain on Oroville in just 24 hours.   Below, a weather map shows the rainfall and weather conditions set to hit the region today. Environmental groups predicted that the main spillway could erode under heavy rainfall and flagged their fears to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2003, requesting updates and improvements to the dam spillways. The improvements were never made because water agencies which would have had to pay for them deemed them unnecessary.  Infrastructure improvements earmarked across the state in January this year didn't include the Oroville Dam either. The $100billion list was made by the governor's office and included plans for the Folsom Dam but made no mention of Oroville.  On October 17, 2006, three environmental groups - the Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba Citizens League - filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) urging the government to fully reinforce the dam's emergency spillways with concrete, according to The Mercury News.  In the face of heavy rainfall, the groups said, the earthen spillways might begin to collapse and erode, leading to the river downhill being inundated with water - as happened over the weekend. Worse, they said, there was a serious risk of 'loss of crest control' - that is, the lip of the dam might fail, resulting in a massive and dangerous surge that would 'cause damages and threaten lives in the protected floodplain downstream'.  But the Department of Water Resources, and the agencies in the line to foot the bill - told the FERC that the spillways could handle 350,000 cubic feet of water per second and there was no danger. 'The emergency spillway meets FERC's engineering guidelines for an emergency spillway,' wrote John Onderdonk, a senior civil engineer with FERC, in 2006. 'The guidelines specify that during a rare flood event, it is acceptable for the emergency spillway to sustain significant damage.' The lake is currently at 92 per cent of its total capacity, according to the Department of Water Resources. Despite that, the weekend saw the earthen spillways being eroded with flows of just 6,000-12,000 cubic feet per second - less than five percent of FERC's supposed safe rate. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Not your average pet!

Also on Monday, it emerged that California Governor Jerry Brown had overlooked the Oroville Dam in the $100 billion list of 'key' infrastructure projects filed this month. The list, generated at the request of the National Governor's Association after Donald Trump called for $1 trillion of infrastructure investment, is a 'wish list' of projects for Brown, CNBC reported. But while the list mentions the Folsom Dam, some 60 miles south of Oroville, as well as flood control in Sacramento, 66 miles away, there is no mention of Oroville Dam itself. Instead, most of the suggested upgrades in the three-page document are related to transportation, such as highways, bridges and railroads. Projects to reduce flooding risk in Marysville, 30 miles south of Orosville and 50 miles from the dam, are mentioned, as are other levee and dam plans. All are placed below a proposed high-speed rail track between Los Angeles and San Francisco on the list - although the governor's office says that the order of the list does not represent how important the projects are. It added that the list was 'an initial list of projects. By no means does it represent all of the state's priorities.' Brown later said that he was not aware of the 2006 report or the concerns raised about the dam. ‹ Slide me › Last February, the Oroville Lake's capacity was at just 45 per cent (left), on Sunday it hit its 901ft limit (pictured recently, right) more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Not your average pet!

He said schools should not suffer 'for putting the safety of our students first based on these unprecedented flood dangers.' In Butte County, where the Oroville Dam is located, 13 of 15 school districts were closed. The county has about 31,000 total public school students.   California appears to have been particularly caught off guard by the recent rainfall, which has seen flooding in the north of the state, near where Oroville is located, and heavy storms in the south. That's because it has been in a state of so-called 'permanent drought' for five years - a drought that only ended with rain and snowfall in December. That rainfall continues to hit the state in waves - and so concerns remain high about the short-term prospects for the dam. Despite the wet weather, however, the state has extended its water bands until May, although those bans continue to vary from area to area.  Chico Councilman Andrew Coolidge says the seven shelters he visited are packed with residents who describe similar terror on jam-packed roads to safety. While most fled, some had no choice but to remain behind. The chief executive of the Oroville Hospital says it is operating normally but that 100 patients have been moved to the hospital's second floor. Hospital CEO Robert Wentz says the hospital took the step Monday morning 'out of an abundance of caution.' ABANDONED EXOTIC ANIMALS RESCUED FROM EVACUATED HOMES California Highways Patrol rescued scores of exotic animals abandoned to their fate as people evacuated their homes during the Oroville Dam crisis. Kangaroos, zebras and mini deer were among the animals now being cared for local volunteer Tamara Archer Houston.  The CHP posted images of the animals on its Facebook page, and people were swift to condemn the owners for abandoning them. Officers were stunned by the discovery of the animals in vacant homes during the dam crisis A Muntjac deer was found by officers from the California Highway Patrol after residents evacuated their homes more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Weezy the rescue dog meets baby for the first time Watch video Deer attacks man after he rescued it from coyote trap Watch video Video shows pregnant teen screaming as NYPD tasers her Watch video Kala Brown tells Dr. Phil about her abductor: 'He did not break me...'

Texas couple live with 180 stone buffalo Alongside images of the cute creatures, the CHP wrote: 'While working the Oroville dam emergency our officers checked on some abandoned properties and came upon these animals including kangaroos, mini deers, and zebras.  'We never know what we'll discover out here. We hope life gets back to normal here real soon and that the owners are able to return to their properties. If it did flood those animals would be dead.. So sad that the owners didn't think enough of them to get them out too...' The patrol responded: 'There really wasn't enough time. Loading those animals would have taken longer than people thought they had to survive. The good news is, all are well.'  Animals found in homes including an albino kangaroo called Kenzie, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, a red kangaroo called Dottie and a Muntjac deer named Mary. The CHP later posted on Facebook: 'Those abandoned furry friends we found were rescued by a kind stranger in Sutter who has lots of property to keep them on while their owners are away for the emergency in Oroville.  'We are thankful for the random acts of kindness we find out in the community.  'Everyone seems to be coming together to take care of each other. This is what makes California so special.' The hospital is outside the flood zone below the dam on Oroville Lake and sits on a hill. Wentz says evacuating acutely ill people is difficult so it is usually better for them to stay where they are. He says patients will not go back to the hospital's first floor until authorities tell the hospital it is safe to do so.  Overnight, state and local officials said the immediate danger had passed with water no longer flowing over the eroded spillway but they cautioned that the situation remained unpredictable. 'Once you have damage to a structure like that it's catastrophic,' acting Water Resources director Bill Croyle told reporters. But he stressed 'the integrity of the dam is not impacted' by the damaged spillway.   A California Highway Patrol spokesman said two planes would fly on Monday to help with traffic control and possible search-and-rescue missions. At least 250 California law enforcement officers were posted near the dam and along evacuation routes to manage the exodus and ensure evacuated towns don't become targets for looting or other criminal activity.    Read more: Dam operators now hope to lower Lake Oroville by 60 feet in preparation for rain and snowmelt - LA Times California News on Weather, Drought plus Los Angeles Updates | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 15 shares California Governor spends $25 BILLION per year on ... by bettyboop 39 Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Walmart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which is aggressively expanding and now has more than 1,600 U.S. stores. Both offer low prices with a focus on store label products rather than name brands. Scroll down for video  Lidl has opened its first prototype store in Frederickburg, Virginia, pictured above Lidl's President & CEO Brendan Proctor is pictured in the test kitchen of their American Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia According to the Washington Post the U.S. prototype store is 35 percent larger than its overseas counterparts with 21,000 sq ft of shopping space.  The company believes a larger store is needed because it will have to offer Americans a larger selection of products in order to compete in the U.S. market.  It's one of a number of tweaks the brand is rolling out in order to cater for American shoppers.

Share this article Share The German supermarket chain is gearing up to open 100 stores across the East Coast by mid 2018, with the first 20 stores opening this summer in Virginia and the Carolinas. The inside of a store in Germany is pictured above The first 20 Lidl stores will be opening in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its first U.S. headquarters in 2015.  Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. Despite being successful abroad, the company is using the space to test things that it hopes will appeal American shoppers from everything to signage to the number of aisles needed. Lidl is closely associated with Aldi. However, unlike Aldi, the Lidl will be a hybrid similar to Trader Joe’s or Harris Teeter In a presentation seen by Business Insider, Lidl describes itself as a cross between Trader Joe's and Harris Teeter.  'After three years of research we discovered that US consumers don't like discount groceries,' the presentation reads. 'Unlike Aldi, the Lidl will be a hybrid similar to Trader Joe's or Harris Teeter but closer to a Trader Joe's. We will sell high end brands, quality not quantity, best products only.'  It will be offering chilled beer and even free samples in the bakery area which are not things it does elsewhere.  'A lot of the supermarkets are so large, it's a challenge for people to go shopping,' U.S. chief executive Brendan Proctor told the Post. 'If I wanted to go in and get a bottle of ketchup — first of all, there are probably about 24 aisles in the store. I have to find what aisle it's in. I get there, I find that there's 50 types of ketchup. Who honestly needs 50 types of ketchup? So we can streamline that.' 'What we've seen and heard is that a lot of customers feel they're being forced to compromise,' Proctor said. 'So they're either getting okay quality at a cheap price or they're getting good quality and having to pay very, very high prices.'  Lidl will offer a limited selection of products that will include familiar brands as well as private-label goods.  The current stores have just six aisles which makes them easier to navigate. A number of the items will remain in their shipping boxes to enable them to be places onto the shop floor quickly. The supermarket will also sell a number of non-grocery items from things as diverse as yoga pants to walking books. Even lawn mowers are going to be sold at the Virginia store.  It is still too early to tell exactly which established supermarket chains Lidl will affect the most, but it is competing head-on for Aldi, another German discount store which has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. Read more: A first look at how German grocer Lidl plans to conquer the U.S. market - The Washington Post Lidl is opening 100 stores in the US - Business Insider Share or comment on this article e-mail 78 shares Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

The details of the expansion, announced Wednesday, come as Wal-Mart and traditional grocery chains already are seeing a stronger threat from German low-priced retailer Aldi, which has been aggressively expanding. Both offer low prices by focusing on store-label products rather than name brands. Aldi has also been adding items to include gluten-free products and fresh produce. Lidl's first 20 U.S. stores will be opening in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where the company established its first U.S. headquarters in 2015. Originally, it planned to open its first batch of U.S. stores no later than 2018. Lidl operates about 10,000 stores in 27 countries. Both Lidl and Aldi have been aggressively expanding in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a fierce price war has hurt Wal-Mart's Asda business as well as traditional local retailers. Aldi, which opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976, now has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. and plans to increase that to nearly 2,000 by the end of 2018. It announced earlier this month that it's spending $1.6 billion on remodeling more than 1,300 of them.

By John Hacker Carthage’s first roundabout, built in 2006, will be getting a twin in the next couple of years. Carthage City Administrator Tom Short told the City Council's Public Works Committee on Feb. 7 that the Missouri Department of Transportation had agreed to share the cost of a new roundabout at Garrison Avenue, Fairlawn Avenue and Elk Street to be built in 2019. Short said the new roundabout will be “eerily similar” in appearance to the one built in 2006 at Fairlawn Drive, Grand Avenue and Airport Drive. “This is a five-legged intersection just like the one at Airport Drive,” Short said. “We have to make sure it can handle truck traffic and it will open up Garrison Avenue through the old airport to more traffic. It will take some of the traffic load off Highway 571 in front of Walmart.” Short said the state and city will each contribute $1.1 million to the project. The total amount agreed to in the contract is $2,201,942. Short said the Public Works Committee voted to recommend that the full council approve the proposed contract. The City Council heard the contract on first reading at Tuesday's regular meeting, with a final decision possible at the next meeting on Feb. 27. Short said the city will likely appropriate the city's portion of the funds for the project in the 2017-2018 budget which is will take affect on June 30, but construction won't likely begin until 2019. He said the city will spend this year finalizing specifications and plans and acquiring land for the right of way for the roundabout. Background The project will place similar roundabouts at each end of Fairlawn Drive, the diagonal drive that runs between Garrison Avenue and Grand Avenue on the south side of Carthage. The roundabout at Fairlawn, Airport Drive and Grand replaced an awkward series of traffic signals that attempted to control the five streets that met at that intersection and was the first roundabout built in Southwest Missouri when it was finished in 2006. That roundabout was built bu Sprouls Construction Co. at a cost of $761,569, with the city paying $100,000 of the cost and the state paying the rest.

Some big players are struggling to sell sporting goods. For independents, that's an opportunity. February 14, 2017 | By HBSDealer Staff The list of bankrupt or struggling sporting goods chains is growing. The parent company of Eastern Mountain Sports filed for Chapter 11 in early February. Shortly after that, reports swirled about a similar possible fate for Gander Mountain. These events follow a year that saw Sports Authority declare bankruptcy and close 300 stores. Also last year, Sport Chalet went out of business. Given the presence of sporting goods — from coolers to canoes to camping gear and beyond — at all the major hardware buying markets, the struggles of the large sporting goods chains raises a timely question for independent dealers: If Sports Authority can’t compete with Dick’s Sporting Goods and Bass Pro Shop — or Walmart and Amazon for basketballs and bikes — what chance does an independent hardware store have? A pretty good chance, actually, according to distributors who spoke with HBSDealer. At Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Do it Best Corp., the co-op said it has members who are planning for sporting goods growth in 2017-18, because of opportunities in their markets, and that the current state of retail sporting goods bodes well for independent dealers. According to Do it Best merchandise manager Shane Burnworth, the merger of Bass Pro and Cabela’s has put a lot of pressure on other large box sporting goods retailers, like Gander Mountain and Sports Authority. A large retailer leaving a market is a clear positive for an independent. But also, independents have the luxury of dealing in sporting goods as a niche to capture additional sales, as opposed to an all-in, make-or-break effort, he said. At Hardware Distribution Warehouses, Craig Cowart, president of the Houston division, said he also sees opportunity for independents in sporting goods, and any other niche category underserved by big boxes in a local market. “We see home improvement retailers successfully catering to local market needs in sporting goods as part of their diversification,” Cowart said. “Most of those that carry the category either work on the edges featuring promotional items to bring in traffic, or try to be the one-stop shop in select categories such as hunting products, camping, collegiate apparel.”  Cowart said he sees many of his customers succeed in gifts, housewares and sporting goods alongside traditional hardware staples. “Stocking multiple unrelated categories under one roof — it's what makes local retail exciting to shop and profitable to run,” he said. However, one area of sporting goods that has seen recent year-over-year declines is firearms. Demand appears to have dropped thanks in part to the recent political transition to a president and Congress deemed less likely to legislate restrictions on gun sales.

Home Industry 5 top bets by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in 2016 5 top bets by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in 2016 Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sharply increased bets on airlines and iPhone maker Apple Inc. in the fourth quarter, while taking a stake in seed company Monsanto Co. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 15, 2017 7:42 PM Taken together, the holdings represent one of the largest common stock investments for Buffett’s company in years. (Reuters) Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sharply increased bets on airlines and iPhone maker Apple Inc. in the fourth quarter, while taking a stake in seed company Monsanto Co. Berkshire’s investments in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. climbed to more than $2 billion each, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based company. It also disclosed a stake in Southwest Airlines Co. valued at about $2.2 billion as of Dec. 31. Taken together, the holdings represent one of the largest common stock investments for Buffett’s company in years. Berkshire first disclosed that it had invested in airlines in November, which came as a surprise to some, because the billionaire previously criticized the business. “There has been massive consolidation in that industry,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which oversees about $2.1 billion including Berkshire shares. Buffett likes investing in businesses that have a durable competitive advantage, Scherrer said, and “it seems like airlines now offer that.” American climbed 2.5 percent in extended trading at 6:04 p.m. in New York, while Delta rose 1.8 percent. United advanced 1.6 percent, while Southwest increased 1.3 percent. Apple shares were little changed. Parker’s Presentation Berkshire’s airline purchases were influenced, in part, by a presentation from American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing Berkshire’s strategy. Buffett said in November that Berkshire added Southwest shares after Sept. 30, without specifying how many. Watch this also: Tuesday’s filing also showed that Berkshire more than tripled its Apple holding to about 57 million shares. The stake is now valued at more than $7 billion, making Berkshire among the top 10 holders of the Cupertino, California-based company. The Monsanto stake was about 8 million shares and valued at more than $800 million. Bayer AG struck a $66 billion deal last year to take over the seed maker. “I’m assuming he sees the same thing we do, which is that there’s a good likelihood the deal with Bayer will go through,” Chris Shaw, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in New York, said by phone. Cash Hoard Buffett, 86, said last month that he’d been accelerating stock purchases at Berkshire, which he’s run for more than five decades. On Sept. 30, the company’s cash hoard hit a record $84.8 billion. It had been climbing in recent quarters because of profit from Berkshire’s dozens of subsidiaries and the redemption of securities that Buffett bought to fund deals. Not all the picks in the portfolio are Buffett’s. In 2010, he brought on Todd Combs, a former hedge fund manager, to help him pick stocks. A year later, the billionaire hired another money manager, Ted Weschler. The filing doesn’t show which person is responsible for each investment. In general, the deputies tend to make smaller investments than their boss. Buffett declined to discuss the rationale for the airline investments during an interview with Charlie Rose on Jan. 27, but he did say that the decision to buy was “in large part” his. Wal-Mart, Deere The billionaire further reduced his holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc., cutting it to less than 2 million shares as of Dec. 31. That compares with more than 60 million in 2014. Buffett has said online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. present an increasing threat to the big-box retailer. Berkshire exited stakes in Kinder Morgan Inc., NOW Inc. and Deere & Co. A rout in crop prices has left some farmers too cash-strapped to buy new tractors from the company. Deere slipped 0.7 percent in extended trading. Berkshire also reported owning about 167 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings Inc., valued at about $740 million at the end of 2016. The satellite radio provider is controlled by billionaire John Malone. Shares of Sirius jumped about 3 percent in extended trading, while climbed 1 percent. Even as Berkshire’s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they’ve become less important to the company’s overall performance. During the past two decades, Buffett has focused more on acquisitions than picking stocks. Berkshire’s dozens of subsidiaries include auto insurer Geico, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and railroad BNSF. Early last year, Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions, the $37 billion buyout of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier to the aerospace industry.

The drugs were allegedly seized during a traffic stop, last Tuesday. (Courtesy photo)   By ADAM ARMOUR News Coordinator A 911 call from a driver reportedly being harassed by another vehicle’s driver ended in the seizure of a large amount of crystal methamphetamine. Last Tuesday, Fulton police responded to a call through the Itawamba County 911 service from a driver heading east on I-22 claiming to be harassed by the driver of another vehicle. Less than an hour later, police had arrested Dustin Hall, 24, of Myrtle and Stephen Daniel, 23, of Ashland, and charged both with possession of crystal methamphetamine with intent to distribute. The charge was enhanced because the suspects allegedly had a firearm in their possession. According to Police Chief Reggie Johnson, who responded to the call, the alleged harassers were closely following the victim’s vehicle in what appeared to be pursuit, matching her speed when she attempted to accelerate or decelerate. In her 911 call, the victim claimed to know neither the driver of the pursuing vehicle nor the passenger, both of whom she described as white males. On the advice of the dispatcher, the victim pulled into the parking lot of the Fulton Walmart and waited for police to arrive. She later said the driver and passenger of the pursuing vehicle followed her into the parking lot. After she parked, they did, too. She claimed the two men stared at her from their vehicle. By the time Johnson arrived, the two suspects were attempting to leave the shopping center. He pulled their car over. The police chief said the suspects were visibly nervous as he interviewed them at their car. The driver, later identified as Hall, had a suspended license. He allegedly notified Johnson he was carrying a pistol inside the vehicle. According to Johnson, Hall allegedly tried to dispose of a plastic bag filled with more than 14 grams of crystal methamphetamine while they were talking by dropping it out of the vehicle’s window. “It was the biggest chunk of crystal meth I’d ever seen,” Johnson said. A search of the passenger, identified as Daniel, allegedly uncovered an additional three grams of crystal meth. Both men were arrested. The narcotics, gun and $400 in cash were seized. Johnson said neither suspect knew the driver they were reportedly harassing, nor did they seem to have a motive for following her. Both suspects were issued $5,000 bonds by Itawamba County Justice Court Judge John Bishop. They are currently being held in Itawamba County Jail. Fulton police were assisted by officers with the North Mississippi Narcotics Unit. adam.armour@journalinc.com Twitter: @admarmr Share this: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to Press This!

(Raynham Police Department) Print Email Alban Murtishi, MassLive.com By Alban Murtishi, MassLive.com The Republican Follow on Twitter on February 15, 2017 at 8:11 AM, updated February 15, 2017 at 12:24 PM comments A judge has ordered 49-year-old Nathaniel Simmons Jr. be held without bail after police said he kidnapped and raped a homeless woman, the Taunton Gazette reported.  Simmons is Level 3 sex offender and served time in prison in the 1990s after he was convicted for raping three women. A judge determined Simmons was too dangerous to be released during a hearing Monday.  Simmons was arrested last week after police said he assaulted a woman in a Walmart parking lot and slammed into a vehicle while speeding away from the cops. Police also discovered some the victim's clothes and machete nearby. Since then, many more allegations have surfaced, including claims by the victim that Simmons raped her, burned her with cigarettes and spit in her face at least 50 times, the Taunton Gazette reported.  During a dangerousness hearing held Monday, the 29-year-old victim, a homeless women from Taunton, told the court that she met Simmons early Wednesday morning in front of a convenience store. He allegedly offered her $50 to smoke crack and let him watch her perform a sexual act.  She also told Raynham police that Simmons identified himself as a cop after she asked him if he was.  The Taunton Gazette reports that the two drove to an apartment in Brockton, where Simmons showed her a gun.  From there, the situation turned, violent. The victim told the court that Simmons bit her, bruised her and burned her.  Police said they found bruises and marks on the victim's thighs.  An image of Nathaniel Simmons' grey Ford Taurus after the crash on Route 104 and King Philip Street.Raynham Police Department  That department received reports around 3 p.m. that a male had assaulted a woman in the parking lot and then drove away in a gray Ford Taurus, authorities said.   Simmons attempted to speed away, but ended up driving into the back of a vehicle at the intersection Route 104 and King Philip Street.

But the president who defrauded students, cheated contractors and shattered democratic norms on his way to the White House is apparently a stickler for following rules. The deportation, over protests, was another shot in the federal government's new war on immigrant communities. Its reverberations extend far beyond the 20 metro areas, including Phoenix, that are home to the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Guadalupes can be found in unexpected places. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Worthington, Minnesota, is a prairie town of 13,000 near the southwest corner of the state, just north of the Iowa line. It has a thriving little downtown spotted with restaurants and stores, and, from June to October, an open-air farmer's market in the old Campbell Soup Company parking lot. Along 10th Street, running through the center of the commercial district, the Top Asian Food and Deli features Asian, Spanish and African groceries, along with money-wiring services. Next door is El Mexicano #3, another grocery. Next to that is the El Mexicano restaurant, which is down the street from El Azteca and El Taco. City administrator Steve Robinson, a Worthington native, said that his 1978 graduating high school class had about 260 people. "Thinking back," he said in a phone interview, "I believe there were four non-Caucasian classmates." Immigrants began coming to Worthington from around the globe in the late 1980s, when the local pork-processing plant was expanding. The cultural transition was often excruciating. Natives, Robinson said, "were afraid to go to the grocery store because they were afraid they were going to be attacked." Crime in Worthington is lower than in most comparable towns within a 150-mile radius, and myths about the dangers of immigrants are "really starting to wane," Robinson said. It helps that immigrant businesses have revitalized a sinking downtown that seemed destined for destruction after a Walmart opened nearby. Today, the local JBS plant employs more than 2,000 people processing more than 20,000 hogs daily. Other businesses, including local farms, livestock transporters, veterinarians and Worthington's downtown merchants, all benefit from the plant's economic impact. Not everyone in Worthington is in the U.S. legally. In 2006, federal immigration agents raided the pork plant (then owned by Swift Co.) as part of a nationwide crackdown and arrested more than 200 workers there. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports greater restrictions on immigration, estimated in 2009 that almost one-quarter of Swift plant workers nationwide were undocumented immigrants. (Some undocumented workers use stolen Social Security numbers to obtain work; many companies pretend not to know.) The pro-immigration Migration Policy Institute, working from U.S. Census data, estimates that, nationally, about 13 percent of the workforce in the meat-processing sector is unauthorized. Worthington is not a sanctuary city. It lacks the resources of Los Angeles or San Francisco. "We don't care what your immigration status is," Robinson said. "We will, however, cooperate with immigration officials." If the feds come for local undocumented immigrants, there's little place for them to hide. The city works with community groups to counsel local immigrants on how to deal with law-enforcement authorities. "We have done demonstrations to show people how to behave during a routine traffic stop," Robinson said. "Many come from countries where the police have been the bad guys." The 2006 raid unleashed a wave of fear through the town. The plant lost workers. The town lost residents. But the trauma didn't stop Worthington's transformation into a cultural polyglot. President Donald Trump's multi-faceted campaign against immigrants is likewise futile. Deportations and immigration bans can impose misery on families and friends. They can compromise businesses, communities and local economies. But they won't make America white again. "First, the racial minority population is growing more from natural increase than immigration," said Brookings Institution demographer William Frey in an e-mail. "Second, the white population will start declining after the year 2025." Robinson said more than 50 languages are now spoken in Worthington. Its diversity is a product not of coastal cosmopolitanism but of low wages paid for hard work. The town's political leadership is still all white. But it probably won't be for long. Asked if there were anything Trump's immigration policies might do to alter Worthington's trajectory, Robinson didn't hesitate to answer: "Not at all." - Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg View.

Pokémon GO will get its first huge update this week: 80+ new Pokémon, new items, and more Posted 21 hours ago by Greg Kumparak (@grg) 0 SHARES Next Story Brexit bumps up the UK price of Microsoft’s Surface Book “When is another generation of Pokémon coming to Pokemon GO?!” It’s a question that the game’s players (including myself) have been shouting since… well, pretty much immediately after the game launched. We’ve finally got an official answer: “later this week”. The once oh-so-shaky servers have stabilized. The game is now available in most of the world. And now, about seven months after the game’s initial launch… it’s finally time for a bunch of new Pokémon. Niantic tells me that players will be able to find “over 80” new Johto Pokémon (those from 1999’s Pokémon Gold and Silver games, otherwise known as “Generation II”) within the next few days. I asked for a date more precise than “later this week”, but the company declined to get more specific. When asked whether the new Pokémon would be added all at once or rolled out gradually, though, a rep replied that they would all “be discoverable as soon as the update goes live.” Better news: the 80 they mentioned will all be discoverable “in the wild”, as they should be — not just from eggs, unlike the handful added in December. A few other things the company confirmed: New “evolution” items required to make certain Pokémon evolve are being added. Niantic tells me that evolution items will come from PokéStops, much like eggs/Pokeballs/etc. I wish they’d gotten a bit more creative there — it’s a good opportunity to add some sort of new gameplay mechanic. Two new types of berries are coming: Nanab berries, which make Pokemon slower and thus easier to hit, and the Pinap Berry, which doubles the amount of candy you get if your next catch attempt is a success. New avatar items — new hats, shirts, and pants are mentioned specifically. They mentioned new “encounter gameplay”, but they didn’t shed too much light on what that means They also released this trailer: Though there’s not much in terms of new encounter gameplay mechanics on display there, worth noting is the new berry shortcut button at 0:16, that the backpack is seemingly now a dedicated Pokéball drawer, and that the camera button got moved up to the top of the screen (until 0:29, at which point it’s suddenly back at the bottom right. Whoops!) Also worth noting: from 0:20 to 0:26, people are very clearly shown playing the game in mountains, woods, etc — the sorts of areas that the game has notoriously been pretty bad at populating, instead dumping lots and lots of Pokémon in Walmart parking lots. Wishful thinking by the trailer directors, or something more? Alas, not mentioned thus far with regards to this update: a better tracking system, trading, or player-versus-player battling. Anyway: this is by far the biggest batch of Pokémon added to the game since launch — we got Ditto back in November, a goofy little Pikachu in a Santa hat in December, and a handful of baby Pokémon that you could frustratingly only get from eggs (read: walking + random luck + maybe some premium items to speed up the process). “But wait, Greg! Didn’t Generation II originally add 100 Pokémon, not ~80?” Yeah, that’s where things get a little fuzzy. Niantic tells me “over 80” are being added, which leaves 20 sort of up in the air. 8 of those remaining 20 are the aforementioned babies(/their evolutions), and are already in the game. That leaves 12 — some of which will probably require those evolution items so Niantic isn’t counting them as discoverable “in the wild”, and 6 of which are presumably the Gen II “Legendary” Pokémon. Based on what we’ve seen with Gen I’s (still absent) Legendaries , those seem to be poker (Poké?) chips Niantic is hanging onto for later plans. How exactly it’ll all break down, though, will be figured out as soon as the players (Shout out to Silph Road and r/PokemonGo!) actually get their hands on the new content. That sense of discovery as everyone works together to catalog everything is half the fun. Will this update spark the same level of insanity that was seen with the game’s initial launch? Probably not. Does it need to? Nah. It’ll bring back a chunk of players who dropped off because they ran out of things to do, for sure — but striving for that same degree of ubiquitous and game-breaking popularity would be a fool’s errand. And for the folks who’ve made it this far and thus might care about the nitty-gritty, a few things I noticed in some screenshots they sent over: 1) Sup, Murkrow? 2) That’s the new berry drawer, as teased in the trailer 3) Looks like berries can be purchased now, given the Shop icon in the upper right 1) Pokémon in GO seem to have genders now, with an icon marking which gender-variant you’re looking at. 2) That silhouette on the “Evolve” button, assuming it’s part of the final release, suggests the button will now show what a Pokémon will evolve into when it’s tapped. With the addition of evolution items allowing one Pokémon to have multiple possible evolutions, this should help prevent any surprises. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Pokemon Go Description Pokemon Go is a mobile, location-based Pokemon game for Android and iOS.

From a young age, we listen attentively to stories – from tales in books to chronicles from the older generations. When we get older this fascination for fables doesn’t fade – whether it’s reading a gripping novel; watching the latest series or blockbuster movie; or being captivated by a person’s true life story. There’s a number of successes that bear testament to the power of storytelling in branding too. Locally, we’ve seen incredible success from the likes of Sally Williams Nougat who literally built the brand from the ground up through powerful storytelling.  In a commoditised confectionary category, Sally Williams set herself apart by captivating people with her tale of how she developed the world’s finest honey nougat. On packs and in interviews, she details how she embarked on a quest – from the souks of Marrakesh to the finest French bistros – in search of the perfect confectionary. It’s mysterious and intriguing, with an added rags to riches backstory of how she spent countless hours perfecting the recipe in her humble home garage. This has helped the brand go from strength to strength, locally and internationally – with the story also allowing her to extend into adjacent confectionary categories. In a very technical ‘audio’ category, Beats also utilised the power of storytelling to disrupt the headphone category and build a strong brand in a very short timeframe. The brand established a strong runway for growth by marketing the story of its founder, Dr Dre, who wanted to inject the energy and excitement of the recording studio into the Beats headset listening experience. It is a new, interesting story within a very ‘same-same scientific’ focused industry. There are a multitude of brand storytelling success stories across industries – some even brought to life through movies such as The Social Network (Facebook). It’s these stories that help brands to thrive, enhances the ability to charge a premium; and creates brand loyalists. Think about Apple: the exciting tale of Steve Jobs and Wozniak, trying to disrupt the world of computing with beautiful technology. Apple’s disruptive, ‘outside-in’ approach to computing story is certainly a lot more exciting than a ‘generic’ brand such as Acer (what’s their story?). As a result, Apple has attracted a set of brand evangelists who camp out year-after-year at their stores to get the latest and greatest Apple-branded product. I don’t ever recall hearing about anyone who have camped out to buy an Acer product…yet, it performs the same functionality as an Apple computer! So how can brands tap into the power of storytelling to enhance brand equity? Consider some of the following principles: Showcase your founders People connect with people; and many of the examples highlighted above, demonstrate how brands can use their founders or a persona to tell a successful brand story. And there’s heaps more: Richard Branson (Virgin), Sam Walton (Walmart), John Morgan (JP Morgan) and even Mrs Balls with her famous chutney, are the obvious ‘big’ ones that spring to mind.  But there are lots of small start-ups who are applying this principle too. For example, local start-up Tax Tim, has a cute story about its two founders: Evan always struggled with submitting his tax returns and explains how he always had to turn to his accountant friend, Marc to demystify the complexity.  It may require you to unearth that interesting tidbit about the person or team who had the ambition to launch something new. But think: if a bunch of accountants have a great story to tell, why can’t your brand founders do so too? Tax Tim founders Marc and Evan explain how Evan spent endless hours struggling with his tax submissions, and how he used to turn to his Marc to help him. Evan thought, “What if I could put Marc’s brain in a machine, then put it online, so that everyone could have their very own affordable tax man to help them?”  The two created Tax Tim, an award-winning interactive online user interface with backing from a number of institutions. Shout about your purpose Successful brands and businesses have a higher raison d’etre, which goes beyond solely focusing on making a profit. This ‘purpose’ could be based on realising non-financial ambitions such as solving a problem, helping people, or fulfilling an unmet need. The financial reward simply follows naturally. For example, eyewear brand Warby Parker has grown from strength to strength because of its associated purposeful story and innovative business model. The business is centred on the story of the founder who lost his glasses on a backpacking trip and as a student and couldn’t afford to replace them. After looking at the industry and realising that it was dominated by expensive retailers that were artificially inflating prices, he created Warby Parker. Warby Parker offers a retail alternative with good-looking eyewear through online and simple retail channels, without the expensive price tag and complexity. The brand’s purpose is to be all-inclusive and therefore for every pair of glasses sold, a pair distributed to someone in need. What’s not to love about the story; and in turn the brand? Understand that people love a disruptive challenger People are hardwired to support the underdog – whether it’s David defeating Goliath or a legal clerk with no experience or education taking on a behemoth Gas and Electrical company in Erin Brokovich– we love it when the challenger wins. Likewise, disruptive challenger brands should flaunt their stories. Locally, we’ve seen how Capitec has done this with great success. They clearly point out that they’re much simpler, more affordable and more transparent versus the big four banks. Staying true to the story of simplicity at every touch point has made Capitec a credible competitor in consumers’ eyes, and the company has reaped the rewards. Always be authentic As is the case with any tale, people want to hear the truth – and are sceptical when they don’t. Authenticity in one’s brand story is therefore key to unlock brand growth. Sometimes brands yearn so much for a story, that it results in a made-up tale which people question. Some time back, after a misleading promotion of ‘part of a healthy breakfast’ and an emphasis on a healthy living story, Nutella was forced to re-look its communication strategy. Yes, the brand could claim to be delicious, but healthy was a step too far in the consumer’s minds. Instead, the brand should have focused on other areas to build its brand story – the delicious ingredients; the childhood fun; its passionate employees; or even the role it plays in people’s breakfasts around the world. In conclusion, in a world where there’s so much choice, complexity and clutter, the importance of storytelling in branding cannot be overstated. Not only does storytelling bring life and emotion into our brands, it’s an incredibly powerful tool. When executed well, it can differentiate brands from competitors and connect brands with their customers to create all-important and profitable, brand loyalists. With this in mind, it’s time for marketers to interrogate their brands to find that golden nugget – a powerful brand story that truly engages and captivates.

What You Can Do to Help Us Serve You Better by Jamie Gilcig FEB 15, 2017 By admin on February 15, 20175 Comments Share on Facebook Follow on Facebook Add to Google+ Connect on Linked in Subscribe by Email Print This Post Cornwall Ontario – Eight is a mystical number.  It’s also a version of the infinity sign if you turn it sideways. The Cornwall Free News turned eight this week, on the 9th.    I decided to not have any fanfare or major celebration as the last time I did so, our 5th anniversary, I was falsely arrested by the Cornwall Community Police Service on charges of making threatening phone calls which records show I clearly never made.  (threatening or otherwise.) CFN is at a crossroads.  It’s the 6th year of a conspiratorial boycott led by City Hall which is kinda insane.   This newspaper is for sale, but media isn’t the best business to be in the year 2017. We pull in over 1 million human pageviews per month and still growing.   From a little berg like Cornwall that’s six flavours of amazing.     Does anyone really think it helps Cornwall for this boycott to be public?  What message does that send to the sixty or so percent of our audience that’s from outside of Cornwall? Don’t move here.  Don’t even think of starting a real business.   Corruption has led to brutally high taxes that are going up at an even faster rate as local industry closes.  That you can negotiate huge breaks on your MPAC evaluations due to dropping property values?   That we cite seniors for playing Abba?  Kill kids ice rinks and stop them from selling worms?    And that we try to kill local business if it’s not built by non local people?   Those are not messages that lead to growth and they all sit at the feet of those at council and certain managers that seem to essentially be paid to hurt the community.  It’s boggling at the very least…. Journalism is a dying trade as people, while still clamoring for real news, don’t seem to want to pay for it?  It’s a challenge that all media outlets face. The biggest problem facing journalism is that big corps have been allowed to gobble up most of we Independents which makes it easier for their fellow corporations and government to lean on them, essentially censure what they write about. When I defended our area twice successfully against Wal Mart for example it all but insured that we’d never get an ad from the money machine that it is even though it wastes metric tons of cash on print ads in other area media that can’t come close to our viewership. In fact in Cornwall the newspaper with the most actual ads has about the lowest readership.   It’s essentially non content, and because they charge less than the Seaway News does for its ads many of their long time advertisers have bailed on them.    Which is insane as the only real reason any entity should advertise is to gain visibility to large pools of viewers, especially if those viewers are their key demographics.  This newspaper that very few read actually has more pages per edition now than the Seaway News, mostly in ads.   That’s insane.  (And good for Mike Piette who is probably the best media sales rep in the area which also calls into question the business savvy of most of his clients) And then when their businesses struggle or fail they blame things like advertising. CFN for example not only charges less and offers more value, but has products our local competition simply do not offer.   We also are more result centric.   Many business people don’t understand how important it is not only to advertise and market, but to make sure that they are doing so properly.  It’s not enough to just show your logo and hope. All that being said the challenge facing CFN and all media is how to generate enough income to keep the lights on. As one of our city councilors likes to joke about, I tend to do just about everything to keep CFN running.  I’d love to have more help and staff; but without more revenue that can’t happen, especially as long as the boycott by the City continues.  (can you imagine a city trying to kill not only a locally grown business, but other local businesses that simply want to advertise where they please?  We had one local business pull their ad after sharing that we sent them three times as much traffic as all the other media combined because they had another business with city contracts that were threatened) The good news is that a recent court decision exposed a first conviction of conspiracy against the interests of this newspaper.  More to come soon hopefully…. We have already added digital ads which I never wanted to do.     We have a new subscription/donation button (click below) because nothing of value in this world is truly free.   If we had $1 per month from every viewer of CFN we’d be able to add 4-6 good emerging media jobs in this community which means we’d be able to deliver more of the content that our viewers love to click on.  I’ve actually had to turn down several stories this year because of the time and resources it would take to cover them. Our last option is a limited paywall.   That would mean you the viewer would have to pay to click on certain stories. We all deserve to be compensated when we do good work.   We have some terrific contributors to CFN and have this amazing policy where our writers get 50% of any sponsorship of their columns.   It’s a terrific value for sponsors as well as their ads in column essentially are ever green. So if you’re still reading this please ponder the value of CFN to you.  It might be a lot; it might be less, but it certainly is of value. What can you do to help? Keep reading.   Please share our content on social media and with your friends and family. Please comment on our stories on CFN and on our social media channels too!  Your voice counts.   How many media outlets have a Mission Statement like ours?  Oddly enough, even though our statement has been live since 2009 a city lawyer has tried to justify the boycott by suggesting that CFN is a blog instead of an Online Newspaper which as idiotic a statement as that is, has been accepted by many of our elected officials. Mission Statement CFN is an online newspaper whose Mission is to give voice to the many who’d never have an opportunity to have a voice whether via op-ed, letters, or comments on stories. To be non-partisan and allow voices to be heard even though our ownership, editors, staff, sponsors, and viewers may not always agree with them. For people to have voice, but still do so in a safe manner although they may be challenged strongly for those opinions.

The likes of Seaway News and Standard Freeloader is gossip and toilet paper. If the papers wasn’t full of ink and other garbage I would use it as toilet paper but it has other uses for those who have dogs to train as well as cleaning windows and mulching in gardens.

The Midlands company are taking a fight over the use of their name on an Asda product into the courtroom. The healthy eating company thinks the Walmart-owned retailer is unlawfully using their trade mark to help sell their new Slimzone range. Asda’s 13 diet ready meals all carry the Slimming World logo, as Asda says they fit in with Slimming World’s diet plan and can be enjoyed by the weight loss club’s members. So what is it all about? In January, Asda revealed a new line of frozen ready meals, which the supermarket says can help you lose weight if you’re following a Slimming World plan. Asda included the Slimming World trademark on its packaging to highlight this. On its press release publicising its new range, Asda said: “The meals have been designed to be free to enjoy if you’re following the Slimming World Extra Easy plan.” But Slimming World reckons Asda is using its trademark unlawfully. The weight loss club has its own set of branded meals sold in Iceland stores. What has Slimming World said? “After careful consideration and on the advice of our legal team, Slimming World has this week taken action to ask Asda to remove our trade marks from their range of Slimzone meals. “We believe that Asda are unlawfully using our much loved and much respected name and trade marks on their meals (that’s Slimming World, Extra Easy and Free), and are trading on the back of our brand’s reputation, which we’ve built and nurtured over 47 years. “We’ve worked hard over the years to earn the trust and confidence of our Consultants, our members and the UK and Irish public – and maintaining that trust and confidence is at the heart of our decision.” Why would Slimming World care? Surely the meals are a good thing if they help people lose weight? Well, as they said in a statement, Slimming World is a business and is aware of the power of its brand. It’s also said that it can not be sure Asda’s nutritional information adds up . The statement adds: “We are unable to give an accurate value for them and by our calculations from the very limited information we’ve been able to obtain, a number of the meals could not be designated Free [Free is a Slimming World trademark indicating the food can be eaten guilt-free as part of a plan]. “Although we asked Asda to let us have a more detailed breakdown of the ingredients used, they have not supplied those details and we have put on hold any decision about whether or not to include the meals in our official database. “We know that this news will be frustrating to some members and we are truly sorry for the disappointment it will cause. “The situation is beyond our control. “The case is now in the hands of a judge and we won’t be able to comment further on the meals themselves until we know the outcome of the case.” What has Asda said? An Asda spokeswoman said: “Our customers have told us that saving money and leading a healthy lifestyle is a priority and that is why we developed our Slimzone range for them. “We’re confident in Slimzone and our customers seem to love it too. “We’ve shared a full list of ingredients for the Slimzone meals to help our customers make up their own minds.” Read More Top stories Download the Telegraph app Shocking attack Traffic chaos City lose again Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @covtelegraph Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Asda Coventry Shopping What's On all Most Read Most Recent AsdaWhy Slimming World is taking ASDA to court The healthy eating company thinks the Walmart-owned retailer is unlawfully using their trade mark to help sell their new Slimzone range FacebookThis is what that purple bird on Facebook REALLY means The bird with the wobbly head has plagued the comment sections of nearly every post on the social networking site.

The doctors felt it was not feasible for him to return to the ship, which was to sail for Honolulu on Friday afternoon. We want to thank the people of Lihue, all of the hospital staff who helped us, the staff at the Kauai Palms Hotel and the Kauai taxi drivers, all of whom were most gracious and helpful. Thanks to James, who prayed for us as I walked with him to Walmart. Kauai is the most like the old Hawaii that we miss. Thank you for your Hawaiian hospitality and kindness. Much aloha, James and Nanci Billings, Honolulu Swimmers behaved badly The action of the Kauai High School boys swim team at the KIF swim championship on Jan. 30 was an act of unsportsmanlike conduct I have never seen in my 30-plus years of coaching age-group, high-school and college-level athletes. Their conduct was an arrogant act of trying to make fun of the Kapaa High School boys swim team by swimming butterfly in a freestyle event to show their superiority. Swimmers, coaches, athletic directors and principals need to be aware of the swimming future of high-school swimming on Kauai. Getting students to go out for a sport that has meager spectator base where parents of swimmers are officials, timers and spectators is not very popular among students. The practices are difficult and under adverse weather conditions in the late afternoon swimming in water temperature averaging in the 60-degree range, and the rewards are meager. Waimea High School does not field a boys swim team for those reasons. At a time where swimming needs to be promoted, acts like that of the Kauai High School boys swim team only discourages others from participating. If Kapaa does not field a boys swim team in the future, there is great chance that KIF boys swimming will be eliminated as a sport and boy swimmers will not be able to participate in state championships. Kapaa coaches Kara and Jeremy have over many years been doing a tremendous job in getting students to go out for swimming and fielding competitive teams. The majority of their swimmers have no swimming experience and had to be taught how to swim competitively. They also take in special-needs students on their team. Two of the swimmers on the Kapaa relay team that was involved could barely swim across the pool when they first joined the team. Thank heaven, they won. A majority of the Kapaa swimmers do not have the financial capability of joining a year-round program to enhance their swimming skills. It is a sport that demands year-long competition to reach potential. KIF athletes sign a contract of behavior and athletes, parents and school administrators need to review and inform all those involved. I have lost respect for the Kauai High School swim coaches who allowed such behavior to occur and to the athletic director and principal who showed no courage in not suspending those involved. All must be aware that high school athletics is a privilege and not a right. James Kitamura, Retired athletic director, Kapaa Councilmember on Waioli board I see from the website of Waioli Corporation, that Councilmember Derek Kawakami has recently become a member of their Board of Trustees. This is a major conflict of interest due to Kauai County budgeting $70,000 of taxpayer money to build a fence that is intended to protect Waioli’s 541 acres at Lepeuli, and their neighbor Patricia Hanwright’s land. It will also block a state owned historic ala loa trail there. Councilmember Kawakami needs to choose whether he wants to serve the public interest as a councilmember, or serve Waioli Corporation’s private anti-access interests.

Cutner February 15, 2017 State Farm Insurance and other insurers slapped with Washington fines2017-02-13T11:10:00+00:00 Financial News, Insurance Industry News, Insurance News Articles, Latest Insurance News Articles No Comment Share It!3000000 The state’s insurance commissioner has issued the penalties to brokers and agents as well. Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler has slapped State Farm Insurance, other insurers, agents and brokers with a number of fines throughout January. These fines totaled $15,000 and were issued for having violated the state’s insurance industry regulations. The largest fines the commissioner doled out were to State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. from Bloomington, Indiana. State Farm Insurance saw two thirds of the total fines from the Washington insurance commissioner. They were ordered to pay $10,000 for regulation violations. More specifically, the fine was for a failure to notify 151 policyholders that their farm-ranch homeowners policies would not protect them against flood damage. Furthermore, State Farm did not notify another 141,000 policyholders who had homeowners, condominium, renters’ or manufactured home policies. The insurance company provided customers this notification upon renewal of those policies. That said, State Farm Insurance wasn’t alone in receiving fines in Washington state last month. Heath Alliance Northwest Health Plan was required to pay $5,000 with regards to its management of a surety bond. In Washington state, all health insurance providers must carry a bond, insurance policy, securities or a cash deposit for indemnification of certain healthcare services. Health Alliance Northwest Health Plan had been using a surety bond, but it allowed it to lapse, no longer meeting the state’s legal requirements. The issue was only corrected when the insurance commissioner contacted them to alert them to the problem and require them to take action. The insurance company resolved the problem by making a funds deposit into a special trust account that complied with the state indemnity requirements. Aside from fines to State Farm Insurance and other insurers, Walmart Stores Inc. was also issued a cease and desist order. The retail giant was selling tire warranties to consumers without service contract provider registration. From June 2014 through July 2016, Walmart sold 112,561 warranties to customers in the state. This equated to $1.1 million in sales. The commissioner also issued a probationary license to Thomas C. Johnson who had applied for a state insurance producer’s license in October last year. The license was to sell life insurance. At the time of application, Johnson disclosed that he had two military offenses dating back to 2005.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Netflix, Amazon fuel L.A. office demand as streaming flourishes print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2965174 false Employees work in the offices of Fullscreen in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 18. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg) Click here to enlarge image Netflix, Amazon fuel L.A. office demand as streaming flourishes By Nicole Piper / Bloomberg Published Feb 15, 2017 at 12:02AM “House of Cards” needs more room. Netflix, the streaming service that’s home to the political drama, last month leased an entire five-story office building in Hollywood, less than three months after signing a decade-long deal for adjacent stages and production offices, bringing its total space in the Sunset Bronson Studios complex to more than 500,000 square feet (46,500 square meters) — roughly the size of five Wal-Mart stores. The surge in online television viewing is spurring a wave of big real estate deals, as companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com and Google snap up space to cope with increased production demands. The amount of office space the entertainment industry occupies in Los Angeles County has climbed to the most this decade, with media tenants in 25.5 million square feet, up 2.99 million square feet from five years earlier, according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc. The space the streaming companies lease has evolved from the small offices of a few years ago to the giant production facilities typically associated with traditional Hollywood studios. “The sort of boom around those marketplaces has been specific to the digital media and the entertainment world converging with the technology world,” said Victor Coleman, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., Netflix’s landlord at Sunset Bronson Studios. The surge in leasing by entertainment companies reaches from downtown L.A. and Hollywood to Playa Vista, once a stretch of marshland between Los Angeles International Airport and Venice that’s become known as “Silicon Beach” because of an influx of media companies and digital startups. Entertainment-industry growth has helped an office market hurt by a years-long exodus of traditional users of corporate space, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which moved to Virginia. Like Netflix, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures set up offices in Hollywood, while Amazon Studios is in Santa Monica and producers of original shows for Hulu’s service have used space at Culver City’s historic Culver Studios, where classics such as “Gone With the Wind” and “Citizen Kane” were filmed. Netflix’s expanded Southern California facilities will be spread across multiple buildings at Sunset Bronson Studios, former home of Warner Bros. Studios, where “The Jazz Singer,” the movie industry’s first “talkie,” was filmed in 1927. “What’s going on in L.A. now is very similar to what we saw many years ago, when the cable companies were growing rapidly,” said Jeff Pion, a vice chairman at Los Angeles-based CBRE. Rising demand for digital content, and the additional production that comes with it, mirrors the era when cable subscriptions climbed and new TV channels brought viewers more options, he said. Demand for space is being bolstered by both commercial and critical successes for the streaming services. Netflix signed up a record 7.05 million new customers in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ estimates for domestic and international growth to cap the company’s first year as a global online-TV service. Its show “House of Cards,” an Emmy nominee for outstanding drama series last year, returns for a fifth season in May. Amazon, meanwhile, last month made history by becoming the first online-video service to receive an Academy Awards best picture nomination, for “Manchester by the Sea,” which secured a total of six Oscar nominations. Entertainment companies have very different demands from those of older L.A. tenants. In Playa Vista, offices are spacious and relaxed, with young people in leggings and beanies working on their laptops while lounging on couches, sunk into beanbag chairs or perched on bar stools. Employees’ dogs run from room to room. “Our mom and dads’ office space is not the office space we want to work in today,” said Brookfield’s Girard, adding that the style once favored mostly by technology and media companies is catching on with traditional office tenants. “Now banks and lawyers want creative space too.” 16465022 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

The network on Tuesday, February 14 handed out a renewal to the America Ferrera-led comedy. The series will return for a 22-episode third season, The Hollywood Reporter reveals. “We are extremely proud of Superstore, which is one of the smartest and funniest comedies on television today,” NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke said in a statement. “Through the show’s expertly drawn characters, our producers and cast do a remarkable job touching on many issues in which audiences can relate. To its credit, not only does Superstore make us laugh, but it makes us think as well.” The single-camera workplace comedy centers on a group of employees at a Wal-Mart-like retail store in St. Louis. Justin Spitzer (The Office) created the series and executive produces with Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad and Gabe Miller & Jonathan Green. Universal Television produces in association with Spitzer Holding Company and The District. Superstore was a solid performer for NBC in its first season last winter and became one of just two half-hours at the network to return for the 2016-17 season (the other being The Carmichael Show). Going into its second season, Superstore also got the benefit of airing a special episode behind the Summer Olympics in August — an episode which drew 9.7 million viewers. So far this season, the show has averaged a 1.8 demo rating among adults 18-49 in live-plus-seven-day numbers. Although the series was originally only picked up for a 13-episode season two, NBC ordered a back-nine in September. Superstore is the second comedy at NBC to get an early renewal, joining the Kristen Bell-Ted Danson starrer The Good Place. The network also handed out a two-season renewal to family drama This Is Us last month. While the latter hails from outside studio 20th Century Fox Television, Superstore and The Good Place are both produced in-house — a sign of the times as networks continue to push for vertical integration. NBC still has yet to launch several first-year comedies, including legal satire Trial & Error, Marlon Wayans' Marlon and Great News from 30 Rock exec producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. In addition to Superstore and The Good Place, the network also has the Will & Grace revival on deck for the 2017-18 season. Related links: The Hollywood Reporter.

Credit: Owen Daugherty | Lantern reporter The holiday came in handy as a national farmworkers-advocacy group used a Valentine’s theme to ask Wendy’s to join the Fair Food Program, with individual requests mailed to CEO Todd Penegor. Meanwhile, the OSU chapter of the Student/Farmworker Alliance hand-delivered its version of the request to University President Michael Drake, encouraging the school to drop its contract with Wendy’s until it joins the program. Though the Fair Food Program has added 14 major corporations to its program, it hasn’t convinced Wendy’s to join. Unlike McDonald’s and Burger King, for example, which buy tomatoes from farms in Florida that are protected by the Fair Food Program’s code of conduct, Wendy’s gets its tomatoes from Mexico, where “human-rights conditions are worse across the board,” said Leonel Perez, a farmworker and member with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a workers’ rights organization. The Fair Food Program, the CIW and the Alliance for Fair Food work together with purchasers — including McDonald’s and Burger King, as well as Wal-Mart and Chipotle — to ensure the protection of rights and wages for farmers and farmworkers in Immokalee, Florida, according to their websites. “What we’re seeking is basic human rights for workers and that there will be respect in the workplace,” Perez said through translator Shelby Mack, the faith and food organizer with the Alliance for Fair Food. Wendy’s tomatoes have been an issue the OSU Student/Farmworker Alliance has been battling since 2014, said Ben Wibking, a graduate student in astronomy and a member of the group. OSU’s contract with the Columbus-based fast-food chain pertains to the Wendy’s location inside the Wexner Medical Center. The past two contracts between OSU and Wendy’s state, under the “option to renew” section, that the school will work to find “a resolution of the concerns of the Student Farm Workers Alliance regarding the procurement of tomatoes for the operation of Tenant’s business at the Premise that is satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.” Wibking said the Student Farm Workers Alliance feels stiffed. That was the main goal of the reminders to Drake — to convince OSU to keep its promise. Perez echoed this message. “It was a call for the administration to take a careful look at the corporations they are doing business with,” he said.   OSU spokesman Ben Johnson said the university is committed to working with the students and with Wendy’s, but he said the students declined an offer to meet directly with Wendy’s. In the meantime, OSU extended the lease for six months in November. Wibking said the group declined to meet with Wendy’s because of a statement it posted on its website in 2013. In the statement, Wendy’s said it is being targeted by CIW and that the restaurant should only have to negotiate directly with the supplier, not a third-party organization like CIW. Workers in Immokalee, Florida, are not paid on an hourly or weekly basis, but rather by output, Perez said. One of the calls from the Fair Food Program is that an extra penny per pound of tomatoes picked goes directly to the farmworkers. By adding this extra penny per pound, Perez said workers would notice a significant increase in their pay. Without the Fair Food Program, if a farmworker in Immokalee, Florida, works a full day and harvests 160 32-pound baskets of tomatoes, the worker would be making roughly minimum wage, Perez said. “Workers can’t earn a living and survive under these kind of conditions,” Perez said. The additional-penny-per-pound system created by the Fair Food Program would require corporations to pay more to the growers who then distribute the extra money into the farmworkers’ paychecks. Depending on the amount of produce corporations order, farmworkers have seen a $20 to $60 raise in their paychecks per week, Perez said. Even though these groups and organizations are working on behalf of farmworkers in Florida, Perez said this impacts everyone. “If you eat, you are connected to farmworkers,” he said.

Buy your tomatoes from Florida. But let’s be real… if you want to be effective, meet with Wendy’s. Declining an invitation shows that you would rather use the media to get your message across versus discussing your concerns with a company you feel could be the root cause of an issue and possibly make some changes. There is a reason why many people are sick of both politics and the media. Reply Pat February 15, 2017 at 9:06 am Fairness is of the utmost importance, but thuggery to force a company to join an organization is wrong on every level. If you want Wendy’s to join and they are not interested, then it would be wise to ask them why?. If this article is correct, the implication that this organization has socialist underpinnings may be the first problem. As Greg pointed out, but in my own words, you solve problems and differences through face to face discussions with individuals, not by blasting someone (or a corporation, which is merely a collection of individuals) in the media. No one will listen to you if you are not willing to listen as well. Reply amiacalva February 15, 2017 at 9:16 am Hmm…lemme see, pay higher wages to Americans that already have great living conditions and privileges, thus paying higher prices for my food, or stiff the much poorer Mexicans that rely on those jobs, as well as the country of Mexico which will encourage more illegal immigration. I detest unions, they are the scum-sucking bane of freedom, and will fight (physically as well as vocally) to my last breath against their underhanded attempts to gain more for themselves at the expense of others. Yes, i want lower prices. Yes, at the expense of unions with their overloaded bureaucracies and machinations to enlist governments to ensure their monopoly on goods and prices. Don’t be fooled, naive ones, while this “Fair Food” pogrom…er, “program”…may sound all cool and happy it is fascism on and under its surface. Make other countries better able to compete and the world benefits, isolate them and foster terrorism. Yes, i’m an American through and through (i served, did you?), and you’re a bunch of selfish, small-minded lazy (“Time for another 15 minute break fellow union comrades!”) louts. Reply Jim February 15, 2017 at 9:22 am Wendy’s (as a corporation), and Dave Thomas (when he was alive as an individual), have provided millions of dollars in donations and benefits to the university, created thousands of jobs in central Ohio, hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, and been outstanding corporate citizens supporting hundreds of charities —– and people want them booted off campus because of their tomato supplier? Get a grip. No one should be telling them they have to pay semi-extortion to the CIW or any other worker advocacy group. I also agree with Greg above that not wanting to meet with Wendy’s show that this is just another grandstanding media event. Reply George Williams February 15, 2017 at 10:09 am More socialist crap. Let them eat organic free range cake. Reply Brian February 15, 2017 at 12:04 pm Wendy’s is a boon to Central Ohio. These socialists will not stop until they’ve destroyed everything good about our civilization. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Tracy Morgan, Jillian Bell and Charlie Day star in the comedy “Fist Fight.” (Photo: Bob Mahoney/Warner Bros.) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE LOS ANGELES – There’s a Tracy Morgan code-red emergency poolside at the W Hotel. The actor goes from loudly cracking funny , even throwing jokes to a nearby bikini-clad admirer, to suddenly being blinded by the emerging Southern California sun. He needs sunglasses — and not just any pair. Morgan needs his prescription Cazal shades, a designer pair with real gold hardware. His assistant thinks they might be in the hotel room, and Morgan looks perturbed. But that expression turns to joy when the $2,000 shades emerge. “Ah,” he proclaims blissfully, sliding them on. “Much better.” Related: 'SNL' leads late-night TV's Trump bump race 'SNL': Melissa McCarthy is back as Sean Spicer, and with a leaf blower Morgan’s entertainment future is so bright, he’s got to wear blinged-out shades. “Fist Fight,” his movie comedy, is the first project he has filmed since a near-fatal accident on June 7, 2014. After a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus, the “30 Rock” star ended up in a coma with a traumatic brain injury. However, Morgan, 48, has largely recuperated from the ordeal, which required him to learn to walk again, and he’s back doing what he loves: making comedy. He plays a gruff but oblivious coach in the R-rated “Fist Fight,” the tale of a meek teacher (Charlie Day) who’s challenged to a brawl by the tough colleague (Ice Cube) he got fired. “Thank God, I didn’t die in the accident, and I was there to do this,” says Morgan. “But I was hit by a truck. I was out for a year and change.” Morgan says he’s “95%” mentally recovered but still mourning friend and fellow comedian James McNair, who died in the crash: “I miss Jimmy every day.” He has a titanium rod “in my leg for life,” but says nothing else bothers him physically. Still, there have been emotional difficulties. Even after making a surprise 2015 Emmy Awards appearance to thank supporters and launching his Picking Up the Pieces comedy tour last year, the star feared he might not be funny anymore on the screen. “When you have a traumatic brain incident like that, there are a lot of components that go into it: the comedy timing, the instincts,” says Morgan. His costar Day noticed that Morgan was tight on the day “Fist Fight” began shooting in 2015. “So we kept rolling the camera even after those first scenes ended. And three takes in, it was like riding a bike,” Day says. “Tracy was the same old Tracy Morgan.” For Morgan, the laughter comes with relief and thanks to his many friends. As he talks about their loyalty, a tear rolls down his cheek, and he doesn’t wipe it away. He also makes it clear that “Fist Fight” is just the start. In May, the actor begins shooting a new, as-yet-untitled TBS comedy series based on his life. “I say ‘Thank you’ to God every morning.

Associated Press Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 | 6:10 p.m. OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett's company nearly quadrupled its investment in Apple to over 57 million shares during the last three months of last year. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed a quarterly update on its U.S. stock portfolio with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Besides the Apple move, Berkshire also revealed a new 8 million share stake in Monsanto and added to its relatively new airline investments. Berkshire, meanwhile, sold off a significant portion of its Wal-Mart investment and reduced its stake in the retailer to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million shares at the end of September. Berkshire's Apple Inc. stake is now worth $7.7 billion, up from roughly $2 billion the previous quarter. That investment got attention when it was first disclosed last year because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies. Investors like to look at Berkshire's investments because of Buffett's remarkably successful track record, although the filing doesn't make clear who made all the investments. Berkshire officials don't generally comment on the filings and didn't respond to questions Tuesday. Buffett handles the biggest investments in Berkshire's portfolio, such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM. He has said that investments of less than $1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each handle about $9 billion for Berkshire. Buffett surprised many people last fall by disclosing new investments in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest because he had previously advised investors to stay away from the airline sector. Berkshire added to all of its airline investments. At the end of 2016, Berkshire held 45.5 million shares of American, 60 million shares of Delta, 43.2 million shares of Southwest and nearly 29 million shares of United Continental. Besides investments the Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire owns more than 90 subsidiaries, including insurance, utility and jewelry firms. 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

The Legal Logik firm launched the class-action against Unilever Canada, Shoppers Drug Mart, Jean Coutu, Uniprix, Métro, Loblaws, Walmart and Familiprix. The class action argues that merchants of products for women have engaged in discriminatory pricing practices, said Jamie Benizri, a lawyer with Legal Logik. Benizri said the class action motion was launched after a Montreal woman claimed she’d been “discriminated against by way of price discrimination in the form of products that are more expensive for females versus their male counterparts for the same product and same quantity.” “We’re talking about the exact same product, same ingredients, essentially for the same product on a per-gram basis,” Benizri said. “She was paying on average 40 per cent more over certain products,” he said. “On a per-gram basis it was about 40 per cent more expensive.” “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms strictly prohibits any form of discrimination based on sex, yet surcharges on products for women is a practice that continues despite significant attention from the media,” added Michael Simkin, one of the Legal Logik attorneys who filed the motion. “We believe this is a practice that should stop and class members should be compensated for the actual costs as well as damages,” he said. Asked if the class action will result in compensation for class members or a reduction in price of certain consumer products, Benizri said: “I think it’s going to be both. I think the marketing practices are going to have to catch up to the discrepancy in prices. Companies are going to have to be a little more sensitive and a little more careful with respect to how they market to males and females. “I think we will see a shift in the way products are marketed in very gendered bias way. So hopefully we’ll see gender neutrality in marketing but I think we are looking to recapture some compensation for the class members who have been discriminated against.” Legal Logik said members of the class are requesting reimbursement for the price difference on products they have purchased, plus $50 in damages and interest for moral damages. Also requested will be $50 for damages and interest for an “unlawful and intentional violation of the right to gender equality”. The law firm from estimates that the total of damages, multiplied by the number of victims, could reach over 100 million dollars. jmeagher@postmedia.com While you were sleeping: Rock royalty, dark animation, the threat of...

(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) Likelihood of U.S. border tax fades in face of mounting opposition Add to ... Robert Fife - OTTAWA BUREAU CHIEF The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 7:59PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 8:43AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article The Trudeau government is increasingly optimistic that a U.S.-imposed border tax is unlikely to hit Canada because of mounting opposition to the Republican congressional plan from corporate America and the White House. The hefty 20-per-cent border tax, promoted by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, was not even raised in the Oval Office meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Donald Trump on Monday, according to a Canadian official. The President is already on record as being skeptical of the tax, calling it “too complicated.” Campbell Clark: Trudeau-Trump meeting may have appeased most Canadians – but not all Read more: How Donald Trump can sidestep Congress on NAFTA Explainer: What’s happening to NAFTA? A guide to what Trump and Trudeau are doing Mr. Trudeau voiced his own opposition to the proposed border tax in a later meeting with Mr. Ryan on Capitol Hill on Monday, the senior official said. The Ryan plan would hit imports with a 20-per-cent tax while exports would enjoy a 20-per-cent tax subsidy. It is seen by Mr. Ryan as way to pay for Mr. Trump’s proposed wall with Mexico, his plan to slash corporate taxes and massive infrastructure spending. Canadian and U.S. corporate leaders are mounting an intense lobbying campaign against the Ryan blueprint. More than 100 U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target, and trade associations, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have warned that the border tax would drive up consumer prices. “The border-adjustment tax idea is part of a broader tax reform. This is very much in the early stages and there is a broad diversity of opinion in the United States around that,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday. “We are in very close conversation with a lot of leading U.S. politicians.” When she was in Washington last week, Ms. Freeland told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that Canada was prepared to respond with tariffs of its own if the border tax was imposed. The U.S. Senate finance committee, which must sign off on new tax proposals, has also raised concerns about how the tax would affect consumers, workers and shareholders. Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo also said on Tuesday he doubted a proposed border tax on Mexican imports to the United States would ever materialize. Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Mexico City, Mr. Guajardo said he had spoken with several Trump advisers and had not found any uniformity in their backing of the border tax. “I wouldn’t be so certain that it will end up in the proposal,” he told reporters. The C.D. Howe Institute estimates the Ryan border tax would shave a full percentage point off Canada’s gross domestic product and would also damage the U.S. economy by making imports more costly to ordinary American families. Mr. Trudeau returned from Washington with a major achievement – a commitment from the President that he only wants to tweak the North American free-trade agreement as it affects Canadian trade. Mr. Trudeau also spoke to Mexico’s President on Tuesday to brief him on his talks at the White House. The opposition parties did not talk about NAFTA during the House of Commons Question Period on Tuesday, opting to focus on the softwood lumber dispute and Mr. Trump’s ban on Syrian refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. NDP MP Jenny Kwan attacked the Prime Minister for not criticizing the President’s “racist immigration policies,” and for not lodging strong objections about the fact that some Canadians have been turned back at the border. “From Vietnam to Iraq, Canada has a proud history of standing up to the U.S. on issues of principle,” she told the House. “So now that he is back safe and sound on Canadian soil, will the Prime Minister summon the courage to denounce Trump’s immigration policies?” Mr. Trudeau said the focus of the White House talks was to protect the Canadian economy, which sends more than 70 per cent of its exports to the United States. “We were able to ensure the Americans understood how many good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the close working relationship that we will continue to focus on,” he said. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale confirmed Tuesday that Mr. Trudeau did not broach the issue of Canadians who were turned back at the border under the President’s immigration ban, now rescinded by the U.S. courts. “There wasn’t an opportunity yesterday, but I do intend to make sure that the new Secretary is aware of the legitimate concerns of Canadians so we can both work together to make sure citizens of both countries are treated properly,” Mr. Goodale said. Instead, Mr. Goodale said the meeting was about economic co-operation, pointing to the President’s commitment to work out a deal to have joint U.S.-Canada customs officers preclear cargo at the plants. “Right now, we already have $2.5-billion of trade that moves back and forth across that border every day. That’s a huge volume. We can improve that relationship and one of the ways to do that is the preclearance process for cargo,” Mr. Goodale said. The Conservatives asked what the Prime Minister did to press the President to get a deal on softwood lumber, because it was not mentioned in Monday’s joint statement. “In Washington last week with [U.S.] Secretary Tillerson, I defended our producers and [Monday] in Washington the Prime Minister did that with energy and vigour and I did too,” Ms. Freeland told the House. “We are seeking a good deal for Canada, not just any deal.” In his Oval Office meeting with the President, Mr. Trudeau made the case to Mr. Trump that Canada should be exempted from his demand that NATO countries spend at least 2 per cent of gross-domestic spending on defence, military equipment and personnel, a Canadian official said. Canada’s defence spending is at 1 per cent, far less than the 3.6 per cent that Washington spends, or more than double the rest of all NATO countries combined. An official said the Americans do not believe the 2-per-cent threshold should apply to Canada because this country’s military has stepped up on repeated occasions to put troops on the ground, from major world wars to Afghanistan to Latvia. “The Canadian contribution to NATO is appreciated,” the official said. “We send real soldiers to do the difficult things.” With a report from Reuters Report Typo/Error Follow Robert Fife on Twitter: @RobertFife Also on The Globe and Mail While Trudeau and Trump praise Canada-U.S. trade agreements, the president adds ‘we’ll be tweaking it’ (The Globe and Mail)   More Related to this Story CAMPBELL CLARK Trudeau-Trump meeting may have appeased most Canadians – but not all How Donald Trump can sidestep Congress on NAFTA Canadian politicians and business leaders unite in face of trade threats Topics Paul Ryan United States of America Donald Trump Justin Trudeau Canada Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

Traditional retail channels including hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores had a combined growth rate of merely 0.7 percent, as they were squeezed by a moderating economy and a rapidly growing e-commerce. Local retailers have been gaining position with Sun Art Group, which operates Auchan and RT-Mart brands, continues to top urban China's market with a 7.7 percent share, followed by Vanguard Group's 6.4 percent. Walmart saw its market share rebounded to 4.9 percent from 4.8 percent a year ago as a result of more focus on China’s hinterland and a more aggressive online-to-offline strategy. Yonghui remained the fastest growing player in 2016, rising 0.6 percentage points to 2.8 percent by the end of 2016 thanks to 79 new stores opening in the past year. As many as 53.5 percent of China urban families have purchased FMCG online, 10 percentage points higher than the previous year and mobile commerce continues to be the key driver of e-commerce and has helped to drive even stronger consumer adoption in lower cities, the report shows.

Yes. It was sexist and demeaning to the brave members of the SLO fire department. I was more offended by the terrible jokes and bad acting. It was in poor taste, but the media is hyping it up way too much. The video was good-natured self-deprecation This is political correctness run amok!

According to SLO City Attorney Christine Dietrick, the city has received two fiery complaints “alleging a variety of violations of state and local workplace laws and policies.” If you missed last week’s column, the concern was over a steamy video of various female SLO Chamber of Commerce employees making sexist remarks to Olson in a searingly funny (Not! It was dumb!) video shown at its annual dinner and briefly uploaded to YouTube. Olson, wearing a city-owned body cam, recorded the women asking about sexy firefighters and whether they’ll attend the annual Chamber dinner shirtless. I’m too sexy for my shirt! Yeah, who isn’t? The SLO City Firefighters’ Local 3523 union was particularly hot under the collar, issuing a statement that characterized the video as “highly offensive sexual objectification,” adding, “members of Local 3523 are disturbed, sad, and embarrassed.” Hey, I agree that if the roles were reversed—men were asking women to come topless to a dinner—it would be rank sexism, but let’s ask ourselves a simple question: Who’s more susceptible to workplace harassment, men or women? Obviously, neither is acceptable, but let’s get a little perspective here! Was the video ill-conceived? Yes, that’s why I shredded it last week, but those involved have been contrite. Olson emailed New Times, expressing his regret, noting he was trying to be “self-deprecating, not deprecating of others,” adding, “Rather than defend my actions in the public setting, my focus is to take responsibility for my actions and express my sincere regret.” Well, I guess an apology isn’t good enough for the union, who’s demanding an independent investigation, though they may just be engaging in petty politics. Just last November, the union filed a lawsuit in a federal court alleging the city miscalculated and underpaid overtime benefits to two-dozen members over three years. Is their complaint about their members being “sad” or did they see a chance to stick it to the city and take it? Look, getting screwed out of overtime is truly something to be concerned about, but should we waste more taxpayer funds to investigate a tasteless video in which no one was actually sexually harassed? Let’s not pretend this is a five-alarm fire when it’s really nothing more than an easily stomped out ember. Put on your big-boy boots and move on, you smoldering sexy firefighters! What’s for sure going to be investigated locally is Arroyo Grande Mayor Jim Hill, who can’t seem to stay out of trouble. He’s now being accused of violating the Brown Act, meaning he allegedly shared confidential information from closed session meetings. The Arroyo Grande City Council voted to appoint an independent investigator—the law firm Liebert Cassidy Whitmore—and allocate up to $15,000 to determine if Hill did stuff like give his wife the password to his city email account. Hill says this is a politically driven attack generated by his forceful condemnation of John Wallace, who is accused of funneling money from the South SLO County Sanitation District when we was an administrator into his own engineering company, The Wallace Group. It’s not looking good for Wallace, who served the sanitation district for 27 years … or was he actually serving himself? His trial will tell! As for Hill’s upcoming investigation, even his stalwart comrade in arms, Arroyo Grande City Councilman Tim Brown, couldn’t blindly back Hill. The mayor’s main vocal support came from Los Osos resident and former Los Osos Community Services District Director Julie Tacker, who’s been accused of copious political shenanigans herself, including bankrupting the district she previously served. I haven’t seen this much finger pointing since I was a 5-year-old playing cowboys and Indians. Bam-bam! It’s like a banana republic down there! Meanwhile up in Atascadero, opponents of the proposed Walmart are doing their happy dance after the retail giant withdrew its plans to build a store—plans that were dragged through 10 years of protests and litigation. Anti-Walmart group Save Atascadero co-founder Tom Comar told The Tribune that the project was “not suitable for our small town” and noted the decision “made Atascadero great again.” Why? Because it was great before the proposed store and now that the store’s not coming, Atascadero’s great again? Huh? Look, I like Atascadero as much as the next office machine, but I’ve seen better city planning carried out by a kid with a Lego™ set. Walmart, which was supposed to begin construction this July, claimed a focus on cyber-shopping led it to withdraw. City officials who backed the Walmart plan had projected $580,000 per year in sales tax—a pretty substantial loss of potential revenue—and Atascadero Councilwoman Roberta Fonzi was particularly unhappy, though instead of blaming Walmart or even Save Atascadero, she blamed California’s cumbersome development regulations as well as California Gov. Jerry Brown. Huh? It’s Governor Moonbeam’s fault? Check your water supply. I think it’s full of Kool-Aid®. To sum up, SLO wants to investigate a silly video, Arroyo Grande pols want to play I know you are but what am I, and Atascadero thinks Jerry Brown ruined their chance at having a Walmart? This seems like a good time to say, Thanks Trump! The Shredder has been scratching his head a lot, and it ain’t dandruff! Send ideas and comments to shredder@newtimesslo.com.

Washington Man Allegedly texts his Ex-boss Instead of Hitman to Kill his Wife & Daughter for $1.5m Life Insurance 15.02.2017 at 10:23 pm By BellaNaija.com 7 Comments Photo Credit: Facebook Police has arrested Jeff Lytle, 42, from Washington for allegedly trying to murder his Filipino wife, Rhoda Mee Funtanilla Lytle, and four year old daughter. According to PEOPLE, Lytle, a father of two mistakenly sent a message to his former boss, thinking it was to a hitman requesting the murders of his wife and daughter. The former boss who received the text on February 7th, notified Snowhomish County Sheriff’s Office. He was thereafter arrested on two counts of criminal solicitation for first-degree murder. He remains in police custody on $1 million bail and court records indicate he has yet to enter a plea to the charges he faces. In the message, Lytle allegedly said: “Hey Shayne how’s it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer.” Lytle went onto explain that the reason he wanted his wife killing was for her $1 million life insurance that he was willing to split ’50/50′ with the killer. “Life insurance is worth 1 million (and there’s a bonus if) you can kill my four-year-old daughter. If you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00. I’ll split everything with the insurance 50/50.” the message read. According to police, Lytle initially denied the message was from his phone, later admitted to authoring the text. He said the message was his way of “venting” his anger at his wife, the affidavit alleges. Lytle told police he knows no one named “Shayne,” and that the text in question was written months ago following an argument he had had with his wife. He allegedly told investigators he usually deletes these cathartic messages, and theorized his daughter may have sent the message after discovering it in his “Drafts” folder, reads the affidavit. According to the criminal complaint, Lytle’s wife told police the couple had been married for seven years and that she was aware of no marital distress. She said the couple have been struggling financially as Lytle has been out of work. About BellaNaija.com Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is investing billions in airline stocks Akin Oyedele Feb. 14, 2017, 4:38 PM 20,364 facebook linkedin twitter email print Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.Rick Wilking/Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway upped its holdings in various airlines during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The 13F filing showed that Berkshire took a new position in Southwest Airlines, buying 43.2 million shares valued at $2.15 billion. The company increased its stake in Delta Air Lines by 848% to 60 million shares worth $2.95 billion. Berkshire also raised its stake in American Airlines. Buffett continued to load up on airline stocks even after calling the sector a "death trap for investors" during his 2013 annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire hiked its ownership in Apple by 277%, buying 42.1 million shares valued at $6.64 billion. Buffett's most valuable holding remained Kraft Heinz, and no change was made to the stake worth $28.4 billion. Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express also remained top holdings. Berkshire dumped nearly all its Walmart shares, cutting its stake by 89%. Berkshire's combined portfolio gained 15% during the fourth quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index of US stocks gained 3.3%. Major investment firms including hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time lag, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filings are made.

It’s a question we get asked all the time that has a simple solution. Including prints from Google Photos. Read on to learn how to make copies of your photos. Whether its with your own printer, online services or even mailed right to your house. Advertisement Our smartphones are capable of taking amazing photos these days. At the same time, they don’t need to stay digital copies or be shared in low resolution on Facebook. Print them and save a beautiful image forever. Read: How to Hide Photos, Video and Apps on Android  Users don’t need any fancy expensive printers either. We can use Google Cloud Print, apps that are designed for manufacturer printers and much more. There are multiple different options available. This is how to print photos from an Android smartphone. Our goal here today is to show owners that they have a lot of ways to do this. Using their own printer, a local Walgreens, or popular services and apps that do it for you. I’ve received over 300 photos in the mail for free, just by paying shipping and handling and using an app from the Google Play Store. Advertisement So without further delay, this is how you too can print photos right from your Android smartphone or tablet. Print Photos With a Home Printer As long as you have a decent printer, or better yet a photo printer, doing this at home is a breeze. The results might not be the best but it’s one of the easiest options for most. You’ll want a photo printer, photo paper (I prefer matte over glossy) and preferably some special photo ink. Next all we need is to use one of the many different apps and services available. First up is Google Cloud Print, but we’ve had mixed results using it. Download the dedicated Google Cloud Print app, and follow the steps to connect it to a printer. There are Cloud Print enabled printers available to buy, but regular old wired printers work just fine too. Once they are connected simply hit the “Share” button on any photo, share it to Google Cloud Print, and you’re all done. It’s pretty easy. Advertisement However, we’d recommend a few other options first as the results have been iffy at best using Google’s service. Instead, most printers have either WiFi or Bluetooth by default, and will work in seconds. Alternatively, many WiFi printers will have options to let owners quickly email photos from their phone right to it. Then, just edit or print them at will. Using the built-in share feature on Android owners can share photos to a Printer in a slew of different ways. Not to mention most popular brands have their own dedicated applications for exactly that. I use HP ePrint, but other companies have similar solutions. Here’s a list. Download HP ePrint Brother iPrint & Scan Epson iPrint Canon Print Service even manufacturers like Samsung Cloud Print All of the applications above can be found on the Google Play Store (or just click our links) and are extremely easy to use. Just follow the instructions, pair a printer to a mobile device, and print on the fly. Some even work when you aren’t home or on the same WiFi connection. Advertisement Above is a screenshot showing how easy it is open a photo and hit share, send a photo to HP ePrint, and print a photo from an Android smartphone in seconds. Their application is dead simple to use, has some decent editing tools, and works every time for me. Give any of the apps above a try today or read on for other options. Print Photos Locally If you don’t plan on printing photos often, or don’t have a good quality printer, use local stores instead. Of course anyone can walk into Walmart and print photos with a little Kiosk, but other much better options are readily available. The first thing that comes to mind is the app Kicksend. It will find nearby stores like Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Target, FedEx Kinkos and other locations. Right from the application you can upload as many or as few as you’d like, and get them printed and ready for pick-up the same day. Kodak has a similar app for finding a Kiosk to print from, and the Walgreen’s app has a photo upload option. Find what’s best for you, and get started. Then just pick-up your photos whenever they’re ready. Upload Photos and Have Them Delivered Last but not least, is probably the best option of all. Surely many of you have seen the commercials for popular services like Shutterfly, especially around Valentine’s Day. These apps essentially allow users to upload endless amounts of photos right from our Android smartphones or tablets. Choose the photo size, special options like gifts or fridge magnets, and get them printed and delivered right to your door. Often times completely free. Advertisement In fact, the Kicksend app mentioned above has this option too. They recommend using their paid print service and have the photos delivered, rather than picking them up locally. Our first recommendation would by Shutterfly. Simply download the app and get unlimited free prints in 4×6 or 4×4 prints. Just pay for shipping. A few of my photos had the tops cut-off, but getting over 300 photos for free is too good to pass up. Shutterfly has good quality prints, and tons of gift options. Like candles, cup coasters, fridge magnets and much more. Not to mention the unlimited free 4×6 are perfect for photo albums or scrap-booking. Alternatively, we’d also recommend users check out Mpix, Snapfish or FreePrints. All of these have easy to use apps that allow us to print photos from Android smartphones or tablets. Send some as a gift, get photos delivered to your door and more. All for a low fee. Of course at the end of the day you could just transfer photos from any device to your computer, and print them yourself. Or add them to a USB thumb drive and take it to any local store for quick quality prints. There are multiple options available these days, so choose what’s right for you. For those wondering, all of these options work great on the iPhone too. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By Kris B. Mamula / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette A $35 million specialty hospital that’s under construction in Lancaster, Pa., is blazing what could be the future of health care by promising big savings with assurances of quality care and patient satisfaction. General acute care hospitals should worry. For-profit Clio Health could change health care in the way Netflix streaming movies and TV shows changed Blockbuster Video. The affiliate of venture capital firm Aspire Ventures of Lancaster is building a private, micro-hospital with four operating rooms — and space to add two more — where a palette of surgical procedures will be done: general, orthopedic, spine, vascular, urological and cosmetic. The surgical services are among the most lucrative for community hospitals, where revenue generated from higher-margin service lines such as cardiology is often funneled to so-called loss leaders, including mental health services and staffing primary care doctors’ offices. In this way, competition from Clio could dent the budgets of nearby community hospitals. “This is going to have a pretty dramatic impact on health care,” Clio CEO Joseph Frank said. “What I see is a nationwide movement.” Size may impede traditional health systems in keeping up with the likes of Clio, said David Simons, an anesthesiologist and president of the Lancaster City & County Medical Society. “They’ve become very large, cumbersome in their ability to cut costs,” he said. So far, Lancaster-area doctors are reacting to the nimbler Clio with curiosity, said Dr. Simons, who is not affiliated with Clio, while some doctors view its emergence as an opportunity. While doctors wait and see what happens in Lancaster, Clio is pressing ahead with ambitious expansion plans for four more hospitals by 2019. None have been announced for Western Pennsylvania — yet. “Pittsburgh is a very sophisticated medical market,” said Mr. Frank, a University of Pittsburgh graduate. “We would be able to develop a micro-hospital there that would be so much more affordable.” Micro-hospitals are gaining traction nationwide because of comparatively lower construction costs and generally higher reimbursement for services than urgent care or ambulatory surgical centers. Clio says it will discount its surgical services by one-third to 50 percent when compared to the local health system, depending on the procedure. Beating those prices could mean less revenue to support lower margin service lines at traditional hospitals, according to Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a Downtown-based consultant. Whether that creates financial headaches for community hospitals depends on the facility’s operating overhead and other factors. “The evidence around the country is that you could charge a lot less for surgery without cherrypicking patients,” ones with the richest commercial insurance coverage and lowest medical risk, Mr. Miller said. “The truth is there is a lot of cross subsidization going on” inside most hospitals. Clio’s financial plan also calls for limiting acceptance of government health plans for the elderly, poor and disabled, Medicare and Medicaid, which community hospitals are obligated to accept. The new micro-hospital will only accept Medicare and Medicaid for doctor bills, medical imaging and rehabilitation therapy — not hospital or surgery center care due to legal requirements, a spokesman said. Health care experts say Medicare and Medicaid pay hospitals less for care than commercial insurers, and in the case of Medicaid, often less than the cost of providing the service. In some areas of Pennsylvania, private surgical hospitals have siphoned patients with commercial insurance while leaving community hospitals to deal with poorer, sicker and more costly patients. Clio’s strategy includes offering direct contracting for surgical care, a strategy used by Wal-Mart, Boeing and other big employers to hold down health care costs. Under the arrangement, self-insured employer groups will be able to contract directly for surgical care for employees. In addition to lower cost, specialty hospitals overall report fewer facility-acquired infections and complications, shorter stays and more convenience when compared to regular hospitals. Mr. Frank said Clio will offer all of those advantages to employer groups, plus advertise its rates for surgical procedures, allowing patients to shop for savings when the hospital opens in early 2018. Nationwide, few hospitals disclose charges and none in Western Pennsylvania have adopted the practice. The 35-bed Clio is projecting that it will perform 2,000 operations in Lancaster during its first year. By comparison, the 328-bed St. Clair Hospital in Mt. Lebanon reported a combined 7,766 inpatient and outpatient surgeries for the six months ending Dec. 31. “This is the beginning of something interesting,” Mr. Frank said. “The timing is right.” Kris B.

Hot Topics: Missing mother, child Frog Belly Farm cleanup Longmont home prices double AG sues Boulder County Airport noise News tips Longmont Humane Society reopens expanded clinic By Karen Antonacci Staff Writer Posted:   02/15/2017 07:47:58 PM MST Updated:   02/15/2017 07:50:33 PM MST Sue Peterson and her 12-year-old blind basset hound Baxter marveled at the amount of people and pets in the newly-reopened Well Pet Clinic at the Longmont Humane Society on Wednesday afternoon. The Longmont Humane Society announced earlier this month that crews had finished renovating and expanding the clinic in order to accommodate more people bringing in their pets for services such as exams, spaying and microchipping. More than 7,500 pets in the Longmont community were treated at the clinic in 2016, according to a news release. On Wednesday, people filled the waiting room as staff reopened after the lunch break. A dachshund puppy wagged his tail under his owner's chair, a black labrador mix happily gobbled down free treats and a cat in a carrier looked out with wide eyes at the whole scene. The clinic expansion includes a new, 349-square-foot lobby and a new, 114-square-foot exam room. Carrie Brackenridge, marketing and communication manager for the Longmont Humane Society, said that anecdotally there have been more and more people coming in to get their pets checked out. "We've had a pretty high demand for our services from the community and with the renovation, we can accommodate more people from the community and the space flows much better and more efficiently for our staff," Brackenridge said. Kelli Kanemoto, Longmont Humane Society director of development, said in an email that the renovation cost a total of $140,000. The Longmont Humane Society covered 55 percent of that cost while a grant covered 25 percent and corporate support from Sun Construction, Sam's Club/Walmart Foundation and the Kenneth & Myra Monfort Charitable Foundation covered the other 20 percent, Kanemoto wrote. Advertisement Peterson brings Baxter, who is diabetic, to the clinic regularly so veterinarians can check his glucose levels. Peterson said she was impressed with the renovation and expanded waiting area. "Oh, I think it's wonderful. It used to be so crowded we would sit out in the hallway," Peterson said as Baxter plopped down to the ground with a grunt. "And we need some space because the dogs are not supposed to meet because you never know why a dog is in here or if they have something quite contagious. This looks way more professional — there used to be stuff piled up behind the (reception) desk." The Longmont Area Chamber of Commerce will hold a ribbon cutting at the renovated clinic at 4 p.m. Thursday.

Move over, oil and gas. Retail is set to replace the troubled energy sector as the most distressed sector this year, according to ratings agencies, lawyers and analysts, beaten down by the strain of competition from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.75% and a range of other issues. The sector’s future is looking increasingly gloomy, with the cost of digital investments, trimming excessive store locations and lagging revenue amid declining traffic setting the stage for a spate of bankruptcies and restructurings in 2017 and 2018, experts say. The sector is grappling with changing consumer behavior and shrinking discretionary spending as consumers are faced with higher prices for everything from rent to prescriptions to gasoline. Fitch Ratings’ “Bonds of Concern” list is filled with retailers, and the agency is expecting the default rate for the sector to jump to 9% in 2017 from 1% over the last 12 months. The retail sector had $38.9 billion in outstanding debt as of December. Research firm CreditSights has an underperform rating on the sector’s bonds. See: Retailers are expected to suffer big spike in bond default rate in 2017 ‘What’s different about 2017 is we’re clearly seeing significant disruption from the rapid movement to online. So at a time when they have significant debt loads, declines in traffic, they’re over-stored and e-commerce is still in investment mode, it presents a challenging profile.’ Steve Barr, PwC Charlie O’Shea, Moody’s lead retail analyst, said his firm has 19 retail and apparel companies with a Caa credit rating or below, “the highest amount of highly distressed retail and apparel names since the recession.” That places them at least seven notches into speculative, or “junk” status, making them high credit risks. S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the majority of outlooks across retail and restaurants are stable, but the ratings trends are negative. “Shifting consumer preferences, and patches of global economic and policy uncertainty are contributing to the increasingly negative outlook bias,” the agency said this week. Read: TJX, Burlington, and other off-price retailers could benefit most from 2017 tax reform Also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy,’ and there may be no remedy In 2016, the energy sector was hammered by defaults, distressed exchanges and bankruptcies, although the recent recovery in oil futures to back above $50 a barrel has raised hopes the worst is over. But the issues facing the retail industry threaten to overwhelm companies that don’t have the liquidity to adjust to the changing landscape. Despite positive January results, the hurdles facing the sector are adding up, but sales are not and it’s already taking a toll. Eastern Outfitters, whose chains include Eastern Mountain Sports and Bob’s Stores, filed for Chapter 11 protection last week, and The Limited filed last month, causing the company to close all its stores. Don’t miss: The restaurant recession turned even more damaging in December Other companies that have filed for Chapter 11 or completely liquidated in the past year include Wet Seal, American Apparel, Aeropostale Inc. AROPQ, +3.18% and Sports Authority. Macy’s Inc. M, +0.18% , Gap Inc. GPS, +0.79% , Sears Holding Corp. SHLD, +6.76% and Guess Inc. GES, -0.88% are among the retailers that have announced store closures in recent months. Macy’s and Sears are often anchor stores that are meant to draw traffic to malls and other shopping centers, and specialty stores like Gap depend on the boost. Traffic declines are bad for them, mall operators, the restaurants and food courts housed in those shopping centers, and other groups that depend on the mall ecosystem. See also: Sears restructuring plan lacks the one thing it needs most: a way to drive sales “What’s different about 2017 is we’re clearly seeing significant disruption from the rapid movement to online,” said Steve Barr, PwC’s consumer markets leader. He believes 2017 will be a “tipping point” and expects more bankruptcies heading into 2018, he said. “So at a time when they have significant debt loads [and face] declines in traffic, they’re overstored, and e-commerce is still in investment mode, [and that] presents a challenging profile,” said Barr. Many of the companies facing trouble are apparel retailers, raising an issue unique to this area: relevance. “Putting aside metrics like debts and cash, it seems harder to put your arms around it,” said Corali Lopez-Castro, partner at Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton. “Trying to keep up with what’s next, then how do you get it into stores, then consumers don’t think you’re cool. How do you give your brand the cool factor?” The question of how to get merchandise into stores only has one answer: quickly. So-called ast fashion, like e-commerce, has changed the way retailers sell and present merchandise. Lopez-Castro highlighted the swift inventory turnover at Zara, an Inditex ITX, +0.11% company. “That’s why the consumer comes back,” she said. “They go back to the store knowing that they’ll see something new.” See: If Amazon grocery shopping is going to catch on, shoppers have to change Also: Amazon’s aggressive warehouse and shipping strategy is paying off What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? Prolonged challenges can weigh on liquidity. “A lot of retailers can survive one bad year,” said Philip Emma, senior analyst at Debtwire, a news and research firm focused on fixed-income markets. “But it becomes a problem when you string together a number of bad years.” The 2015 holiday season, with its unusually warm weather and heavy promotions, hurt many retailers as shoppers were reluctant to buy warm winter clothing during a warm spell. The weather was more seasonal for the 2016 holidays, but the discounting persisted. Add competition and, in apparel, a lack of fresh trends, and there’s another holiday season that falls short. “For certain retailers, if the business model isn’t sustainable, an initial debt cut might not be enough to get them through,” said Joshua Friedman, legal analyst at Debtwire. While he was reluctant to say that retail would follow in the energy sector’s path to bankruptcies, it’s “not hard to see distressed retail going into the restructuring field.” See also: Trump border tax would be a major blow for the troubled retail and restaurant sector The calendar isn’t helping, either, with Easter, an important holiday after the lull of the first quarter, pushed back this year. “Retailers have to get the goods in and pay for them and then there will be a lag time that will hurt their cash flow and further exacerbate the issues,” said Chuck Tatelbaum, senior attorney in the bankruptcy and creditors’-rights department at the Tripp Scott law firm. As if that weren’t enough, there’s also political uncertainty, the specter of rising interest rates, and the task of trying to keep up, which all requires cash. “Do you have the runway to make this change?” asked Moody’s O’Shea, who looks to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.04% and all of the money it has spent to transform its business, from the multibillion-dollar purchase of Jet.com to price investments. “It’s expensive,” he said. “The problem for many of these retailers is do they have the financial flexibility to cross the river and get to the other side?” On Tuesday, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +0.20% BRK.A, +0.23% disclosed that it slashed its stake in Wal-Mart in the fourth quarter to 1.39 million shares from 12.97 million. The latest challenge facing the sector is a doozy: President Donald Trump and his administration are proposing the introduction of a border-adjusted tax, which would tax imported goods, possibly at a rate of 20%, and subsidize exports through rebates. Trump has called out many companies, particularly car makers, for producing in countries including Mexico and then shipping their products back into the U.S., arguing they should be taxed for behavior that is keeping well-paid jobs out of the country. See: Trump is playing a starring role on U.S. companies’ quarterly conference calls Retailers are major importers and apparel retailers import about 98% of their products. No surprise, then, that a group of retail CEOs, including top executives from Target Corp. TGT, +0.15% , Best Buy Inc. BBY, +1.39% , Gap Inc. and AutoZone Inc. AZO, +0.50% , were in Washington on Wednesday to meet with congressional leaders and Trump to make their case against a border tax.
