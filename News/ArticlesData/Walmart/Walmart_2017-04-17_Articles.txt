Advanced Microgrid Solutions (AMS) last week said it will install 40 MWh of energy storage at 27 Walmart stores in the region. The systems will allow the retailer to reduce peak electricity demand and provide dispatchable grid support to Southern California Edison. "Cost efficiency is the hallmark of the Walmart brand," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president, energy for Walmart, said in an April 11 statement. "Adding energy storage capabilities to our clean energy resources reduces the capacity needed from the grid and is part of our commitment to increase reliance on renewable energy." Walmart plans to power 50 percent of its operations with renewable energy sources by 2025 and has already installed onsite generation, including solar PV, at 350 of its stores. A San Diego Walmart store last November began testing a refrigeration battery system that uses the store’s existing refrigeration to store cooling at night by freezing tanks of salt water. Walmart selected Axiom Exergy to install the energy storage system. "When it comes to sustainable and efficient energy management, Walmart sets the global standard," Susan Kennedy, CEO of AMS, said. "Walmart continues to demonstrate its visionary leadership by delivering high quality and low costs for its customers."[Native Advertisement] Lead image credit: Mike Mozart | Flickr Sponsored Content is made possible by our sponsor; it does not necessarily reflect the views of our editorial staff.

When he was mayor, Michael Bloomberg supported Walmart’s efforts to open a store in New York, but the company faced unremitting resistance from unions and elected officials, and it gave up the fight once de Blasio moved into Gracie Mansion. “I have been adamant that I don’t think Walmart — the company, the stores — belong in New York City,” de Blasio said. Walmart’s benefits are obvious to shoppers and to economists like Jason Furman, who served in the Clinton administration and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. In a paper, “Walmart: A Progressive Success Story,” Furman cited estimates that Walmart, by driving down prices, saved the typical American family more than $2,300 annually. That was about the same amount that a family on food stamps then received from the federal government. More On: walmart Professor sues Walmart over 'toilet cleaner' on fishing license Walmart is slashing online prices with in-store pickup Decomposing dead bat found in packaged salad Man who killed Walmart diaper thief charged with manslaughter How could any progressive with a conscience oppose an organization that confers such benefits? How could de Blasio and the council effectively take money out of the pockets of the poorest families in New York? Because, though they would deny it, they care a lot more about pleasing powerful labor interests, especially the United Food and Commercial Workers, which helped lead the long fight to keep Walmart out of the five boroughs. Labor activists have been spreading horror stories for more than a decade about Walmart’s purported mistreatment of workers, yet somehow they haven’t dissuaded thousands of people in other cities from lining up for jobs whenever a Walmart opens. Often there are five or 10 applicants for each job. As the economist Richard Vedder has noted, the pay at Walmart is comparable with that of other large retailers. Some argue that Walmart exerts downward pressure on retail wages, but even if that’s true — and it’s debatable — the effect is tiny compared with the savings at the cash register. According to Furman, Walmart lowered American retail workers’ pay by less than $5 billion while saving shoppers more than $250 billion with lower prices. Anti-Walmart agitators complain about the government subsidies that some of the company’s workers receive for health insurance, which, they argue, burden taxpayers. But these are the same Medicaid subsidies available to low-income workers at other stores and in other industries. It makes zero sense to single out Walmart employees, as the state of Maryland did with a law (eventually struck down in court) forcing Walmart alone to forgo government subsidies and shoulder these costs by itself. If the activists succeed in their quest to transfer these health-care costs to Walmart, they’ll be striking yet another blow against the poor. When low-income workers receive subsidized health insurance through Medicaid, the money comes out of general tax revenue — paid mainly by upper-income taxpayers. If Walmart becomes responsible for paying for its own subsidies, the company might offset the expense by reducing its workers’ cash wages. Or it might raise prices, which would effectively be a new regressive tax hitting its low-income customers hardest. Either way, the burden would shift from affluent taxpayers to the working poor. These Robin Hood-in-reverse effects prompted Furman to reject his fellow Democrats’ campaign against Walmart. “The collateral damage,” Furman wrote, “from these efforts to get Walmart to raise its wages and benefits is way too enormous and damaging to working people and the economy more broadly for me to sit by idly and sing ‘Kum-Ba-Ya’ in the interests of progressive harmony.” De Blasio and the council keep spouting these irrational arguments, but they haven’t persuaded the public. In a 2015 Quinnipiac poll asking whether Walmart stores should be allowed to open, New Yorkers favored Walmart 2 to 1. But so far, their feelings don’t seem to matter to de Blasio and his fellow progressives on the council. After all, as long as shoppers go on paying higher prices at unionized stores, some of their money will keep flowing to the mayor and his allies in the form of campaign contributions. To progressive politicians, that’s the ultimate in social justice. From the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal.

Source: Shutterstock According to reports, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s e-commerce division is approaching the final parts of the deal to acquire Bonobos. This continues the company’s buying spree under Marc Lore, the head of its e-commerce division. Recode claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Bonobos have agreed on a price for the acquisition. However, the financial details of the deal are not currently known. The men’s clothing brand was valued at $300 million back in 2014, but has since expanded its catalog to include more clothing and products. Lore, the founder and Jet.com, joined Walmart roughly seven months ago after it acquired his company. Since then, he has been working to acquire other brands to expand WMT’s e-commerce offerings. He said back in March that the retailer is still behind its rivals when it comes to its online offerings. Wal-Mart Stores Inc has been working hard lately to expand its e-commerce division. The company is attempting to play catch up so that it can better compete with online retail rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). One of Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s efforts to catch up with Amazon.com, Inc. includes offering discounts to customers that pick up online orders at its stores. This effort is another idea of Marc Lore’s. He says that the retailer can afford to offer the discounts because they are cutting out the cost of shipping the products to customers. WMT stock was up slightly as of Monday morning.

A Montana professor is suing Wal-Mart for libel because an employee listed the academic’s occupation as “toilet cleaner” on a fishing license application. Montana State University assistant professor Gilbert Kalonde bought a state fishing license from a Wal-Mart in April 2015, and a store employee used Kalonde’s MSU I.D. when filling out an application form, according to a complaint filed in Gallatin County District Court. But when the employee entered Kalonde’s occupation into a computer database, he wrote that the professor “cleans toilets,” the complaint charges. The incident exposed Kalonde to “hatred, contempt [and] ridicule,” the suit claims. Wal-Mart is looking into it, spokesman Ragan Dickens said. “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing,” Dickens told The Associated Press. “We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” With Post wires Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under fishing ,  lawsuits ,  montana ,  walmart ,  wtf Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Southwest pilot busted with loaded gun in carry-on at airp...

Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China. But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products "Made in USA." The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. "There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow." Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed "border tax" on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto's case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. "Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything's going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. "We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left," a White House official said, "and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that." Making robots great again In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA." Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. "We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics." The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company's hourly workforce is in "best-cost countries." When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules "it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there." That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. "We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change." Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant. "Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere." The rise and fall of U.S. manufacturing jobs U.S. manufacturing jobs hit a peak in June 1979, accounting for nearly one out of every five American workers. But despite a few upticks since then, manufacturing jobs as a percentage of the U.S. workforce have fallen consistently and now make up less than 10 percent of the total. Fall of the U.S. manufacturing worker Manufacturing employment as a percent of total civilian employment from 1979, when manufacturing employment peaked, to Feb. 2017 Global rise of the robot Number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10,000 employees in manufacturing.

(Photo: Todd McInturf / The Detroit News)Buy Photo 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is in talks to buy men’s clothing retail startup Bonobos Inc. for about $300 million, according to a person familiar with the situation. The discussions are in the final stages, though the timing of a deal hasn’t been determined, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Bonobos opened its first Michigan “guideshop” in February at 1417 Woodward in downtown Detroit. Wal-Mart has been buying e-commerce startups and emerging brands that used the internet to grow. Bonobos would represent Wal-Mart’s latest attempt to build its cachet online. The company acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year in a deal that transformed Wal-Mart’s web operations and brought in a fresh team of e-commerce executives. It followed that by snapping up outdoor retailer Moosejaw and women’s apparel seller ModCloth, earlier this year. Founded in 2007, Bonobos started by selling dress pants to men and quickly expanded its repertoire to shorts and colorful plaid shirts. While the brand started as an online-only retailer, Chief Executive Officer Andy Dunn has in recent years started to incorporate brick-and-mortar stores into its strategy. Bonobos has raised more than $120 million in total capital, according to CrunchBase, from investors including Coppel Capital, Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and retailer Nordstrom Inc. — which sells the brand’s products in its department stores. The news of the deal talks was reported by technology news website Recode on Friday.

A professor at Montana State University filed a lawsuit against a local Walmart over the making of his fishing license. Evidently, the clerk working the fishing license desk insulted the professor by allegedly printing “CLEAN TOILETS” under the occupation portion of the professor’s license. According to a lawsuit first obtained by WBZK in Montana and subsequently reviewed by the LawNewz, MSU Professor Gilbert Kalonde went to the local Walmart in April 2015 to renew his finishing license. The lawsuit claims he provided the store clerk with his MSU Faculty identification card that listed his occupation as “Faculty/Professional” at the university. According to the lawsuit, the clerk nonetheless manually entered “CLEAN TOILETS” under the occupation section of the fishing license. However, the clerk allegedly never asked Kalonde to verify if the information on the license was correct. When he returned to the store a year later to renew his license, the lawsuit claims he once again informed the clerk he was an MSU professor. However, he claims the clerk did not update his info or ask him to approve the license again. Fed up with the poor customer service, Kalonde says he asked the store manager for an updated license and written apology. He apparently only received the new license. He then contacted the ACLU of Montana, who filed a libel lawsuit on his behalf against the local Walmart. The lawsuit claims the clerk knowingly made the false entry on the license “with the purpose to expose Plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy.” Dr. Kalonde is of African dissent having been born in Zambia. He now resides in Montana and holds several degrees, including a masters and a PhD. Walmart national spokesman Ragan Dickens sent the news station the following statement: “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing.  We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” It looks like Walmart is not going to just rollover on this one.

Walmart training academies were introduced in 2016 and have expanded to 40 states. A replay of the graduation and grand opening is available on the Walmart Today Facebook page. “Everything we do begins with our associates,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “That’s why we have invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today’s retail environment. Walmart is a place where anyone can fulfill their potential.” Walmart training academies are dedicated facilities where associates receive instruction on retail fundamentals and area specific skills. Since the program launched, the curriculum has expanded training to cover more than 65 positions, including customer service manager, online grocery pickup, and assistant store manager. Associates are trained through a combination of classroom and sales floor exercises, utilizing technology including tablet computers and cloud storage for training materials. “These investments are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster check-out times,” added McMillon. Associates who go through training academy programs are able to earn while they learn new skills. Through skills training associates gain an increase in confidence and knowledge -- which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth and stability. Walmart Academies are providing additional marketable skills that help associates with the job they are in and prepare them for the next level job. “The Walmart Academy has given me the opportunity to help associates build and grow their careers with the company, but also helped me grow as a leader and an individual,” said Alesha Odenbret, Edmond Walmart Academy facilitator. “I have had an incredible experience with the company, and I wanted to be able to share that with other associates.” Walmart plans to have a total of 200 academies opened across all 50 states by the end of summer. Since 2016, more than 52,000 associates have graduated, with more than 225,000 associates on track to complete training in 2017. About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

But eventually they run out of real estate, and then they need the discipline to stop opening new stores and focus instead on driving more sales through their existing stores. They can boost sales and profits dramatically by making changes in the way they run their existing stores, such as with help from analytics and the use of technology. In fact, several such small changes brought in profits that helped 17 retailers outperform the stock performance of the S&P 500 index, according to a new study titled “Curing the Addiction to Growth” published in the Harvard Business Review by Marshall Fisher, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, along with his co-authors, Vishal Gaur (who has a PhD from the Wharton School and now is a professor at Cornell’s Johnson School) and Herb Kleinberger (who has an MBA from Wharton and for many years led PWC’s retail practice). The study covered a 22-year period, ending in 2015, at 37 companies. This group began the 22-year period with double digit top-line growth, which inevitably slowed to the low single digits during 2011-2015 as the retailers reached the maturity stage of their life cycle. Some winners, such as footwear retailer Foot Locker, saw their stock market returns grow 33% a year over this period, or nearly triple the S&P 500 average. Others that witnessed handsome stock market gains include Home Depot and McDonald’s. The lesson for the laggards is to pause, acknowledge the slowing growth, and look for solutions other than opening new stores. Fisher says retailers, as they mature, must break their “addiction” to top-line growth and adjust their strategies to the changed realities. He sees that maxim play out also with companies outside the retail industry. That approach could apply even to countries as they shift gears, he says, citing China’s efforts to move away from low-end contract manufacturing for the rest of the world to building its own brands for its domestic market. Fisher spoke about the chief takeaways from his research in a video interview with Knowledge@Wharton. (An edited transcript of that interview appears below.) He and HBR editor Steve Prokesch also discussed it on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to a podcast of that conversation below.) Knowledge@Wharton: How did the idea for this article came about? Marshall Fisher: My co-authors and I have worked with retailers for a long time, maybe 20 years. Back in the mid-1990s when we started working with retailers, many of the successful ones were category killers that had been founded in the 1970s and were still growing at a hugely rapid rate. You can think of Home Depot, Staples, Urban Outfitters – a long list of retailers. [They were] the iconic success of the time. [They were] young, had an innovative format, [and posted] rapid growth. We can add Wal-Mart to that list. I remember [thinking that their growth rate] can’t go on forever. Wal-Mart’s compounded annual growth rate in its first 20 years was 43% a year. If Wal-Mart had kept growing at that rate, its revenue [today] would be more than triple the world’s GDP. It’s obvious that you eventually run out of places to put stores. Or if you’re an internet retailer, rapid growth depends on attracting new customers. There’s a finite number of people in the world, so you’re going to have to slow eventually. Why is so much emphasis placed on top-line growth? It’s glamorous. It’s cool. Everybody likes it. My co-authors and I wondered, what happens when top-line growth inevitably slows? Do you curl up and die, or is there a way to prosper with single digit revenue growth? “What happens when top-line growth inevitably slows? Do you curl up and die, or is there a way to prosper with single digit revenue growth?” Knowledge@Wharton: How did you go about conducting your study? Fisher: Vishal [Gaur], our data analytics expert, collected data on several hundred publicly traded U.S. retailers. We narrowed that down to 37 retailers that had been continuously in business for a 22-year period ending in 2015. As a group, [the retailers in our study] had been growing at around 15% [a year]. In the last five years, that growth has slowed to 4.6%. They had all gone through this lifecycle of rapid growth to maturity, and most of them had languished. Their stock had been flat in the last five years. But a handful were really rocking. Foot Locker, for example, had experienced single-digit growth in the last five years, but [had a] stock market return of 33% per year, which is triple the S&P [index] over a five-year period. That’s impressive. How the Winners Did It Knowledge@Wharton: That’s remarkable growth. Of the group of 37 companies, 17 were successful. How did they do it? Fisher: First of all, we define success as five-year total stock market return that exceeded the S&P 500 return, so 17 companies were above [that level]; 20 were below. Sponsored Content: They did a couple of things. They stopped or greatly slowed their rate of opening new stores. By the way, the winners and losers had essentially identical top-line growth rates. The winners got that growth mostly through existing stores, whereas the less successful group got their growth mostly by opening new stores. You could think about which is easier – opening a new store or somehow getting your customers to drive more traffic and more sales through existing stores. The first is much easier. It’s much easier to open a new store, [although that is] not trivial. But which is more accretive to earnings? It’s the comp-store sales because you’re leveraging an investment you’ve already made in your existing stores. So what retailers call comparable-store sales growth is incredibly enhancing to profit. Knowledge@Wharton: Even though opening new stores is easier, it’s also probably much more expensive. Fisher: It’s more expensive. The Growth Addiction Knowledge@Wharton: Going back to the title of your study, what is driving this addiction to growth even though retailers realize that they’re driving growth at the cost of their profits? Fisher: Let’s first recap the growth model. When Wal-Mart was growing at 43%, they were opening stores at about the same rate – 43%. And their profit was growing at about 43%. So what they are doing is running their business through a copying machine. They’re just turning out more and more copies of the exact same business. They did enhancements to the business model, of course, but most of the gain came from just scaling the business. That’s a great game to play as long as you have enough places to put new stores. But eventually you’re putting stores in less desirable locations, and you’re cannibalizing existing stores. So, suddenly when you open X% new stores, revenue doesn’t grow by X%; it grows by something a little smaller than X%. Then what happens is your expenses are growing faster than your revenue, and eroding your earnings. Why is it so hard to let go of that? The most interesting finding was not the formula for success, which is to drive comparable-store sales. I talked extensively with Bob Marshall, a vice president at McDonald’s, which was one of the successful retailers in our study. He said, “Look, the formula for success is scale until you run out of geography and then drive comp-store sales until you run out of ideas.” So the scaling by opening new stores is pretty much an execution game. Wal-Mart executives are constantly on their iPhone. They’re working like demons, sun up to sunset with a to-do list. They’re executing because that’s the “open store” game. “Whether it’s the financial investment world, the stock market analysts or consultants, they all like to talk about the growth story. It’s a kind of addiction.” In driving comp-sales, you’ve got to be more thoughtful. That’s an idea game. They’re very different games. Not to pick on Wal-Mart or sound like I am because I have great admiration for them, but if you are playing the execution game, they famously disdain hiring from the Ivy League [universities]. [They] don’t need those high-falutin Ivy League types. That’s a different kind of talent than if you’re figuring out ideas. It’s a different game, and it requires different talent. I think in general the popular world, such as the business commentators, like growth. It’s a positive, simple story to understand. This idea that, “Oh yeah, we’re not growing the top line all that much, but we’ve figured out all these smart ways to grow our bottom line” maybe sounds a little like financial engineering to people and their eyes glass over. So whether it’s the financial investment world, the stock market analysts or consultants, they all like to talk about the growth story. It’s a kind of addiction, I think. Also, if you’ve been opening stores, and that’s been your modus operandi, you’ve got a whole group within the company whose job is to open stores. You would have to fire that group or curtail them [if you change your strategy]. So there’s an infrastructure in most retailers, both emotionally and physically, and external forces leading that way that make their first thought when growth slows to redouble their top-line growth. There’s a kind of a denial period. Many of our successful retailers, such as Home Depot and McDonald’s, went through a period of maybe five years where they pushed growth beyond the point where it was there to be profitably had, and had to at some point say, “Wait a minute, this isn’t working; we’ve got to change our game.” Changing Old Mindsets Knowledge@Wharton: In changing the game, how do you make the transition from a mindset that is focused on execution to a mindset that’s focused on ideas? Fisher: Step one is to accept reality. You need to collect metrics — sales per store, for example — to know when the scaling strategy you have been following is no longer working. Most of the successful ones used [the metric of] return on invested capital. For a new store there’s an investment, and a return, which is the profit on the sales. You need to slow or stop opening new stores when that number goes the wrong way. Step one is to simply look around you and assess the effectiveness of what you’re doing. Then there’s a different set of projects you’ve got to put on your capital budget list, which drive comparable-store sales through your existing stores. For example, Foot Locker installed a device called a “scan gun,” and this was one of 20 or 30 things they did. We all know what the shoe process is like. You go in. You tell the sales associate what you’re looking for. He goes to the back room and he brings out two or three pairs. You try them on. Maybe one doesn’t fit. In another, you don’t like the color. The sales associate goes back and forth to the back room, making typically five or six trips. All this takes a long time. Meanwhile you’re leaving the customer sitting there. So Foot Locker put in place this scan gun that would let the sales associate while he’s in front of the customer know exactly what’s in stock in the back room of that store, neighboring stores or on the internet so he could have a more helpful conversation with the customer on what they’ve got that might be more toward what [the customer is] looking for. And he could have an assistant bring those shoes out to the customer. That added 2% to store sales, they estimated. That is not a huge number, but [the effects could be large if] you do 20 or 30 things like that. All of those take an investment, just as opening a new store takes an investment. So in your capital budgeting process you start looking at not just new stores as investments to drive your top line, but also things you can do within the stores [with help from] technology. Knowledge@Wharton: In addition to Foot Locker, you also mentioned Home Depot and McDonald’s as retailers that did very well. Do you have any examples of some of the ideas that they implemented to more intensively drive business through their stores? “You need to collect metrics — sales per store, for example — to know when the scaling strategy you have been following is no longer working.” Fisher: Absolutely. Other companies I would put on that list, who we interacted with, are Macy’s, Dillard’s and Kroger. Home Depot conceived and added private label products to their stores. They leveraged the internet with what they called a connected retail approach. Macy’s had a concept they called their “MOM strategy” which was an acronym — “My Macy’s” was the first M, and “Omni-channel” was the second. My Macy’s was localizing assortment by store. You think about the factors of production in a store. It’s the assortment you offer, in what quantities and at what price, and what staffing levels you have in the store. All of those things you can measure, as my colleagues and I do in our research. You’ll see variation over time in staffing levels, or in price, for example. You can correlate revenue with those changes, to measure the impact on revenue of changing your price or staffing levels in a store. Once you know how revenue varies with staffing levels or price, the level of those factors can be optimized. McDonald’s did menu additions. Kroger used a lot of analytics in their stores. I’ll give you an example. They have traffic counters, so they know when people are entering the stores. They also have POS (point of sales) data so they know when people are leaving the store. They know typically how long it takes for someone to shop in the store. This may sound low tech, but it had a big impact. They started forecasting when people would show up at the cash register and then staffing to that forecast. They cut the wait time to check out from – if I remember right – something like three minutes to 10 seconds. That drove 1% or 2% of comparable-store sales. When you look at all these things, any one thing is a little bit of blocking and tackling. It does not look that dramatic. But 1% or 2% plus sales [growth from each] if you’re doing 20 or 30 things like that becomes big news. That’s how the total stock market return of the 17 retailers that followed this approach over the period 2011-2015 was 21.9%, significantly above the S&P 500. For the other group of 20 retailers that continued to rely mostly on opening new stores, their total stock market return was 2.8%. So that is a difference of a factor of almost 8 between the successful retailers and the less successful. Pause, Take Stock, Change Tack Knowledge@Wharton: One of the stories we often hear in the media is that retailers are doing badly. Repeatedly we read articles about retail chains going bankrupt. The overall narrative seems to be that brick-and-mortar retailers are doomed because of the internet. To what extent do you buy into that narrative? Or is it too simplistic? Fisher: It’s too simplistic. Our story, I guess, would be a little more nuanced. First of all, we think that assuming a consistent situation for the entire retail industry is obviously silly. You’ve got new startup retailers, and lots of them are still in the high-growth phase. You’ve got some retailers [for whom] probably the reason to exist has gone away and they will go out of business. But we learned that a segment of retailing – bricks-and-mortar retailers that have gone through a lifecycle of high growth and are now in maturity – is struggling because the majority of them are following the wrong strategy. By the way, this applies not just to retailers but to any company or countries that need to adjust their strategy at different points in their lifecycle. China was a high-growth country after its economy opened up in 1979. They had huge growth through basically labor cost arbitrage. Well, wage rates have [since then] gone up in China by double digits, which is good and that’s what the Chinese government wanted, but eventually you can’t play that game anymore. So their growth has slowed and they’ve got to play a different game. So retailers, companies and countries all need to adjust their strategy over time as they start with high growth and inevitably see that growth not decline, but slow. Ken Hicks from Foot Locker commented, “I can leverage as little as 2% revenue growth.” So he can live with 2% [growth]. Same with Macy’s. But not zero or negative. Knowledge@Wharton: If we had with us right now the CEOs of some companies that are up against this slowing growth phenomenon, what advice would you give them about how they should deal with it? “Retailers, companies and countries all need to adjust their strategy over time as they start with high growth and inevitably see that growth not decline, but slow.” Fisher: Well, recognize that it’s a change. I’ve talked about retailing where opening stores is the growth instrument or the most commonly used one. Their change would be to shift to making investments in technology or process changes within their stores to drive comparable-store sales growth. Other companies, such as non-retailers, would have to think through what might be a logical shift in strategy. China, for example, is shifting out of low-end manufacturing. They don’t want to be the T-shirt maker of the world anymore, and are now focusing on innovation, branding, and selling within the internal economy. Some Chinese companies are emerging that are a different breed from the factory owners that made footwear and apparel in the 1980s, 1990s and even the last decade. So that’s another example of the largest country by population going through the same transformation. Knowledge@Wharton: What surprised you most about this study? Fisher: That’s an interesting question. [There were many surprises.] That you can be phenomenally successful. That the successful group put up a 20% stock market return over a five-year period. [They were] phenomenally successful. That they all followed a pretty consistent strategy. That when I would talk to people about how do you grow your earnings when your top-line growth [falls], the common answer would be, “Well, it’s cost cutting, right?” [But for the successful companies,] it wasn’t cost cutting. It was asset leverage. It was a different strategy than what we had thought of. So those were all surprises. The biggest [surprise], though, is just how many companies have this addiction to growth. It took us a long time to come to that title. But it slowly dawned on us how hard it was to make the transition, even at successful companies that went through periods of denial, such as Home Depot and McDonald’s. Knowledge@Wharton: Did any question come up during the study that you would like to address through future research? If so, what would that be? Fisher: I think maybe it would be interesting to see the degree to which this applies to internet retailers, because even though they don’t open stores, they do acquire customers. Just as there’s finite space for stores, there’s a finite [number of] customers in the world. It would be interesting to think about how the lifecycle idea applies to companies other than retailers or to countries.

According to a Monday news release issued by the Athens-Clarke County Police Department, police detained a 21-year-old man on Saturday, April 15 after he stabbed three people before taking a naked stroll through Walmart, all while under the influence of LSD. Adam Scott Presley, was arrested inside a Walmart on Lexington Road in Athens just after midnight, according to police, shortly after he stabbed three people near the 400 block of Meadow Lane, about a mile away. Officers initially responded to the stabbing scene where they found two male victims; one had a stab wound to the face and the other a stab wound to his back. A third victim, a female, was found to have a puncture wound on her lower right abdomen. An indecent exposure call brought police to the Walmart where they encountered the nude Presley. Police began giving Presley, who appeared to be under the influence and had blood on him, verbal commands to stop walking. When he did not, officers used their Tasers on the the suspect, however, the suspect continued to walk, forcing police to use physical measures on Presley. EMS was called to the scene to assess Presley and it was found that he had shattered a car window before entering the Walmart. According to police, Presley eventually told EMS that he was under the influence of LSD and admitted that he stabbed several people.  He then added: "there is nothing wrong with that," according to a news release. One of the victims stabbed sustained serious injuries and was admitted to ICU. Presley was arrested for aggravated assault and is being held at the Athens-Clarke County Jail.  About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

Spark Change.” Campaign Calls on the Public to Join the Fight Against Hunger and Make a Difference in their Local Communities Walmart’s “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” Campaign Calls on the Public to Join the Fight Against Hunger and Make a Difference in their Local Communities Posted on April 17, 2017 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Today, Walmart launches its “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign, a nationwide initiative that encourages the public to join the fight against hunger. Working with Discover card and five suppliers, which represent some of the nation’s leading food companies – Campbell Soup Company, General Mills, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company and PepsiCo – Walmart is offering three easy ways to take action against hunger and help a local Feeding America food bank through social, online and in-store participation. Purchase: For every participating product purchased at U.S. Walmart stores from April 17 – May 15, 2017, the supplier will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) on behalf of a Feeding America member food bank, up to applicable limits. For every Discover card transaction made at U.S. Walmart stores and Walmart.com during the campaign period, Discover will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) to Feeding America and its network of member food banks, up to $1 million. See Walmart.com/fighthunger for further details. Online Acts of Support:  Generate meals for Feeding America food banks by engaging with the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign on social media: Facebook – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or react positively to campaign content; click on Walmart provided campaign content. Instagram – Create or share content using the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; like or share Walmart generated campaign content. Snapchat – Use Walmart provided “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” filters nationwide on Friday, April 21. Twitter – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or make a campaign tweet a favorite; retweet a message featuring the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; click on Walmart-provided campaign content. For each online act of support, Walmart will donate the equivalent of 10 meals ($0.90) to Feeding America on behalf of member food banks, up to $1.5 million. Donate at the Register: Donate to your local Feeding America food bank at the register during checkout. The ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign launches at a critical time when the USDA reports one in eight Americans currently struggle with hunger. To raise awareness for the issue of hunger in America and help generate meals for people struggling with hunger, Walmart and its suppliers are encouraging the public to take action online and in-store to support the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. “This campaign is an important part of our ongoing commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “Together with suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” Walmart is kicking off the campaign with a $1.5 million donation and aims to donate a total of $3 million to Feeding America based on the public’s online participation in the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign. Combining Walmart’s donation with supplier donations through product purchases and customer donations at the register, the campaign has a goal of helping Feeding America secure 100 million meals on behalf of its member food banks. “At Feeding America, we see firsthand the impact hunger has on families in communities across the country, and we understand it takes a village to help strengthen our communities and provide meals to people in need,” said Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America, the nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization. “Great partnerships are essential to moving the needle, and we are grateful to Walmart, its dedicated suppliers and Discover for coming together for the ‘Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’ campaign. Movements like this give each and every one of us an opportunity to get involved and make a difference in the fight against hunger.” With the USDA reporting that 42 million people in America, including more than 13 million children, struggle with hunger, the ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign is part of Walmart’s larger commitment to provide meals to those in need, helping ensure every family has access to affordable, nutritious and sustainably-grown food. As the nation’s largest grocer, Walmart is in a unique leadership position to positively impact the issue of hunger in the United States. In October 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving the affordability of food by lowering the “true cost” of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. This commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those struggling with hunger in the U.S. by 2020. To learn more about the campaign, visit www.walmart.com/fighthunger.

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products “Made in USA.” The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. “There’s just no way to source parts in America right now,” said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company’s assembly plant. “But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow.” Monster Moto’s experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers “remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,” said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s <WMT.N> vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto’s bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. “Consumers won’t give you a free pass just because you put ‘Made in USA’ on the box,” Keechle says. “You have to remain price competitive.” Keeping a sharp eye on labour costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing’s bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the “theft of American prosperity.” But it’s more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. “It’s almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine,” said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc <UPS>, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. “It’s not something that happens overnight,” he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focussed on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognise that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.” MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto’s cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: “Assembled in the USA.” Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers – who make $13 to $15 an hour – to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. “We can’t just blow up our cost structure,” said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. “The only way to make it work in America is with robotics.” The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s <DLPH.N>. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labour differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation.

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the “skills gap” there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company’s lease because he wants to diversify the city’s economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto’s assembly plant. “Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,” he says. “But you have to start somewhere.” (Editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Walmart’s “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” Campaign Calls on the Public to Join the Fight Against Hunger and Make a Difference in their Local Communities Through online acts of support, purchase of participating products and donations at the register, the campaign aims to help Feeding America secure 100 million meals on behalf of member food banks SOURCE: Walmart DESCRIPTION: BENTONVILLE, Ark., April 17, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Today, Walmart launches its “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign, a nationwide initiative that encourages the public to join the fight against hunger. Working with Discover card and five suppliers, which represent some of the nation’s leading food companies – Campbell Soup Company, General Mills, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company and PepsiCo – Walmart is offering three easy ways to take action against hunger and help a local Feeding America food bank through social, online and in-store participation. Purchase: For every participating product purchased at U.S. Walmart stores from April 17 – May 15, 2017, the supplier will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) on behalf of a Feeding America member food bank, up to applicable limits. For every Discover card transaction made at U.S. Walmart stores and Walmart.com during the campaign period, Discover will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) to Feeding America and its network of member food banks, up to $1 million. See Walmart.com/fighthunger for further details.   Online Acts of Support:  Generate meals for Feeding America food banks by engaging with the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign on social media: Facebook – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or react positively to campaign content; click on Walmart provided campaign content. Instagram – Create or share content using the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; like or share Walmart generated campaign content. Snapchat – Use Walmart provided “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” filters nationwide on Friday, April 21. Twitter – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or make a campaign tweet a favorite; retweet a message featuring the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; click on Walmart-provided campaign content. For each online act of support, Walmart will donate the equivalent of 10 meals ($0.90) to Feeding America on behalf of member food banks, up to $1.5 million. Donate at the Register: Donate to your local Feeding America food bank at the register during checkout. The ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign launches at a critical time when the USDA reports one in eight Americans currently struggle with hunger. To raise awareness for the issue of hunger in America and help generate meals for people struggling with hunger, Walmart and its suppliers are encouraging the public to take action online and in-store to support the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. “This campaign is an important part of our ongoing commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “Together with suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” Walmart is kicking off the campaign with a $1.5 million donation and aims to donate a total of $3 million to Feeding America based on the public’s online participation in the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign. Combining Walmart’s donation with supplier donations through product purchases and customer donations at the register, the campaign has a goal of helping Feeding America secure 100 million meals on behalf of its member food banks. “At Feeding America, we see firsthand the impact hunger has on families in communities across the country, and we understand it takes a village to help strengthen our communities and provide meals to people in need,” said Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America, the nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization. “Great partnerships are essential to moving the needle, and we are grateful to Walmart, its dedicated suppliers and Discover for coming together for the ‘Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’ campaign. Movements like this give each and every one of us an opportunity to get involved and make a difference in the fight against hunger.” With the USDA reporting that 42 million people in America, including more than 13 million children, struggle with hunger, the ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign is part of Walmart’s larger commitment to provide meals to those in need, helping ensure every family has access to affordable, nutritious and sustainably-grown food. As the nation’s largest grocer, Walmart is in a unique leadership position to positively impact the issue of hunger in the United States. In October 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving the affordability of food by lowering the “true cost” of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. This commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those struggling with hunger in the U.S. by 2020. To learn more about the campaign, visit www.walmart.com/fighthunger.

The brawl was reported at around 7.30pm at the retail location at 13401 Main Street in Hesperia and was caught on video recorded by at least two bystanders. According to a Walmart employee, it all started with an argument between two women, which turned physical when their husbands tried to come to their wives' defense. Scroll down for video  A bloody fight broke out at a California Walmart on Saturday after two women got into an argument and their husbands, among them a man in a red shirt seen right, came to their defense The man in red was said to have intervened in the argument that erupted in the women's section of the store in Hesperia  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next White supremacist leader was caught on camera punching a... Hair-raising moment a brawl breaks out on a Detroit street... Share this article Share Cell phone footage recorded in the women's section of the Walmart shows a chaotic scene, with several people shouting at one another and gesticulating wildly, although it is difficult to make out from the footage what they are saying because of background noise. At one point, a woman falls to the ground and one man strikes another man dressed in a red T-shirt and dark-colored baseball cap. A few seconds later, a third man in a grey shirt, who police say was not part of the initial altercation, walks up to the man in red and punches him repeatedly in the face, knocking the victim unconscious.  Another man in a grey shirt, who police say was not part of the initial altercation, walks up to the man in red and punches him in the face, knocking the victim unconscious Out cold: The man in the red shirt was found lying unconscious in pool of his own blood The alleged assailant is pictured being led away from the scene by a woman who was seen shouting during the initial argument  A woman dressed in a striped tank top and shirt is then seen dragging the alleged assailant in grey from the scene. Brawler charged: Dahsean Antwan Wages, 24, seen in the video dressed in a gray shirt punching the man in the red shirt, was charged with battery with serious injuries The man in the red shirt was found lying unconscious in pool of his own blood and was later taken to Desert Valley Medical Center with significant injuries to his upper body. He was not named. An 11-year-old girl also somehow got caught in the fracas and had the wind knocked out of her, according to her grandparent, reported Victor Valley News. A hazmat team was later called in to mop up the blood and vomit from the women’s section.  San Bernardino Sheriff's deputies who were summoned to the store reviewed surveillance video and were able to track down the man in the grey T-shirt who was believed to have thrown the devastating punch, reported ABC7. The suspect, identified as 24-year-old Dahsean Antwan Wages, was charged with battery with serious injuries and booked into the High Desert Detention Center on $100,000 bail pending his arraignment, which is scheduled for Tuesday, reported Victor Valley News. Bloody aftermath: A photo taken inside the Walmart after the melee shows crime scene tape and what appears to be blood on the floor in the women's section  Graphic: A hazmat team had to come in to mop up the blood and vomit after the fight A strand of black hair is seen on the floor of the women's section at the Hesperia Walmart after the violent altercation  On Monday, Wages' mother confirmed in a Facebook post that her son was involved in the Walmart fight and asked friends and family to keep him in their prayers.

The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago."There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow."Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law.When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods.Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price.Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China."Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity."But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.”MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA."Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. "We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics."The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.”When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there.”That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD"We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change."Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant."Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere."

Deputies responded about 7:30 p.m. Saturday to the Wal-Mart located at 13401 Main St. after receiving a report that several subjects were fighting inside, a Hesperia Police Department news release stated. When they arrived, deputies determined an argument between two females had escalated into two men fighting one another, according to the release. As the fight was taking place, the victim was struck multiple times in the face and knocked unconscious, the Police Department said. The victim, who suffered “significant injuries” to his upper body, was transported to a hospital in unknown condition. Deputies reviewed store surveillance video during the course of the investigation and determined that the person who knocked the man unconscious had approached the victim and punched him several times; he was not involved in the initial fight, according to the release. The man, identified by police as 24-year-old Dashean Wages, of Adelanto, was still in the Wal-Mart when deputies made contact with him. He was subsequently taken into custody, the release stated.

A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.” In Monster Moto’s cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: “Assembled in the USA.” Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Walmart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. “We can’t just blow up our cost structure,” said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. “The only way to make it work in America is with robotics.” The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation.  “We’re going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,” said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. “You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that’s not going to change.” Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the “skills gap” there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company’s lease because he wants to diversify the city’s economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto’s assembly plant. “Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,” he says. “But you have to start somewhere.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

College Professor Says Walmart Called Him A Toilet Cleaner On Fishing License Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share College Professor Says Walmart Called Him A Toilet Cleaner On Fishing License Image courtesy of Google April 17, 2017 11:36 am EDT By Chris Morran@themorrancave bad employees montana rude receipts that's not my job walmart A college professor in Montana is accusing Walmart of libel, after he says the store deliberately listed his profession as “CLEAN TOILETS” on a state-issued fishing license. In a lawsuit [PDF] filed last week in a Gallatin County, MT, court, an assistant professor at Montana State University says he went to a Walmart in Bozeman to acquire a fishing license. State law requires applicants for fishing licenses to provide photo and ID and to describe their occupation. This information is then input by the Walmart employee into the state’s database. Even though the professor, originally from Zambia, told the Walmart employee that he worked at MSU and showed him his university ID card with the employment status of “Faculty/Professional,” the “CLEAN TOILETS” occupation description was entered into the system. Could it have been a slip of the hand or the click of a wrong button? Not according to the complaint, which says that the information in the occupation field must be manually entered. Additionally, the lawsuit notes that entering false information into the state’s Fish Wildlife & Parks database is a violation of the agreement that authorized retailers must make with the state in order to issue licenses. Rather than a mistake, the lawsuit contends that the Walmart employee made a deliberate attempt to expose Plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy.” Unfortunately, the alleged insult wasn’t noticed until 2016, after the professor returned to the Walmart to have his license renewed. He once again told a store employee about his job at MSU and provided his identification, yet the occupation field remained unchanged. The “CLEAN TOILETS” information was subsequently noticed by the professor’s teaching assistant, who pointed it out in the presence of students. The professor returned to the Walmart store and requested a corrected license and a written apology from Walmart. While the information on the license was fixed, the plaintiff says that no apology ever materialized. According to ACLU of Montana, which is representing the professor in this lawsuit, a complaint was filed with Montana’s Human Rights Bureau but the retailer has not yet made an effort to address the incident. “It’s unfortunate that we have had to sue to protect Prof. Kalonde’s rights, but the failure of Walmart to address these issues is on them,” said Jim Taylor, Legal Director for the ACLU of Montana. “We are still waiting to discuss the matter if they come to the negotiating table.” In a statement to KBZK-TV, a rep for Walmart said, “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing. We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” April 17, 2017 By Chris Morran@themorrancave bad employees montana rude receipts that's not my job walmart Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related c'mon man Bank CEO Rips Walmart For Allowing ID Thieves To Spend $12K Without Anyone Noticing hello it's me Delaware Wants To Become The First State To Offer Digital Driver’s Licenses No More Driving For You Can’t Pay Your Student Loans?

Gilbert Kalonde, assistant professor of technology education at MSU, filed the suit this past week in Gallatin County District Court. Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages from Walmart which is one of the world’s largest retailer, known for selling household essentials at a low price. Walmart spokesman Ragan Dickens told The Associated Press: “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing. “We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Walmart employee identification of his employment at MSU. But the Walmart employee entered “clean toilets” into the state database as Kalonde’s occupation. The suit contends Walmart exposed Kalonde to “hatred, contempt, ridicule” through the incident. .

Photo credit: Getty Images Good morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift, your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to read because cars are the greatest oh yes they are the greatest. Advertisement 1st Gear: It’s Not That Simple “Oh, just bring the factory back from China,” people say. “People will buy things if they’re made in America!” they add. But it’s not so easy. Even when things are assembled in the United States, the parts themselves often are not, as Reuters explained in a big feature that used motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto as an example: Advertisement When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers “remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,” said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods.﻿ And even worse, a lot of the reason why companies moved manufacturing overseas isn’t in pursuit of some nefarious plan to impoverish the American worker. They did it because we, the American people, demanded it through the constant hunger of lower prices. Lower prices can often only be achieved by cutting costs, and a large part of lowering corporate costs is lowering the price of labor. Or eating into a chunk of their profits. And corporations refuse to give up on their profits. Sponsored So when companies bring manufacturing back, they raise prices. Which means fewer people buy their products, “Made in USA” label be damned. The vicious cycle continues. 2nd Gear: Vehicle To Vehicle Communication Stuck In Limbo Advertisement Vehicle to Vehicle, or V2V communication, is vital to the autonomous car revolution. If you’re having trouble understanding why that is, think about when someone in another car waves you on from an intersection or something. That sort of thing is vital. A lack of communication contributed to the first at-fault crash of a Google car. One of the main obstacles to V2V implementation is the lack of a universal standard, so that a Toyota could talk to a Chevrolet, for example, instead of being locked into talking to only other Toyotas. That standard was coming around thanks to a proposed rule from the Obama administration, but now who the hell knows, partially because of the complete inaction of the supposedly “pro-business” Trump administration, and partly because of opposition from groups opposed to the proposed technology to be used as the standard, or those just opposed to any sort of government mandate whatsoever, Bloomberg reports: The Obama administration proposed the rule in December, saying it could eliminate 80 percent of vehicle crashes involving unimpaired drivers. If the rule is finalized, all new light-duty vehicles would be required within four years to be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems. The technology will work hand-in-hand with new automated safety devices, such as automatic braking, in another step toward making driverless vehicles a reality, the Department of Transportation said at the time. More than 400 people and organizations filed formal opinions with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by last week’s deadline, reflecting a wide range of viewpoints.﻿ The end result is that fully autonomous cars will probably be delayed for a few years. We’ll figure it out someday, maybe. Advertisement 3rd Gear: There’s A Good Chance Your Next Rental Car Will Be A Nissan Rental cars are usually the bane of human existence. Unpleasant, disgusting, and poorly maintained, any car that gets a reputation as a rental car generally also gets a reputation as a bad car. That’s been an influence on a lot of manufacturers moving away from rental fleet sales, but not Nissan. Automotive News says Nissan is going all-in on rentals: “It’s part of the business,” Munoz told Automotive News during a wide-ranging discussion at last week’s New York auto show. “The dollars we get are relevant, so we’re going to continue to be there, even if other companies don’t want to.” Munoz made the defiant declaration partly in response to criticism from competitors about Nissan North America’s overall market share growth. Detractors have commented — usually in hushed tones — that Nissan’s climb to a 10 percent U.S. market share has relied on increased sales to rental fleets rather than organic demand from retail customers.﻿ “Money is money” actually isn’t a bad position for a for-profit corporation. Advertisement Advertisement 4th Gear: Chinese Brands Are Trying To Succeed In Their Own Market The Chinese car market is huge, owing to China’s huge population, but the upper echelons of it are dominated by foreign competition. Even in China, Chinese cars aren’t exactly regarded as the standard bears of quality, technology, and luxury. And Chinese companies are looking to change that, according to Reuters: Zhang said SAIC’s MG and Roewe - brands based on technology acquired from bankrupt British car maker MG Rover - plan a total of five car models and nine sport utility vehicles, and would aim to offer quality comparable to global brands such as Nissan, but at a lower price. A concept shown to reporters for an MG sports coupe it will exhibit at this week’s Shanghai auto show could pass for a Jaguar. “I worry for them,” Zhang said of the global brands. “You see local technology getting stronger and stronger.”﻿ I find the idea of an MG, based on old and sad British tech, passing for a Jaguar to be entirely preposterous. Impossible. No way. Advertisement Not yet, anyways. 5th Gear: United Airlines Reports Earnings Tonight But the real show should be the airline’s call with analysts tomorrow. Should be interesting. Advertisement Advertisement Reverse: Hey, It’s The Mustang The Ford Mustang, a two-seat, mid-engine sports car, is officially unveiled by Henry Ford II at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York, on April 17, 1964. That same day, the new car also debuted in Ford showrooms across America and almost 22,000 Mustangs were immediately snapped up by buyers. Named for a World War II fighter plane, the Mustang was the first of a type of vehicle that came to be known as a “pony car.” Ford sold more than 400,000 Mustangs within its first year of production, far exceeding sales expectations.﻿ Neutral: Where’s Your Car From? If you have a relatively new car and you take a look at your Monroney, it should say both the location of the final assembly for your car, as well as its “foreign parts content.” What’s yours?

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products "Made in USA." The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. "There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow." Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Kerry Goldsmith and Brian Jackson construct mini-bikes at motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto in Ruston, Louisiana January 25, 2017. Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. "Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.” Alex Keechle, CEO of Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto, poses on the factory floor in Ruston, Louisiana January 25, 2017. MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA." Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. "We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics." Workers construct mini-bikes at motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto in Ruston, Louisiana January 25, 2017. Picture taken January 25, 2017. The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD "We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change." Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant. "Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere."

Castle Kameron Gately was taken into custody on April 10 on two counts of restraining a child, one count of drug possession and one count of property theft under $30,000. According to investigators, Gately had two boys, ages five and six, with her when she was initially arrested on suspicion of shoplifting at the Walmart located at 6185 Retail Road in Dallas. An investigation has revealed that Gately, who was said to be homeless, had approached the children as they were playing outside their apartment complex and offered to buy them treats and beverages if they went with her, reported Dallas News. According to Gately's arrest affidavit, the two boys agreed to follow the stranger to the Walmart, located a mile away from their homes, because she promised to get them 'whatever they wanted.' Crime scene: Gately was busted with the two children at this Walmart located at 6185 Retail Road in Dallas after a witness allegedly saw her luring the boys from their apartment complex  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Man named Huff is arrested on drug charges after K-9 dog... Drug dealer turned FBI informant known as 'White Boy Rick',... Share this article Share A witness later corroborated the children’s story to police, saying that he allegedly saw Gately luring the pair with a chocolate bar and followed the woman and two children to the Walmart. When police were summoned to the store, they caught the 23-year-old suspect allegedly stealing merchandise with the two kids. Walmart loss-prevention officers interviewed the 5-year-old and 6-year-old, who indicated that Gately was not a relative of theirs and they did not even know her. When responding police officers searched Gately, they reportedly discovered a small plastic bag containing crystal meth stashed inside her bra. The woman was then booked into the Dallas County Jail on $150,000 bond while the two boys were returned safely to their mothers, who had both called police to report them missing.

News late last week that Wal-Mart was in talks to buy specialty online retailer Bonobos is an example of the pace in which the Bentonville-based retailer is moving to expand its e-commerce footprint. Bonobos sells men’s fashion through Nordstrom in addition to its own website. Recode reports the two parties have already settled on a price, which they believe will surpass the $70 million paid for ShoeBuy. Bonobos has reported annual revenue around $125 million. Aside from the possibility of acquiring Bonobos and revamping the division’s leadership, Lore has spent just under $200 million in the past three months acquiring three smaller retail specialty businesses in ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy. Lore said recently that the game is won or lost in “long tail” for a merchant. He explained that it’s easy to get parity of assortment on more commoditized goods like toys and electronics, but it’s much harder for long tail items such as home, shoes and fashion. He said it’s a faster strategy for Walmart eCommerce by buying category expertise – which brings relationships with the suppliers and unique product content. During an interview with Recode’s Jason Del Rey at the recent ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas, Lore reiterated that the CEOs of the recently acquired companies (ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) and the existing home retailer Hayneedle will manage not only their own businesses, but will also oversee that category business on Walmart.com and Jet.com. For example, ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella is going to be responsible for shoes sold not just on ShoeBuy, but also the entire retail shoe business on Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore explained. Lore said Walmart.com is behind and the retailer needs to catch up. He said the recent acquisitions have provided a nice surge in the respective categories and the company will continue to look for more acquisitions because it’s a good way to build out that “long tail of assortment.” He said by acquiring the category depth needed Walmart.com can skip steps and avoid a lot of the heavy lifting which saves time and energy. He also said Walmart U.S. e-commerce is looking for opportunities to acquire brands like ModCloth, which are more vertically integrated with exclusive products not found anywhere else. He said the product exclusivity is one of the most interesting aspects of ModCloth along with the retailer’s efforts to empower women. When asked about a five-year vision, Lore said Walmart U.S. e-commerce plans to be a disruptor and turn the corner in terms of overall market share and customer experience. He said Walmart.com is on a mission with its suite of specialty retailers to have anything a consumer wants to buy, make sure it’s easily found, priced right with adequate online content and delivered fast. Lore said the retailer is applying this concept throughout the product universe, and over time it will make a big difference. “Quite frankly to date we haven’t done a great job,” Lore added. “We are focused on a lot of shiny things and business inputs now and not that concerned with the outputs of price. We think it’s important to first get the inputs right. That’s why we are hiring more merchants (and) merchandisers for online and having them focus on very narrow categories and perfecting it. The goal is to get every category perfected,” he said. While Wal-Mart Stores has increased its stake in JD.com in China, Lore said the company’s first order of business and priority is to win in the U.S. because it’s a bigger opportunity. “My mandate was to crush the U.S.,” Lore said. When asked if “win” means No. 2, Lore said emphatically that “win means win. It’s not going to happen in 12 months, but win means win.” Comments comments Previous post Armor Bank officially opens in Forrest City Next post J.B.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Sustainability is No Longer Optional for Suppliers SOURCE: Toronto Sustainability Speaker Series DESCRIPTION: With several governments internationally developing and implementing Climate Change, Circular Economy and Zero Waste Policies, global firms are already taking a proactive approach to supply chain risk management, while others are taking a riskier “wait and see approach”. On the retail side, leading companies have identified supply chains as a critical risk in this area and are developing more stringent sustainable procurement policies and criteria. On the producer side, organizations will need to ensure more sustainable supply chains, design, and packaging in order to maintain competitiveness.  These new, circular business models are driving the purchase of sustainable materials, products, and services. At the same time, environmental requirements are increasingly being included in supplier contracts. Walmart – Leading Retailers in Circular Supply Chain Management For companies like Walmart where a large proportion of carbon footprint comes from suppliers, sustainability targets not only encompass their own operations but also their vast global supply chain.  In December 2016, the mega-retailer joined several other major retailers and producers in becoming a member of Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy 100. As such, the organization has committed to a more circular business approach to supply chain management. Walmart is now planning an even tighter sustainable supply chain management system that will screen and engage suppliers. This will encourage a more circular and sustainable design of products and packaging, mitigate regulatory and reputational risks, and capitalize on cost-saving opportunities.  This will also mean an even closer focus on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), improved packaging efficiency, reducing waste streams, water conservation, and ethical sourcing in order to reduce overall environmental and social impacts. The latest circular economy initiative builds on Walmart’s Supplier GHG Innovation Program that achieved a reduction of 20 million metric tons of CO2 from its products’ lifecycles and supply chains between 2010 and 2015. With an eye on further reducing ‘Scope 3’ emissions through its supply chain, Walmart has set a target to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030.  In addition, other retailers like Loblaw’s and Costco have implemented sustainable sourcing strategies that seek to ensure that their supply chains are economically, environmentally and socially sustainable. For producers to maintain market access to Walmart and other retailers, it will be essential to develop new circular business models that encourage resource, GHG and cost efficiencies across life cycles – from design and sourcing to manufacturing, to distribution, to use, to recovery, to reuse and/or disposal. Leading Producers Taking Action At Unilever, who is also part of the Circular Economy 100, the sustainable supply chain program extends across 200,000 different materials and over 160,000 suppliers who work with up to a million smallholder farmers.  The consumer goods giant claims to be on track to reduce its carbon footprint by 40% by 2020.  Above all, the organization has demonstrated that sustainability can drive revenue generation. By reducing their overall environmental impact by one-third, the company grew from €40 billion to almost €50 billion in revenues with an increase in operating profit of approximately 5%. Unilever has also recently committed to ensuring that all of its plastic packaging is 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 and has called on the entire consumer goods industry to join them in adopting circular economy best practices. Other producers such as Coca-Cola and Dell have adopted a circular economy model and supply chain management best practices that can capitalize on cost reductions, reduce risks, increase brand reputation and revenue growth across operations and supply chains. Sustainable Procurement Policies and Standards The more stringent procurement policies of Walmart and other retailers is expected to create a domino effect across the consumer goods industry. This trend is accompanied by other drivers like new regulations as well as consumer and investor pressures.  As such, producers will need to begin placing further focus on supply chain management in order to monitor sustainability risks and opportunities. In a recent study by BSR/GlobeScan’s State of Sustainable Business Survey, 84 percent of respondents said they had a supplier code of conduct, and 61 percent said they considered sustainability in sourcing strategies. In addition, ISO 20400, the first international standard for Sustainable Procurement, is currently being finalized and due for release later this year. The latest ISO effort will build on current standards like the British Standard 8903 and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS). It will provide best practice guidelines for organizations to integrate sustainability in their procurement processes. Amidst existing and forthcoming regulations, new international standards and stakeholder pressures, producers will need to consider more circular business models and delve deeper into their supply chains and product life cycles in order to meet increasingly rigid standards for transparency and disclosure related to sustainability, and access to markets.

Walmart Looks To Improve Its Wardrobe With Possible Purchase Of Men’s Retailer Bonobos Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Looks To Improve Its Wardrobe With Possible Purchase Of Men’s Retailer Bonobos April 17, 2017 10:02 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler another purchase bonobos filling the virtual closet jet.com online retail retail shopping walmart You know that part of every “ugly duckling” movie where the protagonist goes through a head-to-toe makeover in a matter of minutes? That describes the last four months for Walmart, which has revamped its wardrobe with the purchases of ShoeBuy, ModCloth, and even MooseJaw. And it’s apparently not done with apparel, with a possible purchase of online men’s retailer Bonobos in the offing. Recode, citing sources with knowledge of the matter, reports that Walmart and Bonobos are in the final stages of making a deal to place Bonobos under the Jet.com umbrella. New York City-based Bonobos was founded in 2007 as an online men’s dress pant outfitter that has since expanded to include dress shirts, suits, and outerwear. The company isn’t only online, however, it currently operates 30 Guideshop locations where men can get fitted for apparel and then place orders that are delivered to their homes, Recode reports, adding that Bonobos clothing is also sold at some Nordstrom locations. We’ve reached out to Walmart and Bonobos for comment on the possible deal, and will update this post when we hear back. While Bonobos doesn’t seem to have much in common with Walmart — it’s clothing retails for $90 to more than $500, according to Recode — it does fit the bill for the retailer and its subsidiary Jet.com’s recent online retail shopping spree. Walmart e-commerce chief Marc Lore has made it known that he’s concentrating on expanding Jet’s online offerings by way of acquiring other brands. When Jet.com revealed its $70 million purchase of ShoeBuy in January, Lore told Recode that it was a “fair assumption” that the company and Walmart would pursue more acquisitions of online retailers, likely in “categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands.” And that’s just what the company has done. Following the purchase of ShoeBuy, Jet.com paid $51 million for online outdoor retailer Moosejaw in February, followed by ModCloth in March.

Walmart Opens 100th Training Academy in the U.S. Academies provide better training for associates, create better shopping experience for customers A Walmart associate receives high fives as she enters an academy graduation. (Photo: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 17, 2017 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time EDMOND, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart is celebrating the grand opening of its 100th training academy in the U.S. at 1225 West I-35 Frontage, Edmond, Oklahoma, today. Walmart training academies were introduced in 2016 and have expanded to 40 states. A replay of the graduation and grand opening is available on the Walmart Today Facebook page. “Everything we do begins with our associates,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “That’s why we have invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today’s retail environment. Walmart is a place where anyone can fulfill their potential.” Walmart training academies are dedicated facilities where associates receive instruction on retail fundamentals and area specific skills. Since the program launched, the curriculum has expanded training to cover more than 65 positions, including customer service manager, online grocery pickup, and assistant store manager. Associates are trained through a combination of classroom and sales floor exercises, utilizing technology including tablet computers and cloud storage for training materials. “These investments are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster check-out times,” added McMillon. Associates who go through training academy programs are able to earn while they learn new skills. Through skills training associates gain an increase in confidence and knowledge -- which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth and stability. Walmart Academies are providing additional marketable skills that help associates with the job they are in and prepare them for the next level job. “The Walmart Academy has given me the opportunity to help associates build and grow their careers with the company, but also helped me grow as a leader and an individual,” said Alesha Odenbret, Edmond Walmart Academy facilitator. “I have had an incredible experience with the company, and I wanted to be able to share that with other associates.” Walmart plans to have a total of 200 academies opened across all 50 states by the end of summer. Since 2016, more than 52,000 associates have graduated, with more than 225,000 associates on track to complete training in 2017. About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

My City Journal article notes that a majority of New Yorkers — including those in union households — want Walmart stores in the city, and that support for Walmart is especially strong among blacks and Hispanics. The economist Richard Vedder and I defended the proposition, “Long live Walmart,” Walmart in a recent Intelligence Squared U.S. debate in New York. We expected to have a tough time convincing the liberal audience, but they ended up voting in favor of Walmart. Of course, the economic arguments for Walmart don’t carry the same weight at City Hall as union campaign contributions.

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products “Made in USA.” The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. “There’s just no way to source parts in America right now,” said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company’s assembly plant. “But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow.” Monster Moto’s experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers “remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,” said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto’s bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. “Consumers won’t give you a free pass just because you put ‘Made in USA’ on the box,” Keechle says. “You have to remain price competitive.” Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing’s bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the “theft of American prosperity.” But it’s more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. “It’s almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine,” said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. “It’s not something that happens overnight,” he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.” MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto’s cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: “Assembled in the USA.” Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. “We can’t just blow up our cost structure,” said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. “The only way to make it work in America is with robotics.” The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90% of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5% of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14% to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD “We’re going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,” said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. “You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that’s not going to change.” Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the “skills gap” there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company’s lease because he wants to diversify the city’s economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto’s assembly plant. “Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,” he says. “But you have to start somewhere.” tags Donald Trump Made in America manufacturing protectionism Made in USA more from business TCS shareholders approve Rs 16,000 crore share buyback Apr 17, 2017 17:49 IST Modi pitches for ‘Make in India’ to become world number one in jewellery sector Apr 17, 2017 16:47 IST Worth a Thousand Words- Make Your Smartphone Photography Smarter Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Walmart’s “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” Campaign Calls on the Public to Join the Fight Against Hunger and Make a Difference in their Local Communities Through online acts of support, purchase of participating products and donations at the register, the campaign aims to help Feeding America secure 100 million meals on behalf of member food banks BENTONVILLE, ARK., April 17, 2017 – Today, Walmart launches its “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign, a nationwide initiative that encourages the public to join the fight against hunger. Working with Discover card and five suppliers, which represent some of the nation’s leading food companies – Campbell Soup Company, General Mills, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company and PepsiCo – Walmart is offering three easy ways to take action against hunger and help a local Feeding America food bank through social, online and in-store participation. 1. Purchase: For every participating product purchased at U.S. Walmart stores from April 17 – May 15, 2017, the supplier will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) on behalf of a Feeding America member food bank, up to applicable limits. For every Discover card transaction made at U.S. Walmart stores and Walmart.com during the campaign period, Discover will donate the equivalent of one meal ($0.09) to Feeding America and its network of member food banks, up to $1 million. See Walmart.com/fighthunger for further details. 2. Online Acts of Support: Generate meals for Feeding America food banks by engaging with the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign on social media: Facebook – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or react positively to campaign content; click on Walmart provided campaign content. Instagram – Create or share content using the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; like or share Walmart generated campaign content. Snapchat – Use Walmart provided “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” filters nationwide on Friday, April 21. Twitter – Create original content that uses #FightHunger; like, share and/or make a campaign tweet a favorite; retweet a message featuring the campaign hashtag #FightHunger; click on Walmart-provided campaign content. For each online act of support, Walmart will donate the equivalent of 10 meals ($0.90) to Feeding America on behalf of member food banks, up to $1.5 million. 3. Donate at the Register: Donate to your local Feeding America food bank at the register during checkout. The ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign launches at a critical time when the USDA reports one in eight Americans currently struggle with hunger. To raise awareness for the issue of hunger in America and help generate meals for people struggling with hunger, Walmart and its suppliers are encouraging the public to take action online and in-store to support the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. “This campaign is an important part of our ongoing commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “Together with suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” Walmart is kicking off the campaign with a $1.5 million donation and aims to donate a total of $3 million to Feeding America based on the public’s online participation in the “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign. Combining Walmart’s donation with supplier donations through product purchases and customer donations at the register, the campaign has a goal of helping Feeding America secure 100 million meals on behalf of its member food banks. “At Feeding America, we see firsthand the impact hunger has on families in communities across the country, and we understand it takes a village to help strengthen our communities and provide meals to people in need,” said Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America, the nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization. “Great partnerships are essential to moving the needle, and we are grateful to Walmart, its dedicated suppliers and Discover for coming together for the ‘Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’ campaign. Movements like this give each and every one of us an opportunity to get involved and make a difference in the fight against hunger.” With the USDA reporting that 42 million people in America, including more than 13 million children, struggle with hunger, the ‘’Fight Hunger. Spark Change.’’ campaign is part of Walmart’s larger commitment to provide meals to those in need, helping ensure every family has access to affordable, nutritious and sustainably-grown food. As the nation’s largest grocer, Walmart is in a unique leadership position to positively impact the issue of hunger in the United States. In October 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving the affordability of food by lowering the “true cost” of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. This commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those struggling with hunger in the U.S. by 2020.

Walmart will now offer discounts for picking up online orders in its stores, starting on April 19. Pickup Discount will initially be available on about 10,000, online-only items that customers buy online and ship to any Walmart store for pick up. The retailer plans to roll out the discount to more than one million of the most popular items by the end of June. "We’re creating price transparency to empower customers to shop smarter and choose what’s best for them," said Marc Lore, President and CEO, Walmart U.S. in a blog post.  Lore explained it can remove the last mile delivery costs when the company leverages its fleet of trucks to deliver products directly from fulfillment centers to its 4,700 stores. "This means, quite simply, it costs less for us to ship to stores. So, our customers should share in those savings," he wrote. "Last-mile delivery makes up 28% of the costs of delivery alone," explained Sarah Engel, CMO, DynamicAction. "Walmart knows this all too well and is turning to BOPIS to reduce this costly expense with their new Pickup Discount program. Not only are they reducing the hit to their profits by minimizing their delivery costs, but Walmart is further setting themselves apart from Amazon by connecting their purchase data across all channels and utilizing their physical stores to their advantage as local distribution centers ­– something Amazon is not in a position to do. Furthermore, they are driving the online shopper into the physical store, where they are well positioned to drive incremental sales." Customers shop an item notated with "Pickup Discount" on Walmart.com and ship to their local store for pick up. These shoppers will then receive a discount based on each individual item. In one example, a Britax B-SAFE 35 Infant Car Seat offers a Pickup Discount of $7.40, while an even larger item like a TV (the VIZIO SmartCast M-Series 70" Class 4K Ultra HDTV) offers a Pickup Discount of $50. According to the retailer, 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, which means pickup may not be a hardship for most. The company has also been aggressively expanding its Online Grocery Pickup service, which is in 600 stores currently with an additional 500 locations planned for this year.  The service allows shoppers to order groceries online, select a pickup time and have those groceries delivered to their car. “By offering a discount for customers to pickup select items in store, Walmart is definitely on to something," said Nick McLean, CEO, OrderDynamics. "While buy online, ship to store is on the rise, it is still not the norm and this is great way to convert hesitant shoppers. However, it will only work to Walmart’s advantage if they use the discount sparingly. The discount should be an incentive to get shoppers in the door and drive additional sales. By over discounting or offering the promotion on too many items, Walmart may end up losing profit margins on both online and in-store purchases.” Walmart noted it has added additional staffing at Pickup desks, including department managers in many stores. It has also developed new training programs and introduced mobile workforce technology.  Some Walmarts are offering a Pickup Tower. "Much like a high-tech vending machine for your online orders, this feature in a few of our stores allows you to pick up items in less than a minute by scanning a bar code sent to your smartphone," explained Mark Ibbotson, EVP of Central Operations – Walmart U.S. The pilot phase has been so successful Walmart plans to expanding it to other locations across the country. The company is also testing "other pickup options and locations." "Retailers know that an omnichannel consumer is more valuable than a single-channel consumer," said Ed Kennedy, director of commerce at Episerver. "Omnichannel consumers spend more online and spend more when they go into physical stores to buy after shopping online. Walmart is the first to pass this value along to the customer explicitly. But it comes as no surprise as Jet.com's CEO Marc Lore takes over the helm of all Walmart’s e-commerce operations. It’s similar to an incentive that Jet.com pioneered previously, where consumers receive discounts on their total when they add qualifying items to their cart. Walmart is simply extending that value relationship across channels now."      SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Digital Tranformation Walmart's Tech Innovation Hub Will Invest in Startups Omnichannel Walmart Expands Capabilities as Online Shopping and Traffic Grows E-Commerce Platform Jos.

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products "Made in USA." The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. "There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow." Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed "border tax" on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil - in Monster Moto's case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials - they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. "Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything's going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. "We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left," a White House official said, "and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that." MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA." Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. "We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics." The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC's. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company's hourly workforce is in "best-cost countries." When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules "it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there." That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD "We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change." Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant. "Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere."

Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing.

Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump´s proposed "border tax" on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil - in Monster Moto´s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials - they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc´s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans´ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can´t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. "Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It´s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything´s going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration´s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. "We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left," a White House official said, "and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that." MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA." Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. "We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics." The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC´s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company´s hourly workforce is in "best-cost countries." When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules "it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given... the labor differential there." That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD "We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change." Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant. "Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere."

Nordstrom is an investor in Bonobos.  The website said that the price of the deal could not be learned, but a retail business would likely fetch one to two times revenue. Bonobos has US$100mil (RM440.43mil) to US$150mil (RM660.64mil) in revenue and was valued at US$300mil (RM1.32bil) in 2014, the article said.  The world's biggest retailer has been working aggressively to close the gap with rival Amazon.com Inc under the leadership of chief executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore.  The deal, if announced, would become the fourth e-commerce acquisition by the retailer in less than a year.  Wal-Mart declined to comment while, Bonobos did not respond to the requests for comment.  Lore has overseen the acquisition of three other online retailers, shuffled management and made two-day shipping free on all online orders over US$35 (RM155), without any membership fees to compete with Amazon's popular Prime shipping programme. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Online ads target Britain’s homeless youths with offer of shelter for sex: charity US scientists track fish migration using DNA in water samples Vehicle-sharing services offer range of driving experiences How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Tuchel hoping Dortmund stay focussed on football Kudos for promoting Islamic cruising Going with the flow – the fun and fundamentals of water advertisement Latest News Phone app nabs Coachella festival cellphone thief Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum National search launched for alleged US ‘Facebook killer’ Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings SWIFT warns on vendor security after documents leaked by hackers Most Viewed in Tech SWIFT warns on vendor security after documents leaked by hackers Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings National search launched for alleged US ‘Facebook killer’ Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media New York City taxi commission plans to force Uber to add driver tipping feature Online ads target Britain’s homeless youths with offer of shelter for sex: charity Will autonomous driving kill the sports car?

Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages from Walmart which is one of the world’s largest retailer, known for selling household essentials at a low price. Walmart spokesman Ragan Dickens told The Associated Press: “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing. “We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Walmart employee identification of his employment at MSU. But the Walmart employee entered “clean toilets” into the state database as Kalonde’s occupation. The suit contends Walmart exposed Kalonde to “hatred, contempt, ridicule” through the incident.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo By Los Angeles Times Apr 12, 2017 at 3:44 pm | Print View Dissenters were quick to react when ModCloth, an online seller of trendy women’s clothes and accessories, was acquired by retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last month. “You have disappointed us all,” one reader commented under a blog post by ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger announcing the sale — the notion being that ModCloth would lose its cache as part of a discount mass merchant. “I’m done shopping with you,” wrote another. But Gregg Koger noted that Wal-Mart would give ModCloth “the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow.” ModCloth is one example of how Wal-Mart belatedly but aggressively is expanding its e-commerce business to keep pace with the seismic shift in consumer shopping from bricks-and-mortar stores to the internet. With nearly half-a-trillion dollars in annual sales and 4,700 U.S. stores, Wal-Mart has been buying online retailers, slashing shipping rates and rolling out new ways for in-store customers to do more of their shopping at Walmart.com and its other websites. While traditional U.S. in-store retailing is growing less than two percent a year — forcing many retailers to close stores — e-commerce is growing 16 percent annually, researcher EMarketer Inc. reports. E-commerce sales this year will hit $462 billion and soar to $789 billion by 2021, the company estimates. Wal-Mart’s effort to tap that online growth often is portrayed as a direct attack on Amazon.com Inc., the online-retailing behemoth. Wal-Mart prefers to frame its strategy as capturing more of the e-commerce market by blending its in-store, online and mobile-app offerings so that customers easily can move from one to the other to make purchases. If it snatches business from Amazon in the process, all the better. One of Wal-Mart’s key acquisitions was Jet.com Inc., which also sells a variety of consumer products and groceries. Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com last year and then named Jet.com Chairman Marc Lore to head its entire U.S. e-commerce operation. “It was a radical signal to everyone that the biggest retailer in the world was willing to put $3.3 billion into the (online) market,” said Adrien Nussenbaum, CEO of Mirakl, a developer of software products for retailers and other businesses. Under Lore and Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart has taken several other steps to bolster its e-commerce sales, including: • Acquiring Shoebuy.com, an online footwear retailer, and Moosejaw.com, an online seller of outdoor apparel and gear. Those retailers and ModCloth continue operating as separate websites. • Launching free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more at Walmart.com, Jet.com and many of its other sites. • Boosting the stock on its virtual shelves. At the start of 2016, Walmart.com had eight million items for sale. Today it has more than 35 million items. • Launching a program that allows in-store customers to go online or check their phone app to see a list of items they have bought, then reorder those items online. • Rolling out a groceries program whereby customers order items online and then have the groceries loaded into their vehicle at a Wal-Mart store. • Forming a division called Store No. 8 that’s intended to hatch new online retail approaches and businesses. Wal-Mart said in October that it was going to slow the pace of new store openings this year, in good part to shift investments to its e-commerce business. “We’re being pretty active,” Lore said during a recent tech gathering, called Code Commerce, in Las Vegas. “We’re behind. We need to catch up. There are some big things we have in the works,” said Lore, who spent two years with Amazon after it bought his previous online venture, the parent of Diapers.com and other sites. Wal-Mart is the second-largest online mass merchandiser behind Amazon, but it’s a distant second. Amazon’s product sales totaled $94.7 billion last year while Wal-Mart’s tallied $14.4 billion, according to EMarketer. Amazon, with $136 billion in total sales last year, has other assets and services as well, namely a variety of video, entertainment and other services available through its Prime membership. Prime also provides free shipping on Amazon purchases, and analysts estimate about 65 million Amazon customers subscribe to Prime for $99 a year. (Amazon doesn’t disclose the number except to say it has “tens of millions” of subscribers.) Stephen Beck, founder of the management consulting firm Cg42, said Prime gives Amazon customers more incentive to shop at the site. Prime customers spend an average $270 a year above what they were spending at Amazon before subscribing, he said. The Bentonville, Ark., company, which also owns the Sam’s Club chain, posted total sales of $482 billion in its fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Like what you're reading?

Police say 21 year-old Adam Scott was under the influence of LSD when he stabbed two men and a woman at a home on the 400 block of Meadow Lane in Athens. One man had a stab wound to his face while the other was stabbed in his back. The woman sustained a stab wound to her stomach. The victims are all recovering at this hour. A short time later, officers received an indecent exposure call from workers at a Walmart location on Lexington Road. When they arrived on scene, the suspect was completely naked and covered in blood. After giving the man commands to comply, the suspect refused and officers deployed a stun gun on him and placed him under arrest. It is unclear what charges the man is facing.

If Wal-Mart succeeds, the move into fashion also would advance its effort to access younger, millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com. A Bonobos deal would mark the company's fourth acquisition of a small online clothing-and-accessories brand since the start of 2017. The bid was first reported by Recode on Friday. Wal-Mart has declined to comment. The move is in keeping with an online strategy led by Marc Lore, the founder and former chief executive of internet retailer Jet.com, who took over Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in August, after Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet. Wal-Mart is the world's largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology. But despite its traditional muscle, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has been unable to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website. Wal-Mart's online sales account for only about 3 percent of total sales, the company has said. In the second half of this year, it is targeting online sales growth of 20 to 30 percent. In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women's clothing. In March, Lore said at an industry event that Wal-Mart will make more acquisitions to expand its business rapidly. Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the deals could begin to add up, though so far they are too small to have a material impact on Wal-Mart. "It gives them a totally separate vehicle to grow with fashion brands and to own fashion brands," he said. Wal-Mart's move also aims to stem the loss of market share to Amazon in the highly competitive fashion sector. Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester. Macy's Inc, Nordstrom Inc, Gap Inc, Kohl's Corp, L Brands Inc and J.C. Penney Co Inc also compete in the segment. Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates Inc, said Wal-Mart's prior efforts to buy market share through acquisitions have not succeeded. "They have been involved with this strategy for a long time. How has it done? Terribly," Davidowitz said. "Marc Lore has continued this strategy." Lore did not respond to a request for comment. Wal-Mart has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, Wal-Mart acquired more than 15 start-ups. The company has not disclosed what it spent on each deal, but said in January it had spent a total of $3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in its prior four fiscal years.

Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China. But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products "Made in USA." The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. "There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow." Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil -- in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials -- they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. "Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive." Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. "It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. "It's not something that happens overnight," he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers.

Low interest rates and fiscal expansion have helped fuel a boom in construction in Japan’s capital. (Bloomberg file photo) Robots may help fill the construction labor gap By: Bloomberg News April 17, 2017 2:24 pm 0 The future of U.S. homebuilding depends on more people like Cyndicy Yarborough, a 26-year-old former Wal-Mart clerk with no background in construction. At Blueprint Robotics in Baltimore, she works in a factory that builds houses like cars, on an assembly line, using robots that fire thousands of nails into studs each day and never miss. Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they’ll be pieced together. “I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,” said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May. For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies like Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labor shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International Inc., the world’s biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties. Giant Legos To meet growing demand, high-tech plants are opening, and older factories that were shuttered after the last decade’s real estate crash — many in areas such as rural Pennsylvania, where labor costs are cheap — are being revived. Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens. “This has to be the wave of the future — I don’t know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,” said John Burns, an Irvine, California-based homebuilding consultant. “What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.” U.S. homebuilders say the labor crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it’s pushing costs up as much as 5.2 percent on average over 12 months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Donald Trump’s proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, one heavily dependent on immigrant labor. The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com. Mansions, dorms Today’s plants are capable of producing bigger buildings with more elaborate designs. The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the U.S. to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions. “Some builders won’t even advertise they work with modular companies like us,” said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft Corp.’s Pennsylvania construction facility. “You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.” Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs. Marriott’s plans The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, California, with 97 rooms — all built at a Guerdon Enterprises LLC plant in Boise, Idaho. Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pennsylvania. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, next month. “What we like is how well modular is built,” Khalifa said. “These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.” Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tennessee, said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes’ commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50 percent since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said. Cheaper labor Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion’s modular division. Workers make about $15 to $20 an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with $50 to $100 an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York’s Hudson Valley, and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said. Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can’t be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet. Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said. “The house is 60 percent complete when it arrives, and that means 60 percent of the headaches of building are gone,” Megna said. Industry stigma For less-expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There’s also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry’s oldest relative. “Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like ‘this is nice for a trailer,’” said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. “Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.” There doesn’t seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is “booming at moment,” with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50 percent from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom. “Coming out of the recession, the labor pool is just lacking,” Cooper said. “Kids are not going to construction trade school any more — they’re all playing on their computers.” Blueprint’s robots That isn’t necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, CEO of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He’s even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company’s German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley. “Robots cut the hole,” he said. “But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.” Instead of displacing workers — a usual side effect of automation — Blueprint’s machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn’t otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling center with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee — no hard hat needed — uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do. Yarborough said she’s not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free, six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults. “I’m more interested in the engineering side,” she said, adding that she’d like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. “I want to end up upstairs.” Share this: Print Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google 2:24 pm Mon, April 17, 2017 Finance & Commerce Bloomberg News Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The bid was first reported by Recode on Friday. Wal-Mart has declined to comment.The move is in keeping with an online strategy led by Marc Lore, the founder and former chief executive of internet retailer Jet.com, who took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business in August, after Wal-Mart paid US$3.3 billion for Jet.Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales exceeding US$23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail Technology.But despite its traditional muscle, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has been unable to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.Wal-Mart’s online sales account for only about 3 percent of total sales, the company has said. In the second half of this year, it is targeting online sales growth of 20 to 30 percent.In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing. In March, Lore said at an industry event that Wal-Mart will make more acquisitions to expand its business rapidly. Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the deals could begin to add up, though so far they are too small to have a material impact on Wal-Mart. “It gives them a totally separate vehicle to grow with fashion brands and to own fashion brands,” he said. Wal-Mart’s move also aims to stem the loss of market share to Amazon in the highly competitive fashion sector. Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of US$13 billion in 2016, up US$9 billion from five years ago.It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over… Post navigation Five die as light aircraft crashes in Portugal Sean Spicer’s Beautifully Complicated Relationship With The White House Easter Bunny Search for: Recent Posts You won’t believe who Salman Khan invited to give chorus for his film Tubelight’s teaser!

The Multi-Purpose Center offers a day program for Lee County residents age 60 and up. Free transportation is available to and from the center, though some participants provide their own travel or are brought by family. By CALEB BEDILLION DAILY JOURNAL TUPELO – It was just a trip to Walmart, but she phoned her father after it was over. “This is great. I’m getting paid to help people go and shop,” Dana White said during the call. “That’s a good job perk.” That shopping trip? She was there with about 11 or so senior citizens, helping them select and stock up on things they need, helping them finish up on time to get back onto the bus that brought them there. It was a small thing, but it was part of a much bigger thing: White, 39, is two weeks into her new job as director of the Lee County Multi-Purpose Center for the Elderly. She’s quick to describe this work as truly tapping into her heart’s passion. “I see the elderly as the forgotten population,” said White last week, seated in a room that’s now her office. “They’re not looking to get anything from you. They are just looking for you to love them, to remember that they matter.” White replaces Shelton Shannon as the Multi-Purpose Center’s director. He retired in December after almost nine years on the job. The Multi-Purpose Center offers a day program for Lee County residents age 60 and up. Free transportation is available to and from the center, though some participants provide their own travel or are brought by family. The staff there serve meals to elderly residents that come, but home delivery service for meals is also on offer. The center, normally open five days a week, is located on Cliff Gookin Boulevard in Tupelo, with satellite centers in Saltillo, Verona and Pratts. Lee County and the Three Rivers Planning and Development District fund the multi-purpose center. White comes to her new position from an eight-year stint with Region 4 Mental Health Service, where she was a mental health therapist. Much of her work was in nursing homes with some time in schools as well. Nursing home work confirmed a commitment to serve the elderly. And after only two weeks on the job, she can’t imagine going anywhere else. “This is a family,” she said. “I get as much as I give.” White was born in Guntown, where she still resides, and received a bachelor’s degree at Blue Mountain College.

Posted 18 Apr 2017 02:00 Updated 18 Apr 2017 02:20 FILE PHOTO: Women's clothing are displayed in a Walmart store in Secaucus, New Jersey, November 11, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wal-Mart Stores Inc's bid for clothing retailer Bonobos, which surfaced last week, is the latest step in the company's attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon.com Inc and others in the rapidly growing online fashion world, analysts and retail consultants said. If Wal-Mart succeeds, the move into fashion also would advance its effort to access younger, millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com. A Bonobos deal would mark the company's fourth acquisition of a small online clothing-and-accessories brand since the start of 2017. The bid was first reported by Recode on Friday. Wal-Mart has declined to comment. The move is in keeping with an online strategy led by Marc Lore, the founder and former chief executive of internet retailer Jet.com, who took over Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in August, after Wal-Mart paid US$3.3 billion for Jet. Wal-Mart is the world's largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales exceeding US$23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology. But despite its traditional muscle, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has been unable to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website. Wal-Mart's online sales account for only about 3 percent of total sales, the company has said. In the second half of this year, it is targeting online sales growth of 20 to 30 percent. In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women's clothing. In March, Lore said at an industry event that Wal-Mart will make more acquisitions to expand its business rapidly. Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the deals could begin to add up, though so far they are too small to have a material impact on Wal-Mart. "It gives them a totally separate vehicle to grow with fashion brands and to own fashion brands," he said. Wal-Mart's move also aims to stem the loss of market share to Amazon in the highly competitive fashion sector. Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of US$13 billion in 2016, up US$9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester. Macy's Inc, Nordstrom Inc, Gap Inc, Kohl's Corp, L Brands Inc and J.C. Penney Co Inc also compete in the segment. Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates Inc, said Wal-Mart's prior efforts to buy market share through acquisitions have not succeeded. "They have been involved with this strategy for a long time. How has it done? Terribly," Davidowitz said. "Marc Lore has continued this strategy." Lore did not respond to a request for comment. Wal-Mart has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, Wal-Mart acquired more than 15 start-ups. The company has not disclosed what it spent on each deal, but said in January it had spent a total of US$3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in its prior four fiscal years.

If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE.

Now they want fast. As shoppers turn to the convenience of cyberstores, they crave shipping that can keep up with their demands. "For consumers, it's one of the top things they're looking for, and it's a decision maker between buying at one site versus another," says Aaron Cheris, a partner in the San Francisco office of Bain and Co., a management consulting firm. Free shipping is expected, says Luke Knowles, founder of Free Shipping Day, a one-day, annual online-shopping event in December. On Dec. 16, 2016, more than 1,000 retailers offered free shipping and delivery by Christmas Eve. Retailers have answered the call for free and swift delivery in different ways. Under Amazon's subscription model, members pay a fee to get free shipping. Wal-Mart and Best Buy provide free and fast shipping if you meet their conditions. Should you still pay for a subscription? It depends. Before you decide, consider how often you order and what you'll get beyond shipping. Here's what you should think about. LOW MINIMUMS If your orders meet minimum-purchase thresholds, you can get speedy and free delivery without a subscription from some retailers. Wal-Mart announced free two-day shipping on eligible orders of $35 and above on more than 2 million items in categories from food to electronics while eliminating its membership program in early 2017. Best Buy offers free two-day shipping on thousands of items for orders of $35 and up. Apple boasts free two-day shipping on most in-stock products. "The first battle was (over) free," says Cheris, of Bain and Co. Now, consumers have their eyes set on two-day delivery. "One of the problems with the old, 'I'll get it to you in three to five days' is, well, which is it? Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? The nice thing about two is it's not only faster, but it's more specific." FEATURES Even if free two-day shipping becomes standard, don't dismiss subscriptions. Consumers should consider other features, Cheris says. For instance, a membership at shopping service ShopRunner unlocks free two-day shipping on eligible items at hundreds of participating retailers. After a 30-day free trial, the fee is $79 a year or $8.95 a month. Amazon Prime is perhaps the best known of all programs. After a 30-day free trial, members pay $99 a year or $10.99 a month to get free two-day shipping on more than 50 million items, plus free same-day and two-hour delivery on household goods, groceries and other items in select cities. Shoppers also get extras such as video and music streaming. "The reason people join is for the free, fast shipping, but the reason they stay is because a lot of them get attached to other stuff, whether it's Prime Now or Prime Pantry or Prime Instant Video," Cheris says. See if you can share your membership and split the price. At Amazon, two adults can form an Amazon Household to share select benefits of Prime, like free shipping and photo storage. A membership to online marketplace Google Express can be shared with one person in your household at no additional cost. After a three-month free trial, the program costs $95 a year or $10 a month for free same-day delivery on eligible orders. PRICE When shopping without a membership, ensure that a retailer with free shipping isn't charging more for its products than what you would save on shipping. For example, a pair of Nike running shoes recently sold for $48.75 at J.C. Penney with $8.95 shipping, for a total of $57.70 before tax. The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It's a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands. If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. "It depends on how frequently you shop the category," McLean says. "I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you're buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that's a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories." MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. "Shoppers are winning here," says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder.

Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they’ll be pieced together. “I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,” said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May. For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies like Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labor shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International Inc., the world’s biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties.

Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens. “This has to be the wave of the future -- I don’t know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,” said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based homebuilding consultant. “What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.” Popular Now Shaping the Future of CAD It's All in the Numbers – KPI Best Practices Problems in Purchasing U.S. homebuilders say the labor crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it’s pushing costs up as much as 5.2% on average, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Donald Trump’s proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, one heavily dependent on immigrant labor. The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com.

The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the U.S. to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions. “Some builders won’t even advertise they work with modular companies like us,” said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft Corp.’s Pennsylvania construction facility. “You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.” Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs. Marriott’s Plans The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, Calif., with 97 rooms -- all built at a Guerdon Enterprises LLC plant in Boise, Idaho. Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pa. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, N.C., next month. “What we like is how well modular is built,” Khalifa said. “These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.” Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tennessee, said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes’ commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50% since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said. Cheaper Labor Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion’s modular division. Workers make about $15 to $20 an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with $50 to $100 an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York’s Hudson Valley, and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said. Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can’t be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet (18 meters by 5 meters). Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said. “The house is 60% complete when it arrives, and that means 60% of the headaches of building are gone,” Megna said. Industry Stigma For less-expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There’s also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry’s oldest relative. “Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like ‘This is nice for a trailer,’” said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. “Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.” There doesn’t seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is “booming at moment,” with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50% from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom. “Coming out of the recession, the labor pool is just lacking,” Cooper said. “Kids are not going to construction trade school any more -- they’re all playing on their computers.” Blueprint’s Robots That isn’t necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, chief executive officer of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He’s even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company’s German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley. “Robots cut the hole,” he said. “But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.” Instead of displacing workers -- a usual side effect of automation -- Blueprint’s machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn’t otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling center with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee -- no hard hat needed -- uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do. Yarborough said she’s not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free, six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults. “I’m more interested in the engineering side,” she said, adding that she’d like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. “I want to end up upstairs.” By Prashant Gopal and Heather Perlberg Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

During the Riverhead Town Zoning Board of Appeals public hearing Thursday night, neighbors also voiced their concerns that the new development will cause more traffic and litter. The property owner, Riverhead PGC, which is a subsidiary of Phillips International in Manhattan, has proposed building a 10-screen, 1,490-seat multiplex where the former Walmart store was located. Two restaurants, including a drive-thru eatery, are also proposed. The applicants are seeking a variance from the ZBA to construct a 60-foot building since the property’s height limit under the zoning is 35 feet. “This will definitely take up the whole back of our house when I look out the window,” said James Hinchy, who lives on Oliver Street in a house located next door to the proposed multiplex. “The height of the building now is too much as it is. To increase it by nearly 50 percent is unfair to us.” Mr. Hinchy also said he’s concerned about increased traffic on Oliver Street and described the 8-foot fence currently on the property as insufficient since it fails to keep garbage from blowing onto his property. Mr. Hinchy added he’s tried to contact the property owner about the litter and never received a response. “I didn’t say I don’t want a movie theater,” Mr. Hinchy said. “I don’t want to see the building.” Harold Saperstein of Kings Drive described the current fence as a “disaster” since people throw bottles, cans and plastics bags over it. Dale Young, who’s lived on Oliver Street since 1964, said she’s had difficulty with litter and noise coming from the trash compactors and loading docks at the Northville Turnpike shopping center that includes Kmart and BJ’s Wholesale Club. “Now I’ll be getting it from both sides,” she said. Charles Cuddy, the applicant’s attorney, said the front of the building will be 60 feet high and the east and rear of the building will be 55 feet high. “The height increase may be considered substantial, but Riverhead now allows 60-feet buildings in the DC-1 district downtown [zoning],” Mr. Cuddy said. “In addition, many buildings that have been built in recent years are 50 feet high and close to 60 feet, so it’s not that unusual. To make the movie visual experience worthwhile, it’s necessary to have the additional height.” William Kugelman of Phillips International said his company is in negotiations with Regal Cinemas to run the theater. “We’ve assembled a team to bring this property to life and make it economically viable,” he told the crowd Thursday. “We are committed to work with the community and to work with the town.” The proposal calls for demolishing a portion of the former Walmart building and the stores to the east of it, Mr. Cuddy said. The multiplex will be smaller and set back further from neighbors than the existing building, he said, adding the current building is 71,000 square feet and the proposed multiplex will be 57,000 square feet. ZBA member Frank Seabrook asked the applicant the height of the stadium seating theaters in Holtsville, Ronkonkoma and Stony Brook; VHB Engineering, which prepared the site plan for the applicant, agreed to have that information by the board’s next meeting. Mr. Seabrook also asked the applicant to come up with a plan to decrease the visual impact of the project on neighbors. Tom Najdzion of Ostrander Avenue said traffic is his major concern since drivers use the parking lot as a cut-through between Oliver Street and Ostrander Avenue. He suggested requiring traffic to go through the Route 58 entrance instead of side streets. The two restaurants proposed call for a 7,500-square-foot eatery with 220 seats and a 2,600-square-foot restaurant with 125 seats and a drive-thru window. The legal notice for the ZBA hearing stated the drive-thru window requires a variance since it isn’t permitted under the zoning. However, Mr. Cuddy said he plans to address the issue by filing a special permit with the Town Board. A variance for shared parking, which was also in the hearing notice, will be addressed through the site plan process before the Planning Board, Mr. Cuddy added. The applicant is also seeking a variance to have only one loading dock instead of the three required by the zoning code. Not everyone expressed opposition to the proposal Thursday. Joseph Gilroy, who lives on Ostander Avenue, said he’s spoken to the property owner and is confident the company will work with neighbors. “I’m all for it,” he said of the multiplex. “I think it’s a great thing for the Town of Riverhead.” Mike Goodsell of Kings Drive said while he’s a fan of movies and is very excited about the proposed multiplex, he doesn’t believe the building should be 60 feet high. ZBA member Leroy Barnes told the crowd, “Let’s face the reality. We need a movie theater in this town and we’re going to have one.” The hearing was adjourned to the April 27 meeting. ZBA vice chairman Otto Wittmeier said the board plans to review the application and follow up with residents. “I feel a lot of the complaints are with the owner of the existing property, which has nothing to do [with Regal],” he said.

Cohn, 56, did not work on Republican Trump's campaign and only got to know him after the November election, but he has emerged as one of the administration's most powerful players in an ascent that rankles conservatives. Trump refers to his director of the National Economic Council (NEC), as "one of my geniuses," according to one source close to Cohn. More than half a dozen sources on Wall Street and in the White House said Cohn has gained the upper hand over Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart News and a champion of protectionist trade opposed by moderate Republicans and many big companies. Cohn is a key administration link to business executives and White House sources say he will lead the charge for Trump on top domestic priorities such as tax reform, infrastructure and deregulation. "Gary's singular focus is tax reform and he's working to try and get that done in 2017," said Orin Snyder, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn and a long-time friend of Cohn. "He is working to implement the president's twin goals of economic growth and job creation. The tax plan will also include a reduction in the corporate rate, but also tax relief for middle- and low-income Americans." Some conservatives fear Cohn may push through a tax plan that is unnecessarily complicated and argue that including tax relief for middle- and low-income Americans would not spur economic growth as much as cuts focused entirely or mostly on businesses and entrepreneurs. Adam Brandon, president of the conservative group FreedomWorks, is disappointed Trump is not charging ahead with a plan unveiled last year during his campaign that would slash taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals. That plan was shaped heavily by Stephen Moore, an economic policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, who advised Trump's campaign. But it has since been shelved. "I don't like the idea of scrapping it and starting over again," Brandon said. A senior administration official said the White House has started from scratch on the tax plan and, while setting business tax cuts as the highest priority, is consulting with lawmakers, economists and business leaders before taking it to the Republican-led Congress. Two administration officials said reports that the White House was considering a carbon tax and a value-added tax were incorrect, but that other ideas were on the table. "We are considering a multitude of options for tax reform," a White House official said on Sunday. Rapport Associates of both Trump and Cohn say the two have developed a bond. People who have worked with Cohn say he is loyal, direct and assertive, traits that Trump likes. Crucially, Cohn also has the trust of Jared Kushner, Trump's adviser and son-in-law, and his wife Ivanka, Trump's daughter. Cohn hired his staff more quickly than other top officials, building a reputation for competence in an administration hurt by early missteps over healthcare reform and a travel ban, the sources said. "Gary is a huge asset to the Trump administration. He'll be of great help in eliminating unnecessary regulation, stimulating growth and reforming the tax code," said billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, an early backer of Trump who knows Cohn through Wall Street circles. The son of middle-class parents in Cleveland, Ohio, Cohn overcame dyslexia and worked in sales before elbowing his way into a position as a Wall Street trader and rising to become president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs. Kushner was a Goldman Sachs intern when he first crossed paths with Cohn. After Trump's election victory, Kushner paved the way for Cohn to meet the president-elect, who had spent much of the campaign blasting investment banks as modern-day robber barons. Trump soon named Cohn his NEC director. Apparently paying more heed to Cohn and other moderates on his team, Trump last week said he was open to reappointing Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman when her term is up and he also held back from naming China a currency manipulator. Both stances marked a reversal from his campaign when Trump criticized Yellen and vowed to label China a currency manipulator on "day one" of his administration, a move that could lead to punitive duties on Chinese goods. Sources close to Cohn and inside the White House said there are sharp policy differences between Cohn and both Bannon and Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff. A White House spokesperson denied there was a power struggle inside the West Wing. Cohn has already put his stamp on regulatory policy by working with Kushner to successfully push Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission after billionaire investor Carl Icahn, an early Trump supporter, had vetted other candidates. Clayton's nomination has been advanced to the Senate for a vote. The vacant Federal Reserve vice chairman's seat is a key regulatory role Cohn and his colleagues on the economic team want to fill soon. Cohn has interviewed nearly two dozen candidates and has whittled the list down. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration is one of several candidates left, a source familiar with the process said. Cohn will also take a leading role in developing Trump's infrastructure plan to rebuild airports, roads, and bridges. The biggest challenge may be figuring out how to pay for the initiative, which Trump has estimated at $1 trillion. While conservatives are concerned by Cohn, they note that Bannon is still part of Trump's mercurial administration and that Cohn could fall out of favor as quickly as he has risen. "Whoever is up today," Brandon said, "could be gone tomorrow."

Are high PE stocks duds? Do they generally fall out of favour quickly and should investors avoid them just because of stratospheric multiples. Conventional wisdom would suggest yes. But a closer look at the history of high PE stocks shows investors have nothing to fear just because a stock is trading at high multiples. Shares of good companies have always traded expensive but still managed to make money for their investors in the long run. Several investors are comparing D-Mart with Wal-Mart, given D-Mart's similar business model and management DNA. But what many forget is that Wal-mart shares were very expensive in the early 1980s. In 1983, for instance, it traded at a PE of 45 times high for a retail stock. But what is important from the investor perspective is that it gave 20% compounded returns for the two decades. Titan, India's largest listed jewellery company, started off with extremely high multiples in the first decade of the 21st century. Average multiples in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 57, 51 and 53 times respectively. In 2007, the stock traded at 80 times. But look at the returns and you will be stunned. Since 2007, the stock has returned 700% or 23.2% annually . Another example is Nestle India.In 2010, Nestle's shares traded at an average PE of 45. In the next five years, the stock more than doubled giving an annual return of 17%. Avenue Supermarts stellar rally its high valuations has made many believe that the stock has reached its peak and may not generate good returns for investors from this level. But if one has to disregard the near-term volatility and take a longer-term bet, the stock can make good money for its investors despite appearing expensive. PE multiples sometimes can sometimes be misleading. Eicher Motors, despite trading at more than 50 PE in 2013, has generated 33% annual returns in the last four years, outperforming other two wheeler companies, such as Hero Honda and Bajaj Auto. Both the marquee firms traded at below 20 times that year. Maruti Suzuki is another example. In 2015, its average PE multiple was 33 and that of Tata Motors was 9. From that period till now, Maruti has gained 50%, while Tata Motors investors are still in the red. The common thing amongst all these expensively traded companies that generated wealth for investors is high earnings visibility for the next several years. In case of Avenue Supermarts, earnings growth rate for the past years has been 55%. Even if the company delivers a 35% compounded growth for the next three years, it will trade at 35 times FY20 estimated earnings. A multiple of 50-55 would mean that the stock can give a return of 50% from here in the next three years and an optimistic 70 times multiple would mean the stock can double from here. 5 stocks on which tech charts have buy signals of 11 Next Prev Play Slideshow 5 stocks that look favourably poised for buying calls 16 Apr, 2017Text: Milan Vaishnav, CMT The domestic equity market is heading for a rather uneventful week, with global geopolitical tensions hanging over its head.

The Dayton Daily News (http://bit.ly/2ppMDy0 ) reports the cost to the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek includes about $210,000 paid to two law firms. The city's law director says outside counsel was necessary. Crawford family attorney Michael Wright says the money could have gone toward a settlement for the family. An officer fatally shot John Crawford III in 2014 after a 911 call about someone waving a rifle at the Wal-Mart. Police say he didn't obey commands to drop what later turned out to be an air rifle. A federal probe for any possible civil rights violations is continuing. Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The cash infusion comes as House Democrats face pressure to break from their party and support Trump administration initiatives that could benefit the lobbyists’ clients. A filing last week by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) shows four corporate lobbyists raised more than $380,000 for the organization -- the primary campaign arm for Democratic House candidates -- between January and March. The three-month figure is nearly four times as much as the amount lobbyists raised for the DCCC during the entire 2016 election cycle. In all, the DCCC reported raising $31 million in the first quarter of 2017. Since the election, the question of whether Democrats should embrace or spurn business interests has been a point of contention in the lingering feud between the party’s centrist officials, most of whom backed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who challenged the former secretary of state for the Democratic nomination. Last year, the Democratic National Committee ended its ban on lobbyist donations, which was put in place by former President Barack Obama. The decision angered many Sanders voters, who saw it as a move to boost Clinton’s fundraising in the primary race. In the wake of Clinton’s loss to Trump, progressives have pushed the party once again to reject lobbyist cash. Although the DCCC never prohibited lobbyist donations, the committee reported only about $100,000 in funds bundled by lobbyists in all of 2015 and 2016, according to a MapLight review of campaign finance records. Three of the lobbyists who have been collecting checks for the DCCC were major Clinton donors and fundraisers -- accounting for about $1.7 million in donations to the Clinton campaign and its joint fundraising account with the DNC and state parties. Some of their clients could have interests in legislative measures before the House of Representatives. Tony Podesta, who founded the Podesta Group lobbying firm, has raised $131,000 for the DCCC and donated $5,000 to the committee so far this year. His client list includes Walmart, Wells Fargo, as well as defense contractors Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. Trump and House Republicans have promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed after the 2008 financial crisis -- and House Democratic votes could be crucial to any repeal effort. Lobbying disclosures show Podesta’s firm has lobbied for Wells Fargo on “financial services regulation. The Podesta Group also lobbied on Dodd-Frank for the BMO Financial Corporation and the Investment Company Institute, a trade association representing the mutual fund industry. Trump is expected to seek Democratic House votes for measures to lower the corporate tax rate. Federal records show that in 2016, Podesta lobbied for Credit Suisse Securities, Oracle and Wal-Mart on the issue of “corporate tax reform.” Democrats have called for an investigation into the Trump administration’s links to Russia’s government. Podesta was hired to lobby for Sberbank, a Russian state-owned bank, during the 2016 election. He has also registered to lobby for at least six foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Podesta bundled $450,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2016. His brother, John, was a former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton and chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Steve Elmendorf, who has raised $55,000 for the DCCC, leads the lobbying and public relations firm Subject Matter. His firm has lobbied on Dodd-Frank implementation for clients that include Goldman Sachs, MetLife and at least three financial industry trade associations. One of Elmendorf’s clients, CIT Group, recently gave Steven Mnuchin an $11 million payout upon his being appointed Treasury Secretary by Trump. Elmendorf also recently lobbied for General Electric and News Corporation on the issue of corporate tax policy. Congress is now considering legislation to strengthen airline passenger rights, after a senior citizen was bloodied, knocked semi-conscious and forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight to make room for a company employee. The efforts could face opposition from the industry trade group Airlines for America, another Elmendorf client. "We helped America's airline industry connect with policymakers," his firm’s website boasts. Another lobbyist, Vincent Roberti, Sr., has raised more than $88,000 for the DCCC year. He, too, has lobbied for Airlines for America. In recent months, Roberti has also lobbied on behalf of Citigroup, Pfizer, Boeing and AT&T. Unlike his colleagues, David Thomas, a partner at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, didn’t collect money for Clinton’s 2016 committees. He’s been an active fundraiser for the DCCC this year, though, raising almost $106,000. Thomas has lobbied for Chevron, Humana, and United Technologies Corporation. In 2011, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported that New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Lujan planned to decline donations from lobbyists. Lujan, who currently chairs the DCCC, quickly reversed course. The DCCC and the lobbyists raising money for the committee did not respond to requests for comment. This story is a collaboration between International Business Times' David Sirota and MapLight's Andrew Perez.

The software allows arbitrage sellers to place orders from multiple suppliers. Miami, United States - April 17, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Arbiship, an eBay Amazon automatic ordering tool for drop shipping sellers has launched with a promotion of 100 free orders for all new users. The software automatically manages & fulfills orders for eBay sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart, uploads tracking numbers, calculates profits and creates profit reports emailed to users weekly. Arbiship users start with 100 free orders until May 15th. More information on Arbiship is available at: http://arbiship.com. On eBay, arbitrage involves buying hot or top-selling items at lower than usual prices and then selling them for a profit according. According to SaleHoo, with the most successful arbitrageurs generally making money by buying and selling in specialized areas. SaleHoo also reports that although an arbitrageur doesn't need to be a specialist in the products they are selling, it is necessary to know the market. Knowing the product and the target market increases success in marketing and turning items over quickly. Arbitrage is everywhere online, all the time. It might be hard to cleverly disguised, but it's true. Those who live in the USA and do a bit of online shopping have likely bought a plethora of arbitrage items without even realizing it. At least 1/4th of the items purchased online are from middle men such as arbitrage sellers. So what is this arbitrage, anyway? Arbitrage is a basic economics concept. The same idea can apply to any commodity that can be bought and resold - arbitrage is the art of finding a product at a low price from one supplier and selling it at a higher price to the customer. That might sound like a standard business, but the difference is that instead of buying discounted products wholesale, with eBay arbitrage sellers are often buying straight from an online retailer and getting them to ship direct to their customers. The seller is essentially a middleman, connecting lazy buyers with the products they can't be hassled to research. People often ask skeptically: "Does that really work?". The answer is yes, in fact it works incredibly well. The Arbiship app is fully automated software to assist eBay arbitrage sellers in the technical processes of automatically buying and re-selling products online. It has the power to automatically process orders from multiple suppliers while also uploading tracking numbers, along with a unique bundling feature that allow sellers to fulfill Amazon add-on items by bundling multiple items into one order. There is no daily process of placing manual orders, finding the correct items on retailers websites, copying address lines manually, double checking buyer information, filling in payment details or calculating profits. The software is equipped with the intelligence to keep a tab on all sales and profits in an easy to use manner. Arbitrageurs receive weekly profit emails to stay on top of their most vital information, along with accurate data in the sales page. Arbiship is an advanced eBay arbitrage automatic ordering software that works with Amazon, Walmart and other online sellers. It allows users to edit and manage all of their records in one place and import or fill in supplier details, including any variations.The software automatically skips orders with cancellation requests, double checks addresses for accuracy and notifies users about problems before they occur. The automatic eBay arbitrage order fulfillment software for sellers offers the first 100 orders free with no payment required to allow arbitrageurs to use Arbiship and see and compare its time-saving capabilities to their current strategies.

The hotspot program uses devices provided by the Rochester Public Library. Two years after moving to Rochester, Mohamed Said sees his family making new connections. The Somalian refugee and father of two says it's due to a little device about the size of a cellphone. As a result, his wife, Faadumo Abdalla, is studying for her driver's license test and taking online classes. His 7-year-old daughter is finding help with her homework, and his 4-year-old daughter has become obsessed with "Dora the Explorer." The device is a mobile hotspot supplied through a Rochester Public Library pilot program. The library purchased 97 devices earlier this year, using a $30,000 donation from the Rochester Public Library Foundation. While 65 of the hotspots can be checked out at the library, Library Director Audrey Betcher said staff wanted to ensure others were specifically put into the hands of people who needed them the most. As a result, the library partnered with Olmsted County Community Services to ensure they went to families in need. "It's a huge barrier in our world," Betcher said of the internet access. With 32 devices in hand, Armin Budimlic, director of the county's Family Support and Assistance programs, asked agencies to target families in the Minnesota Family Investment Program and the Diversity Work Program. Workforce Development Inc. and Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association split the devices, which is how one landed with Said's family. While his family is using it for a variety of online activities, Said is has also been searching for new employment opportunities. He's employed at WalMart, but is hoping to find other work to better support his family. "The computer has helped him with that," said Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association caseworker Warda Hussein, who also served as an interpreter. IMAA Employment Program Manager Ahmed Osman said the benefits for most families, like Said's, go beyond individual uses. "You can see more family activities are being done," he said, noting in some cases parents help children with their homework and in others tech-savvy children help their parents fill out job applications. Cheri Fischer, a career counselor for Workforce Development, said she's witnessed similar family-related activities. "A lot of the older generation don't know how to navigate the laptops," she said, noting children frequently lend a hand. Both agencies provide laptops with the hotspots. Osman said that is a crucial component since many clients may only have older desktop computers that may not be equipped for a wireless signal. Others don't have access to a computer. Agency staff also noted the hotspots have been a boon to the work they do. Osman said his office frequently gets visits from clients and former clients who need help completing online applications, which can take at least an hour in the case of one major local employer. He said clients with laptops typically need less help, which creates more time to work with others, which is important since a growing number of jobs require online applications. "We have seen a tremendous improvement with our clients who have been allowed to get a hotspot," Hussein said. Fischer said many of the Workforce Development clients using the hotspots have transportation issues or may be unable to leave their homes due to disabilities or childcare needs. As a result, email access helps staff connect with them and offer advice from a distance. "It's also helped out a lot with people who are in post-secondary education programs," she said, noting they are better equipped to upgrade their employment opportunities. Said and Abdalla said the have noted one potential downfall. They said their children are learning English at a faster pace than they are, and they worry their daughters could lose the connection to their native tongue. Osman, however, encouraged them to see it as an opportunity. He said they can learn from their daughters' newfound knowledge while also teaching the young ones about their roots. He said he expects the devices will continue helping bridge and strengthen relationships. "Even watching movies will help them with language, too," he said after Said noted his family has been able to use the device for entertainment. What's your reaction?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News eBay Amazon Automatic Ordering Tool For Drop Shipping Arbitrage Sellers Launched   View as PDF  Print View    Arbiship, an eBay Amazon automatic ordering fulfillment tool for drop shipping sellers, has been launched with 100 free orders for all new users. The software allows arbitrage sellers to place orders from multiple suppliers. Miami, United States – April 17, 2017 /PressCable/ — Arbiship, an eBay Amazon automatic ordering tool for drop shipping sellers has launched with a promotion of 100 free orders for all new users. The software automatically manages & fulfills orders for eBay sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart, uploads tracking numbers, calculates profits and creates profit reports emailed to users weekly. Arbiship users start with 100 free orders until May 15th. More information on Arbiship is available at: http://arbiship.com. On eBay, arbitrage involves buying hot or top-selling items at lower than usual prices and then selling them for a profit according. According to SaleHoo, with the most successful arbitrageurs generally making money by buying and selling in specialized areas. SaleHoo also reports that although an arbitrageur doesn’t need to be a specialist in the products they are selling, it is necessary to know the market. Knowing the product and the target market increases success in marketing and turning items over quickly. Arbitrage is everywhere online, all the time. It might be hard to cleverly disguised, but it’s true. Those who live in the USA and do a bit of online shopping have likely bought a plethora of arbitrage items without even realizing it. At least 1/4th of the items purchased online are from middle men such as arbitrage sellers. So what is this arbitrage, anyway? Arbitrage is a basic economics concept. The same idea can apply to any commodity that can be bought and resold – arbitrage is the art of finding a product at a low price from one supplier and selling it at a higher price to the customer. That might sound like a standard business, but the difference is that instead of buying discounted products wholesale, with eBay arbitrage sellers are often buying straight from an online retailer and getting them to ship direct to their customers. The seller is essentially a middleman, connecting lazy buyers with the products they can’t be hassled to research. People often ask skeptically: „Does that really work?”. The answer is yes, in fact it works incredibly well. The Arbiship app is fully automated software to assist eBay arbitrage sellers in the technical processes of automatically buying and re-selling products online. It has the power to automatically process orders from multiple suppliers while also uploading tracking numbers, along with a unique bundling feature that allow sellers to fulfill Amazon add-on items by bundling multiple items into one order. There is no daily process of placing manual orders, finding the correct items on retailers websites, copying address lines manually, double checking buyer information, filling in payment details or calculating profits. The software is equipped with the intelligence to keep a tab on all sales and profits in an easy to use manner. Arbitrageurs receive weekly profit emails to stay on top of their most vital information, along with accurate data in the sales page. Arbiship is an advanced eBay arbitrage automatic ordering software that works with Amazon, Walmart and other online sellers. It allows users to edit and manage all of their records in one place and import or fill in supplier details, including any variations.The software automatically skips orders with cancellation requests, double checks addresses for accuracy and notifies users about problems before they occur. The automatic eBay arbitrage order fulfillment software for sellers offers the first 100 orders free with no payment required to allow arbitrageurs to use Arbiship and see and compare its time-saving capabilities to their current strategies.

The last marketing class of the week brought us a guest speaker, which I was happy about; marketing class was the one class that Dyson business freshman were constantly taking notes in. Not that the notes were needlessly drawn out — they were more or less a copied version of the ones found in our textbook. But it was a long textbook, and it was a short semester. The guest speaker was John Fogarty, who had been a student at Dyson before it became Dyson. Back in the pre-Dyson days, the Applied Economics and Management major was called “agricultural economics”, which was like poison to the ears to the parents of those who wanted to send their children to schools that would prepare them for business. But after the turn of the millennium, it was “applied” instead of “agricultural,” which somehow meant it was a richer education process. You might scoff, but the marketing pivot was genius. As one applicant’s parents explained in April after getting the college decisions, there daughter was choosing between Brown and Cornell, looking for something that would get a good job in finance. But the allure of “Applied Economics of Management” overshadowed any gap in prestige. The word choice paid off: the student was now one of my classmates. Mr. Fogarty was carved a different era, born from a different mindset. He wore his “blue collar” mentality proudly. “I got an offer from Goldman Sachs, and I turned them down.” He repeated it, with a shrug. He went to work for Wal-Mart’s business team because that’s what his heart wanted. It was a nice sentiment, but it was heresy to the students he was talking to. The unspoken assumption about Dyson is that a significant portion of the students want a career in finance. And not just a career in finance — on Wall Street, too. Banks! Big, bloody banks. There isn’t anything more intriguing and sexy than working on Wall Street for most students here. The most popular concentration is finance. The most popular clubs are financing and investment. The panels where banks come to meet students at Cornell are easily the most attended. I went to an entrepreneurship panel today — seven people showed up. Not to say Dyson is a Wharton wannabe. Wharton can be cold and menacing, angry and distant. One of the glowing rarities of AEM is the intimate setting it provides students. Each class of freshman is only about  100 students, allowing students to make stronger, friendlier connections. There’s something disarmingly charmful in how casual Dyson is. In comparison, Wharton is flooded with 600 freshmen each year, each one cockier than the one before. Waste a moment gasping for air, and you just might drown. But there are moments when I realize schools don’t define students. Their careers goals do. One night, while working in a group on a marketing assignment, we talk about the careers we want to embark on, and more implicitly, our career salaries. Actually — it was pretty damn explicit. One girl prattles on about her dream career. She looks through the career profile of a young banker, who’s working at a big bank with a name that rolls naturally off the tongue and into a pool of cash. “Hey, how much do you think first year associates at Goldman Sach’s get paid?” We shrug. Some ungodly number, perhaps. The conversation swings to me. I think about where I want to work. “You know, I might want to work at Frankfurt. I heard they do good international trade there.” I thought Frankfurt sounded like a romantic place to work. The Goldman girl smirks. “Why would you ever want to go there? There’s nothing there.” True, it wasn’t Wall Street. But should that matter? *** By the way, Mr. Fogarty isn’t done yet. Near the end of his talk about his career and why he chose it, he looks up at us, and takes aim at the zeitgeist. “How many of you are interested in a career on Wall Street?” Something interesting happens. In my head, I imagine at least a third of the class raising their hands. No — maybe half. Every year, Dyson sends scores of students to the banks on Wall Street: JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche and Goldman Sachs. And this isn’t to mention the inevitable horde of students who apply to Wall Street and rejected. In my mind, I see hands flying. We all look around. But not a single person raises their hand.   William Wang is a freshman in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.

Related REDDY | Lost in the Closet By Narayan Reddy 4 hours ago For a long time since then I projected my insecurities on others. I felt like the only true way for me to be gay was to be unapologetically “fierce.” I acted and appeared as a stereotypical gay man and cut out anyone who I felt wasn’t with that. I began to see homophobia where it wasn’t. It took some hard looks in the mirror to see that me at my “fiercest” was me at my most repressed, most pretending to be something I’m not in blind pursuit of something that I thought I should be. BYRNE | Five Childhood Activities that Never Paid Off in Real Life By Sarah Byrne September 11, 2013 As a junior, I feel like I’m getting perilously close to entering what some might call the “real world,” what others might call “adulthood,” and what I call “scary.” With this old age comes a (very) small bit of wisdom, and I feel that I can now confidently assess some of the decisions I made earlier in life. I’m not sure about everyone else, but I know that I definitely used to take everything way too seriously. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Schultze • 3 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Shelia Mendoza says she's not looking to make a living from Liberty, just some extra cash and conversation. M.L. SCHULTZE / WKSU       It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking. Listen Listening... / 4:11 A rural app -- and adaptation   The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library. CODE SWITCHHow Driverless Vehicles Could Harm Professional Drivers Of Color It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake. Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Her job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs. "The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " she says. So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado.   ALL TECH CONSIDEREDPittsburgh Offers Driving Lessons For Uber's Autonomous Cars Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. She created Liberty as a business, but she talks about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door. "We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says. One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, she says, is to be a grandma. Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, she was one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained. The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships. ALL TECH CONSIDEREDIn China, As In The U.S., The Fight Over Ride Hailing Is Local For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with her first customer who'd lost his license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until he could get his license back. "I always had him there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before he would go to work. Once in a while he paid for mine." Since he regained his license, things have slowed down for Mendoza. "I was happy he got his car, I was happy he got his license. He's a better person for that because I know he hated getting hauled around by an old lady," she says and laughs. She's hoping business will pick up, and her hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app. THE TWO-WAYGoogle Spinoff Sues Uber, Saying Leader Of Autonomous Vehicle Unit Stole Key Designs "I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want nothing like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " she says. Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community. "The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot." Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies. AROUND THE NATIONRural Trump Voters Embrace The Sacrifices That Come With Support Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit. Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area. "I like that the drivers are from the communities," she says. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here." Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America. M.L. Schultze is a reporter with NPR member station WKSU. You can follow her@MLSchultze.

[NYT] More workers in general merchandise stores have been laid off since October, about 89,000 Americans. That is more than all of the people employed in the United States coal industry, which President Trump championed during the campaign as a prime example of the workers who have been left behind in the economic recovery. The troubles at the American mall are coming to a boil [WaPo] The jobs report pointed to dire problems confronting many of the stores populating shopping plazas and malls. Department and general merchandise stores — a category that includes Macy’s and Wal-Mart — shed 34,700 workers last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Retailers involved in high-priced big ticket items such as furniture stores and auto dealers barely added jobs. Nor are wages keeping pace. Average hourly earnings for retail employees, including managers, has inched up just 1.1 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.7 percent average increase for all U.S. workers. What in the World Is Causing the Retail Meltdown of 2017? [The Atlantic] In a long and detailed paper this week on the demise of stores, Cowen Research analysts offered several reasons for the “structural decay” of malls following the Great Recession. First, they said that stagnating wages and rising health-care costs squeezed consumer spending on fun stuff, like clothes. Second, the recession permanently hurt logo-driven brands, like Hollister and Abercrombie, that thrived during the 1990s and 2000s, when coolness in high-school hallways was defined by the size of the logo emblazoned on a polo shirt. Third, as consumers became bargain-hunters, discounters, fast-fashion outlets, and club stores took market share from department stores, like Macy’s and Sears. Finally, malls are retail bundles, and when bundles unravel, the collateral damage is massive. The Call-In: Retailers Decline While Amazon Grows [NPR] These department stores are faltering. But on the one hand, you have some luxury brands that are doing just fine. And on the other hand, you have this enormous rise of dollar stores that have thrived even post-recession. posted by melissasaurus (151 comments total) 50 users marked this as a favorite   Working in one of the primary retail chains, I can say I've seen my current employer refuse outright to replace any employees that are fired or quit. At one point two years ago we had 230 employees but are now down to just around 100. The biggest reason I've heard from my boss is that the store is "maximizing productivity". I know that's a bullshit answer. He knows it too. Really though it feels as if it's just one more method for the top spots to improve their paychecks. posted by JakeEXTREME at 6:57 AM on April 17 [9 favorites] The Atlantic link has the tl;dr--"Between 2010 and last year, Amazon’s sales in North America quintupled from $16 billion to $80 billion. Sears’ revenue last year was about $22 billion, so you could say Amazon has grown by three Sears in six years." posted by Halloween Jack at 6:58 AM on April 17 [30 favorites] FTFA: Finally, malls are retail bundles, and when bundles unravel, the collateral damage is massive. This is the key, to me: I can skip a trip to the mall, and instead do individual transactions on my computer. No more Lands' End, just llbean.com; and a day later, no more B.Dalton, just amazon.com. posted by wenestvedt at 7:00 AM on April 17 [7 favorites] The spaces will close or adapt. My local mall now has a bowling alley/arcade/fun complex in place of a dead Penney's, for instance, and substantial former retail space taken up by urgent care and other health care facilities. Down the road is a Big Block metromall, which varies between thriving (Wal-Mart, big movie theater complex) and rotting (Huge Circuit City corpse never resold, constantly changing small restaurant selection). Brick and mortar can't beat online for selection, nor on convenience. They either win on customer service -- which costs money to provide -- or on necessity (things you can't easily return and can't try out / try on / pick up and look at online), or vanish. And in the latter case they still need to remain competitive on price or they become just a meatspace showroom for Amazon. posted by delfin at 7:04 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] Is this best post month? posted by Melismata at 7:11 AM on April 17 [5 favorites] I want "all of the people employed in the United States coal industry" to become a standard measure of people. "Welcome to the college football season kickoff here at Michigan Stadium. 108,000 fans are here for the game, which is more than one and a half times as many people as are employed in the United States coal industry." posted by Etrigan at 7:17 AM on April 17 [117 favorites] Is it naive to think that in a time when real wage growth has been stagnant while fixed costs (health care, rent) keep growing, Americans just can't sustain the kind of spending-as-entertainment that was the lifeblood of malls in the 80s and 90s? It seems like we've been restructuring the economy to be based on direct consumer spending for the last 30 years at the same time that constant transfers of wealth to the ownership class has left us less able to support that kind of an economy. posted by murphy slaw at 7:17 AM on April 17 [90 favorites] It's not just the shopping malls. The same thing is happening in cities. In my own neighborhood there was an awesome consignment store that was doing bang-up business, and the landlord just recently kicked them out, to be replaced with a real estate broker's office. Meanwhile, that store was probably one of the main drivers of foot traffic in the neighborhood, so now all of the other businesses here are going to suffer, too. The stupidity of greedy landlords continues to astound me. posted by 1970s Antihero at 7:21 AM on April 17 [31 favorites] I'm not sure how they do it, but Microcenter is a (I assume) success story in brick and mortar, most likely because their prices are the same as amazon, and they have just about anything that's tech related, from resistors and diodes up to flat screen TVs. Sure, I can get some widgets online for a few dollars less, but it's worth the extra dollar or whatever for instant gratification for that oddball cable you need TODAY to finish a project. The last 3 times I walked into a Best Buy, I walked out empty handed because it seems like all they want to sell are mobile phones, and their computer parts/cables selection is both a joke and ridiculously overpriced. Our local Sears is a disaster. About 1/3 of the huge retail space is filled with "outdoor living" stuff like gazebos and gas grills, while their electronics section has 2 TVs and 10 xbox games from 2 years ago. Even (what i think of as) their reason for existing tools section is a tiny corner of the store that seems to be a forgotten remnant. posted by Mr. Big Business at 7:24 AM on April 17 [12 favorites] I want "all of the people employed in the United States coal industry" to become a standard measure of people.

Yup. I have lived in a totally gentrified city, one that is gentrifying rapidly, and now I've that will likely go that way in the next 50 years.

Increasing numbers of us are big and/or tall and fall outside of the size range carried at all the major mall retailers. My mom likes going to the mall but for me there's no reason to go in to 80% of the stores because I know there won't be anything in my size. I know there's various reasons for it, from sizing and manufacturing of big and tall apparel to the fashion industry's outright Loathing of no traditional bodies. But the bottom line is that's stores I'm not going in, money I'm spending online, and money I'm not spending at all the other businesses, the food court, etc. posted by Ghostride The Whip at 7:36 AM on April 17 [11 favorites] It makes me think that some sort of bubble has been going on under the surface and we only just notice now as it is popping.

I stopped trying to shop at the mall, long before online took over, because there was just no point. When you go to the mall with three friends, and end up turning the ONE person who can wear mall clothes into the barbie doll for all the others to vicariously shop for, and the other three are just pretending they don't care that they can't wear anything there, well, how soon do you think they'll schedule another outing like that?

You can't feel it, and monitors don't accurately capture color. I do most of my shopping online, but craft supplies are one of the few things that I still buy in person.

People without disposable income can't buy stuff, and when they have to buy stuff, they go for the cheapest option possible. Of course people whose real incomes haven't risen in decades aren't out shopping for fun! stores that sell, say, upscale Himilayan salt. The thing is: these stores don't last, either. Even in the wealthiest cities, the demand rarely supports the rent, especially into the medium term and longer. posted by praemunire at 7:43 AM on April 17 [9 favorites] No wonder a lot of people voted for Trump and his empty promises about jobs. Please, let us not forget that most of the people hardest-hit by this very phenomenon (that is, the contraction of retail)--working-class non-white people--did not vote for Trump. One of the very dumbest things liberals have done post-election is permit the framing that "people harmed by the economy voted for Trump." No. Clinton won the under-$50K income groups, though you'd be hard-pressed to realize it reading the poetic accounts of Ohioan suffering.

Not only might you extend some poor schlub's job slightly, but they can be fascinating demographic.studies as to what stores stick it out to the end, who's stuck working there and who's wandering the halls. My last trip to a since-demolished mall (RIP Granite Run) showed stores I hadn't seen in a mall in decades popping up (custom t-shirt printers like what you'd see down the shore), "Oriental Gifts" hodgepodges with owners desperate to chat up anyone nearby, and a Bath & Body Works visited by a woman carrying on simultaneous conversations with the staff, other customers and Jesus. The look of dear God please buy some soap or something and save me from this lady on the cashier's face was unmistakable. posted by delfin at 7:50 AM on April 17 [3 favorites] Also, with a physical store, what are you paying for, exactly? It isn't quality. Storefronts significantly drive up costs, which usually ends up reducing the quality of the product. Compare clothes from The Gap today as compared to 25 years ago; it's not even close. It isn't knowledgeable staff. Retail staff usually doesn't know anything. Physical touch and feel, like for clothes? Every web store worth its salt has a free try on and return policy. It slightly increases the time in exchange for home delivery and no trip to the mall. Customer service? Phone banks and online chatbots are already handling most of that anyway. So why do you need a storefront? Outside of restaurants, I don't see much of a future for retail. Maybe groceries, but even there home delivery is pretty awesome. posted by leotrotsky at 7:52 AM on April 17 [4 favorites] Of course, malls (together with churches) have also served as third spaces for many communities without other viable options available. That's a little scary. We're polarized enough without removing one of the few places left where people mingle freely. posted by leotrotsky at 7:52 AM on April 17 [29 favorites] I think there's a couple more factors that aren't mentioned that are also causes of changes in the retail industry: - Clothes are less of status symbols than they used to be. Maybe this is just my extrapolation and becoming an young adult but my perception is that brands are less desired than they were 15-20 years ago when I was a teenager. Some brands are still holding cachet: my 14 y.o. nephew is sort of a jock and big fan of nike for his shoes and shorts for games but doesn't give a shit about anything else. I'm not sure if there's any huge clothing brands for many teen segments that exist except perhaps crocs and uggs (or maybe I'm wrong, because I'm old). (Related, this piece last week in the atlantic relatedly supports this; that the upper and middle classes have been spending more money on experiences (dining out, travel) instead of material objects like clothes). - There was an oversupply of retail space even during the retail/mall heyday of the 80 and 90s. The suburbs have been competing with each other to get the newest and greatest stores (AND THEY still do, there's a new shopping development opening in Orange in the next year or so) and its accompanying tax base. Some stores move to the newer one when it opens. The Cleveland area (not just the city, but the region) has had negative population growth over the past 30 years but several malls, retail 'lifestyle' centers, or strip malls (Tower City, the Galleria, Crocker Park, South Park, Legacy Village, Woodmere, that failed one in Garfield Heights and I'm sure there's more, those are ones that were only built from 1989-2005) were built. There were malls (euclid square, Randall) closing even in the 90s. posted by fizzix at 7:53 AM on April 17 [6 favorites] A couple of national chains I frequent seem to be pushing online shopping really hard now. However, I live within a 15 minute drive of several branches of these stores so paying shipping costs doesn't make sense to me even from a convenience standpoint. I might feel differently if gas prices double but right now I don't see the value. (Plus, the one time I tried it the stuff was shipped from another state with a week delay. I could've gotten it quicker via Amazon Prime, or gee, just driven to one of the local stores.) I live near what is considered an upscale mall that's been there for several decades. It's anchored by some high-end national stores that I rarely shop at and the stores in between are selling mostly much lower quality stuff probably aimed at teenagers and young adults. At this point, outside of tourist season, I think the mall must be making most of its money on the concessions and restaurants, and the top-of-the-line movie theater. I can't imagine many of those jobs are more than minimum wage. posted by fuse theorem at 7:55 AM on April 17 [1 favorite] Brick and mortar can't beat online for selection, nor on convenience. Eh. At least on the convenience factor, I'd say it's a toss-up, at least for me. The whole rigamarole of ordering a range of sizes/waiting for delivery/test fitting/shipping back things that don't fit or look like the pictures or are made like crap/possibly re-ordering, is an enormous inconvenience that seems to consistently get dismissed by those who are either easy to fit or just plain want to do everything online regardless. I'm always between sizes and it's usually much easier for me to go to an actual store and try stuff on. Shopping online for clothing is always a huge guessing game that requires me to run-up a credit card without even knowing if anything will actually fit. It's certainly not an exceptionally efficient or convenient system. posted by Thorzdad at 7:57 AM on April 17 [18 favorites] Once you take brick and mortar retail out of the picture, one of the few ways that humans are still employed by an online storefront is in warehousing and distribution. Boston Dynamics' Atlas (seen in the video literally doing warehouse work) has progressed over the past 10 years from being incredibly bulky and needing tethered power, to being lighter than your typical warehouse working human and running on battery. That's also the top end of the spectrum. There are other videos out there of two fulfillment human workers and a few hundred smaller, droid-like bots zipping around the factory floor. Essentially robotic shelving. Kiva, Knapp, and Locus are just three options if you're one of those new retailers opening in Redhook that the NYT talks about. And that's not even talking about the robotization at the manufacturing level (already pretty firmly here), and at the point to point delivery level (quickly approaching as companies dump money into self-driving tech). You're quickly going past the 10% of all people employed in retail, and tacking on the 3% of transportation workers, and the (what remains of) 9% of people employed in manufacturing (using 2014 numbers). posted by codacorolla at 7:58 AM on April 17 [6 favorites] There's a mall near me that was DOA (just built maybe a decade ago, or not even) and the interesting thing there is that the mall itself is deader than dead but the surrounding Big Box-opolis is thriving. Traditional covered malls near me are generally dying (there is one, the super upscale one with the high-end brands, that is doing well), but the new-urbanist typed places and the big box strip malls all seem to be doing fine. What I remember from my mall-spent youth (Monroeville Mall, home of zombies and me as a pre-teen holla!) is that 90% of mall stores are clothing stores. And I don't know about you guys, but 90% of my own purchases are definitely not clothing. posted by soren_lorensen at 7:59 AM on April 17 [3 favorites] Yeah, convenience depends somewhat on the type of goods. Clothing has more factors involved than, say, a saucepan or a book. Malls near me are about 90% clothes, shoes, cell phones/accessories. So many cell phone stores. Maybe a token Kitchen Kapers to cleanse the palate. posted by delfin at 8:02 AM on April 17 I took my daughter shoe shopping yesterday, and we went to four stores before we finally found any shoe at all in her size. Luckily, she liked that one, so we got it. I could have beat the price by $8 online (we paid $58, I saw them for $50) but she was getting impatient (she's 5) and I thought we should give business to the store that actually had employees around to help measure her foot and find the right shoe. But next time? I think we're ordering a pair from Zappos and sending it back if it doesn't work. My time is too valuable to me to spend hours going from store to store to get a shoe for a kindergartner. And this isn't some dying backwater, either, we were shopping in Sugar Land, Texas, a very well-off suburb of Houston. posted by Pater Aletheias at 8:03 AM on April 17 [12 favorites] It's not a mall, but for a while (I think maybe it moved?) an old department store (Apex) in Rhode Island (Pawtucket? I want to say it was Pawtucket) was an incredibly strange DMV branch. It was still filled with empty shelves and the bathroom had a poster of "The Loss Prevention Whale" who wore a deerstalker cap and smoked a pipe. The experience was deeply bizarre, but the whale was pretty cute. posted by Bulgaroktonos at 8:04 AM on April 17 [7 favorites] The thing about clothes is that, while you might think buying them online would be a hassle because of fit, they're also quite light and easy to ship (and consequently super easy to send back if you don't like them). I don't have Prime and anything over a few ounces I prefer to buy locally because who wants to pay for shipping on a La Creuset dutch oven? posted by soren_lorensen at 8:05 AM on April 17 I actually go to traditional covered malls all the time. I went to one yesterday. That one is definitely in trouble, but it's innovating by trying to attract new kinds of stores. They have a semi-upscale grocery store now, which is what I went there for. The Target that I go to is in a mall. And I go to the mall that has been partially taken over by the university all the time, sometimes for university functions but sometimes to buy stuff. There are actually a couple of cute stores in there where I look for gifts sometimes. An interesting thing is that the two struggling malls have more independent stores, and most of them aren't clothes. The mall that is thriving has more traditional clothing stores, but they're also anchored by the Target. posted by ArbitraryAndCapricious at 8:05 AM on April 17 On top of all else stated: My 13 year old daughter simply does not want things. I'm not sure how standard this is, but if it the norm things are going to change. She doesn't want clothes or toys or fun objects or... anything that I can think of. She is totally content in the consumer space with the minimum in clothes, a phone and books from wherever (the library, kindle, second hand shops.) I cannot convince her to leave the house and go shopping. I'm envious, honestly. posted by n9 at 8:08 AM on April 17 [16 favorites] The Atlantic link has the tl;dr--"Between 2010 and last year, Amazon’s sales in North America quintupled from $16 billion to $80 billion.

I will never stop being upset with Sears, a company that made itself on the mail-order business, for completely failing to capitalize on internet shopping. In some other universe Sears is the go-to place to buy literally anything online and Amazon is a has-been that got muscled out of the book sales market by Barnes and Noble and Borders. posted by Mr.Encyclopedia at 8:09 AM on April 17 [18 favorites] - Clothes are less of status symbols than they used to be.

What's nice is the newer ones (Legacy Village, Crocker Park) look like little towns, so if and when they fail they can be repurposed into actual towns. They're actually pretty nice spaces to just be in, unlike those old school monolithic indoor malls. I mean, Crocker Park is huge and mixed use with green space like a mini park in the middle. Legacy's not bad either; they have outdoor music & events in their big central green space. posted by leotrotsky at 8:13 AM on April 17 [3 favorites] Also: I've noticed my boys, aged 6-2, have a tiny fraction of the desire for toys I had at their age.

We're near a couple of universities that attract people from overseas, especially Duke, but the dearth of locals at the mall gave me pause. People are focusing on the quality of jobs, but product design decisions and decisions about what to host at malls seems pretty important. Have you ever decided "I will buy pants today" and then tried to accomplish that at a mall? If you are educated enough to know that it _should_ be possible to own comfortable, machine washable, professional-looking, pocketed, etc. clothing [all the things a smart person who isn't working 'at a fashion magazine' would want], you won't find it at a mall. The whole place seems to be filled with clothing created from the sketches of precocious teenagers selected by slightly meaner, slightly more venal versions of Nina Garcia. The clothes may "look expensive" and seem to be about "the girl" who "is a New York professional" or some other nonexistent archetype -- but a little more boring, because this is the mall in North Carolina -- but nobody I know _wants_ to dress like that. That's clothing. There are other things at the mall, but none of it is that great. It would be OK to price things a little high if they were actually worth it. These retailers were really interesting to me when I first came to the big city, but the novelty is gone and there's not really anything else to recommend them. Godiva Chocolates? The tea retailer (where the tea doesn't seem very fresh, which is the main determiner of actual quality)? Various shoe stores that don't carry my size and _insist_ that I must want to wear boots with heels and/or horse tack? We went all over the local mall looking for men's dark summer-weight wool pants (slim fit, no pleats) and finally were referred to a _second_ mall. The more local Brooks Brothers doesn't have much in the way of professional men's pants, just stuff that looks like "I'm a Kennedy on vacation", possibly because that makes the store look "unified". The emphasis on brand/look/voice means that nobody's looking at the details of _what people actually need or want_. The education that Gen X, and possibly millennials, has been given emphasizes marketing over the less visible and aggregated work of just making and sharing useful things. posted by amtho at 8:13 AM on April 17 [10 favorites] GDP has been growing for eight straight years, gas prices are low, unemployment is under 5 percent, and the last 18 months have been quietly excellent years for wage growth, particularly for middle- and lower-income Americans. Thanks, Obama. Laugh if you want, but these sorts of questions—“what experience will reliably deliver the most popular Instagram post?”—really drive the behavior of people ages 13 and up. This is a big deal for malls, says Barbara Byrne Denham, a senior economist at Reis, a real-estate analytics firm. Department stores have failed as anchors, but better food, entertainment, and even fitness options might bring teens and families back to struggling malls... Rings true enough. In general, the extant enclosed malls in my neighborhood have casual-sit-down, hang-out places like food courts and indoor playgrounds. The ones that closed didn't. The 80s suburban teenagers I knew largely socialized and played grown-up by driving to the mall. Today, they say, fewer young people are interested in car ownership or doing so much driving, partly because keeping in touch with phones is so much more efficient. I'm surprised the author talks about self-driving cars as retail accessories but doesn't seem to touch on this aspect at all, because there are so many interesting speculations and questions. For example: Self-driving cars could extend support for the sort of low-density, pedestrian-hostile development we already have way too much of. A mall that attracts affluent 14-year-olds in self-driving taxis might thrive, but it would do so partly by filtering out people who balk at the cab fare. Which is something suburban malls - usually pretty hostile to pedestrian, bicycle, or bus access - have always done. The well-off kids get meat-space congregating and socializing, the less-well-off kids have a disadvantage. posted by Western Infidels at 8:14 AM on April 17 [4 favorites] Interesting points here about how children today just ... don't want stuff.

I guess because making stuff is something you get a lot to Youtube videos. The toys she loves most in the world she's never seen an ad for; it's those Calico Critters at Barnes & Noble. Calls them her "widdle kwidders." There's nothing she loves more than "cwafting." She'll find little pebbles or pieces of plastic and go, "I can cwaft with that!" and pick them up and put them in her little satchel for later.

It certainly isn't the big attraction it was to previous generations. When you have a smartphone and/or online spaces (games, social media, etc) the need to cruise the mall goes way way down. When Teens and Pre-Teens shop it's typically associated around the core shopping times of back to school, Christmas, etc and yes I think they are purchasing less items overall. For every clothes horse willing to go through endless racks of clothing there are tons of consumers that purchase the bare minimum. With more and more office spaces going casual or psuedo casual I think people are able to use the same stuff in multiple settings. See also the rise of athleisure wear like yoga pants. Yes there are still plenty of people sporting North Face and Lululemon all of the time but seriously how many variations of that are truly required in someone's wardrobe. So you have the premium retailers who are basically selling Veblen goods and more and more of the remainder are being driven into lowest common denominator goods. Not quite to the point where we are buying our paper-fabric workwear from a vending machine ala Cyberpunk but getting closer and closer to it. posted by vuron at 8:25 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] "I can cwaft with that!" and pick them up and put them in her little satchel for later. a) This is adorable as fuck b) I wonder to what extent video games are playing into this alongside the aforementioned YouTube videos.

I swung by there again last weekend only to discover the replacement style has completely different sizing and runs about 3 inches longer on the same size inseam. And I'm an average sized male who doesn't have to worry about missing pockets and all that nonsense. I'd gladly pay more for pants that are consistent, have sizes that mean something, and would stick around, but at Gap pricing, I'm pretty sure they are the more expensive option. Maybe I should take this to AskMe. posted by Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug at 8:29 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] Clothes are less of status symbols than they used to be. Maybe this is just my extrapolation and becoming an young adult but my perception is that brands are less desired than they were 15-20 years ago when I was a teenager. Clothes are still a status symbol (see any of the articles about Cochella style, for instance) but yeah, brands are basically anti-status now. The status comes from doing something "different" (even if it's actually still a kind of uniform -- again, see the articles about Cochella style). posted by mpbx at 8:36 AM on April 17 I have to admit the last couple times I bought shoes I ordered 5 pairs from amazon and returned 4 of them. posted by bq at 8:38 AM on April 17 [3 favorites] My n=1 almost-five-year-old also has no desire for stuff. He doesn't see commercials because when he wants to watch a cartoon he pulls up the PBS Kids app on his tablet and watches a cartoon. We walk right by the toy section at Target and he doesn't even notice it. We'll see if that lasts once peer pressure starts to be a thing, but so far he seems pretty impervious to brands and characters. Like, he loves Daniel Tiger but it would never occur to him that owning Daniel Tiger-branded stuff is desirable. (Well, okay, when given the option to get Peppa Pig gardening gloves, he did pick those. But there was no option for un-branded kids' garden gloves so it was either those or a bunch of superhero properties he knows nothing about because he's four and those movies are not for young children, dammit!) posted by soren_lorensen at 8:45 AM on April 17 I wonder how much of retail and mall's downfall is the death of physical media. Blockbuster, Tower Records, Sam Goody, Virgin Megastores, National Record Mart, Hollywood Video, Borders Books, J&R, B. Dalton, Movie Gallery, and Media Play have all closed, many in the last decade. I remember my mall having 4 music stores, 3 software/videogame stores, 2 bookstores, and a movie store. Now all that you see in a mall is maybe a GameStop and one Barnes and Noble if you're lucky. One of the last media stores you see in a mall is F.Y.E. That company bought out many smaller music stores like Camelot and Wherehouse. Surprisingly, a "new" (maybe it was just remodeled) one opened in the most-successful mall near me. It is mostly t-shirts, stuffed animals, and other pop culture odds and ends. There's a tiny rack of about 20-30 CDs, maybe 50 DVDs, and 50 or so vinyl shoved in the back. The big stores I like to go to (other than grocery and maybe a Target for everyday essentials) are what could be considered "hobby" or "DIY" stores. I really think these will stick around for a while, at least until very instant shipping become real. Craft stores like Michael's and Joann let you see the colors and feel the fabric, and offer classes. Loews and Home Depot also let you see the colors for paint and tile, in addition to selling product too big to ship normally, and some products you want right away. The electronics "hobby" store used to be Radioshack, but they stopped stocking that stuff decades ago. Now it is Micro Center, a place I love and dearly miss due to moving away. I had many weekends picking up Raspberry Pi and networking accessories, and they matched Amazon if needed. All of these places you can visit on a Saturday morning when you decide to finally work on that project, but Amazon will get it to you on Tuesday. posted by ALongDecember at 8:45 AM on April 17 [9 favorites] If the teenage boys in my Texas suburb are to be taken as average, brands are indeed still important; it's just that they are athletic clothing brands--Nike, Under Armour, etc.--that they can buy at the giant Dick's Sporting Goods or online. posted by tippiedog at 8:46 AM on April 17 [1 favorite] I have to admit the last couple times I bought shoes I ordered 5 pairs from amazon and returned 4 of them.

When I shop for clothes, I might buy one out of ten items I try on - so buying online in order to try on at home is a huge hassle. And I have had horrible luck with shoes; either they don't fit, or they're much lower quality than their reviews or their price indicated. I would much rather go to a physical store. But, still, they're not going to make much money off of me - I don't have much money, so shopping for clothes and shoes is maybe a twice a year event, and generally to replace / find something specific, not a leisure activity. It's a chore. posted by Kutsuwamushi at 9:00 AM on April 17 [1 favorite] Yes, watch any number of youtube videos targeted at Teens and Young Adults and athletic wear is omnipresent.

At my local mall, I'd be amazed if they have the CATEGORIES, let alone the brand names I would want or reasonable prices. * Many formerly mall-centric chains are bailing out to the strip malls. GameStop comes to mind. * Better marketing needed.

He doesn't see commercials because when he wants to watch a cartoon he pulls up the PBS Kids app on his tablet and watches a cartoon. We walk right by the toy section at Target and he doesn't even notice it. Our house is the same way. We have essentially two channels, PBS and (carefully curated) Netflix. We don't have Nick or Disney or any of the other advertiser supported outlets so that manufactured desire just isn't there. Walking down the toy aisle holds no fear for us because, quite frankly, my kid has no idea what half those things are. Last Christmas, we even had trouble writing a letter to Santa, because she couldn't think of anything to put on it, whereas I vividly remember poring through the Sears catalog, marking down all the cool things I'd seen in the commercials between cartoons. Cartoons which, in and of themselves, were just 30 minute advertisements for toys. And while I'd like to take credit for being an exceptional parent, this isn't unusual in our peer group. Around here at least, kids just aren't interested in acquiring "stuff" and if that trend holds true as they reach their prime teenage spending years, I'd expect this trend to accelerate. posted by madajb at 9:12 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] Washington Post: The entire coal industry employs fewer people than Arby’s Another largely overlooked point about coal jobs is that there just aren’t that many of them relative to other industries. . . . according to the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns program: 2014 US Employment stats for selected Industries Car washes            150,019 Theme parks        143,894 Used car dealers 138,058 Casinos                     99,952 Travel agencies     99,888 Radio                        94,584 Museums                 91,966 Breweries and wineries 82,342 Coal mining            76,572 Skiing                        75,036 Bowling                    69,088 Nail salons              68,428 Florists                     61,170 2014 US Employment stats for selected single employers Whole Foods      72,650 Arby’s                  ~80,000 Dollar General 105,000 J.C. Penney       114,000 Walmart          2,200,000 Part of the fixation on coal is because . . . there's something mysterious and ennobling about the dangerous endeavor to extract valuable commodities from deep within the earth, something that's missing from, say, used-car sales or ski-lift operation. There's also coal's role in generating the nation's electricity. But while the industry's impact is large, its payrolls aren't. Coal is highly concentrated in certain regions. When coal mines shut down, towns go under. National media coverage can make coal's impact feel larger than it actually is. Even a quarter-century ago, the coal industry employed only 131,000 people. If Trump were to somehow bring all those jobs back, there'd still be more people employed by the retail shoe sales industry (224,000). The point isn’t that coal jobs don’t matter . . . But if you’re looking to make a meaningful increase in the number of jobs available to U.S. workers, bringing back coal jobs isn’t going to do it.posted by Herodios at 9:12 AM on April 17 [18 favorites] Personally, I don't care so much about the malls, other than as places that provide jobs to locals and keep some money in the local economy, but I am pretty concerned about the downtown retailers in the town I live in since they too are suffering and, from my perspective, add even more to the community than a mall by providing a vibrant city center. I buy everything I can from local retailers, even if that means spending more or waiting for orders occasionally just to help keep them, and my town, as an actual living space rather than accepting we're all moving to an almost completely virtual society. It's a losing proposition no doubt, and so a waste of money in the long run, but seeing more wealth being funneled into ever fewer hands and watching the town I live in struggle to maintain anything but bars is just something I'm not eager to accept, even if it is the most likely outcome. posted by gusottertrout at 9:16 AM on April 17 [3 favorites] > I was telling someone a couple of weeks ago that the mall closest to me seemed to have mainly foreign visitors in it (based on language and other cultural signifiers, and the kinds of questions strangers were asking me).

I know exactly which mall you're talking about by your description, because I live walking distance from it. About seven miles east are large Pakistani and Indian communities in Morrisville, and about seven miles north is a significant (and increasingly middle-class) Latino community east of Durham. The "foreign visitors" you're referencing are locals by any reasonable meaning of the term. They live here. (And that Brooks Brothers store you mention is for casual wear.

We spend a literal factor of 10 more on afterschool activities than my parents did when I was growing up. In part because we're keeping them out of the mall. Under Armour's MyFitnessPal etc. apps are pretty brilliant advertising and I think points the way towards how brands can move towards marketing more effectively - thus killing stores faster I guess.

I do the same thing with shoes and clothes. If I'm unsure of a size or style, I'll order two of the same shirt in two different sizes, and return the other one. A friend of mine pointed out, quite rightly, that what I'm doing is totally due to class privilege. Thanks to my middle-class income and no major life catastrophe, my credit score is awesome. Credit cards constantly give me zero interest offers and high credit limits, so I can float thousands of dollar of online merchandise at my leisure. As long as I keep track that I get all of my associated refunds, companies are incentivizing me to not go to a B&M store. I used to feel bad for doing this, but I've come to realize that I'm not just saving time and money, but there's a huge emotional labor cost I'm saving by not going to a mall. I don't have to piss away twenty minutes of driving, followed up by ten minutes of finding parking. I don't have to deal with crowds or salespeople. And I almost always get what I came for when it comes to online shopping.

I'm glad it's not just my kids. We've stopped buying toys almost completely because they just don't get used. Even if a kids thinks they want something, it's rare to get more than a week's use out of it before it's forgotten. There's no equivalent of the Star Wars action figures and play sets I used all the time for years at their ages. They want: 1) more Minecraft time, 2) other game apps the see their favorite YouTubers playing, 3) craft materials, 4) Lego. That's it. I still feel kind of weird about that because part of me says "they really should be playing with actual physical toys" but maybe that's just my own generational prejudice. I definitely see how "imagine a scenario for this plastic dude" pales in comparison to "build anything you can imagine in a virtual world." And my almost-11 year old daughter has zero concept of clothing brands. Just doesn't care at all. She is keenly aware that her aging phone (an iPhone 4s) is looked down on by her peers with more recent models, but that's the only noticeable way she gets dinged for being a middle-middle-class kid with lots of upper-middle-class/lower-upper-class peers. posted by Pater Aletheias at 9:53 AM on April 17 [1 favorite] I tend to visit two different malls, and they are both pretty busy, and what they both have in common is that the large open air spaces between stores contain a variety of different gathering spaces and activities. In one, they have chessboards, air hockey, reading nooks, places to sit and charge your mobile devices. Plants and fountains kept in good repair. Very comfy squashy leather chairs instead of hard benches. It must have taken some serious investment, but from the way that people use all the amenities, it seems to be working. In the other, they have made the mall more of a community space— the last time I was there, they were hosting a huge gallery of art from all of the public schools in the county. You could go grade by grade, and it was sweet— kids could bring their families to see what they had been working on in school. Older students had made pieces with very bold political statements and topics, and their work was presented with respect and care. Families were walking through the “gallery” and talking together. Also, count me in the camp of "shopping for clothes and shoes online is an enormous hassle" camp. Sending stuff back is rarely free, and even more rarely easy. Textures and materials that look one way online turn out to be something else entirely in person. Sizes are an eternal crapshoot.

Amazon's Canada store doesn't have nearly the same breadth of goods - it's more electronics and media, not a digital mall/Walmart, and even when Zappos had a Canadian site it wasn't the Zappos experience. The upscale downtown malls seem to be doing great. But the ones out in the smaller towns are dying out. But we don't get to use Amazon to shop for dry goods and clothing too. For people like my parents in a town of less that 20,000 people 60 miles outside of Toronto, it's not dying mall vs online shopping.

But the Jacobs model is really not applicable to the vast majority of malls, regardless of whether they have multi-use space or not. Most stores within malls are cut off from exterior foot traffic. And most malls themselves are isolated from exterior foot traffic. Trips to the mall are purposeful trips, usually in cars. This means that their ability to contribute to neighborhood life in the specific way that New Urbanism conceives of stores contributing (as opposed to the simple provision of lower-wage jobs) is practically nil. Even the Oculus, which at least (?) is in a transit hub, so there's an independent reason to go there, has basically zero New Urban-style impact on its community. Most of the stores aren't even street-visible, much less street-interacting. It also means that malls are totally vulnerable to any reason that car traffic might drop off or to any general sense that that particular mall isn't appealing anymore.

We did go to the Crabtree store, but shouldn't we be able to find what we need in a giant mall that happens to be closer? For the best examples of where the market for preppy casual wear is massive and thriving, go deeper inside the Beltline in Raleigh. Cameron Village, or the open-air fake village that used to be North Hills. Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines, Lilly Pulitzer, Monkee's, Talbots, J. Crew, etc., are all thriving among the types of people for whom clothing is still a status symbol, and to whom brands still matter. And I think it's not incidental that these stores all thrive in the open-air fake-village malls. For a lot of the preppy-casual types I know in Raleigh, one of the best things to do in summertime is to attend the "Midtown" Beach Music Series that takes place on the astroturf town square. This particular mall is smart, because they use the outdoor space to host events that align with the lifestyles promoted in the brands. Another mall that is smart is one of the sad old malls in Asheville, where the storefronts are now occupied by the NC DMV office and a dressmaker who specializes in quinceañeras, so while you're standing in line you can look through the glass at the mesmerizing sparkly dresses in their storefront. In general, I think it would be GREAT to have government offices take up space in indoor malls. It would beat downtown bureaucratic offices in a lot of ways: parking is better, you can do a one-stop thing, and they could leave a few options open in the food court and maybe a keymaking kiosk (for real estate transactions) or a Zales (for weddings). posted by witchen at 10:27 AM on April 17 [5 favorites] Profit margins for Amazon are tiny, worse even than Whole Foods and American Airlines (if less bumpy than the latter), two industries notorious for razor thinness.

I think it's that everyone wants to suggest that they own or have access to a beach house, and when they're stuck inland in Raleigh they want, at least, a taste of those good beach times. Have you seen the movie Shag? It's a template for the lifestyle ideals of these folks. I mean, Lilly Pulitzer isn't popular because people are a-ok with their pine trees and blacktops in the inland suburbs. Lilly Pulitzer is popular because it suggests that they are in the loop, somehow, on that easy-breezy West Palm Beach life. Or at least that easy-breezy Topsail Island, NC life. posted by witchen at 10:46 AM on April 17 [1 favorite] Of course profit margins at Amazon are razor thin. Bezos has basically demolished book retailing with that model and he's going to do it to other forms of retailing. I mean as long as Amazon's stock price increases and market share increases it's not like Bezos has to mine every transaction for the maximum possible return. The sheer volume of transactions tends to eliminate the risk of putting loss leaders onto Amazon and in theory Amazon could probably run whole divisions of their website at a loss in order to push other retailers to the brink. posted by vuron at 10:48 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] The regressive move away from retail back to a faster mail-order system perplexes me, because it is the exact opposite of instant gratification. In the time it takes the average person to get in a car and drive halfway to a store that might have what they want, I can open the Amazon app on my phone, do a voice search for my desired product, scroll through options, pick what I want, and hit the one-click-to-buy button, knowing that I'll have it in two days without having to think about it any more. That feels a lot like instant gratification to me. posted by Pater Aletheias at 10:50 AM on April 17 [5 favorites] For the young'un out there: Pastabagel's famous explanation of how Sears should have ruled the internet. posted by gwint at 10:53 AM on April 17 [16 favorites] Los Angeles definitely hasn't gotten the memo on dying malls. When our malls get rundown and unpopular, the owners announce 1.5 billion dollar upgrade plans. Sometime we even build a giant mall right next door to an existing giant mall, as the case with the Glendale Galleria/Americana. Even the Burbank IKEA got replaced with a "largest in the US, if not the world" IKEA earlier this year. posted by sideshow at 10:53 AM on April 17 [2 favorites] knowing that I'll have it in two days without having to think about it any more.

Traditional covered malls near me are generally dying (there is one, the super upscale one with the high-end brands, that is doing well), but the new-urbanist typed places and the big box strip malls all seem to be doing fine. I've seen an enclosed mall in my hometown revive itself by converting to an open-air type mall; they kept the anchors but got rid of all the interstitial stores, as far as I could tell--I didn't see a Spencer's Gifts or Lox, Stock and Bagel around, anyway. The last time I was in it when it was enclosed, it was starting to die, but it seems to be doing fine now. The other enclosed mall in town? Not so much. posted by Halloween Jack at 11:25 AM on April 17 re: athletic wear, this too goes along with lower purchasing power. I remember in the aughts it was more diversified and there was definite status attributed to signifiers of certain activities – watersports, skiing, cycling, climbing, backpacking. Hiking and running were kind of in the background. Once the recession hit, within months it seemed like easily half the people I knew had gone from being gym rats discussing where they'd surf that summer and ski that winter, and started training for marathons. In the past few years, running has skyrocketed as THE activity you can talk about with anyone at the office. As someone who's touched on pretty much all the sports, the explanation is easy: running is the cheapest sport.

I'm no expert, but I've always assumed that coal jobs are "good" jobs in that they are higher paying in rural locations. There is also a car industry type effect for all the ancillary businesses supporting machinery, etc. It is not written in stone that retail jobs pay peanuts, so the erosion of unions (see coal too) and the resultant expanding inequality is a big part of the picture in my opinion. posted by idb at 12:01 PM on April 17 As someone who's touched on pretty much all the sports, the explanation is easy: running is the cheapest sport.

And without having to leave my house. Or talk to a person. Some of that is chronic illness and not wanting to spend precious weekend spoons on hiking out somewhere and then trying on a zillion things in more than one store. That entirely wipes me out and takes forever. It's worth it to me to order a couple of sizes of things on Amazon, wait a couple days, try things on at my own pace, and send back (for free!) what I don't like. And I usually end up spending about the same amount and liking the clothes way more, because I don't have to settle for a small selection. posted by fiercecupcake at 12:03 PM on April 17 [6 favorites] running is the cheapest sport.

Not to make everything about emotional labor, but there is a significant emotional labor benefit to having something immediately get checked off your list versus having it scheduled for some future designated "shopping" time. Like, last night was pretty warm in NYC; we just moved into a new apartment and need to buy an A/C; so I woke up after a night of poor sleep and, at 5:30am, ordered an A/C that has good reviews, fits my space requirements, has the features I want, and is in my price range, and it will be here by Wednesday. I crossed things off my list without even getting out of bed. If it turns out its defective, I can print a label from Amazon, throw it back in its box and schedule a UPS pickup; versus schlepping it back to the store, waiting in line, trying to prove it doesn't work, etc. As for clothes, I'm a tall woman with big feet, so I haven't been able to shop in physical stores since I was like 14. Plus, I like to try on clothes with the proper undergarments and the coordinating pieces so I can be sure I'm actually adding something useful to my wardrobe (vs. buying a shirt, oh wait now I need a strapless bra, and this shirt only works with this one pair of pants and that pair of pants only works with heels, but if I wear heels now the shirt looks weird, etc etc). posted by melissasaurus at 12:15 PM on April 17 [9 favorites] America is dead; a photo project. posted by 1970s Antihero at 12:18 PM on April 17 [3 favorites] Not so!

I still order from them online (although I will sometimes pick them up at the shops or return them to the shops) because it's a million times easier and I can afford the occasional interest charge on my credit card during the overlap between purchase and return when it happens. These shops ALWAYS have more inventory available on the website. I remember when Nau opened (before it closed and re-opened as a subsidiary of someone else and became less wonderful) and its shop had basically only a few of anything in stock. You could feel the fabrics and try on one or two things for size, but it was all shipped to your house from the store. I suppose the delayed gratification put lots of people off, but I loved it. It better mimicked the idea of something being for me, instead of the same t-shirt everyone had from every shop. I've never enjoyed shopping as either entertainment or as chore unless it's flipping through catalogs or looking through a lovely photo shoot on a webpage. It more often means that the reality of putting said article of clothing on my body--or actually using said piece of kitchen equipment--is a very significant let down from the fantasy (more so than if I had put it on in a dressing room), but the act of imaging the purchase as part of my life is so much better not experienced in a brick and mortar store. I don't know what that says about the death of malls, or the change in American consumerism, but I'm reminded of a Mefite describing Amazon as the place where they store everything they might ever want or need someday. I guess I basically treat Nordstrom the same way, but occasionally, I have them ship it to my house, so I can drop it back by the store on my lunchbreak when it did not actually fill a need in my life. posted by crush at 12:35 PM on April 17 [1 favorite] Tom Goes to the Mayor is basically about this very problem. posted by Kitty Stardust at 12:36 PM on April 17 [1 favorite] One of the most surprising things about moving to the Triangle is the demographically diverse appeal of a genre of music I had literally never heard of before I got here.

Blockbuster, Tower Records, Sam Goody, Virgin Megastores, National Record Mart, Hollywood Video, Borders Books, J&R, B. Dalton, Movie Gallery, and Media Play have all closed, many in the last decade. I remember my mall having 4 music stores, 3 software/videogame stores, 2 bookstores, and a movie store. Now all that you see in a mall is maybe a GameStop and one Barnes and Noble if you're lucky. This is it for me. Kindle, Chromecast, Google Play, Steam and Netflix have replaced most of the reasons why I'd ever go to a mall. posted by octothorpe at 2:16 PM on April 17 Part of the fixation on coal is because . . . there's something mysterious and ennobling about the dangerous endeavor to extract valuable commodities from deep within the earth, something that's missing from, say, used-car sales or ski-lift operation. I would wager that 99.9\% of it is that coal mining coded extremely masculine and it's done by white men. We talk about coal mining because the decline of coal mining is robbing white men of their right to white-men's work. If coal goes away, they might need to become a nurse, like a woman. Or sell clothes, like a woman or , even worse, a gay man. Or otherwise do something that doesn't count as really work, because not-white-men do it. posted by ROU_Xenophobe at 2:37 PM on April 17 [19 favorites] > Coal mining coded extremely masculine and it's done by white men... the decline of coal mining is robbing white men of their right to white-men's work.

But if this really is a secular decline which is manifesting, I think the impact could be much bigger than just malls closing, or even the job losses in retail, 10% of the workforce though it be. For example: Los Angeles definitely hasn't gotten the memo on dying malls Los Angeles is a car city. Cars and malls are symbiots. Malls don't exist without cars. I read a rather tedious NY Times op-ed about Trump voters the other day, which made one interesting point: the post-2008 economic recovery has not been evenly distributed, pace William Gibson. A much, much higher proportion of the new jobs which are being created are being created in cities, and this was not the case with other recoveries. In a weird and I think unexpected way, the rise of the internet has made urban living much more appealing, because of this basic equation: if the amount of times you need to leave your house to get the shit you need to live drops by say, 2/3rds, then the amount of stores within a given radius of you is also going to drop by some large amount. If the average number of shopping trips per person drops, than in order for a store to survive it's going to need to be at a convenient distance for a much, much larger group of people. Stores are thereby driven toward locating in dense, urban environments. Bookstores are an interesting example of this --- Amazon came for them first, right? But actually, in the past couple of years, not only are physical book sales up, the number of bookstores is also increasing. The chains are struggling, while independents thrive. Chain books stores arose and thrived on the mall-model; it's taking them down too, even as boutiques proliferate. Big picture wise, I mean, why does North America look different from Europe? Because Europe was developed when farmers had to live about a half a day's walk from the nearest village, and a half a day's ride from the nearest market town, and maybe two or three days from the nearest port or regional capital. Between canals, railroads and eventually the car, Americans were able to spread out much more. Because it's probably a universal human truth that people want to live no more than a couple hours from basic necessities, but how far that actually is depends on the means of transport you have available. If most people switch to getting most our goods online, we're still going to have stores, but much fewer of them, and potentially much more highly concentrated. It could profoundly reshape our landscape, just as much as interstate highways themselves did. posted by Diablevert at 3:21 PM on April 17 [7 favorites] it might be a good time to start questioning systemic assumptions like the 40 hour workweek I have a fantasy where I run for president on this one issue. In my stump speech, I'd ask everyone who is able to take Monday or Friday off every week for 4 weeks. "Elect me and that will be the new normal, 3-day weekends for everyone." Once I get that accomplished and a 32-hour work week is the new standard, I'd resign and my wonderfully qualified VP would take over. I've come to the conclusion that automation and AI will make humans irrelevant in the workplace and that it may well happen in my lifetime. A shorter full-time work week is a necessary stepping step in that process (in the less dystopian scenarios anyway). posted by VTX at 3:49 PM on April 17 [1 favorite] Universal Basic Income 2020. posted by Beholder at 4:24 PM on April 17 [1 favorite] > I wonder how much of retail and mall's downfall is the death of physical media.

It used to be that I could walk into any Best Buy in the state (MN) and run into someone I knew. The only time I go into a Best Buy these days is to pick up my online order as they're the best price on some stuff surprisingly often. It still shocks me when I walk in because the floor plan is so dramatically different than what I remember. Most of the middle of the store was devoted to physical media. CDs and DVDs with some space for cameras and phones. There were even about a double handful of isles devoted to software in front of the computer department. I fondly remember working late on the annual inventory night when my now wife and I found a copy of Vamyros Lesbos someone had put in with a bunch of Disney movies. It was a dumb joke made funnier by the fact that we couldn't move it until the next day when the whole inventory process would be over. Then we took our break time to make out in her car. I mean. I met my wife working at Best Buy so as much as I dislike retail for all the same reasons as everyone else, I'm not really comfortable with it's downfall. posted by VTX at 6:03 PM on April 17 [2 favorites] This, combined with a general gentrification trend in cities, means our suburbs are likely just tomorrow's banlieues, a ring of poverty around a gentrified urban core, but with shoddier construction and less transit infrastructure.

I'm all for supporting local business, but when it's $60 full sticker at the book store and $30 shipped at Amazon, well, I can wait for free 2 day shipping to get it here.

Or, you know, Anthropologie. Which (shrug emoji) And then there's Durham and Chapel Hill and Carrboro and Saxapahaw and etc etc.! In all seriousness, North Carolina is better in this regard than South Carolina or Alabama or Arkansas or a lot of other states in the region. Not just aesthetically, but in the number of leftward voters who've been gerrymandered out of representation. The majority of us do not want this transphobic nonsense. And about a quarter of us would probably go in for a good madras short.

If you’re willing to spend a little more, and maybe drive a little farther, you can enjoy the local stuff rather than what’s imported from Mexico or Peru. Several weeks after growers warned that federal trade policies could virtually eliminate Delta asparagus in the future, here are some places you still can find it. And this is by no means an exhaustive list. In the produce section Mexican asparagus is the most common variety found in a dozen Stockton supermarkets surveyed by The Record over the past several days. And it’s cheaper than the local stuff, typically running about $2 per pound. But a few stores around here do carry Delta asparagus — or at least, asparagus labeled as California- or U.S.-grown, though it’s not always entirely clear exactly where it’s coming from. Podesto’s is a sure bet, offering “Delta Queen” asparagus that is clearly labeled as originating from Klein Family Farms, based in Stockton. Yes, you’ll spend more than you would on foreign asparagus — $3.49 per pound, as of last week. Safeway, Walmart and Marina Marketplace all carry asparagus labeled as grown in California or the U.S., though specifics at the produce stands are lacking. The Raley’s on Morada Lane had both U.S. and Mexican asparagus as of late last week. You’ll find Mexican asparagus at Food 4 Less, Grocery Outlet Bargain Market, WinCo Foods, Smart & Final, Trader Joe’s, Save Mart and Rancho San Miguel. Straight to the source If grocery store labeling frustrates you, the closest you can get to asparagus straight from the field is to drive the 17 miles from Stockton to the Kings Crown packing shed, in Delta no-man’s-land at Tracy Boulevard and Clifton Court Road. The shed, owned by local asparagus farmers, is where the spears are taken to be cleaned, processed and packaged for shipment. But they sell directly to the public, too. A 3-pound bag costs $10, and a 9-pound bag costs $30, which is roughly comparable to what you’d pay at the grocery store. The shed is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It’s expected to remain open at least through Mother’s Day. “It’s cut every day,” farmer Joe Ratto said. “It’s fresh as it can be.” There’s always farmers markets, too. You should be able to find local asparagus at both the Stockton and San Joaquin certified farmers markets. Asparagus grower Roscoe Zuckerman also supplies Bay Area farmers markets from San Rafael to Los Gatos. Dining out Some Stockton restaurants still use local asparagus, though it’s getting harder and harder to find. Andy Pappas, owner at Papapavlo’s Bistro & Bar at Lincoln Center, said the restaurant still uses Delta asparagus as a side course and in soup. And you might find deep-fried asparagus there on occasion. Local asparagus “has a deep flavor that’s hard to beat, and we like supporting the local farmers,” Pappas said. Market Tavern features Delta asparagus, as does Midgley’s Public House, where you can even get an asparagus cigar (asparagus and cream cheese, in an egg roll wrapper with sweet chili sauce, according to the menu). San Joaquin Asparagus Festival If all else fails, you can still find Delta asparagus at the festival held in its honor, which takes place this weekend at the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds. Between 400 and 500 11-pound boxes will be available for sale at the festival, with 740 additional boxes used for cooking deep-friend asparagus and other goodies, said Ratto, the farmer. He had some good news to share on Monday: Delta growers have resumed harvesting asparagus. They had to stop several weeks ago due to very low prices for Mexican asparagus, but now the prices down south have rebounded, which puts Delta growers back in the ballgame. They still are deeply concerned about the future. The packing shed has produced 40,000 fewer boxes of asparagus than last year. Based on the phone calls they’ve received lately, however, it sure sounds like some Stocktonians are willing to pay more — and drive a little farther — for their asparagus fix. Said Ratto: “And that’s wonderful.” — Contact reporter Alex Breitler at (209) 546-8295 or abreitler@recordnet.com. Follow him at recordnet.com/breitlerblog and on Twitter @alexbreitler.

Christi Brown created the FlexEhoop, which has been on Walmart's website for about two weeks. She has also been a single mother since 2011. Brown created her product with some help after not having a lot of time to exercise and not liking any of the weighted hula hoops. “A lot of people have donated their time," said Brown. "I had a photographer donate her time for my product shots. It’s been wonderful how the community has come together to just help each other out.” She said being a single mother is a 24-hour job and can be tough at times. While working on entering the business world, Brown explained she lost the balance between entrepreneur and mother. “Cause at one point, I really felt like I was on a train that had suddenly dropped me off and I was holding on it and it was just out of control," Brown said. "It was just on its own path and I couldn’t catch up to it fast enough.” She eventually caught up to that train and now has her son involved with some of her business endeavors. At times, Brown said she wanted to give up on taking care of herself and was tired of living paycheck to paycheck. She said the idea of getting married was enticing just to have someone else to take care of her. Her advice to other single mothers is to not give in to those desires. Brown said those times will pass and any dream a person has is achievable no matter the situation. “If you don’t just do it and just step out there and make it happen no matter how uncomfortable you are, you’ll just stay in your little box," Brown said. "You won’t do it because you will be too terrified. All I can say is if I can do it then anybody can do it.” Brown hopes one day her product will be in schools for children to use even if for just a few minutes a day. She said she has also been talking with local chiropractors and physical therapists who she said are interested in using her product with patients.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Now, at the East Vancouver location on Hastings Street near Slocan, customers can pick from a newly added selection of more than 750 fresh food items — from chicken drumsticks and aged parmesan cheese to organic apples and cups of fresh berries.  It’s the first such store in B.C. for Shoppers, which has opened similar “enhanced convenience food sections” at 33 locations in the Toronto area and a few in Regina. It’ll open another one later this year on Cambie Road in Richmond and another eight smaller “grab and go” versions on West and East Broadway, Main, Granville and Homer streets in Vancouver.  Shoppers has chosen these outlets because of their “density, urban location and demographics,” and because they’re located where there currently isn’t a fresh food grocery option, said senior vice-president of merchandising Chong Bang. It’s part of a wider trend by large retail chains in North America — such as Target, Walgreens and Wal-Mart — to move into urban neighbourhoods, where analysts and executives see that consumers prefer to pick up groceries in smaller stores within walking distance of where they live. “I think that it’s a good distinction to make that we are not going to be a destination shop. People will still go to the grocery store. It’s more ‘hey, what can I make for dinner?’ and they pick up a pasta, a sauce and some protein, and mix and match,” said Bang at the East Hastings store, pointing out packs of ready-made soups and mixes, alongside packs of cooked sirloin steak and turkey breast strips.  Shoppers was bought in 2014 by Brampton, Ont.-based supermarket giant Loblaws Companies Ltd., which had previously purchased Richmond-based Asian grocer T&T Supermarket in 2009. It means Shoppers can offer a wide range of produce from Loblaws’ brands in its grocery locations, including President’s Choice and T&T’s popular Asian goods, from mini-almond cookies to pork dumplings. So while customers shouldn’t expect the vast range of services found at Walgreens’ U.S. “superstore” locations, where they can be wooed with baristas, juice bars and dedicated sushi chefs, they can pick up fresh T&T sushi made daily — an option that has already been very popular, according to Bang. Drug store chains and big-box retailers offering fresh food have generally aimed to compete with conventional rather than discount supermarkets on pricing. They also try to draw in customers with one-time specials and seasonal discounts on specific items, and Bang confirmed this will be the case at Shoppers. jlee-young@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo.

Listen Listening... / Listen to the Story Kevin Butt's job is to find cleaner ways to power Toyota. One of the hardest places to do that is at the automaker's sprawling plant in central Kentucky, a state where nearly 90 percent of electricity still comes from coal. Butt points out a new engine assembly line, where a conveyor belt moves in a slow circle. He says it was specially designed with a more efficient motor. There are also enormous fans overhead and LED lights, all changes that save millions. "I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill," he says. That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But a few years ago, Toyota decided that by 2050 all of its operations, all around the world, should be zero-carbon. It's part of a larger business shift. In Kentucky, General Motors, Ford, Walmart, L'Oreal and others also have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are starting to look at renewables. "There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do," Butt says. That's true globally, he says, and it's especially true in Kentucky, where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. "We're a coal state, we're proud to be a coal state, we're sentimental about our attachment to coal," says Charles Snavely, secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, Snavely spent 35 years in the coal industry. His office is now working with companies — he calls them customers — to help develop renewable energy. But Snavely says he struggles with whether "the growth of renewables [comes] at the expense of coal. Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie?" Kentucky, unlike many other states, has no mandate to require a certain share of renewable energy. The state joined two dozen others in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, which would have shuttered hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Snavely says coal built his state's economy, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. "We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates," he says. President Trump's order to start dismantling the climate regulation was a victory for Kentucky. And yet, it may not do much to stop the steady decline of coal. "The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables," says Jim Gardner, who used to regulate power companies as a member of Kentucky's Public Service Commission. Two years ago, Gardner was struck by an encounter with a local man who worked remotely for Facebook. He told Gardner that big corporations were actually deciding where to expand based on where they could get renewable energy. "He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in," says Gardner, "so that Facebook and others were not looking because [some states] were not going to be open to renewables." The Public Service Commission worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement — "a clear signal to people outside of the state," says Gardner — that if a big customer wanted renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities could cut a special deal to provide it. That gave utilities permission to offer renewable energy. But they still face challenges to produce it. The state's cheap coal makes it harder for renewables to compete, and to see a return on investment. What's more, Kenya Stump, of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, says Kentucky has only moderate potential for solar power, and not much at all for wind. She says hydro power holds the most promise. Stump is working with companies that want to develop renewable power, but she doesn't foresee a major spike anytime soon. "Right now renewables are starting to compete on costs, but not reliability," she says. But she adds that once battery technology develops and solar or wind power can be stored, "all bets are off." Kentucky's utilities are also highly regulated. An energy activist says he's been heartened by a shift in the state's attitude, but thinks officials could do a lot more to encourage renewables. "The sun in Kentucky is as strong as it is in North Carolina and Ohio and New York, where the solar industry is employing tens of thousands of people," says Andy McDonald of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. "Kentucky is not limited by our resources; it's limited by our policies." None of those challenges is stopping a slow transition. "This tract is about 60 acres," says David Crews, standing in a freshly mowed field where East Kentucky Power Cooperative is about to install 32,000 solar panels. It will be one of the state's first utility-scale solar farms, and it's there by popular demand — from businesses. Crews says some companies don't mind paying a bit more to meet their sustainability goals. East Kentucky Power has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president doesn't want to limit carbon emissions, doesn't mean the next one won't. "The seesawing of regulations when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy," he says. "And that wouldn't be good for our customer base." The utility is marketing its new solar farm, and if demand is strong enough Crews says it will add more panels. At Toyota's plant in central Kentucky, Kevin Butt envisions installing solar panels on the roof. The company is also researching fuel cell technology, seeking the breakthrough that could help it eliminate carbon emissions. But for now, he's getting creative about finding renewable energy where he can. He drives me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill, and here and there, things stick up. "The black tube coming out," he says pointing, "it's a methane capture well." The methane is released as the trash rots. When it goes into the air, methane is a dirty greenhouse gas, but last year Toyota set up a generator here to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line, straight to the Toyota plant 6 miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. "They either have to put it in their system," Butt says, "or people will be looking at alternate ways to get that energy in a renewable form." Copyright 2017 NPR.

Schultze/WKSU hide caption toggle caption M.L. Schultze/WKSU Shelia Mendoza says she's not looking for a livelihood out of Liberty Mobility, but a little extra cash and some new friends to talk to. M.L. Schultze/WKSU It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking. The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library. Code Switch How Driverless Vehicles Could Harm Professional Drivers Of Color It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake. Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Her job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs. "The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " she says. So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado. All Tech Considered Pittsburgh Offers Driving Lessons For Uber's Autonomous Cars Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. She created Liberty as a business, but she talks about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door. "We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says. One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, she says, is to be a grandma. Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, she was one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained. The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships. All Tech Considered In China, As In The U.S., The Fight Over Ride Hailing Is Local For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with her first customer who'd lost his license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until he could get his license back. "I always had him there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before he would go to work. Once in a while he paid for mine." Since he regained his license, things have slowed down for Mendoza. "I was happy he got his car, I was happy he got his license. He's a better person for that because I know he hated getting hauled around by an old lady," she says and laughs. She's hoping business will pick up, and her hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app. The Two-Way Google Spinoff Sues Uber, Saying Leader Of Autonomous Vehicle Unit Stole Key Designs "I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want nothing like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " she says. Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community. "The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot." Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies. Around the Nation Rural Trump Voters Embrace The Sacrifices That Come With Support Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit. Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area. "I like that the drivers are from the communities," she says. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here." Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America. M.L. Schultze is a reporter with NPR member station WKSU.

Every weekday, we bring you the Ad Age/iSpot Hot Spots, new and trending TV commercials tracked by iSpot.tv, the real-time TV ad measurement company with attention analytics from 10 million smart TVs. The New Releases here ran on TV for the first time over the weekend. The Most Engaging ads are ranked by digital activity (including online views and social shares) over the past week. Among the new releases, Walmart calls attention to its charitable efforts by showing cheerful volunteers working at food banks followed by an on-screen message that reads "When you buy select items at Walmart, you help secure a meal for someone in need." Lincoln introduces "complimentary pickup and delivery servicing -- because the most important luxury of all is time." And VW shows a couple sneaking onto a racehorse at a race track to convey the charms of turbo mode on the Passat: "That feeling. Only better." (We didn't notice the usual on-screen, small-type "Do not attempt" disclaimer, so now we want to attempt to commandeer a racehorse.)

"The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot." Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies.

One of the hardest places to do that is at the automaker's sprawling plant in central Kentucky, a state where nearly 90 percent of energy still comes from coal. Butt points out a new engine assembly line, where a conveyor belt moves in a slow circle. He says it was specially designed with a more efficient motor. There are also enormous fans overhead and LED lights, all changes that save millions. "I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill," he says. That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But a few years ago, Toyota decided that by 2050 all of its operations, all around the world, should be zero-carbon. It's part of a larger business shift. In Kentucky, General Motors, Ford, Walmart, L'Oreal and others also have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are starting to look at renewables. "There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do," Butt says. That's true globally, he says, and it's especially true in Kentucky, where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. "We're a coal state, we're proud to be a coal state, we're sentimental about our attachment to coal," says Charles Snavely, secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, Snavely spent 35 years in the coal industry. His office is now working with companies — he calls them customers — to help develop renewable energy. But Snavely says he struggles with whether "the growth of renewables [comes] at the expense of coal. Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie?" Kentucky, unlike many other states, has no mandate to require a certain share of renewable energy. The state joined two dozen others in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, which would have shuttered hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Snavely says coal built his state's economy, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. "We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates," he says. President Trump's order to start dismantling the climate regulation was a victory for Kentucky. And yet, it may not do much to stop the steady decline of coal. "The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables," says Jim Gardner, who used to regulate power companies as a member of Kentucky's Public Service Commission. Two years ago, Gardner was struck by an encounter with a local man who worked remotely for Facebook. He told Gardner that big corporations were actually deciding where to expand based on where they could get renewable energy. "He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in," says Gardner, "so that Facebook and others were not looking because [some states] were not going to be open to renewables." The Public Service Commission worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement — "a clear signal to people outside of the state," says Gardner — that if a big customer wanted renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities could cut a special deal to provide it. That gave utilities permission to offer renewable energy. But they still face challenges to produce it. The state's cheap coal makes it harder for renewables to compete, and to see a return on investment. What's more, Kenya Stump, of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, says Kentucky has only moderate potential for solar power, and not much at all for wind. She says hydro power holds the most promise. Stump is working with companies that want to develop renewable power, but she doesn't foresee a major spike anytime soon. "Right now renewables are starting to compete on costs, but not reliability," she says. But she adds that once battery technology develops and solar or wind power can be stored, "all bets are off." Kentucky's utilities are also highly regulated. An energy activist says he's been heartened by a shift in the state's attitude, but thinks officials could do a lot more to encourage renewables. "The sun in Kentucky is as strong as it is in North Carolina and Ohio and New York, where the solar industry is employing tens of thousands of people," says Andy McDonald of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. "Kentucky is not limited by our resources; it's limited by our policies." None of those challenges is stopping a slow transition. "This tract is about 60 acres," says David Crews, standing in a freshly mowed field where East Kentucky Power Cooperative is about to install 32,000 solar panels. It will be one of the state's first utility-scale solar farms, and it's there by popular demand — from businesses. Crews says some companies don't mind paying a bit more to meet their sustainability goals. East Kentucky Power has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president doesn't want to limit carbon emissions, doesn't mean the next one won't. "The seesawing of regulations when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy," he says. "And that wouldn't be good for our customer base." The utility is marketing its new solar farm, and if demand is strong enough Crews says it will add more panels. At Toyota's plant in central Kentucky, Kevin Butt envisions installing solar panels on the roof. The company is also researching fuel cell technology, seeking the breakthrough that could help it eliminate carbon emissions. But for now, he's getting creative about finding renewable energy where he can. He drives me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill, and here and there, things stick up. "The black tube coming out," he says pointing, "it's a methane capture well." The methane is released as the trash rots. When it goes into the air, methane is a dirty greenhouse gas, but last year Toyota set up a generator here to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line, straight to the Toyota plant 6 miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. "They either have to put it in their system," Butt says, "or people will be looking at alternate ways to get that energy in a renewable form." Copyright 2017 NPR.

On April 15, 2017, Baker District deputies were dispatched to two vehicle break-in calls on Brookwood Road, Lincolnton. In one break-in items in the vehicle had been moved around but nothing appeared to be taken. In the second reported vehicle break-in, the victim told officers that her purse, which contained a .380 caliber handgun, credit cards, and identification, had been stolen from her unlocked vehicle overnight on April 14, 2017 and discovered the next morning. The credit card company called the victim to inquire about a number of purchases that had been made overnight and that alerted the victim to the break-in. Deputies viewed surveillance video at Walmart in Lincolnton where purchases were made with one of the stolen credit cards. Using information from the video, officers were able to identify one of the suspects. That led to a residence on Ginger Lane where a search warrant was executed. Baker District deputies located items purchased at Walmart with the stolen credit card and some of the belongings of the victim. The handgun was located near a bridge on four-lane Highway 16 near Highway 150. Charged during the investigation were: Cameron Dweayne Jordan, 22, of Charlotte, NC is charged with one felony count each of Conspiracy, Obtaining Property by False Pretenses, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Larceny of a Firearm, and Breaking and Entering a Vehicle. He is also charged with misdemeanor Conspiracy, Possession of Stolen Goods, and Larceny. Bond for Jordan was set at $41,000 secured. Brian Hady Karimian, 18, of Sherrills Ford, NC was charged with two felony counts each of Obtaining Property by False Pretenses and Aiding and Abetting a Felony. He is charged with one felony count each of Conspiracy and Possession of a Stolen Firearm. He is also charged with one misdemeanor count of Conspiracy. His bond was also set at $41,000 secured. Melvin Patrick McCullah, Jr., 21, of Ginger Lane, Maiden, NC was charged with one misdemeanor count of Possession of Stolen Goods and released on a $2,500 secured bond. Jordan and Karimian will also be charged with two additional vehicle break-ins on Brookwood Road.

Barry Eichengreen The renminbi is now fairly valued, and China has been intervening to support the exchange rate. Photo: AP Donald Trump’s comments about China during the US presidential campaign didn’t exactly bolster high hopes for Sino-American relations once he was elected. Trump denounced China for “taking our jobs”, and “(stealing) hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property”. He repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency. The low point came last May, when Trump warned his followers: “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country. That’s what they’re doing. It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world.” Given such inflammatory rhetoric, many people understandably felt considerable trepidation in the run-up to Trump’s summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. It wasn’t hard to imagine a refused handshake or the presentation of a bill for payment, like the one Trump reportedly gave visiting German chancellor Angela Merkel (a report denied by the White House). Instead, Trump treated Xi with considerable deference. One explanation is that he was preoccupied by the impending US missile strike on Syria. Another is that it is easier to command Trump’s respect when you have an aircraft carrier, 3,000 military planes, and 1.6 million ground troops. But the best explanation is surely that the US depends too heavily on China, economically and politically, for even a president as diplomatically reckless as Trump to spark a conflict. Economically, the US and China are too closely interlinked through global supply chains to be able to cut ties. US companies not only compete with Chinese imports; they also rely heavily on them. Retailers like Target and Walmart rely on Chinese imports to stock their shelves. Electronics companies like Apple rely on workers in China to assemble their products. And the idea that the US could easily source the same inputs from other countries is fanciful. Put simply, while Trump has repeatedly observed that China sells more to the US than the US sells to China, starting a trade war in an effort to correct this supposed imbalance would still cost American business very dearly. And if there is one constituency that Trump listens to consistently, it is business. Aggressive US trade sanctions against China would send equity prices plunging, alarming a US president who measures his economic policy success by the level of the stock market. The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff didn’t cause the Great Crash, much less the Great Depression. But that tariff and the foreign retaliation it elicited sent the stock market down still further, which was hardly helpful. Politically, too, the US cannot afford serious conflict with China, given the growing crisis on the Korean Peninsula, which North Korean provocations and Trump’s incautious reaction have brought to the fore. Posturing aside, Trump will be forced to recognize that military force is not an option. A surgical strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities would most likely not succeed, while a massive attack would provoke devastating retaliation against South Korea. The only feasible strategy is tighter sanctions and political pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. And the only party capable of tightening sanctions and applying effective political pressure is China, whose goodwill the US now regards as essential. Trump’s about-face on China is of a piece with his “recalibration” on repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, organizing a large-scale infrastructure-investment initiative, and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In each case, his glib campaign slogans have run up against the hard reality of actually making policy. In all these areas, Trump is learning that he is hemmed in by the same constraints that led Barack Obama’s administration to make the choices it did. As with Obama, the agent of change is turning out to be an agent of continuity. The US has some legitimate economic grievances against China—for example, over its treatment of American intellectual property and US beef and grain exports. But the appropriate venue for adjudicating such disputes is the World Trade Organization. That is where Trump’s administration, like Obama’s, is likely to end up. The Trump administration could yet label China a currency manipulator, rebuking it for keeping its exchange rate artificially low. It could do so either now or later in the year. But that accusation would be contrary to the facts: The renminbi is now fairly valued, and China has actually been intervening to support the exchange rate, not weaken it further. Inside the Washington, DC beltway, however, facts are no longer what they once were. Singling out China for manipulation might still appeal to a president who values symbolism as much as Trump does. But little of consequence would follow. The US depends too much on Chinese cooperation to risk overly antagonizing China’s leaders. Labelling China a currency manipulator would be the economic-policy equivalent of launching 59 cruise missiles at an isolated air base in Syria. It would be much sound and fury, signifying nothing. ©2017/PROJECT SYNDICATE Barry Eichengreen is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Cambridge.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Partnerships that government officials and roboticists said they hope will move the United States to the forefront of robotic manufacturing started to form Wednesday in Pittsburgh. More than 200 representatives of U.S. companies and universities met at the National Robotics Engineering Center in Lawrenceville for the first major meetings of the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute, known as ARM. Representatives from mammoth companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Amazon and Wal-Mart sat next to the founders and CEOs of Pittsburgh robotic startups such as IAM Robotics and RE2 Robotics and staff from top universities and community colleges. “You're all prospective members of ARM,” Gary Fedder, the institute's interim CEO, said Wednesday at the start of two days of recruitment and planning activities. The institute is the latest of 14 such centers across the United States meant to advance domestic manufacturing. It will run on $80 million in federal money for the next five years plus an expected $173 million in funding and in-kind contributions from companies and universities. The Department of Defense announced in January that it would base its advanced robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Fedder said the institute is hiring staff and will start bringing on members in the next two weeks. “This is a wonderful opportunity that we have in front of us,” said Howie Choset, the institute's chief technology officer and a professor in Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute who worked on the university's petition for the institute. “We're all just happy and excited to get started.” Greg Hudas, a Department of Defense employee who is the project manager of the 14 manufacturing institutes, said work at the robotics institute will help the United States catch up to China, Germany, Japan and other countries that have outpaced America in manufacturing. Catching up through robotics will bring manufacturing jobs back to America, Hudas said, and could create more jobs than are replaced by automation. Hudas said the institute will focus on innovations in the automotive industry, textiles, electronics and the medical field. Programs from the institute could start at the end of the summer, Hudas said. Those early efforts will include education programs at the K-12 and college levels and training and retraining opportunities at community colleges, universities and tech schools. Hudas said to expect to see robots in small businesses. “We feel the time is right for this technology to actually increase jobs,” Hudas said. “We're No. 1 in the world when it comes to innovation and technology. We need to be No. 1 again in manufacturing.” Aaron Aupperlee is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach Aupperlee at aaupperlee@tribweb.com or 412-336-8448.

If you like to make pizza too, you need a good pizza cutter. Sure you could go down to Walmart and get a plain pizza wheel for a few bucks, but why get a crappy one when you can get a Star Wars one? The R2-D2 Pizza Cutter starts out with the standard spinning blade of pizza cutting. The handle is where the cool stuff is. It looks like R2, and has a cutout for a speaker in the base. That speaker makes R2-D2 boops and beeps as you slice up your pie. Sadly electronics in the handle mean you can’t just toss it in the dishwasher, and you need to handwash it. You can grab yours over at ThinkGeek for just $9.99(USD).

Police determined she had lured the boys from their homes with candy and promises of more treats. Castle Kameron Gately, 23 The Dallas Morning News reports arrest warrant affidavits show Castle Kameron Gately promised the boys who’d been playing outside their apartment complex that she’d buy them whatever they wanted if they went with her.

Download the Roar TV app: I have been vocal in my criticism of Arsenal manager Arsene over the last few months and still believe that there is a desperate need for a change of manager. However, there is also a larger an much more immovable problem at the club. That problem is Arsenal’s billionaire owner Stan Kroenke. Kroenke made his fortune in real estate, benefiting greatly from his marriage to Ann Walton – the heiress to the WalMart fortune. Since the mid nineties Kroenke has invested millions in sports teams in America as part of the Kroenke Sports and Entertainment Group. As well as Arsenal, Kroenke owns NFL team the Los Angeles Rams, MLS franchise Colorado Rapids and Lacrosse team the Colorado Mammoths. In addition to owning these teams he has controlling stakes in the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche of the NBA and NHL respectively. To understand why Kroenke is such a damaging influence on Arsenal it is important to explore the fortunes of the other teams he has dominion over. St Louis/ Los Angeles Rams Kroenke first bought a stake in the Rams in 1995 and became the team’s full owner in 2010. While the turn of the millennium was a successful time for the Rams – winning a Super Bowl in 2000 and returning to the big game in 2002 – since then it has been a dire time to support the Rams. In the years since their two Super Bowl appearances, the Rams have made just two playoff appearances and won a single postseason game. Their last taste of success came in 2004 and since then they have failed to post a single winning season. The years since Kroenke took full ownership have been particularly bleak with the Rams becoming a laughing stock as they consistently post an underwhelming record. Sounding familiar Arsenal fans? The final blow was dealt in 2015 when it became apparent the current season would be the team’s last in St Louis. Kroenke had decided to move the team to Los Angeles as the draw of a more lucrative market was too powerful, leaving thousands of loyal fans without a team. Kroenke’s eventual relocation of the Rams perfectly demonstrates how he values profit over team success or the needs of fans. It does not bode well for Arsenal. Denver Nuggets Kroenke Sports and Entertainment took over the Nuggets in 2000 and although the NBA franchise is technically in his wife’s name, Kroenke’s fingerprints are all over the club. He inherited a struggling franchise who were rebuilding after a period of modest success in the mid nineties. In 2003 the Nuggets hit the jackpot when they drafted Carmelo Anthony with the with the third pick in the NBA draft. Anthony was an immediate success and lead the Nuggets to seven straight playoff appearances, although in all but one of those appearances the Nuggets were defeated in the first round. Sounds like Arsenal in the Champions league doesn’t it? Despite the stellar play of Anthony, the Nuggets failed to surround him with enough talent to make a serious run at an NBA title, with ownership happy to milk the increased revenue of playoff basketball without breaking the bank salary wise. Eventually Carmelo got sick of Denver and demanded a trade leaving the Nuggets in another period of rebuilding. They have a young and talented core but it remains to be seen if Kroenke invests in the team sufficiently for them to succeed. For Arsenal fans there are eerie similarities to draw between the departure of Carmelo Anthony and the cavalcade of stars who left the club between 2011 and 2012. Colorado Avalanche I will admit that I don’t know anything about ice hockey so it is harder for me to judge Kroenke’s ownership of the team. The Avalanche won the Stanley Cup the year after Kroenke took over in 2000 but it is hard to imagine he had much to do with that if anything. The foundations of that team would have been built before Kroenke took over. Looking through the season by season records the Avalanche seem to be doing OK – making the playoffs reasonably consistently without threatening to win it all. However, there have been accusations flying around that the Kroenkes – Josh (Stan’s son) is the chairman – have been absent owners of late focusing their time and energy into moving the Rams to LA. During this period they seem to have put all the hockey decisions in the hands of GM Joe Sakic. Sakic is a franchise legend who played his entire 21 year NHL career with the Avalanche and Quebec Nordiques (where the franchise was based before it moved to Denver). However, recently his decision making has been questioned by fans who feel it may be time to change. Sounds very familiar doesn’t it? Club legend left in complete control of team operations with little or no input from board level. Granted the situation hasn’t been raging on for as long as at Arsenal but there are definite similarities to be drawn. Colorado Rapids Kroenke purchased the MLS franchise in 2004 and in 2007 moved the stadium out of Denver to the suitably named suburb Commerce City. Could there be a more perfect destination for a team owned by silent Stan. It’s not been all bad for the Rapids since Kroenke took over winning the MLS cup in 2010. However ,that has been the only taste of success. More often than not the Rapids have failed to qualify for the playoffs and have been mired in mid table mediocrity. When you look at all the sports teams Kroenke owns together it paints a very clear picture of an owner who is interested in only one thing – money, money, money. Not a single one of his franchises have been associated with winning during his tenure and Arsenal have been exactly the same. It seems slightly unfair that much of the fury is directed at Wenger as he is the public figurehead, while Kroenke remains behind the scenes with his fortune increasing by the day. It is time for Wenger to go but Kroenke is the root of the problem. Wenger’s prolonged period in charge is merely a consequence of his ownership, Want to work for The Roar?

Report Being a Coloradan i know all to much about your Kroenke debacle. The Colorado Avalanche are my favorite team in all of sports yet seem to not give a flying fuck about on ice production. He brought in Sakic and Roy to bring back the older generation of fans that were pushed out by the shitty on ice display every year, not to make the team better. Hopefully while Kroenke is out in LA making sure they have enough hot dogs to go around, Sakic can use his power to better the team, but sadly Sakic has no clue what he is doing as a GM and we have the worst record in the NHL since 2000 to show for it. Kreonke cares more about selling hot dogs and nachos than he does of his teams records. Its unfortunate because just about every pro franchise in Colorado is owned by the Kroenke family. Josh Kroenke is no better either, hes a spoiled little kid that couldn’t even make the college basketball team so he had his mommy pay for him to sit the pine. Fact of the matter is, if he remains the owner for all these franchise, arsenal included, there is no way these teams are winning anything unless some magical season happens, which i’ve been hoping for, for a long, long time and nothing seems to change.

Reply April 18th 2017 @ 8:44am joe said | April 18th 2017 @ 8:44am | ! Report All owners (particularly in the NFL) #1 priority is making money.Its a business, an investment (often subsidized by taxpayers) that they want maximum return on. The fans have this belief the owner(s) care as much about winning as they do.They don’t.It is quite often more lucrative to lose than it is to win,especially in the MLB where some teams outlay $50 million for teams payroll the whole season.The team isn’t going to win anything but the owner COULD go out & spend another $100++ million on a handful of high price free agents & maybe the team wins it all,but probably not.So why not pocket the money for yourself.? Im not saying its right or wrong but thats the reality.The NFL recently implemented a minimum salary spending limit where owners have to spend 90% of the cap amount in each NFL season because certain owners where just outlaying as little as possible to keep money in their pocket.Why spend $150 million to go 9-7 maybe you do it on the cheap for $90 million & go 7-9.Who cares you aren’t winning the SuperBowl either way but you save yourself $60 million in salary payments. Owners & most players have a far bigger interest in making maximum dollars.Winning is a nice bonus but its definitely not the #1 priority. Reply April 18th 2017 @ 10:26am Super-Human said | April 18th 2017 @ 10:26am | ! Report As a past nuggets fan and still an Arsenal fan… I hate the guy. But actually Nuggets did have some pretty good players with Melo in his time there, they were past their prime. It was just unfortunate. The coaching was mediocre as well. Poor management lost the stars and gained none – Maybe that was Stan the sell on man. Melo’s biggest problem was himself anyway. A lazy type of character. Reply April 18th 2017 @ 12:27pm joe said | April 18th 2017 @ 12:27pm | ! Report The Nuggets letting Carmelo Anthony walk was actually a smart move.He was always a malcontent.And look at how effective he has been since he left.I think he has led the Knicks to two playoffs in 5 seasons in NY, and the Eastern Conference from 2012 to 2016 was extremely weak.To not even make it as an 8 seed in that conference shows how ineffective a player you are Reply Have Your Say Click here to cancel reply.

It happened about 2:20 a.m. Saturday on Hermitage Road near the restaurant's location there, which is just off Chenal Parkway. The 20-year-old victim told investigators he was walking west from his workplace toward Wal-Mart when a tan, four-door Honda pulled up and the driver asked for a cigarette, according to a Little Rock Police Department report. The victim reportedly gave the man a cigarette and then, after being asked, told him he was a waiter at IHOP. "The driver then stated, 'Oh, so you got that money,'" the report said, noting the driver then pulled out a gun and demanded "everything" the victim had. The car fled west on Hermitage after the victim handed over his cash, the report said. The robber was described as a black man who stood about 5-foot-10 and weighed around 235 pounds. He was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. Two other people were also in the vehicle, though the report listed a detailed description for only one of them: a black man who stood about 5 foot 8 and weighed 160 pounds. He was said to be wearing a white T-shirt and black pants and to have very few teeth, according to the report. No arrests had been made at the time of the report.

April 17, 2017 at 2:34 p.m. Hey titleist and NutButter - Yes and yes, but when you make it all about race you are no different that the race-baiting Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. The fact that blacks commit a disproportionate number of crimes has little to do with race and everything to do with culture. ( permalink | suggest removal ) titleist10 says...

( permalink | suggest removal ) 3WorldState1 says... April 17, 2017 at 4:23 p.m. What's in the white mans culture to make them represent a disproportionate amount of child rape and child pornography from this newspaper?

April 17, 2017 at 4:42 p.m. Hey 3rdWorld - Do you have any data to back up your claim? I think you are full of sh*t. Be sure and provide the data on a relative basis. For example, if black men make up 10% of the state's population and their piece of the child rape and child porn pie is 10%, nothing is disproportional. And if you have no data, S. T. F. U.

He cites statistics showing that job increases occurred simultaneously with an increase in the minimum wage. This is about as credible as the rooster claiming that the sun rises because he crows. Just because two events occur simultaneously doesn’t mean that one causes the other. To further his case, he uses the restaurant industry as an example for how employers can cope with a rise in the minimum wage by shifting income from tips to wages without impacting the cost to customers. The restaurant industry is one of the few, or maybe the only industry that can employ such a mechanism. This mechanism might work for high-end restaurants such as Anthony’s, although some of their staff would see an income reduction because loss of tips would more than offset the increase in their wages. It might be great for employees of Denny’s, provided they get to keep their jobs, because Denny’s would still be forced to raise prices, which would result in loss of business and a corresponding loss in jobs — this is Economics 101. Walmart, MacDonald’s and most other low-wage companies will ultimately be forced to raise prices to cover the extra cost of wages. The patrons of these companies tend to be low-income, so they will bear most of the cost of the higher minimum wage along with those that lose their jobs at those companies. Companies will also find other ways to cope, such as increasing automation to eliminate jobs. McDonald’s has already announced that they will install self-order kiosks in all of their U.S. stores. There has also been a robot developed that can flip burgers and place them on buns. Self-order kiosks are already widespread in some European countries with high wages. Not coincidentally, the youth unemployment rate is 20 percent to 30 precent in those countries. One tragic consequence of high minimum wages is that people who are not worth that wage, such as people with disabilities or people with Down syndrome will be denied employment. They will not only lose their income, but also the structure, satisfaction and social contact that a job provides. The bottom line is that companies will not employ someone unless that person can provide more value to the company than the cost of his or her employment. There are better mechanisms to help low-income families than increasing the minimum wage, such as the Earned Income Credit (EIC), which is basically a negative income tax. The EIC gives nothing to the 18-year-old high school dropout who works at McDonald’s and lives with his parents. However, for a single mom with two children earning the current minimum wage, the EIC is about $5,000. She also gets an additional child tax credit of $2,000. Mr. Burbank’s hypothesis looks valid in the current environment where the economy is booming and wages are rising because of a shortage of workers, but it will fall apart fast when the next recession occurs and the high unemployment rate will be exacerbated by the higher legislated minimum wage.

The award is given to electric companies that provide superior service to national, multi-site energy customers. Avista was one of only eight recipients chosen by customers in a nationwide open-ballet process. Ann Carey, Avista national account executive, accepted the award on behalf of the company.   Over 700 companies, encompassing a variety of industries—including national brands such as Microsoft, Walmart, Staples, Marriott Hotels and Costco—were eligible to nominate and vote for utilities that go “above and beyond their expectations.” They were then asked to rate those selected companies on important traits, including innovative offerings, ease of incentive programs, and appropriate communications and customer support before, during, and after outages. Most of the voting companies are in at least 48 states and work with hundreds of different utilities. “To be one of the few utilities in the country receiving this award is a real honor,” said Dennis Vermillion, president of Avista Utilities, “and an acknowledgment of the incredible service our employees provide to our customers.”  Visit avistautilities.com to learn more about Avista.

The Wall Street Journal, citing data from logistics staffing firm ProLogistix, reported that starting pay for those employees climbed to $12.15 per hour in February, a 6 percent increase compared to February 2016 and more than double the average wage increase in the U.S. over that span. Retail giants — including Amazon and Walmart — hope to capitalize on the boom in e-commerce by rapidly building and leasing the distribution facilities needed to quickly ship items to customers. Although automation systems in new warehouses tend to suppress the job gains ordinarily seen in the past, the paper noted that attracting new workers is nonetheless difficult since the country remains at essentially full employment. Warehouse positions are generally low-paid and high-turnover — with little training or education required — but companies are reportedly offering everything from bonuses, pay raises and flexible scheduling to gift cards or employee events in order to prevent poaching. E-commerce warehouses are significantly larger than conventional warehouses, and even modest pay increases can dramatically increase retailers' labor costs. "A guy who makes $10 an hour, you offer $10.25, he’s going to leave,” Allegiance Staffing president Tom Landry told the Journal. "That's another tank of gas." And as shoppers grow more and more comfortable with e-commerce, the problem doesn't appear likely to abate soon. Federal labor numbers showed the warehouse and storage workforce grew by more than 5 percent in March compared to the same month last year, and Amazon alone recently announced plans to add 25,000 part-time warehouse workers over the next 12 months.

News Business Style Beauty Shopping Careers Fashion Week Editors' Picks Events Join News Business Style Beauty Shopping Careers Fashion Week Editors' Picks Events Join Beauty Can We All Agree That K-Beauty is Far More Than Just a Trend? Think K-beauty is a bubble that's going to burst soon? Hardly. Avatar: Author: Arabelle Sicardi Publish date: Apr 17, 2017 Social count: 3 Think K-beauty is a bubble that's going to burst soon? Hardly. 3 SHARES My mother is the biggest tomboy I know. She disbelieves in razors, still owns the same Estée Lauder eyeshadow palette she had her wedding makeup done with and sends me chain-mail conspiracy reports of how hair dye will make my hair fall out. She has always shown blatant disinterest in my obsession with skin care; a visit home once led me to discover that she'd been using an SK-II cream I had given her as a paperweight for her tax forms. Things changed when I wasn't looking, though: the last time I went on a beauty trip to Asia, she e-mailed me a list of 20 products she wanted me to pick up. My mom had become a skin-care fanatic. The fact that my mother is now as up to speed on skin-care regimens as any internet-savvy millennial says a lot about the state of the beauty industry. People have reported on the rise of South Korean skin-care products with some surprise, labeling it a fad, the latest trend, one more conversation starter in the line of ridiculous things: can you believe they bother with a 10-step routine? Ha, ha, ha, crazy right? Now look at this Instagram person using a hard-boiled egg to blend their foundation. As if these two things are equally as gimmicky and foreign and ill-researched. Hardly. What was once a tourist's curiosity has now become a legitimate and long-standing portion of the Western beauty market. Sign of the times: an AmorePacific Cushion Compact sells just as fast and for more money — as Maybelline Great Lash. Actually, Maybelline sells a tube of its most popular mascara every 1.6 seconds. AmorePacific's cushion? Sells every 1.2. Internationally. This is all to say that I was asked to answer the question: "Is K-beauty a trend bubble that's ready to burst? Will we move on soon?" My answer is this: hardly. If my mother is taking the time to get educated in it — my mother, an ardent fan of Crocs, FarmVille, and "Shark Tank" — it's safe to say this so-called "trend" is here for awhile. It's settled down to roost.  So my more measured answer? Yeah, still no. Korean skin care isn't a fad so much as a newer, rapidly growing share of the skin-care market, and it is only going to get bigger — and more normalized. Higher end retailers like Barneys (with a new sheet mask bar) and Nordstrom (with a K-beauty pop-up) are turning to K-beauty to boost their flagging sales and get customers in the door during an era in which department stores are struggling. Mass retailers are investing in K-beauty in droves: Ulta is beginning to pick it up, Target and Walmart already do, and CVS will begin to do so, too. Hyper-vigilant skin-care lovers might be branching out to try Taiwanese and Thai beauty brands as well, but South Korean skin care is just starting to reach the promised land of Middle America: that sweet spot of brand near-immortality. Forever 21, Opening Ceremony and even the more unlikely Mailchimp are also among the companies dipping their toes into the K-beauty pool. While the newsletter service's venture was just a well executed troll maneuver, Ulta and CVS aren't playing around. They're offering brand and store exclusives, some — like CosRx for Ulta — from brands that don't even yet have brick-and-mortar outposts in South Korea. CosRx is also collaborating with the U.S.-based retailer that first introduced the brand to the American market: Charlotte Cho's Soko Glam. While their collaboration is skin-care-related (a vitamin C serum that sold out in a single day), Cho's company's focus for the future of Korean beauty in the U.S. is on color cosmetics. Her bets are placed on Korean cosmetics becoming the next wave of beauty products, though this by no means that skin care will die out. "While Korean beauty companies have long been recognized for their skin-care innovations, watch out for color brands making a huge impact in the space next," says Cho. "Korean color brands like Etude House revamp their packaging regularly, create limited edition colors in small quantities and have the agility and R&D to take new innovations to market within six months, while committing to affordable price points. If anyone can do fast, innovative makeup, it's going to be Korean beauty brands." In this Business of Fashion report, she noted: "I think they can rival the Elfs and NYXes of the world." Other retailers are placing their bets on South Korean cosmetics as the next stage, too: The e-tailer Violet Grey just teamed up with both Alicia Yoon and South Korean makeup artist Jung Saem Mool to launch JSM's namesake cosmetics brand into the US luxury market. Staying keenly focused on how to continue building on K-beauty's current momentum in the Western world is no doubt a smart move for beauty retailers. The Korean International Trade Association has collected survey data that shows 8 out of 10 American cosmetics buyers want to import Korean products. Imports within the category have gone up tenfold in a decade in Europe alone, with general growth expanding as well. It is, actually, an integral part of trade among the U.S., China and South Korea. When Trump was elected, South Korea's Trade Association met to prepare plans for, and I quote, "a contingency plan for the worst case scenario." Exports to China and the U.S make up 40 percent of Korea's exports — 29% of those to the U.S. are beauty products. Four months in, and the "worst case scenario" hasn't entirely come to pass (yet). In fact, exports are up 51.6 percent in the first quarter. If the U.S. issues a preemptive strike on North Korea, it's very likely our trade relations — including the not-insignificant market share of 29 percent that the U.S. market takes up in South Korean exports — could be hurt. You know, besides all the actual humans involved. Given Trump's recent statements on Korea (and his constant flip-flopping on everything he's ever said), we may have to update this by the time of publication. Still, Korean skin care has shown no signs of slowing down in the U.S. market right now, even as our government considers preemptively involving the country in escalating acts of war.  One reason that K-beauty brands have been able to continue their upward trend stateside — other than their constant innovation and speed — is that they're also receptive to consumers in a way rarely seen in their Western counterparts. When informed by customers that their "White Power" essence was, as Tumblr would say, "problematic" for U.S. customers, CosRx rebranded it pretty much immediately and emailed their consumers directly. "I think it's the first time I've seen consumers directly affect a brand. We've been consumers of American products for so long, and I've never seen things transpire the same as with Korean beauty," says Tiffany Marie, a K-beauty blogger and brand consultant. "The brands who come to U.S. and hire U.S. staff are more conscious about their context and race. They approach the genre of 'whitening' and 'brightening' products with an open-minded conversation. They've been really receptive to people who reach out." That being said, all brands involved in Korean-inspired cosmetics have something significant to work on: color ranges, for lack of a better descriptor, suck. Shade selection in South Korea-based face lines is almost universally extremely limited, and only a of the few brands who've brought over cushion compacts and the like have bothered to expand the array of shade options much.  Lancôme, for example, didn't even make a shade dark enough for Lupita Nyong'o when they signed her as a spokesperson; L'Oréal chemist Balanda Atis had to do the research and initial production of darker shades on the side of her main job. Atis is an African American woman, by the way — which is to say, she had to formulate the shade ranges herself, in her down time, with the favors of colleagues also up for the job. Where there's been absence, Atis proves, there is also immense opportunity. It doesn't make sense for brands to neglect to approach a more diverse range of customers when they're one of the only markets still left so largely untouched. They're up for grabs, waiting for the science and the focus of the industry to catch up. After all, while South Korean consumers spend slightly more than U.S. consumers per capita ($171 as compared with $139), African American woman spend 80 percent more on cosmetics than the general market. Whoever caters to them the right way will likely be amply rewarded. K-beauty isn't going away and retailers are doubling down, expanding locations, branching out with brand offerings, collaborating and offering exclusives across price points and platforms. A factor that could shift the major players continues to be who will serve the large group of people who are continuously underserved. In a moment where everyone wants something to escape into in a country that feels inhospitable, whoever understands people of color and the art of color cosmetics will win: despite a demagogue's rule.  Homepage photo: @sokoglam/Instagram Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.

Jennifer Ludden/NPR hide caption toggle caption Jennifer Ludden/NPR Kevin Butt, Toyota's regional environmental sustainability director, at a facility that uses methane to generate clean electricity to help run Toyota's auto plant in central Kentucky. Jennifer Ludden/NPR Kevin Butt's job is to find cleaner ways to power Toyota. One of the hardest places to do that is at the automaker's sprawling plant in central Kentucky, a state where nearly 90 percent of electricity still comes from coal. Butt points out a new engine assembly line, where a conveyor belt moves in a slow circle. He says it was specially designed with a more efficient motor. There are also enormous fans overhead and LED lights, all changes that save millions. "I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill," he says. That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But a few years ago, Toyota decided that by 2050 all of its operations, all around the world, should be zero-carbon. It's part of a larger business shift. In Kentucky, General Motors, Ford, Walmart, L'Oreal and others also have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are starting to look at renewables. Around the Nation In Kentucky, The Coal Habit Is Hard To Break "There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do," Butt says. That's true globally, he says, and it's especially true in Kentucky, where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. "We're a coal state, we're proud to be a coal state, we're sentimental about our attachment to coal," says Charles Snavely, secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, Snavely spent 35 years in the coal industry. His office is now working with companies — he calls them customers — to help develop renewable energy. But Snavely says he struggles with whether "the growth of renewables [comes] at the expense of coal. Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie?" Kentucky, unlike many other states, has no mandate to require a certain share of renewable energy. The state joined two dozen others in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, which would have shuttered hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Snavely says coal built his state's economy, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. The Two-Way Trump Takes Aim At A Centerpiece Of Obama's Environmental Legacy "We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates," he says. President Trump's order to start dismantling the climate regulation was a victory for Kentucky. And yet, it may not do much to stop the steady decline of coal. "The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables," says Jim Gardner, who used to regulate power companies as a member of Kentucky's Public Service Commission. Two years ago, Gardner was struck by an encounter with a local man who worked remotely for Facebook. He told Gardner that big corporations were actually deciding where to expand based on where they could get renewable energy. "He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in," says Gardner, "so that Facebook and others were not looking because [some states] were not going to be open to renewables." Energy The South Has Been Slow To Harness Its Wind, But That's Changing The Public Service Commission worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement — "a clear signal to people outside of the state," says Gardner — that if a big customer wanted renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities could cut a special deal to provide it. That gave utilities permission to offer renewable energy. But they still face challenges to produce it. The state's cheap coal makes it harder for renewables to compete, and to see a return on investment. What's more, Kenya Stump, of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, says Kentucky has only moderate potential for solar power, and not much at all for wind. She says hydro power holds the most promise. Stump is working with companies that want to develop renewable power, but she doesn't foresee a major spike anytime soon. "Right now renewables are starting to compete on costs, but not reliability," she says. But she adds that once battery technology develops and solar or wind power can be stored, "all bets are off." Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America Kentucky's utilities are also highly regulated. An energy activist says he's been heartened by a shift in the state's attitude, but thinks officials could do a lot more to encourage renewables. "The sun in Kentucky is as strong as it is in North Carolina and Ohio and New York, where the solar industry is employing tens of thousands of people," says Andy McDonald of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. "Kentucky is not limited by our resources; it's limited by our policies." None of those challenges is stopping a slow transition. "This tract is about 60 acres," says David Crews, standing in a freshly mowed field where East Kentucky Power Cooperative is about to install 32,000 solar panels. It will be one of the state's first utility-scale solar farms, and it's there by popular demand — from businesses. Crews says some companies don't mind paying a bit more to meet their sustainability goals. Science Natural Gas Plant Makes A Play For Coal's Market, Using 'Clean' Technology East Kentucky Power has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president doesn't want to limit carbon emissions, doesn't mean the next one won't. "The seesawing of regulations when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy," he says. "And that wouldn't be good for our customer base." The utility is marketing its new solar farm, and if demand is strong enough Crews says it will add more panels. At Toyota's plant in central Kentucky, Kevin Butt envisions installing solar panels on the roof. The company is also researching fuel cell technology, seeking the breakthrough that could help it eliminate carbon emissions. But for now, he's getting creative about finding renewable energy where he can. He drives me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill, and here and there, things stick up. "The black tube coming out," he says pointing, "it's a methane capture well." The methane is released as the trash rots. When it goes into the air, methane is a dirty greenhouse gas, but last year Toyota set up a generator here to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line, straight to the Toyota plant 6 miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. "They either have to put it in their system," Butt says, "or people will be looking at alternate ways to get that energy in a renewable form." The Two-Way Toyota Plans $1.3 Billion Investment In Kentucky Plant Energy Wind Energy Takes Flight In The Heart Of Texas Oil Country Correction April 17, 2017 A previous version of this story incorrectly said 90 percent of Kentucky's energy comes from coal.

I like the local news and obituaries in Section A then, the articles, comics and sports with the tv guide in Section B. I also like the actual date written on the weekend papers instead of the week numbers. Keep up the good work. The Hamilton argument If I stole $230,000, I hope the court would order me to pay back that much, not just $40,000. If I ever need an attorney, I won’t hire Claude Kuehn if his best argument is that growing up in East St. Louis is my only defense. Things weren’t like that in East St. Louis when Mr. Hamilton was growing up. If you want to use that argument, print a list of people who were born into poverty but made something of themselves without stealing money from others. You would have to run a special edition because there wouldn’t be room to list them all. Baseball’s stupid rule Major League baseball has made another stupid rule. First, it was a designated hitter rule. Now, on an intentional walk, the pitcher doesn’t even have to throw the ball. Utterly ridiculous. They want to save time. Here’s another suggestion. When a guy hits a homerun, don’t run around the bases. Just walk back to the dugout. That will save you some time. After an out or strikeout, the team throws the ball around the bases. Cut that out, too. Just some food for thought for the idiots who are ruining baseball. Molina’s sticky chest protector Pitchers use pine tar in professional baseball. That’s why the ball stuck to Yadier Molina. “We don’t know what happened?” They know exactly what happened. A baseball doesn’t magically stick to things. The sport is becoming crooked if they can’t admit to that. If you watch, you can see pitchers add pine tar from the brim of their hat to their fingers before they throw the ball. In defense of Watkins If my children went to Harmony Emge school and had Mr. Watkins, I wouldn’t believe a word of the case against him. There are a lot of parents over there who said that this never happened. There are women who will say whatever it takes to ruin a person or to get money out of him. She just wants her 15 minutes of fame, her money and to move on. This happens all the time, all over the United States. The basics in Belleville If Belleville police station is so “state of the art,” why don’t they do basic things like keep a list of residents who have security cameras like O’Fallon and Fairview Heights? In Swansea, with the recent car break-ins, they used robo-calls to inform the public. Do the Belleville police do any of these simple things? A money flow problem Delayed again. Hofbräuhaus will not be ready until late summer this time. It’s obvious, the Kellers have a money flow problem, which is preventing the completion of Belleville’s newest boondoggle. In an effort to spend your TIF money, the Belleville TIF clowns forgot to do their due diligence on Keller’s finances. Gas station will be ready in 2019, hotel in 2021, and soccer fields in “never.” What’s the next excuse? Another grand opening of the Hofbräuhaus? Are there any developments in the lawsuit about the plans for the project? What’s going to be the excuse when it doesn’t get done this summer? And when does summer end for these people? MetroLink security on the cheap The deputies working MetroLink security are paid much less than the rest of the department. Security guards working for the contract company that MetroLink hired makes almost as much as the Metro deputies do. The sheriff was having trouble finding people to take those positions. The problem is MetroLink wants everything done on the cheap. They don’t hire enough people or pay enough. They don’t care about your safety, just if you pay your $5 round trip. Corruption right in front of us The article about the public corruption tip-line is a joke. State’s Attorney Kelly, it’s right in front of you. You’re among the corruption and you’re going to sit on a panel to rid us of it? You can’t even take care of what’s going on in your own county. You’re part of the problem. Hotline? For what? A new public corruption hotline? For what, to give somebody five years for what he should have gotten ten years for? To pay back $40,000 for all that he stole? If the public corruption hotline finds anything, it’s not like they’re going to do anything about it. Issues facing Belleville I voted to re-elect Belleville’s mayor because I thought that his opponent was dishonest. But I don’t want that action to be misinterpreted as approval with the way that things are being run. We still have huge vacancies in the former Walmart, Augustine’s Restaurant and lots of other businesses that used to be here, but left or closed. I’d like to see more action restoring the basic businesses in Belleville. We don’t even have a local bakery. More info needed on the bus plan District 201 school board members need to share how this bus plan is going to save money. Adding 280 employees is huge. Will they be union employees? Is District 201 one of the last to add bus employees or did they just open the spigot for many other districts to follow suit? We need more information. A loose cannon in 201 Assistant Superintendent Brian Mentzer is walking around like a loose canon. He’s trying to tell us that he knows how to run a bus business. He can’t even run a school and keep the roof repaired. Crying for more taxes Belleville School Districts 118 and 201 asked for a sales tax increase to help the children. Then, they went out and bought their own bus company rather than continuing to rent. We all know it’s cheaper to rent than to buy. I hope the voters in this area remember this behavior the next time that the school districts come crying to us for more taxes “for the children.” Give us a cost breakdown I’d like to see a breakdown of the costs involved with the school purchasing the bus business. What was it costing before and line-by-line what will it cost now? Somebody had to have done that before they voted in approval of it. Then again, maybe not. “The district doesn’t need to make a profit.” Are you expecting the tax payers to prop you up? Union clowns The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees threatening to strike because Gov. Rauner won’t negotiate in good faith? What a joke. Madigan and the Democrats were going to stop paying these clowns and the union employees said nothing. The AFSCME employees are clueless. Bost ends our internet privacy Thank you, Congressman Mike Bost, for voting to end our internet privacy. Your browsing history can now be sold by AT&T and Charter. Imagine the fun of discovering from Walmart or any other retailer that your 14-year-old daughter is pregnant. BND biased toward president BND, look through your newspaper and website and pick out every negative article you can find on the president and the people he has chosen. I know that this is a democratic area, but you are so biased. Please adjust your editorial ideas for the good of everyone reading this paper. High cost of trash pickup I hope the new Swansea mayor looks at trash pick up in the village. We pay an enormous amount for our trash stickers, especially for a large family. The trash company isn’t very reliable if they feel that your can is over-filled. With the amount that we pay, they should pick up anything that we leave out there. I’d like the new mayor to get a new company who is willing to work with the people of Swansea and not just take our money. Obama to blame The community organizer, Obama, may finally understand what a “red line” is. Obama was guaranteed by Russia that all chemical weapons had been destroyed in Syria. The White House liar, Susan Rice, stated last year all chemical weapons in Syria were gone. After eight years of incompetence, Obama let the world become a much more dangerous place. Finally, the United States has a leader who will correct the multitude of Obama’s blunders. No world wide apology tour from the Trump White House. Hoping Trump knows best I hope Trump knows what he’s doing in Syria. I know that chemical weapons are horrible. But, conventional weapons are awful, too. Senate needs cooperation Republicans had to use the “Reid Nuclear Option” to get Judge Gorsuch approved for the Supreme Court. They used a simple majority vote. Democrats are complaining, “Remember what goes around, comes around.” Why don’t they remember that it was Harry Reid who started that back in 2013 to get Obama’s executive nominees passed. Maybe one day we’ll get senators who want to work together rather than spout, “What goes around, comes around.” A blueprint for MidAmerica St. Louis is pursuing private management for Lambert International Airport under the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airport Privatization Pilot Program. The city would retain ownership of the airport and its land, but a private company would lease it. Money coming into the airport could be used for needs beyond the airport and by the city and St. Louis region, something not allowed under the current operation system. Mark Kern and company ought to take a hard look at this program for MidAmerica Airport. Why not let someone run MAA that knows how? Who lives in the county? How long will Madison county IT director Rob Dorman be allowed to live in St. Clair County? How many other Madison county employees don’t live in the county? A lack of color Collinsville has no black city employees or any black members on the city council. This is a shame. I think that the Collins house was even built by slaves. Where is Dallas Cook? Dallas Cook hasn’t bothered to show up to work since the election. Sure, he’s finished at the end of April. But, why are the taxpayers still paying him a salary this month if he isn’t working? O’Fallon fundraiser was wonderful Thanks to Ann Morey and her crew, the Taste of O’Fallon fundraiser put on by the St. Clair County Extension and Education Foundation on Friday, April 7, was wonderful. It was so much fun. Local restaurants brought fantastic samples and the O’Fallon High School jazz band was excellent.

Jennifer Ludden/NPR hide caption toggle caption Jennifer Ludden/NPR Kevin Butt, Toyota's regional environmental sustainability director, at a facility that uses methane to generate clean electricity to help run Toyota's auto plant in central Kentucky. Jennifer Ludden/NPR Kevin Butt's job is to find cleaner ways to power Toyota. One of the hardest places to do that is at the automaker's sprawling plant in central Kentucky, a state where nearly 90 percent of electricity still comes from coal. Butt points out a new engine assembly line, where a conveyor belt moves in a slow circle. He says it was specially designed with a more efficient motor. There are also enormous fans overhead and LED lights, all changes that save millions. "I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill," he says. That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But a few years ago, Toyota decided that by 2050 all of its operations, all around the world, should be zero-carbon. It's part of a larger business shift. In Kentucky, General Motors, Ford, Walmart, L'Oreal and others also have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are starting to look at renewables. Around the Nation In Kentucky, The Coal Habit Is Hard To Break "There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do," Butt says. That's true globally, he says, and it's especially true in Kentucky, where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. "We're a coal state, we're proud to be a coal state, we're sentimental about our attachment to coal," says Charles Snavely, secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, Snavely spent 35 years in the coal industry. His office is now working with companies — he calls them customers — to help develop renewable energy. But Snavely says he struggles with whether "the growth of renewables [comes] at the expense of coal. Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie?" Kentucky, unlike many other states, has no mandate to require a certain share of renewable energy. The state joined two dozen others in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, which would have shuttered hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Snavely says coal built his state's economy, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. The Two-Way Trump Takes Aim At A Centerpiece Of Obama's Environmental Legacy "We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates," he says. President Trump's order to start dismantling the climate regulation was a victory for Kentucky. And yet, it may not do much to stop the steady decline of coal. "The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables," says Jim Gardner, who used to regulate power companies as a member of Kentucky's Public Service Commission. Two years ago, Gardner was struck by an encounter with a local man who worked remotely for Facebook. He told Gardner that big corporations were actually deciding where to expand based on where they could get renewable energy. "He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in," says Gardner, "so that Facebook and others were not looking because [some states] were not going to be open to renewables." Energy The South Has Been Slow To Harness Its Wind, But That's Changing The Public Service Commission worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement — "a clear signal to people outside of the state," says Gardner — that if a big customer wanted renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities could cut a special deal to provide it. That gave utilities permission to offer renewable energy. But they still face challenges to produce it. The state's cheap coal makes it harder for renewables to compete, and to see a return on investment. What's more, Kenya Stump, of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, says Kentucky has only moderate potential for solar power, and not much at all for wind. She says hydro power holds the most promise. Stump is working with companies that want to develop renewable power, but she doesn't foresee a major spike anytime soon. "Right now renewables are starting to compete on costs, but not reliability," she says. But she adds that once battery technology develops and solar or wind power can be stored, "all bets are off." Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America Kentucky's utilities are also highly regulated. An energy activist says he's been heartened by a shift in the state's attitude, but thinks officials could do a lot more to encourage renewables. "The sun in Kentucky is as strong as it is in North Carolina and Ohio and New York, where the solar industry is employing tens of thousands of people," says Andy McDonald of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. "Kentucky is not limited by our resources; it's limited by our policies." None of those challenges is stopping a slow transition. "This tract is about 60 acres," says David Crews, standing in a freshly mowed field where East Kentucky Power Cooperative is about to install 32,000 solar panels. It will be one of the state's first utility-scale solar farms, and it's there by popular demand — from businesses. Crews says some companies don't mind paying a bit more to meet their sustainability goals. Science Natural Gas Plant Makes A Play For Coal's Market, Using 'Clean' Technology East Kentucky Power has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president doesn't want to limit carbon emissions, doesn't mean the next one won't. "The seesawing of regulations when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy," he says. "And that wouldn't be good for our customer base." The utility is marketing its new solar farm, and if demand is strong enough Crews says it will add more panels. At Toyota's plant in central Kentucky, Kevin Butt envisions installing solar panels on the roof. The company is also researching fuel cell technology, seeking the breakthrough that could help it eliminate carbon emissions. But for now, he's getting creative about finding renewable energy where he can. He drives me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill, and here and there, things stick up. "The black tube coming out," he says pointing, "it's a methane capture well." The methane is released as the trash rots. When it goes into the air, methane is a dirty greenhouse gas, but last year Toyota set up a generator here to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line, straight to the Toyota plant 6 miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. "They either have to put it in their system," Butt says, "or people will be looking at alternate ways to get that energy in a renewable form."

But, we’ve lost more; we’ve lost a true polymath. There wasn’t anything that Pradipto was not interested in — and became knowledgeable about. Apart from retailing — which he learnt on the fly — Pradipto was a marketing and management guru, a mentor and a hands-on teacher, both of which gave him ample scope for storytelling — but with always a lesson in the tail. That was the least of it. He was an expert in all his hobbies — horology, scripophily, medal-collecting, art, music, and even stray cats and dogs. He devoured books, wrote several himself, was passionate about history and heritage. A raconteur par excellence, he enjoyed speaking — always entertainingly — as much as he did listening — to learn. Towards the end, he even became an entrepreneur — but to improve others. He was one of the first degreed (IIT, IIM) recruits to the boxwallah world. But, when he and I worked on a book on that tribe and the planters — those first Indians to work in British firms — he candidly expressed the view that those earliest Indian recruits — from good families, well-spoken and interacting well with others, products of good schools, and able team-sport players — laid the solid foundation for today’s high-flying managers. Equally clearly, he assessed the vital role the Anglo-Indian women secretaries of those days played. Pradipto Mohapatra, the Veteran Lines signboard, N Kannayiram and Warren Hastings with his Maid Marian in their Alipur garden     To talk about Pradipto in memoriam depends on the interest you shared with him. But the one thing everyone could say about him was that nothing got him down — even in those early days when retail, at least its Western concept, was the goal and there was no one from the West willing to share their knowhow. A colleague of those early days, Dilip, recently recalled how after refusals from several major international retailers, Walmart unexpectedly invited them to make a presentation at its headquarters in Arkansas. Gung-ho, hours were spent on preparing the presentation. On arrival, they were thrilled at being whisked off to the Chairman’s ranch house; it boded well. But midway through their presentation, he stopped them:” We are not interested in India. There’s no future there. Let’s have lunch.” Lunch over, hobbies discussed — Pradipto at his best — the Chairman invited them to see his hobby — breeding prize bulls on his 200-acre ranch. A bored Dilip watched as Pradipto proved an enthusiastic learner, animatedly carrying on a conversation about breeding superior bulls with the Chairman. An hour later, driving to the airport, Dilip rued, “What a waste of time!” Pradipto, with that trademark laugh, responded, “You win some, lose some, but can always learn from bull!”   Shortly after this, while I was writing up the Spencer legend, Spencer’s teamed with a Hong Kong company and the first FoodWorld was born. A Spencer loyalist from childhood, I regretted the lack of Spencer in the name. Pradipto prophetically replied, “FoodWorld was the name it had to be. You cannot make a mistake about its business with a word like ‘food’ in its name. Other retail chains Spencer’s plans to start will for now also forego the ancient name. But one day… India is ripe for the huge super stores with 20-25% discounted prices, offering a half day outing in the country with everything, including entertainment, under one roof and serving an area fifty miles around. That’s when we’ll be back with Spencer’s…” And then, he softly spelt out RPG-Spencer’s dream: “We want to be with the Spencer name the cutting edge of retailing in this country.” RPG-Spencer’s may not be the biggest in the country today — but every other major conglomerate has followed the trail Pradipto blazed. That’s saying something. When the postman knocked…. * Where are Veteran Lines, asks GS Murugesan. They’re in Pallavaram, in the Cantonment area, just south of the Airport. Once a flourishing Anglo-Indian colony — to serve the military, not as usual the railways — with numerous quaint houses and a rollicking social life, it still has a few Anglo-Indian families but fewer of those houses. It got its name from the homes built for the European Artillery Veterans — British NCOs who retired there, many of them having married Anglo-Indian girls. * You forgot another MCCian who played for India, N Kannayiram, who was in the 1952-53 team to the West Indies, writes RN Ratnam. CD Gopinath, not happy with the way Indian cricket was going, said ‘No’ to the trip. A medium-pacer and the first Indian to captain the Madras Cricket Club, Kannayiram, from Madurai, learnt his cricket, like RB Alaganan, in Ceylon. * I understand there were two ménages a trois (households of three) in Fort St George of olden days; some light on them, please, asks Rasathy Sinniah. The first (1680s) was Governor Elihu Yale who took up with Mrs. Catherine Nicks after his wife returned to England. Hieronima de Paivia, widow of the leading Jewish diamond merchant in the city, joined them after her husband died. The fortunes their husbands left both widows helped swell Yale’s. The other instance was of Warren Hastings, Maria Imhoff and her impoverished painter-husband Baron Karl von Imhoff living together in Madras. Years later (1770s), when he was Governor-General, Hastings married his Maid Marian in Calcutta.

One marijuana enthusiast, Michael Eymer, saw an early opportunity to cash in on the $1.3 billion legal marijuana industry. He founded Colorado Cannabis Tours in January 2014, the year it became legal to sell recreational weed in the state. The business began as a rudimentary model, with Eymer driving four people around in a sedan to check out a couple of dispensaries. These days, Cannabis Tours takes around 200 people in six party buses every weekend. Though the bus ride itself is the main attraction, tourists get to check out a few dispensaries, including Medicine Man (aka the “Walmart of weed”) as well as a live glassblowing demonstration. Now, although Eymer, a 35-year-old single dad, runs his company out of his home, he raked in $1.8 million in sales last year. He’s up 66 percent this year so far. “Pot is my passion,” Eymer told Yahoo Finance. “I keyed into the business opportunity early on. I’ve always had some involvement in the industry even before it was official. Then, seeing all these changes happening in Colorado, I just thought it was the perfect time to seize the opportunity.” The business of weed Eymer, an avid cannabis consumer since he was 15 years old, first saw the possibility of building a business around his pastime in December 2009, when Colorado legalized medical marijuana. He decided to move to Denver when Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana use. (Weed sales didn’t begin until 2014 in either state.) Legal cannabis is now a $6 billion industry in the U.S., and analysts expect it to be worth $50 billion by 2026. Pot legalization in Colorado has “increased the amount of money coming into state coffers,” legal pot opponent and former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter acknowledged in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Still, Ritter believes the state Legislature — rather than the voters — should have decided whether to legalize pot. “We did this through our constitution. We didn’t write a piece of legislation that could really deal with all the issues. It was passed by the voters in the constitution. It was like using a blunt force instrument to try and do this when we should have been using surgical instruments,” he said. Ritter isn’t alone in opposing marijuana legalization. Just over 53 percent of Coloradans voted in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana, which mirrors the country’s divide overall. Only 49 percent support nationwide legalizing recreational marijuana, according to an exclusive Yahoo News/Marist Poll, “Weed & the American Family.” Moreover, most people don’t see weed as a worthwhile venture despite the economic opportunities: 72 percent of Americans would not be likely to invest in the marijuana business, according to the same Yahoo News/Marist Poll. A controversial cash cow Despite its divisive nature, pot has been lucrative for Eymer. Originally from south Florida, he moved to Colorado to help start and manage dispensaries around Denver. After a couple of failed ventures, he decided to forgo that business amid a glut of competitors. Dispensaries line Denver’s streets, and there are 459 retail marijuana stores across Colorado. That’s more than the total number of Starbucks stores in the state. He decided to build an experiential tour company instead. Anyone could seek out dispensaries on their own, but not everyone could facilitate a decked-out party bus that hit the streets of Denver. Colorado Cannabis Tours is one of a handful of companies that have built their businesses around weed tourism without selling the drug itself. Read More Because federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from taking marijuana money, the overwhelming majority of dispensaries operate only with cash. CCT has a massive advantage over other pot-related ventures, though. As an ancillary business, it’s found banks and merchant-service providers to work with and accepts credit card payments. All aboard the cannabis tour bus Yahoo Finance joined a 30-person tour with a wide range of attendees, hailing from all over the U.S. and representing different ethnic and age groups. The youngest participants were three Hispanic 23-year-olds from Chicago. The oldest was a Caucasian grandmother from New York City, whose nephew took her on this trip to commemorate her 69th birthday. Sherri Doll, a 50-year-old visiting from Dallas, Texas, came to Denver with her best friend to see the city from a weed-friendly perspective. “We are on a bus in Denver, Colorado, being chauffeured to smoke pot. That’s unbelievable. Younger, in my early teens, we wanted to smoke weed and were too afraid because every time you turned around, the police was pulling you over,” she said in disbelief. She said she would definitely return with her adult kids: “I would come back. I would want them to experience the good, the bad and the ugly.” Members have to be at least 21 to get on the bus, but Eymer says he has made a few exceptions for those who are over 18 if they have a medical marijuana card. The tour itself costs $99, and it makes three stops. The first stop is Medicine Man, aka the Walmart of Weed (appropriately so, given it’s the largest dispensary in Colorado). Tourists there learn how to grow marijuana indoors, and they are shown the nutrients needed to produce a healthy plant. Next, they stop at a dispensary called River Rock. Finally, they stop at Glasscraft and see a glassblower make a pipe. A tour guide accompanies the crowd, and his primary role is to pass around a bong and keep guests happy and hydrated (especially given Colorado’s mile high altitude). The tour begins at noon and ends, fittingly, at 4:20 pm. Entrepreneur … and a family man Now, with 30 employees, CCT has evolved to offer much more than its namesake tours. Eymer and his business partner Heidi Keyes, a visual artist, offer Puff Pass and Paint, a cannabis-friendly painting class, and an edible-making demo called Cooking with Cannabis, taught by a Culinary Institute of the Arts-trained chef who teaches people how to infuse coconut oil with cannabinoids. Eymer and Keyes are planning to expand to California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., starting in January 2018. Mike Eymer with his family (Source: Mike Eymer)More As his business enjoys continued success, Eymer hopes to chip away at the stigma surrounding cannabis and its users. “I want to show that [my customers] are just normal people. This is just a plant they enjoy consuming. And when non-cannabis users can realize that — by seeing them and by them not being hidden — then perhaps once the stigma is completely dropped, we’ll see the laws dropped, too. And hopefully, 10 years from now, a company like mine won’t even be necessary.” As CCT continues to grow, Eymer has found it increasingly difficult to operate the business out of his home, especially as the single father of a 5-year-old daughter. Despite his current entrepreneurial success, he says that “being her father is the most important thing in my life … far beyond my business.” For now, he’s been able to avoid talking to her about marijuana entirely. But he anticipates the conversation will change imminently. “I haven’t had any [conversations] yet. I haven’t needed to have any yet. When your child is that young, they’re still in a bit of a bubble. She’ll leave that bubble in the next few years.” So what does his daughter think he does for a living? “I’m a travel agent,” he said. “She just thinks of cannabis as a plant.” _____ Read more from the Yahoo Weed & the American Family series: Americans families defending pot as never before, Yahoo News/Marist Poll finds How Republicans and Democrats in Congress are joining forces to defeat Sessions’ war on weed Cannabis advocate Melissa Etheridge: ‘I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink’ These mothers of suicides don’t think marijuana is harmless ‘Cannabis has made me a better parent’: One mom’s confession Photos: Small pot farms in Northern California thrive amid fears of Big Business Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next After 7 years in prison, a small-time pot grower will reunite with his daughter Yahoo News Kennedy: Medicinal marijuana is a ‘Trojan horse’ for the recreational drug industry Yahoo News Video The family that smokes together Yahoo News DHS Secretary John Kelly: Marijuana Is Not a Factor in the Drug War’ Fortune Cannabis Gives 4-Year-Old a Shot at Life After Family's Cross-Country Move Yahoo News Scientists have invented a dryer that can dry clothes in half the time without heat Business Insider Trump order would target high-skilled worker visa program Associated Press Trump takes on outsourcing with new executive order Yahoo Finance Melissa Etheridge: ‘I’d Much Rather Have a Smoke With My Grown Kids Than a Drink’ Yahoo Celebrity What to Watch in the Markets Tuesday, April 18 Yahoo Finance Video Netflix: Why our subscriber growth rates were disappointing Yahoo Finance Here's how much the average family in their 40s has saved for retirement CNBC US Marines in Japan are pushing the F-35 to the limit Business Insider Mark Zuckerberg kicks off F8 Conference live on Yahoo Finance Yahoo Finance Money Basics: What Are Stocks?

Perhaps our President is privy to some intel that to date has not been disclosed that proves Assad was responsible, but my gut tells me the attack on Assad was a mistake resulting from bad intel or undue pressure from the Neocons (like McCain) and Neoliberals (like H.

(KABC) KABC By Melissa MacBride Sunday, April 16, 2017 11:28PM HESPERIA, Calif. (KABC) -- One man was arrested and another is still at-large after an argument among customers at a Hesperia Wal-Mart escalated into a brawl that was caught on video. The argument started between two women at the 13401 Main St. store Saturday night. Teri Nycum was in the checkout line when she heard the commotion and began filming with her cellphone. "They were just pointing fingers, pushing each other," she recalled. "They just started fighting." At one point, the video shows a woman fall to the ground. One man hits another man wearing a red shirt. Then a man wearing a gray shirt walks up and punches the man in the red shirt, knocking him unconscious. San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies looked at surveillance video and found the man in the gray shirt, who was still in the store. A man's knocked unconscious during a fight @Walmart in Hesperia. Deputies arrest one man. The story next at 11pm. Video by Teri Nycum. pic.twitter.com/UFF35uAo9w— Melissa MacBride (@abc7melissa) April 17, 2017 He was arrested and later identified as Dashean Antwan Wages, 24, of Adelanto. He was booked for battery with serious injuries and bail was set at $100,000. Arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. The man in the red shirt has not been identified or located. Nycum said she was nervous that the incident would escalate if anyone was armed. She says store employees did not help de-escalate the situation. "Security was nowhere to be found," she said. "The employees were just watching. I think they should have at least helped the guy a little more." The sheriff's department asked anyone with information to contact the Hesperia Station at (760)947-1500.

Solar Energy International, a nonprofit headquartered in Paonia, has invested in training locals in solar installation as part of its Solarize North Fork project. The project has helped install 42 new solar projects in the area, creating jobs for local contractors and investing almost $1 million since 2015. SEI also offers vocational training in Paonia schools and has trained 56 students since 2015 in solar technology, according to Mary Marshall of SEI. QUICKREAD MINING A NEW FUTURE The coal industry has been on the decline for years, with two of the three mines in the North Fork Valley closing or idling in the last year, and that’s creating challenges and new opportunities. In this two-day series, The Daily Sentinel is examining both those hanging their hopes on a black gold turnaround — or at least the handful of high-paying mining jobs for as long as they’ll last — and those working to diversify the economy and build new industries in Delta County. SUNDAY: Among troubles, workers cling to lone remaining mine TODAY: Change is happening, even if old-timers, newcomers disagree about it By Erin McIntyre Sunday, April 16, 2017 RELATED STORY: Striving to Survive PAONIA — On the corner of Paonia Town Park sits a memorial to coal miners who lost their lives harvesting hard black gold from the rugged mountains. When the community dedicated the North Fork Miners Memorial in 1983, 62 names were added to the plaque, and they budgeted one-quarter of the memorial for future casualties. It would be nearly a decade before two more names were added to the plaque, and four more after that. For now, the remainder of the monument remains blank, in macabre anticipation of the next name destined to join. Though working in the mines has become exponentially safer since a 43-year-old Finnish miner named Joonas Batki died in 1906 in a rockfall accident and became the first name on the memorial, there are also fewer opportunities these days to be added to this list. A town that once bet on coal for its economy is now faced with the reality that only one mine remains operating, and a fraction of the workers have been called back to earn wages and support their families. The mining that built this community and gave it a sense of identity and purpose looks on its way out to many. There are now more government workers than miners in Delta County. The communities are in transition, coping with the fallout from the loss of jobs and tax income to support schools and other public services. Diversification is the mantra for the North Fork now, in a place where most people realize the mines are not coming back, even as they mourn the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the past three years. It’s possible that in the not-too-distant future, the only miner left in Paonia will be the memorial’s bronze statue standing sentinel over this community, staring toward the mountains, wearing his headlamp and wielding his pickax. QUAINT PLACES QUIETLY CHANGING The towns of the North Fork Valley, named for the tributary of the Gunnison River running through it, exude a quaint, pastoral quality that makes visitors feel like they’re worlds away from everywhere else, not just less than an hour from Delta, the big town with Walmart and more than one grocery store. Some of that characteristic has been retained on purpose by locals, and some of it is a byproduct of the economic situation. The median income for a Delta County household is roughly $42,000, and agriculture is still a mainstay, though the top dollars come from cattle and field crops, not the niche organic farms or orchards the area is famous for. But things here are changing, and the people who have lived here a long time can feel it and see it. Some are big things — like dwindling classroom enrollment for schools. Others are little signs — like a Pilates studio on the main street of Hotchkiss, a conservative farming town known for its annual sheepdog trials. It’s not the same as when the bust happened in the mid-1980s, when the largest mine in the area shut down, housing prices tanked and foreclosures soared. This time is different. Though school enrollment has decreased by 200 students in Paonia and Hotchkiss in the past decade, others are moving into the area and buying property. The number of real-estate transactions has soared 268 percent in the past five years in Paonia, while the median sales price has increased more than 12 percent. In Hotchkiss, the number of sales has fallen by half since 2012, but the median prices have jumped more than 20 percent. Thomas Wills, a resident of Hotchkiss since 1990, sees an opportunity for the communities to plan ahead, to be proactive and decide what they want to be. He’s seen a lot of changes here since he bought his house for $17,000 and locals accused him of driving the prices up at the time. He’s been the publisher of the North Fork Merchant Herald since 1996 and owns Wills Gallery and Used Books. He currently serves on the Hotchkiss Board of Trustees, helped found the Hotchkiss planning committee and is co-leader of the town’s downtown improvement committee. Delta County is currently writing a new master plan, its first since 1992, and the transitional period is ripe for asking what everyone wants the communities to look like in the future. “We do need to be reinvigorated,” Wills said. “But we have all kinds of problems, and the main problem is we don’t have enough retail.” He sees a need for more mom-and-pop shops and retail stores that have been lost over time through attrition, in a town that used to be known for its many antique stores. In the near future, he sees an influx of people moving from more expensive, crowded cities who want to get out of the rat race. He predicts more high-dollar homes, small ranchettes for affluent horse owners and the like, smattered across the mesas with organic farms. “That’s what people want, a version of Hobbiton,” he said, referring to the mythical town in “Lord of the Rings.” “We will see more affluent people moving in. I don’t really like that future, but things are going that way.” He sees signs of it even in rural, agricultural Hotchkiss, in the occasional BMW and Maserati parked in the town, which now has five gyms, including yoga and Pilates studios. “That’s the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “People are paying for that.” While no large-scale manufacturers have been attracted to the area, some international companies have relocated there — including Shade Scapes, which moved to Hotchkiss in 2015, into an old mercantile store next to the library. The company produces commercial umbrellas and other furnishings for outdoor spaces and distributes worldwide. Paonia has recently attracted companies like Optibike, a high-performance electric bike company that sells models costing as much as $12,000. LAID-OFF MINERS  “DOING WHAT THEY CAN’ It’s not that coal isn’t still a part of the economy here, but its role has significantly diminished. The Oxbow mine closed, the Bowie mine is idle with a skeleton crew, and the West Elk Mine had significant layoffs in June and took back just a fraction of its workers six months later. The remaining miners in the valley are surviving on half a mine compared to three mines open in 2013. A select few have returned to work in the West Elk Mine. Scott Morley is one of those miners, and he considers himself lucky to be back, though he feels awful for the guys who don’t have the same chance. Morley, a coal miner for 38 years, knows more than 80 others who have been laid off and didn’t get called back. He survived the layoff last June by getting a lower-paying construction job with Telluride Gravel, which meant a two-and-a-half hour commute each way. The week of Thanksgiving, he found out they were calling people back to the mine. Morley had just finished a 17-hour shift in Basalt, working in freezing conditions in a trench with water up to his waist, when his son-in-law, a fellow miner, called to tell him they were taking applications. Morley was hired back to be a fire boss, a position charged with inspecting areas before miners enter them, checking for gas or unsafe overhead surfaces as well as other dangers. It’s a job he takes seriously, one he decided to learn how to do after he lost 27 friends while working at the Wilberg Mine in 1984, in the worst mine fire in Utah’s history. Morley and his family moved here for work eight years after that happened. Now, he’s close to retirement and grateful for the overtime, averaging 55 hours of work, including swing shifts and graveyards. He’s a bishop in the Mormon church, and he knows six other men in his ward who were laid off with him six months ago. Morley was the only one of them called back to work. Though part of his position in the church is to counsel other members, it makes it hard for him to broach the subject with them because he’s troubled about their livelihoods, but thankful he has a good-paying job for at least a little while longer. “Their unemployment is running out, times are getting tough and they’re taking jobs that normally they wouldn’t take,” Morley said. “It’s kind of the last straw and they’re doing what they can to keep going.” Some have gone to work installing high-speed fiber internet or solar power. Others have gone back to farming, or taken one of the few retail jobs available. Others have embarked on new ventures as hunting outfitters. The Morleys have also kept themselves going by operating A Simpler Time Bed & Breakfast in their family home, now that their kids are grown and they don’t need the bedrooms anymore. Mostly, he just hopes they can keep going long enough to be able to afford to retire, because he doesn’t want to start over again. He never intended to spend his career underground, and thinks back to that one winter 38 years ago, when he took a mining job to avoid the harsh winter as a masonry contractor. He never meant for it to last a lifetime. One of the last conversations Morley had with his 101-year-old mother before she died five years ago was about mining. “She said, ‘When are you going to get a real job?’” he recalled. “This is it. This is all my résumé says now.”   REPLACING COAL AS A LIFELINE While some like Morley are just trying to hang on for a few more years to reach retirement, others are looking for ways to bring in jobs to boost the economy and help the community and those who didn’t leave for other mining jobs. Securing Delta County’s future means pursuing a variety of opportunities that don’t involve a finite resource subject to the whims of the marketplace and environmental regulations. They’re hoping to replace the lifelines that the seams of anthracite coal provided to the community. Delta County Administrator Robbie LeValley doesn’t see the diversification of the economy as a question of choosing other opportunities over mining or ranching. While she acknowledges that the mainstays have traditionally been agriculture and energy, she sees those transforming, not declining, into markets including alternative energy, such as the training provided through Solar Energy International, an international nonprofit headquartered in Paonia, and value-added agricultural products, like Big B’s cider and juices in Hotchkiss. The county is still experiencing financial losses from the decline of the mines, and those revenues have not shown signs of rebounding. LeValley considers the financial situation the “new normal.” Flat sales-tax revenues, property tax declines from the closure of the Bowie Mine and losses from other mine-related revenues are still being felt. In the last three years the county has lost more than $775,000 in federal mineral lease revenue and severance tax dollars, according to LeValley. For the first time, the county is trying to decide how to monetize its recreational appeal. LeValley said the county received funds from Great Outdoors Colorado for a recreation master plan in February, which it has never pursued before. The county is hoping to piggyback on other recreation destinations within a day’s drive, including mountain bike trails in Fruita and the river park in Montrose, and concentrate on marketing the rivers in the county for recreation. LeValley sees the installation of fiber internet as a boon for the area. It’s being installed across Delta and Montrose counties by a subsidiary of Delta-Montrose Electric Association, Elevate Fiber, which has already gone live and provided gigabit service in many parts of Paonia as well as Orchard City. “When we started looking at how do we diversify the economy, broadband was the number one thing Delta County and all the municipalities looked at,” she said. The goal is to use fiber to serve the existing businesses in the community and attract those that are being priced out of the Front Range, as well as location-neutral workers. Since Elevate launched in June, it has connected more than 500 paying customers and 6,000 have registered for service, according to DMEA spokeswoman Becky Mashburn. Workers have installed service in accordance with demand, and after neighborhoods mapped out by the cooperative have a sufficient number of committed customers, the network in that area becomes available. Bringing fiber to rural areas is echoing the story of how DMEA formed back in the 1930s, when urban power companies didn’t want to incur the costs of building lines to sparsely populated areas with few paying customers and the grid wasn’t available to them. “It’s really history repeating itself again,” said Mashburn. “I really think that at the end of the day it’s just about the fact that we’re tired of waiting.” Solar energy has also experienced a boom recently in the North Fork Valley. Solar Energy International’s program offering training opportunities for displaced workers as well as its program called Solarize Delta County Farms has installed 42 new solar projects in the area since 2015 and has helped create jobs, according to Mary Marshall of SEI. The C-PACE program, a state initiative that allows small businesses including farms to spread their financing for energy-efficient projects over a 20-year period to realize immediate savings on their energy bills, was also adopted by Delta County earlier this year.   STUDENT DECLINE AN INDICATOR OF CHANGE Fiber is one of the bright spots for valley residents, no matter how they feel about how things have changed. Ron Rowell cites the investment as a smart idea to help bring small businesses and individuals to the area. Like many longtime residents, he has diversified to make it possible for him to make a living in the North Fork Valley, where he grew up. It’s a place that has always had its ups and downs. These days, many residents are jacks-of-all-trades, like Rowell. He has experience as the fire chief, the mayor, a school-bus driver and a small-business owner, and he also does snow removal on the side to make ends meet. “We struggle, there’s no doubt about it,” he said. Rowell and his wife, Deb, owned Paonia Cleaners & Laundry for 37 years until they sold it recently. His business has been kept alive with wool blankets and down comforters, Sunday-best suits for churchgoers and rugs that can’t be washed at home. He knows others have had to leave the area, through his school bus routes over the past 31 years. He had 60 kids riding the bus at one time, and now only has 15, though his route length has doubled. Schools are one of the primary tax-funded services struggling with the exodus of the mines, forcing leaders to seek creative solutions to keep buildings open. At Paonia and Hotchkiss schools, attendance has declined by about 200 students in the past 10 years, 15 percent of the former population, according to Assistant Superintendent Kurt Clay, who grew up on a farm in Hotchkiss. Most of those students came from mining families. Officials have discussed closing either Paonia or Hotchkiss high schools and combining the populations to save money. However, “for next year, that’s just a rumor,” Clay said, noting that the schools have different identities and the district values keeping them open because they are “the lifeline of our communities in many ways.” Paonia and Hotchkiss are also well-known sports rivals and traditionally send teams to state competitions every year. “Before we would ever combine schools, we would want to exhaust all our options first,” he said. Next year, budget forecasts for the district estimate that Delta County schools will receive 77 percent of their money from per-pupil funding from the state. “We are at the mercy of the state,” Clay said. “It’s not a great position at all.” In an attempt to keep the doors open at schools in both communities and keep opportunities for students, the district plans on consolidating some classes and offering combined schedules for certain classes next year. For example, students at Paonia High School might travel to Hotchkiss High School for certain high-level science classes or electives, or vice-versa, though the details are still being worked out. Clay said the district is reluctant to pursue more local funding through a mill levy override, because the community’s economy is depressed. But they’re seeking other forms of funding, including a BEST grant to revitalize aging buildings.   FUNDS FUEL DEBATES  ABOUT THE FUTURE As the North Fork transitions, old-timers and newcomers are butting heads over how — or if — tax money should be spent to revitalize the economy. Rowell has been an involved and outspoken resident, opposed to recreational marijuana and other controversial measures promoted as economic development. The latest of those is an effort to turn the old Paonia Middle School, most recently used for miner training, into affordable housing and a work center for artists through a program called Space to Create, the first state-driven initiative for artists’ affordable housing in the country. Though town trustees originally moved to earmark $35,000 for the project, locals protested the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize the initiative and the board decided to table the measure. Elaine Brett, the lead organizer of Space to Create and a member of the North Fork Creative Coalition, sees a lot of potential in transforming a vacant building into a source of revenue for new businesses. She said Space to Create wouldn’t just be for traditional artists — culinary arts and distilleries could also qualify under its broad definition and help add value to local agricultural products. Brett has lived in the valley for 12 years and moved there from the Washington, D.C., area to retire after falling in love with the area on vacation in 2003. She became involved in the arts and nonprofit communities, using her background in organizational management. In 2010, she participated in a project with the local chamber of commerce in anticipation of the reduction in the energy industry’s contribution to the economy. “We knew the clock was ticking on the coal mines,” she said. “It wasn’t a death wish on the coal mines by any means, it was just imminent.” At that time, the group developed Vision 2020, which identified areas to concentrate on for a balanced, diverse economy including the arts. Brett sees Space to Create as an opportunity to move forward with promoting the arts as an economic support for the valley, like the Blue Sage Center for the Arts in Paonia and the Creamery Arts Center in Hotchkiss. For Rowell, he sees government being involved in subsidized housing for artists as the latest thing brought here by outsiders to make their new home more like where they came from. Rowell said he felt subsidizing artist housing was not a smart move, especially since the tax base in Paonia doesn’t directly benefit financially from several nonprofits that have stationed themselves downtown in what he considers prime retail locations. “You cannot have a viable tax base in a community if the majority of your downtown is nonprofits,” he said. “They receive services, fire protection, roads, all that, but they’re not paying into it.” Though he grew up here in the North Fork Valley, at 67 years old, Rowell feels like an outsider here. This place has transitioned to be somewhere he doesn’t feel like he belongs, a place where he feels outnumbered. “We just don’t hardly fit in here anymore,” he said, noting that he and his wife will likely leave the area for retirement. As Morley described, the town has always been known for being “a hippie town full of coal miners,” a melting pot where friction exists and people don’t always agree. Sometimes there are conflicts, like five years ago when the owner of Oxbow Mining Co., a billionaire named Bill Koch, entered his tank in the Fourth of July parade and a sign-wielding hairdresser stepped in front of the tank and halted the parade with a solo confrontation. The area has become a hotbed of protests against fracking for natural gas, and the efforts to strengthen the arts and nonprofit communities haven’t been without controversy. Despite his worries about the valley and its future, and the fact that he believes the mines may only be open another decade at most, Morley is optimistic about the survival of the communities. But he admits there is conflict about what this valley should transform into, though everyone is hopeful it will recover somehow. “Everybody’s idea of better is different,” he said.

Courtesy: WDAM HATTIESBURG, MS (WDAM) - Demario Davis spends his falls making crushing tackles for the NFL’s Cleveland Browns. On Good Friday, Davis took a break from football to share his story of faith with Southeast Mississippi's Fellowship of Christian Athletes at USM’s Payne Center. "I was excited,” Davis said. “Anytime I get the opportunity to speak about God and who He is and Christ and my relationship with Him, it's a tremendous blessing and honor for me. I've known about FCA and what they've done in different parts of the country but I've never seen to the magnitude what they're doing here. Really to just come here and be a part of it has really just blessed my soul." Born in Collins, Davis played football at Brandon High School before earning a scholarship to play at Arkansas State University. As a freshman at ASU, Davis was arrested for stealing groceries at a Walmart. He recalls looking to his mother the moment he was sentenced to three days in jail. "And I looked at her and that's the first time in my life that she looked at me and it was a look like, ‘There's nothing I can do son,’” said Davis to the FCA crowd. “And there was only about 20 feet between us but it felt like a gap that was so wide cause there's nothing I can do for you. You finna go back there and I can't help you." "God brought me to Him and I want to go and bring others to Him. And the best way for me to do that is just share what happened in my life and speak from experience. And that's what allows me to testimony so openly." Davis' relationship with God only strengthened his football career. He enters his fifth season in the NFL and second with the Browns. In 2017, Davis will team up with linebacker Jamie Collins, a former Golden Eagle and fellow Mississippi native. "I'm hype man, I'm excited,” Davis said. “The league is in trouble to allow two Mississippi guys at linebacker to get on the same team. Davis said he’s proud to represent Mississippi, his family and God as he continues his NFL career. “You come up having a very good sense of family and tradition,” Davis said. “[Mississippi]’s not as busy as a lot places so you learn to care about the people that are around you...You learn I think the truer qualities of life and understand what's really important when you grow up [in Mississippi]."

By Annie Gasparro Published: Apr 16, 2017 5:48 p.m. ET Share By AnnieGasparro Whole Foods Market Inc. wants to cut prices without sacrificing the local products that define its healthy image. Investors are pushing the organic food pioneer to boost profit by operating more like a big-box grocer. Some smaller suppliers and industry consultants say the shift to a more centralized distribution structure and other changes risk compromising Whole Foods' ability to keep stocked with the latest foodie trends and hot local brands. "Shifting to national buyers can certainly deliver cost savings to Whole Foods, but at what price to the soul of the banner?" said Jim Cusson of brand consultancy Theory House. Many of the changes are being spearheaded by Don Clark, a former Target Corp. executive hired in November 2015 to run Whole Foods' grocery operations. The data analytics, centralized purchasing and strict shelf management he brought from Target could save money that Whole Foods can use to lower its relatively high prices, addressing a key customer complaint. But matching its competitors on price could also mean limiting how often it updates the products Whole Foods stocks. Whole Foods has long divided its 462 stores into 11 regions, each with distinct product offerings like local maple syrup and gourmet pickles. A quarter of Whole Foods shoppers that visited the chain in the past month did so for items they couldn't find elsewhere, according to a survey by Kantar Retail. For those who also shopped at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., only 3% said exclusive brands were a top draw. The shift comes as Whole Foods looks for a way out its longest stretch of same-store sales declines since going public in 1992. Whole Foods is under pressure from Jana Partners LLC, which last week said that along with allies it had amassed an 8.8% stake in Whole Foods. The firm is pushing for faster operational changes. Major grocery stores like Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. have seen annual sales increases of more than 10% in recent years for natural and organic foods, eating into Whole Foods' core business. Stealing that business from Whole Foods and other specialty stores has been a rare bright spot for big grocery chains battling more competition and falling food prices, which has sparked a price war that has eaten into profits. Whole Foods co-founder and Chief Executive John Mackey said his chain remains a specialty store even as it adopts more conventional techniques. "Our culture is still very unique," Mr. Mackey recently told The Wall Street Journal. "What Whole Foods needs to do is to take the best ideas of the traditional supermarket industry and integrate them into our company." He said his new strategy strikes a balance between the remaining autonomy of regional executives and an easier process for national brands to pitch their products just once at Whole Foods' Austin, Texas, headquarters. That streamlining will lead to lower prices, he said. "We think there are tremendous savings we can have that we can pass on to our customers with lower prices," he said. But smaller brands and people who work with them say they have less incentive to put up with a more impersonal Whole Foods. "It's not a great launching pad for brands anymore, and there are plenty of other options," said brand consultant Jeff Grogg. Aaron Glassman, owner of SOL Natural Foods, said that as a small company, the changes are making it harder to get on shelves at Whole Foods. "They have condensed the purchasing powers into less people. It makes it more challenging," he said. A.C. Gallo, Whole Foods' president and chief operating officer, said small suppliers will still have access to the brand's national store network, and that the approach will allow executives to better monitor how well local products are performing. And some big brands say Whole Foods' regionalized approach made it tough to negotiate a nationwide strategy for their brands. "It's always been difficult for everyone to commit the resources and big ideas to Whole Foods when it took a region-by-region" approach, said John Foraker, chief executive of Annie's Homegrown, a large Whole Foods supplier of macaroni and cheese and snacks like crackers. Rick Cunnington, a 63-year-old retiree in a suburb of Tucson, Ariz., said he is glad Whole Foods plans to focus on price over the diversity of its offerings. Though he has shopped at Whole Foods for years, he said, he buys many items like cheese and vegetables at Trader Joe's where they are cheaper. "I'll keep an open mind, especially if there are coupons involved," Mr. Cunnington said about Whole Foods's efforts to appeal to more shoppers. "My wife and I are value shoppers."

A week earlier, Payless said it was closing 400 stores, and before that it was J.C. Penney announcing it was closing 138 location. Just look at some of the iconic retailers closing stores. Sears is shutting down about 10 percent of its Sears and Kmart locations, or 150 stores. Even the very first Kmart, which opened in 1962 in Garden City, Michigan, is closing After closing dozens of stores last year, Macy’s plans to close 68 more of its locations, including a store in downtown Minneapolis that opened in 1902. For some retailers, it’s a total liquidation – they won’t be back. Others hope that store closings will help improve profits, but experts have long said you can’t cut yourself to prosperity. In the world of thin margins, Wal-Mart and Amazon, retailers have to be at the top of their game 24/7/365. There’s little room for error. Yes, there probably are too many retail stores in the U.S., at least on the large-scale chain side of the ledger. Things were a lot simpler “back in the day” when there weren’t as many options. Some memories stick. Like getting shoes at Thom McAn when I was a kid. Then maybe a trip to Gibson’s, Howard’s or TG&Y. Maybe all three if we couldn’t find what we were looking for. J.C. Penney with it’s marble and granite was a step above, but the ultimate fun place to shop was the multi-story Valley Department Store in downtown Vicksburg. There was an entire floor for just toys! I even remember a Woolworth’s store with its eatery before it closed. The Battlefield Mall was home to Shainberg’s, McRae’s, Sears, another TG&Y and K&B Drugs. In the 80’s, Aladdin’s Castle was full of video games where my allowance was invested quite often. Then came the opening of the Pemberton Square Mall in 1986, and within a decade, the old Battlefield Mall was no more. Thirty-years later, Pemberton is now mostly a ghost-town. A vibrant mall isn’t always easy to find these days, but having something like The Mall at Barnes Crossing in Tupelo continue to do well is reassuring. A repaved road and parking lot around the mall would make life even better (hint, hint). For now, some of the closings haven’t affected The Mall at Barnes Crossing. J.C. Penney and Payless locations aren’t on the chopping block. Neither is Sears, at least not yet. And the good news is, MBC is getting a HomeGoods and H&M later this year. Maybe we do have too many stores, though. According to Business Insider, the U.S.has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia, the next two countries with the most retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar Credit Ratings report from October. And good times don’t always last. But good retailers do. Many smaller locally owned shops have learned to adapt by offering unique items and superior customer service. The retail landscape is far different from what it used to be. It’s survival of the fittest. But I’ll always prefer walking in and touching and seeing what I want to buy, not clicking on a photo on my screen. Old-fashioned? Probably. But infinitely more fulfilling. dennis.seid@journalinc.com Twitter: @dennisseid Click here to leave a comment!

Gary Lee Fellenbaum and Jillian Tait were charged Nov. 6, 2014, with murder in the death of Scott, who was Tait’s son. Submitted Photo – Chester County District Attorney’s Office By Michael Rellahan, Daily Local News Posted: 04/16/17, 7:28 PM EDT | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments This photo combo of undated images provided by the Chester County District Attorney’s Office shows Gary Lee Fellenbaum, left, and Jillian Tait, who were charged Nov. 6, 2014, with murder in the death of Tait’s 3-year-old son, Scott “Scotty” McMillan. Submitted Photo – Chester County District Attorney’s Office WEST CHESTER >> Gary Lee Fellenbaum is scheduled to appear in a Common Pleas courtroom Monday to begin pre-trial proceedings in the capital murder case against him for the murder of 3-year-old Scott “Scotty” McMillan, the youngest child of the woman he had been living with in a West Caln trailer home. But although the courtroom, the judge in the case, and the attorneys both on his behalf and the prosecution’s remain the same as previous appearances, the landscape of the case against him has changed significantly. Last week, the mother of the young victim in the case agreed to assist with the prosecution and testify against Fellenbaum, who authorities contend was the main perpetrator of the physical abuse that McMillan and his older brother suffered in October and November 2014. Scott McMillan died of blunt force trauma after being subjected to regular beatings and, the prosecution contends, torture. Prior to that, Fellenbaum’s attorney had been hoping to have the two tried together. Advertisement Jillian Tait, who met Fellenbaum while they both worked at the Wal-Mart in Sadsbury and moved in with him shortly thereafter, was allowed to plead guilty to third-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, along with related charges, in exchange for her cooperation. The lead prosecutor in the case, First Assistant District Attorney Michael Noone, told Judge William P. Mahon that his office had decided to drop the first-degree murder charges against her, and the intention of seeking the death penalty, because her testimony against Fellenbaum was necessary. “This defendant will be a critical witness in the trial of Gary Fellenbaum,” and the prosecution’s attempt to win a death-penalty conviction against him, Noone told the judge. “Essentially, your honor, the defendant will act as a living adult witness to what happened in that trailer.” More than that, Fellenbaum’s ex-wife, Amber Fellenbaum, has also agreed to testify against him. Amber Fellenbaum, who was not charged with the boy’s murder, nevertheless saw the alleged abuse that both Fellenbaum and Tait inflicted on him, and is expected to bolster the prosecution’s case. Amber Fellenbaum pleaded guilty to two counts of endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person, one count of each for both Scott McMillan and his older brother, who was 6 at the time. She faces a total maximum penalty of 18 years in state prison. All three have been held in Chester County Prison since their arrests in November 2014. The hearings that begin Monday before Mahon will include more than two dozen pre-trial motions filed by both the prosecution and Fellenbaum’s attorney, George S. Yacoubian Jr. of Radnor. Among them are a motion to have the trial moved from Chester County because of pre-trial publicity, and to keep the jurors chosen for the capital case from seeing photographs of the victim. Yacoubian contends that his client’s constitutional right to a fair trial had been hopelessly compromised by the pre-trial publicity the case had received in newspaper articles, television broadcasts, and internet posting. “The self-evident conclusion is that this county has been so saturated with the facts underlying this case that it is impossible for defendant to receive a fair trial before a jury of impartial persons who learn of the case only through the evidence properly admitted during trial,” Yacoubian wrote in his request for a change of venue. The trial is scheduled to begin in September. Mahon had reportedly expressed concern privately about the jury selection process in the cases of both Fellenbaum and Tait, who at that point could have been tried together. Not only is the trial one in which the prosecution is seeking the death penalty, which would require extensive questioning of each panelist to see whether they could impose a death sentence, but it also has been the subject of much discussion in the media, both locally and nationally. In addition, the allegations themselves that have been made against Fellenbaum could make it extraordinarily difficult to impanel a jury made up of people who declare they could judge the case fairly on the facts alone and not on sympathy for the victims. The murder shocked members of the Chester County community for its savage nature, and drew heartbreaking headlines around the world with its accompanying photograph of the red-headed tyke Scotty. At the time, Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan called the case “an American horror story.” When the boy was brought to the emergency room at Brandywine Hospital in Caln, he had “bruises on top of bruises,” Hogan said at a press conference announcing the charges. “Our emergency room nurses see a lot of things. But when they saw his body, they wept.” Mahon is reportedly considering calling in dozens more prospective jurors from the county than the 124 he had summoned in the last death penalty case over which he presided, that of Coatesville chainsaw killer Laquanta Chapman. He has also noted that extra alternate jurors might need to be empaneled because of the possibility that some jurors chosen might not be emotionally able to complete the trial. The last time a trial for a county crime was tried outside of the county was reportedly the escape case involving then-convicted murderer Nicholas Yarris, who jumped out of a constable’s car in West Whiteland and fled while being transported from state prison to Delaware County. That was held in Carlisle, Cumberland County in the mid-1980s. The infamous Johnston Brothers murder trials were also heard by out-of-county juries in the early 1980s. Yacoubian, the private attorney who was hired by Gary Fellenbaum’s family to replace the county’s Public Defender’s Office’s lawyer over the summer, has made it clear in his motions that he is very concerned about the way the jurors are given the evidence in the case. In his motions, he asks Mahon to forbid all “in-life photographs” of McMillan that might prove inflammatory to the jurors; shield them from knowing beforehand what case they might be hearing; and order that there be strict rules about behavior by those attending the trial, including no talking or shaking heads during testimony, or displaying signs, banners, or clothing that might be prejudicial, both in the courtroom and outside the courthouse. For its part, the prosecution also filed motions in the case. In them, they ask Mahon to allow a computer simulation of the case to be used in opening statements, and to have McMillan’s older brother, who is expected to testify, give his testimony outside the presence of Fellenbaum. Beginning in October 2014, according to the allegations set forth in the case against the Fellenbaums and Tait, Gary Fellenbaum began physically abusing both of Tait’s sons. The abuse included punches and beatings, but also whipping with a crudely fashioned “cat o’nine tails,” and tying the boys to chairs or hanging them upside down by their feet. Allegedly Fellenbaum’s beating of Scott McMillan escalated to the point where the boy could not hold down his food. Angered, Fellenbaum allegedly punched him in the face so hard he fell out of his chair, and he later punched him in the stomach. The boy began vomiting and later passed out. Although Fellenbaum and Tait tried to revive him, they left him alone in a bedroom for several hours before finding him completely unresponsive on the evening of Nov. 4, 2014. Amber Fellenbaum, 24, who did not participate in the alleged abuse, gave a statement to investigators after McMillan’s lifeless body was found in the trailer by emergency personnel who responded to her 911 call. In her statement, she said that for two weeks prior to McMillan’s death, she saw Fellenbaum and Tait spanking him for lying or disrespecting Fellenbaum. In one instance, Fellenbaum began “wailing on his rear end,” because he would not respond to his questions. She allegedly said she saw the couple beat McMillan on his buttocks with a frying pan, and both of them punch him in his face, stomach, and buttocks. “His buttocks were purple and red, his face was swollen, and his body (had) numerous bruises,” she told the police. Amber Fellenbaum also witnessed the incident in which her estranged husband taped McMillan to a kitchen chair with his hands above his head, and then proceeded to “pummel him” until he vomited and his body went limp. She said that after McMillan became unresponsive and had labored breathing, she asked the couple to take him for “immediate medical attention,” but that they both declined to do so. It was not until about 7:30 p.m. that day, when McMillan had stopped breathing, that she called for emergency help. To contact staff writer Michael P. Rellahan call 610-696-1544.

(JAKE NAUGHTON/NYT) Kirsten Green was ranked among the dozen most successful venture investors in the world this year thanks to her early role in Dollar Shave Club, Jet.com and other startups where she saw potential for building strong brands. Share story By KATIE BENNER and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Kirsten Green had only dabbled in investing in startups before she began a venture-capital fund in 2012. What she had instead was years of experience covering the retail business as an analyst on Wall Street. So Green, 45, parlayed that retail knowledge into her venture-capital endeavors and used it to bring specialized advice to her companies. In one of her first moves as a venture capitalist, she put $1 million into Dollar Shave Club, then a tiny company, which sells razors to consumers online. Later, she invested in Jet.com, an e-commerce startup that was vocal about wanting to take on Amazon. Last year, both those startups hit the jackpot: Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, while Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com for $3.3 billion. For Green, that translated into a bonanza of returns.

The Dollar Shave Club and Jet.com deals have helped vault Green this year to No. 12 among the top 50 venture capitalists in the world, according to data compiled by CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital. Other venture capitalists on the list also landed their spots partly because of big sales or initial public offerings of their startups, including the recent IPO of Snap, the maker of the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat. The place of Green, who did not rank in the top 20 last year, on the list demonstrates that the real measure of success in venture capital is how much a startup is worth when it sells or goes public. CB Insights put together the list using criteria such as the size of a return an investor was able to generate when the investments went public or were acquired. The firm focused on the performance of investors since 2009 for the list. Green is an unorthodox venture capitalist for several reasons. Apart from having never worked at a venture-capital firm before starting her own in 2012, she is also a woman in a male-dominated field. (Of the top 20 venture investors this year, only two were women.) And unlike many generalist venture investors, who work in a range of areas, Green focuses specifically on commerce and other retail-related startups. Investors have tried for years to find the next Amazon or eBay, often with little success. Recent high-profile e-commerce failures include Fab.com, One Kings Lane, Shoedazzle and Gilt, all of which were financed by brand-name investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and General Atlantic. Green’s roots in retail run deep. She began her career as an accountant auditing retailers. In the late 1990s, she covered those companies as a stock analyst for Montgomery Securities, studying measurements like customer traffic in retail locations and a store’s profitability per square foot. She also observed the rise of brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach and Ugg. She soon concluded that online commerce would underpin the next generation of important retail brands, but that consumers would not rely on just one way to shop. With the rise of Amazon and other online retailers, Green saw more bankruptcy filings from traditional retailers, as well as news of store closings and reports of market-share shifts. But she also saw stores do well when companies could make an emotional connection with shoppers and better analyze their behavior. “Retail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs,” she said. “People can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.” In 2003, Green decided to jump from analyzing this shift to investing in it. For a time, she worked as a consultant to a private equity firm before turning to venture capital because of her interest in young companies. In 2010, she raised an angel investment fund to make one-off investments in companies like Birchbox, a cosmetics subscription service, and Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer, while she studied how to raise a venture fund. In 2012, Green raised a $40 million venture fund. The investment firm Cendana Capital contributed $10 million, despite the fact that she had never worked as a traditional investor or tech entrepreneur. “When we talked to founders she had worked with, they all said that she had the best expertise and gave the best advice,” Michael Kim, a managing partner at Cendana, said of Green. With that fund, Green put $1 million into Dollar Shave Club when the startup was valued at just $5 million. She also joined the company’s board. After Green invested in Jet.com in 2014, she chatted with Jet’s executives almost weekly about matters including strategy and potential acquisitions, said Katie Finnegan, who was the online retailer’s head of corporate development. Finnegan said Jet still consults with Green even after the company’s sale to Wal-Mart. Green has “a real instinct for brands,” said Rachel Blumenthal, the founder of the children’s apparel startup Rockets of Awesome, which sends subscribers a customized box of clothing for every new season. Blumenthal got to know Green from Warby Parker, which was founded by Blumenthal’s husband, Neil. Green invested in Rockets of Awesome last year and has brought her opinions about consumer behavior to the startup. At a recent company board meeting, Green argued that the online retailer’s subscription box needed to remain distinct from its other packaging. Rachel Blumenthal agreed, saying that making the box “the crown jewel of the customer experience” was the right decision because it was one of the most powerful ways to reach consumers and to learn about them. Green currently serves on more than 10 company boards, including for the men’s clothing company Bonobos, the makeup brand Glossier and the women’s vitamin company Ritual. She has also had her share of flops. Threadflip, an online consignment store in which she had invested, shut down last year and became part of Le Tote, a service that lets users rent clothing. As for exits, Green said she tells entrepreneurs that she expects them to take the companies public or sell to a buyer as soon as appropriate. Of the 30 companies in her first fund, eight have been acquired. In her second $75 million fund, which she raised in 2014, two companies have been acquired, including Jet.com. “Now that people are bombarded with information, we are in a golden age where brands matter,” Green said. “I want to be part of this new era.” KATIE BENNER MICHAEL J. de la MERCED Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

The deal calls for Williams to supply ethane feedstock to the plant, which makes ethylene, a component of plastic materials. Nova expects to close on the purchase in the summer. Nova maintains executive offices in Moon and most of its facilities in Canada. New York City plans to force Uber to add tipping option in app New York City’s taxi and black car regulator plans to require Uber Technologies to add a tipping feature to its app by July. Drivers have long complained that Uber has resisted such a move, even as other ride-hailing companies offer a way for customers to add gratuity. Uber is facing a similar push in California, where a state lawmaker introduced a bill early this year that would require ride-hailing companies to accept tips via credit cards. If Uber is forced to adopt tipping in its two most important U.S. markets, it wouldn’t make much sense to refuse to do so elsewhere. Kraft Heinz collaborating with Dean Foods Kraft Heinz Co. and Dean Foods Co. are collaborating to market Kraft Macaroni & Cheese —which in 2015 removed artificial flavors, preservatives and dyes — with Dean’s DairyPure brand milk, which launched in 2015 with no artificial growth hormones. Dean Foods is based in Dallas. Kraft Heinz is headquartered in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Wal-Mart ends threat to ban Visa credit cards across Canada Wal-Mart stores reached an agreement to continue accepting Visa credit cards across Canada, ending the retailer’s threat to bar the world’s largest payments network from its 409 stores in the country. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions.  From staff and wire reports Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Join the conversation: Commenting policy | How to report abuse To report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to socialmedia@post-gazette.com and include a link to the article and a copy of the comment.

Last November, Oregonians agreed the state's low high school graduation rates were unacceptable and possible solutions being offered by a measure that required money be set aside, in part, for vocational training were worth a try. By their 2 to 1 approval of Measure 98, voters said that whenever good times in the economy generate an extra $1.5 billion-plus in biannual tax revenue, lawmakers must preserve a $300 million-chunk — less than 5 percent of the state's K-12 education budget — for mandated spending on career-technical education, dropout prevention and college-credit opportunities. School districts must also be monitored and audited for compliance. Yet, five months later, the fate of Measure 98 remains in limbo at the Oregon Legislature, where a Tuesday deadline will determine which bills fail or advance for the year. Facing a $1.6 billion hole in Oregon's upcoming budget and influence by the state's public teachers union in Salem, lawmakers are moving several proposals to dilute or fundamentally alter Measure 98 as voters intended. So far, the House and Senate education committees have recently advanced bills that'd pull "unspecified" amounts of Measure 98 dollars for other uses, such as hiring social workers in elementary schools and setting up student grants with the Oregon Future Farmers of America Association. Because Measure 98 changed state law, rather than the state Constitution, lawmakers can alter it however they see fit. "We need to see this get to classrooms before there are a ton of changes to it," said Toya Fick, executive director of Stand For Children Oregon, the local chapter of the Portland-based nonprofit behind Measure 98. "It's unacceptable to dismantle and cut the measure before it even has a chance to reach our classrooms and benefit our students." The only major effort to keep the measure mostly intact has been through a loosely-organized "work group" under the Oregon House that drafted a proposal to give schools more spending flexibility as requested by teachers and school districts. The work group's four bipartisan lawmakers then crafted an amendment to House Bill 2246, which was unanimously approved Monday by the House Education Committee. Before casting their vote, the committee asked the work group's lawmakers during testimony whether they felt the proposed revisions still keep in line with the will of the voters. "I think it stayed amazingly on course," Republican Rep. Carl Wilson responded. The state's teachers union, the Oregon Education Association, also participated in the work group but ultimately opposed the HB 2246 amendment. In written testimony, OEA lobbyist Laurie Wimmer said Measure 98 was not created by education experts and called it an "expensive and inefficient bureaucracy masquerading as 'accountability.'" Instead, Wimmer said OEA has submitted a better proposal in the Senate through an amendment to Senate Bill 353, another placeholder bill, which is up for vote Tuesday by that chamber's Education Committee. OEA's proposed revisions would gut Measure 98's funding requirement and strip its mandates, essentially making it an optional grant fund. Stand For Children has drawn ire from the OEA for its backing from the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the Walton family behind Walmart. Measure 98 had broad endorsements and zero opposition; educator groups like OEA, which backed the now-failed Measure 97 corporate tax hike, declined to endorse it. The defeat of the unions' business tax made fears of a $1.6 billion-shortfall a reality for Oregon's 2017-19 budget, which is largely the result of soaring retirement and health care costs of public employees and retirees who make up the unions' memberships. It's still unclear where budget talks are headed in Salem. Gov. Kate Brown has proposed a $8.1 billion K-12 education budget, less than what school districts say they need, and cutting Measure 98's funding carve-out in half. HB 2246's passage Monday could set the tone for Tuesday's decision on the SB 353 revisions, Democratic Sen. Arnie Roblan, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, told AP. "We're in a situation where we're about to cut $500,000 from education budget," Roblan said. "I'm not saying this is the best bill we've ever written. But it's better than not having anything, which I was concerned about."

Bubblebum has teamed up with Spanish firm Oblumi, which has developed the 'tapp'. It connects to mobile phones, and converts it into a digital infrared thermometer. Bubblebum founder Grainne Kelly has landed a distribution deal with Oblumi to exclusively distribute the device in Ireland and the UK over a period of five years. The company already sells its child booster seats into more than 1,000 stores in the UK and US. Ms Kelly, who is from Derry, says the firm has also secured a new deal to sell her car booster seats into 1,700 Target stores in the US. "I have created and founded Bubblebum, and we have been exporting around the world for the last seven years," she said. "We are in Walmart and Halfords. We have been looking at adding more products to our range." She said she was contacted by Oblumi, which was keen to break into the UK and Ireland market with its smartphone thermometer. "We thought, people are doing this, but don't know how to get it to market," Ms Kelly said. "The product is a smartphone thermometer. But it's not just that, it also logs all of the data. "So, if the baby is at home with granny, and she is checking the temperature, the mother and father can also check that. It also reminds how much paracetamol to take ... reminders of when to take the temperature. "We will also take this a step further for the elderly. For example, when my dad was sick, he got out of hospital ... he couldn't remember when to take his temperature of medicine ... we had to manually record that." The company now employs 12 staff - doubling the size of the team to meet demand for its existing products. "(The new thermometer product) is a pretty significant deal. We are also in another 1,000 stores in the UK, and Target in the US (with the Bubblebum booster seat). In the past two weeks we have signed Walmart in Chile and we have already doubled staff numbers." She said there has already been "great interest" in the new smartphone thermometer. "This is the first device of its kind on the market," Ms Kelly said. "As a parent of a child who had frequent bouts of fever, I am acutely aware of the precautions people need to take with infants and the confusion that lies with tracking temperature and medication. Our objective is to alleviate these concerns and allow parents and carer's to rely on the Oblumi device as a practical solution." "The Oblumi tapp can also check the temperature of liquids with accuracy and speed such as the temperature of a baby's bottle or bath water, a constant concern for parents."

That will make it more difficult for companies to factor any changes into their spending decisions for next year. The failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, threw off a timetable that even Mnuchin had admitted was ambitious for the complex task of overhauling the tax code, he told the Financial Times. “It started as (an) aggressive timeline,” Mnuchin said. “It is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the health care” debate. Mnuchin said Monday he still expected tax reform to be enacted this year. Shortly after taking office in February, Mnuchin said the administration wanted to pass major tax legislation by the time Congress left for its August recess. But he said at the time that the effort “could slip to later this year.” Enacting tax reform, including a cut in the corporate tax rate, by August would have allowed businesses to take the changes into account — particularly expected lower tax rates — as they planned for 2018. Congress also works better when facing a recess deadline, so failure to enact the legislation by August means it might not happen until sometime in the fall — if at all. It’s possible tax reform efforts could fail, as did the attempt to replace Obama’s health care law. Or, at the least, an overhaul of the tax system could take much longer than anticipated. The last major tax changes, in the 1980s, took more than two years to enact. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are still drafting their tax proposals. And the House Republican push for a controversial border adjustment tax looms as a major sticking point. The tax, which would subject importers to higher taxes than exporters or those that produce products in the U.S. for domestic consumption, could raise $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. The money would help offset a sharp reduction in the 35 percent corporate tax rate. But the border adjustment tax has split the business community. Major exporters want it. But retailers that import a lot of goods, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., oppose it. Mnuchin said Monday that Treasury officials were still studying the border adjustment tax, but that there might be other ways to raise the $1 trillion in revenue. “That is not to say we have taken it off the table,” Mnuchin said. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are trying to craft a tax overhaul without increasing the deficit. Mnuchin said that stronger economic growth triggered by an overhaul could help offset projections of lost revenues from lower rates. “Economic growth creates lots of revenues,” he said. “When you calculate whether it is deficit-neutral or not, there are a bunch of different calculations and a bunch of models. I am just pointing out the magnitude of what economic growth does.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

And the inspiration behind the success of their unique aesthetic was not hard to miss on Monday in New York City.   The twins stepped out in looks that played with layers and oversized silhouettes. Lovely in layers! Ashley and Mary-Kate (right) Olsen enjoyed a coffee on an outing in New York City on Monday wearing oversized clothes With coffees in hand, the 28-year-old fashion designers exited a restaurant while wearing styles that have been their go-to choice over the years. Mary-Kate had on a blue trench coat that was left open with a black sweater, a beige skirt over black pants and black sandals with thick straps. She completed the look with sandals and large sunglasses.  Ashley had on a long flared trousers, a tan trench coat and Mary-Kate had on a blue trench coat Ashley had on a long flared trousers, a tan trench coat that cut past the calf, and the teamed it with white sneakers. The sisters have put their acting career behind them to focus on their brands The Row and Elizabeth and James. They have a long history in fashion, and in an interview with Refinery 29, their former stylist Judy Swartz, who helped them launch their first fashion line for Walmart when they were teens, and served as their red carpet stylist, shared what inspired their interest in oversized ensembles and layers. Lunch break: The entrepreneurs exited a restaurant with coffees Business savvy:The sisters have put their acting career behind them to focus on their brands The Row and Elizabeth and James History: The twins' first foray into fashion was a line for Walmart when they were teens 'Well, the layers came from me. It's how I dress. It comes from my days of dressing rock stars,' she said. 'I'm pretty petite myself, and I just have always worn big, oversized things to cover myself up. I still do. I might wear a tight pair of jeans, but I've got a big baggy sweater on, and 50 layering pieces. I'm not surprised that layering moved forward with [Mary-Kate and Ashley's] aesthetics, because it was such a big part of their style growing up.'

Photo credit: Ron Edmonds/AP Happiness, who knows. Joy, jeez, that’s a whole frickin’ thing. I will never have even the faintest idea about deep personal fulfillment. But you can make the minute-by-minute drudgery of life a little better. You can hang a bird feeder near a window, and fill it with birdseed, and have some pretty birds to look at. Advertisement Around the edge of the roof of my home, there is a gutter. This is true of most roofs in the industrialized world, probably including the one nearest to you at this moment. Every foot or so along the length of this particular gutter, there are nails that hold it in place, some of which stick out a centimeter. I hung a bird feeder from one of the nails; I can see the bird feeder through the window from where I sit doing blogs. I filled the bird feeder with birdseed. For much of the day, it has lots of pretty birds visiting it. Therefore my life is better than it would be otherwise. Is it the best kind of bird feeder? I have no idea. Is hanging it from a nail sticking out a couple centimeters from a flimsy metal gutter somehow bad homeownership? No idea. Am I training the birds to be indolent, to be entitled; am I filling them with birdseed and sending them forth to rain feces upon someplace that otherwise would receive a lesser smattering of it? No idea. The birds are pretty, and they are alive, and they’re on the bird feeder, and that is good. When they’re not eating from the bird feeder, they perch nearby and sing to each other. Advertisement The other day I heard a fast, rhythmic pecking sound from outside, like a woodpecker. Oh no, I thought, the woodpeckers have come to eat my house, which is wood. But then I looked out the window, and I saw: It was not a woodpecker. It was a very pretty little white and black and powder blue bird—a nuthatch, I am almost certain—who would select a sunflower seed from the mixed birdseed in the feeder, and carry it over to a level place, like the patio railing. There the bird would set the sunflower seed, and, bang-bang-bang-bang, crack it open with its sharp little beak. Then the bird would flutter back over to the bird feeder for another sunflower seed. I watched the bird eat sunflower seeds this way for an hour. Then, presumably satisfied with its meal, it flew off into a nearby tree and sang some. It was good. Sometimes a squirrel tries to ransack the bird feeder—he (I think it’s a he, or maybe I’m gendering the squirrel’s pathologically dumb behavior) tries to climb down to it from the roof, which means he ends up upside-down on the bird-feeder, with his head pointed down and his tail up—and almost always he wipes out in glorious fashion, though sometimes not before he gets some bites of birdseed. Two days ago he accidentally pulled the entire bird feeder off the gutter and both of them crashed to the deck below and he ran off, probably from embarrassment, then came back an hour later, after I’d refilled and re-hung the bird feeder. A good squirrel. Probably there are things I could do to keep the squirrel from doing this, but I’m not sure I want to. You can hang a bird feeder from someplace near a window where you sometimes are. They’re cheap; you can score one from Home Depot or the garden section of Walmart or wherever for like 10 bucks. Here is a picture of a bird feeder. It’s just a tube with some scoop-shaped perches sticking out below some well-placed holes in its sides. You could make one out of a plastic water bottle, no problem. Do you have a balcony? A window box? Is there a frickin’ solid surface somewhere above a window, where you can bang in a nail when your landlord is not looking? C’mon. You can do this. Sponsored Birds will come hang out on your bird feeder. Even if you live in stinky concrete hell, I bet you will score some birds. You will be sitting there doing whatever—blogs, or eating cereal, or TPS reports, or sobbing—and then hey, look! Out the window! A bright blue bird! Two little yellow guys, eating together! A nuthatch! It’s a bird party! Maybe your life will still be unsatisfying! But it will have more birds in it than it had yesterday, and birds are better than no birds. Hang a bird feeder. Thank you.

Erie News Now set out to learn which information was fact or fiction.  We confirmed with the administration at Presque Isle Downs and Casino that Stephens has gambled here, using his player's card at least once so far in 2017.   Jennifer See, Director of Marketing at the casino said, "We were notified yesterday (Sunday) afternoon of the possibility of him coming into this region, and I know that they have been looking for him.  The gentleman has been here on property one time so far this year based on his carded play, overall it's business as usual." State Police confirmed that that all barracks in the area, including the small on-site barracks at the casino, were alerted Sunday afternoon, to keep a lookout for the suspect, but say there is no credible evidence that he's been here since the brutal murder was posted on Facebook. In a prepared statement, State Police Community Services Officer, Trooper Cindy Owens said, "We're concerned about the citizens of the commonwealth however, we do not have any substantiated information that the fugitive Steven Stephens is in our area." State police told Erie News Now they have responded quickly to multiple alleged local sightings of Stephens, and so far they are false...including reports the suspect left his cell phone in the Harborcreek Walmart."That information was not relayed to the State Police from the FBI or the Cleveland officers investigating the incident," Trooper Owen said.  "I would just advise the public not to believe everything they see on social media and to watch for a uniformed officer speaking with the news media like yourself and take that information into accounts," she added. State Police will remain vigilant and every barracks is equipped with the description of the suspect and his vehicle.  If the public sees the fugitive or his vehicle they should report it immediately to local police or call 9-1-1.  Trooper Owen offered this advice, "The public should not confront the fugitive and should report the most accurate information as soon as possible."  At Presque Isle Downs and Casino, Jennifer See said gamblers are staying vigilant as well. "Well we've actually had a lot of Facebook posts from our players saying, hey you might want to be aware, so they're trying to also help give us information."

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Boston Angel Investors → Under New CEO, Rowheels Considers Selling More Than Just Wheels Jeff Buchanan April 17th, 2017 @_jeffbuchanan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Wisconsin —  After six years in business, Rowheels, a Fitchburg, WI-based maker of special wheels for wheelchairs, is expanding its team and products. The company sells wheels that allow people in wheelchairs to propel themselves forward by pulling the hand rims—as if rowing a boat—rather than pushing them. This alternative motion is more effective at strengthening back and shoulder muscles, while the design improves a chair’s responsiveness and braking, says Rowheels co-founder Rimas Buinevicius. Earlier this month, Rowheels named Fred Mindermann as its new CEO. He replaces Buinevicius, who continues to be involved with the company as its chairman. The leadership change comes as Rowheels adds more wheels to its product lineup, attempts to widen the distribution of its products, and considers selling entire wheelchairs, Buinevicius says. Rowheels began selling its wheels in 2015, after spending its first few years in research and development mode. Currently, the company sells two models, each of which comes in four different sizes. One of the models, known as Rev-HX, is designed for athletes and other physically active individuals. The other model has a lower gear ratio, meaning the person pulling the rims will feel less resistance. That makes it a better fit for certain older adults and other wheelchair users who do not have as much upper-body strength. Buinevicius says both models are “high-end” wheel sets—they are very light, at about three pounds per wheel, and a pair of the lower-gear wheels reportedly starts at $2,100. The two types of wheels the company sells today are marketed mostly toward people who are likely to use a wheelchair for years on end. Meanwhile, there are many people who only use wheelchairs temporarily, such as while recovering from injury over a period of weeks or months. Rowheels is now also setting its sights on this potential customer group. Later this year, the company will introduce a new wheel set, which will be called Rev-3 and cost less than $1,000, Buinevicius says. Health insurers sometimes pay the cost of a chair equipped with wheels from Rowheels, depending on the specifics of the patient’s coverage plan. Still, some patients end up paying out of pocket, Buinevicius says. Like the two Rowheels models that are already on the market, Rev-3 wheels can be attached to chairs made by several brands, including Invacare, TiLite, and Sunrise Medical. Buinevicius referenced the bicycle industry when explaining why his company decided to offer a more affordable wheel. People can spend thousands of dollars on a two-wheeler at an upscale bike shop, or buy one for $100 at Walmart—it all depends on the wants and needs of the individual, Buinevicius says. He envisions Walmart, along with other big box chains like Costco and Target, potentially selling wheelchairs with Rev-3 wheels attached at some point in the future. In the more immediate future, Rowheels is working to get its products on shelves at 30 locations of Numotion, a Brentwood, TN-based seller of wheelchairs and wheelchair parts. Rowheels also plans to explore its options for selling products via online retailers, such as Amazon, Buinevicius says. It’s also possible that Rowheels will begin purchasing wheelchair frames—meaning all parts excluding the wheels—and selling entire chairs, equipped with its wheels, under white-label agreements with frame manufacturers, Buinevicius says. Rowheels would likely continue to sell wheels à la carte so that users who are satisfied with their frames but want to switch from pushing to pulling only have to buy what they need. The company plans to fuel some of its growth through revenue and retained earnings, … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Jeff Buchanan is the editor of Xconomy Wisconsin.

And if you're willing to go down the refurbished route, you can get a pair for as little as $76.99. Here's a full rundown of all the best deals: New $84.99 - Silver - Walmart $89.99 - Gold - Walmart $89.99 - Black - Groupon $98.00 - Black - Walmart Refurbished $76.99 - Silver - Amazon $79.99 - Black - Amazon Walmart also has the gray model at $79.99 new, but these are unfortunately out of stock at the time of writing.

Courtesy of Winston-Salem police Winston-Salem police are looking for a silver 2003 Mazda Miata convertible, similar to this one, with North Carolina license plate ZNY-4120. The body of the vehicle’s owner, John Douglas Agnew, was found dismembered at a Winston-Salem townhouse on Monday. The last time Melanie Agnew Simpson talked to her father, John Douglas Agnew, was on Friday, April 7. That Sunday, she went by his house in the 300 block of Timberline Drive and saw a handwritten note on the front storm door. “Not feeling well. Do not knock. Do not ring the doorbell,” the note said. But the note wasn’t in her father’s handwriting, and his car, a 2003 Mazda Miata, was missing. The next day, Monday, April 10, she returned to the house and got a locksmith to get into the back door of the house. The locksmith saw a large amount of blood in the kitchen and on the dining room carpet. When Winston-Salem police officers arrived later, they found a black duffel bag in a downstairs bathroom with Agnew’s arms, lower legs and head inside, according to a search warrant. The duffel bag appeared to be new, with a Wal-Mart tag on the handle. Officers also found a safe that had been pried open from the back. Simpson and other family members told officers that Agnew kept a .45-caliber handgun in the safe and that the safe was usually in an upstairs bedroom. Randolph County Sheriff’s Office detectives found a human torso in a wooded area in Randleman. Winston-Salem police Lt. Mike Cardwell said the human remains found in Randolph County belong to Agnew. Cardwell said an autopsy showed that Agnew was stabbed to death. In a news release, Winston-Salem police said he was stabbed multiple times in the neck and chest. Adrion Demare Whorley, 31, of Rockingham, has been charged with murder and concealing the death of Agnew, according to arrest warrants. Whorley was released from state prison on Jan. 3 after spending 16 years and four months behind bars, said Keith Acree, a spokesman for the N.C. Division of Adult Correction. Whorley was convicted in Forsyth Superior Court in August 2001 on one count of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury and six counts of armed robbery, Acree said. According to the search warrant, Whorley listed Agnew as a friend in his official contact list in 2001 and as an approved visitor while Whorley was an inmate. Investigators are still looking for Agnew’s missing car, Cardwell said. A detective with the Winston-Salem Police Department went in a helicopter to search for the car but didn’t find it, he said. Cardwell said detectives believe Agnew’s car was likely abandoned in the area where the human remains were found in Randolph County. At Agnew’s house, Winston-Salem police found a hacksaw, covered in blood, hair and body tissue, in the kitchen sink, visible boot or shoe prints in the floor and fingerprint evidence that matched Whorley, according to the search warrant. The upstairs bathroom shower curtain was missing. Agnew’s torso was found in a wooded area off Canter Road in Randleman and was wrapped in a transparent shower curtain, the search warrant said. State prison officials were able to track down Whorley to a house in the 100 block of Safie Avenue in Rockingham. On April 13, Winston-Salem police detectives, state prison officials and detectives with the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office executed a search warrant at that house and attempted to serve an arrest warrant. Officials soon learned that Whorley was at the Economy Motel at 603 South Hancock St. Deputies with the sheriff’s office took Whorley into custody and found a receipt on Whorley showing that he rented a room from April 13 to April 14. Whorley refused to allow officers to search his room. A woman in the room next door told authorities that Whorley had been staying in her room the week before Agnew’s death but had left April 7, using her car. He returned to the motel on April 10 and then got another room on April 13, taking his bags with him. Police obtained a search warrant for Whorley’s motel room and seized two suitcases, one with clothing, a heater, a circular saw, a GPS, an answering machine and a number of pennies. Melanie Agnew Simpson sent out a statement last week about her father. “My father, John Douglas Agnew, was a beloved father-in-law, grandfather, brother, uncle, cousin and friend,” she said in the statement. “Dad was an extraordinary man with a boundless capacity for love. He extended his kindness, warmth and generosity to not only his entire family, but to those in the community as well.” Funeral services for John Agnew were held Monday afternoon. mhewlett@wsjournal.com (336) 727-7326 @mhewlettWSJ jhinton@wsjournal.com (336) 727-7299 @jhinton@WSJ +3  Agnew Courtesy of the Agnew family +3  Whorley Courtesy of Forsyth County Detention Center Tags John Douglas Agnew Police Criminal Law Detective Search Warrant Crime Keith Acree Adrion Demare Whorley Mike Cardwell Torso Michael Hewlett Follow Michael Hewlett Close Get email notifications on Michael Hewlett daily!

Miller’s words about “defending a culture that celebrates and benefits from the robust discourse possible only when information and ideas can be shared openly” (“A Unified Voice”). Yes, I agree that the past several years have limited, on several issues, diverse viewpoints, even silencing many. Take for example the issue of same-sex marriage. A greater majority of states had voted against it, leaving one to deduce that millions of Americans did not support it. Yet these very Americans—representing both genders, many races, and a wide diversity of religious beliefs—have not been granted a voice for their views. Any attempt to express them has been met with name-calling and ­censorship. When I entered the library world, I was taught that librarians are about information, not about taking sides. Libraries are a wonderful place where thinkers and writers from both sides [of a question] can be given opportunity for “robust discourse” without shaming and labeling. As Miller says, “our work to protect freedom of inquiry and expression is never done,” and giving people who have opposing views the right to exchange their opinions “without risk of retribution” is part of what has made this nation great. As the magazine generally presents one perspective, I look forward to seeing other viewpoints on a variety of issues expressed and libraries across the country offering a safe, open forum for free exchange of ideas. Thank you for being so broad-minded. —Name withheld Library drones I just finished reading “10 Ways Drones Are Changing Your World” in Consumer Reports (Jan. 2017). It is only recently that I have shifted my view of drones as irritating toys or cartoon-ish Jetsons futurist dreams to universal practical tools. Seeing on news reports, in agriculture, and photography what they can do has opened my eyes. Drones will be used everywhere within ten years, and people won’t look and point when they see one on the job, taking care of business…. One particular line in the article caught my eye: “Walmart is examining ways to deploy drones inside its warehouses to photograph and catalog inventory.” This got me thinking about how libraries will take advantage of drones in the future. Could large institutions use them to inventory/shelf-read their collections after hours when users wouldn’t be ­bothered? Will there be drones so quiet and unobtrusive that they could provide security inside of a large university library? Drones will definitely be used by campus security to help patrol the many isolated locations on campus to protect the university community. Another quote from the article, “Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said about 86 percent of the orders the online retailer ships weigh less than five pounds. That’s lightweight enough to be delivered by drone. Amazon is now testing autonomous aircraft that can drop a book or pair of shoes at your home within 30 minutes of receiving the order.” Wow! What if public libraries could deliver books, CDs, DVDs, etc., to shut-in users in such a manner? Or move items from branch to branch quickly and efficiently? I urge librarians to read this article and begin to dream of the ways that drones will change libraries. —Jeff Siddons, Libn., St. Petersburg P.L., FL Thanks for LJ help It isn’t often that a supplement to a periodical moves me to write a thank-you note, but I found as I was reading the Reference Supplement 2017 that you had saved me so much time that I could take a moment to send a thank-you. What a great job! The supplement…included titles from all subject areas and all price ranges, meaning my medium-sized library could keep its collection up-to-date within budget. Just another reminder of…how essential [LJ] is to my work. —Michele Raine, Asst. Dir., Wood Cty. Dist. P.L., Bowling Green, OH No help wanted Thanks, Steven Bell (“Librarians Are Not Worth Waiting For”)…. I don’t understand why many students (and some faculty) don’t value reference assistance. Most librarians want students to excel and succeed in their studies! —Jane Reiter, Research & Instruction Libn., Davenport Univ., Lansing, MI CORRECTION Benjamin Ludwig’s The Original Ginny Moon (LJ 3/15/17, p. 110) was published by Harlequin’s new literary imprint Park Row and is not one of the publisher’s Mira titles.

The driver followed the truck to a Walmart off the highway, where police met them. Officers asked Sisk and Maland if there was anyone in the cargo area of the truck, and Sisk allegedly told police his two sons were because there wasn't enough room in the truck's cab. RELATED: S.A.

Cleveland Police 1 of 2 Crime April 17, 2017 3:07 PM Social media users say murder suspect spotted in Altoona, but police say otherwise By Shawn Annarelli sannarelli@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Law enforcement have been on the lookout for a suspect who posted a Facebook video Sunday of a man being shot and killed at close range. The killing has sparked a national manhunt for suspect Steve Stephens, 37. Cleveland police allege Steve Stephens, 37, shot and killed Robert Godwin Sr., 74, in a seemingly random attack. It was widely speculated on social media that Stephens was spotted in the Altoona area based on authorities discussing their search for him in Blair County. Someone called in a tip to police Monday morning, according to state Trooper David McGarvey, that they spotted a vehicle matching the description of Stephens’ 2016 white Ford Fusion on Interstate 99 near Altoona. McGarvey said there was nothing else to report and that the tipster wasn’t able to provide a license plate when they called in. Police, according to their discussion over the scanner, searched for the suspect and his vehicle near Logan Valley Mall and Wal-Mart. There have been similar alleged sightings of Stephens or his vehicle in Pennsylvania, including in Erie and Philadelphia. Stephens, who claimed on Facebook that he killed more than a dozen people, is considered armed and dangerous. His vehicle’s temporary Ohio tag is E363630. Cleveland police have obtained an aggravated murder warrant for his arrest and said on social media that there is a reward of up to $50,000 from the FBI for information leading to Stephens’ arrest.

One call was using the Selma Police Department name. The caller claimed to be collecting a debt and for more information they needed to contact Veronica at the Selma Police Department. Police Captain R.L. Daniels said the agency does not have any employee named Veronica and officers are not calling people collecting debts. A second call from a person who said they were Eric and they worked for the workers compensation division of the federal government demanded a $100 payment through Money Gram at Wal-Mart. Captain Daniels said both callers were scams. Anyone who believes they may be the victim of a scam in Selma is asked to contact Captain Daniels at 919-965-8189 Extension 2003.

April 17, 2017 Christian Roselund Finance Legal Markets Washington As more and more large companies are procuring renewable energy directly, and often ditching their utilities to do so, U.S. technology companies are playing a leading role. And while Google’s 100% renewable energy commitment has led the pack, Microsoft has by no means been a laggard. Last week Microsoft reached an agreement with Puget Sound Energy (PSE) to establish a special contract, whereby the tech company will be allowed to source carbon neutral and renewable energy from the wholesale market while continuing to make contributions to a PSE energy efficiency program. Additionally, Microsoft will be required to pay a $24 million “transition fee” to PSE. The settlement will now go to the three members of Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) for approval or modification. Microsoft is not the only company in the region that is seeking a degree of independence from PSE. Kroger, Sam’s West, Walmart and a trade group calling itself Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities were also parties to the agreement, and in October PSE filed with WUTC to create a new retail service for large commercial and industrial customers which will allow them to procure energy from power suppliers other than PSE. According to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Microsoft was the third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2016 at 257 MW of contracts signed, following Amazon and Google. In all three cases the majority of capacity procured was wind. But it is not only wind that is benefitting. GTM Research estimates that in 2016 over 1 GW-DC of solar projects came online through either “green tariff” programs whereby utilities procure solar on behalf of corporate customers, or through direct procurement. The company further estimated in February that there was another 1.9 GW of solar projects for corporate purchase under development. Christian Roselund Christian Roselund serves as Americas editor at pv magazine, and joined in 2014. Prior to this he covered global solar policy, markets and technology for Solar Server, and has written about renewable energy for CleanTechnica, German Energy Transition, Truthout, The Guardian (UK), and IEEE Spectrum.

Diapers.com, Soap.com, And Sibling Sites To Be Folded Into Amazon On Wednesday Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Diapers.com, Soap.com, And Sibling Sites To Be Folded Into Amazon On Wednesday April 17, 2017 12:18 pm EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup amazon beautybar beautybar.com casa.com diapers.com jeff bezos jet marc lore quidsi so long and farewell soap.com yoyo.com The Amazon-owned Quidsi family of websites, including Diapers.com, Soap.com, and BeautyBar.com, is dead, but customers of those sites still have questions: Where can they shop now, and what will they do if they have a problem with an item ordered on the sites? The domain names for the Quidsi sites (which also include Wag.com, Yoyo.com, and Casa.com) will continue to work, but the brands are being folded into the relevant sections on Amazon.com. On a FAQ page for customers who missed the news about the shutdown, the company explains that the Quidsi brands have “moved to a new home on Amazon.com.” What users will see after Wednesday when they type those domain names is an Amazon search page. Items purchased from Quidsi sites through the shutdown can be returned within a year, and customers still have separate service lines for the brand, which are 1-800-342-7377 and CustomerCare@diapers.com. Amazon will also maintain a place where customers can check their separate order history from Quidsi sites. Amazon purchased Quidsi for more than $500 million after an extended price war over diapers and personal care items. Co-founder Marc Lore left Amazon after a few years and began a new company Jet, which also set out to compete with Amazon and sell pretty much everything. Jet, which at the time we called “either the future of retail or a doomed wacky scheme,” was acquired by Walmart, and Lore became the head of e-commerce for Walmart. As Amazon and Walmart are locked in a battle for e-commerce supremacy, did Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have Amazon shut down Quidsi in a cost-saving move that happened to be a little bit mean to Lore? Employees reported when the shutdown was announced a few weeks ago that Quidsi was close to profitability as a separate unit.

Barron's doesn't seem to think it's a big deal and even went so far as to declare that grocery stores and big-box home improvement stores are immune to Amazon's charge in last weekend's edition. I wanted to bang my head on the desk! There is no such thing as an "Amazon-Proof" retailer and any investor who makes the mistake of thinking there is may as well take his or her money to Vegas where at least they'll have fun losing it. Here's how to make sure that'll never be you. Mainstream Press or Mainstream Mess? Barron's, one of the most widely respected financial publications in circulation – and one I love to read because it's so good – has offered not one, but two "head-to-wall-banging" statements about Amazon in recent weeks. I don't know if it's a fear of change or just a human inability to understand it, but I cannot stress enough how poorly thought out some of the arguments are. Nor can I ignore the amount of money such failed logic will cost any investor who fails to understand the real impact Amazon has on our world. First, Barron's argued that Amazon faces steep challenges in its emerging grocery business as it introduces new technologies to expedite deliveries and reduce the amount of time that customers need to be in a store actually buying products. Barron's contention is that Americans like to go to – and spend time in – the grocery store. According to survey data, they state that fast checkout times just don't matter to consumers. Bang! – that was the sound of my forehead as it hit my desk. Then, just a few pages later, the newspaper wrote that home improvement retailers like The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW) have "virtually Amazon-proof" business models. Bang! – my forehead hitting my desktop yet again. The idea that a retail business model is immune to Amazon's charge is naïve at best and exceptionally shortsighted at worst. Either way, it's a costly notion. The situation reminds me of Thomas Watson in 1943 when he said that he thought there was "a world market for maybe five computers." Or Spencer Silver, the chemist who said that "the literature was full of examples that said you can't do this" right before he invented the adhesive that made 3M Co.'s (NYSE: MMM) Post-it notes possible. To be fair, I don't want to call out the writers at Barron's. Most of the arguments they advanced actually originated with Wall Street analysts who "cover" grocery store stocks and big-box retailers in a way that would make politicians green with envy. Once again, Wall Street and the financial press are ignoring history. When they're told that a disruptive company like Amazon can turn an industry on its side, they stick their fingers in their ears and scream the five most dangerous words in the English language… "it'll be different this time." Right… and I've got a bridge to sell you… After 20 years of watching Amazon become the disrupter of all disrupters, how can they possibly believe that there are Amazon-proof retailers?! Lessons from History There was a time that one could argue – as many did – that traditional and fashion retail companies had the same advantages Barron's has touted about the grocery and home improvement businesses. Back in the 1990s, malls were packed. They were a popular destination for an entire generation of shoppers. I remember when it took longer to find a parking spot than it did to pick out a shirt. Then technology showed up and a young man named Jeff Bezos lit the world on fire in July of 1995 when Amazon.com opened for business and billed itself as the "Earth's Biggest Book Store." By September 1996 – only 14 months later – the company had 100 employees and sales of more than $15.7 million. Chances are you know the rest of the story like I do. Here's where it really hits home and why I've decided to write to you on this topic today. Take a look at this chart. It's the peak market capitalization of eight iconic brick-and-mortar retailers – brands you know by heart – and Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) from 2006 and 2016. See if you can spot the trend. Red, red, red, and more red. The only other retailer posting positive capitalization growth over the last 10 years has been Walmart with a measly 2%. Meanwhile, Amazon's market capitalization increased by 1,910%. JCPenney and Sears… they're closing stores and approaching a fiscal implosion that too many should have seen 10 years ago. These retail companies failed to understand their customers' taste and changes in shopping behavior. Just this week, Payless ShoeSource filed for Chapter 11. J. Crew just shut down its flagship Fifth Avenue shop and admitted it has $2 billion in debt – a large chunk of which is due next year. More retailers have declared bankruptcy in the first three months of 2017 than they did for the entire 12 months of last year. It's only a matter of time before Amazon figures out how to package groceries and lumber. As I have said many times over and for many months now, "it's Amazon versus everybody else and any retailer without an Amazon defense strategy is living on borrowed time." There are two ways to play this. Longer term, there's no question you want to own shares of Amazon. The company has returned 4951.33% since it went public in May 1997, turning every $10,000 invested into more than $505,133 today. Obviously, that's an expensive proposition – at about $900 a share, you can either buy 100 shares or a really nice house in the competitive San Francisco Bay area. Normally I'd suggest a Direct Stock Purchase plan as a way around this problem, but Amazon doesn't offer one at the moment. So consider buying just a few shares at a time. Heck, buy even one if that's what you can afford. Then, throw away the proverbial key. Amazon may well be the only company in the world today that you can buy today and expect to hold for the rest of your investing lifetime. There's no doubt that Amazon will go up and down, but what makes it so very compelling is that the odds that Amazon will go out of business are virtually nil. That means, in keeping with how we do things around here Total Wealth Style, you will be investing based on the certainty of growth rather than the uncertainty of risk. Never forget that Wall Street has a vested interest in protecting what's in the rear-view mirror, but you have a vested interest in building wealth based on what's ahead.

I was 6 when I got my first camera — it was the first thing I used my allowance on. It was an old 110 Kodak camera. I was hooked from that moment and although there were moments where photography was not in the forefront, it was never too far behind (whether I realized it or not). So, since my boys were 7, I thought it was a great time for them to get started and was really excited (and a little nervous) about getting the opportunity to teach them. Their experience thus far had been taking pictures with their iPad Minis. I personally detest taking pictures with iPhones and iPads. It just doesn’t feel natural and is very awkward for me. However, that’s the world we live in. Their first non-iPad cameras were inexpensive Canon point and shoots. My thought process was that in full auto I would have the opportunity to teach them about composition and how to identify light without getting caught up in all the controls, modes, and details (at least not yet). Steven Jr with his little red Canon. 2015. Ayden and Steven Jr. were both very excited to get their cameras. I took them to the beach for their first run at it and they shot and shot and shot. When we got home and looked at the images they had probably 1,000 to 1,500 images each… of nothing! Sand, blurry rocks, unidentifiable objects, and blown out water (as close as they could get with it). They were a little disappointed, to say the least. The second time out, I reminded them to slow down and take the time to frame and “see” the shot before taking it. Again, 1,000 shots of nothing. Now some will read this as me punishing them but that is not the case at all. I just fell back to what worked for me: film. When I was 6 years old and had my brand new 110 camera, I blew through the first roll. Once I understood how much it cost to develop, process, and print, I went much slower and took the time to find interesting subjects instead of shooting anything and everything I saw. Steven Jr’s shot from Cerro Gordo. Shot with his Canon Sure Shot 76 Zoom, Tri-X, and entered into his school art contest. 2016. So, we took the digital cameras and replaced them with film cameras that we got off of eBay for about $20 each (one is a Canon Sure Shot 76 Zoom and the other a Vivitar 2001 Z). As expected, the first time out they blew through the entire roll within a matter of minutes. When they were done they asked for more film. When I told them that 36 was all they got, they were bummed (especially since I continued to shoot the rest of the trip). However, the next trip out with the same constraints (36 shots), the roll lasted the entire two-day trip. One of the boys actually left two frames unused. What made this special, other than just getting through to them, was that we developed and scanned the film together at home (We printed the image at Richard Photo Labs here in Valencia, CA.). That tangible process helped them understand what it means to “create” an image. Steven Jr. entered a shot he took on the trip (above, from the Cerro Gordo Mountains of the Sierra’s) into his school art contest and was able to place with it. His shot was the only film shot in the contest (all the others were from phones or iPads). He was quite proud of it. Ayden’s shot of the Tufa @ Mono Lake with his Vivitar 2001 Z and Tri-X. 2016. Over the next several months they got better and better. My next step was to start teaching them how to control depth of field. I needed a camera that could give them instant feedback as well as aperture priority mode. The old film cameras were great but lacked in the instant feedback area. So, it was time to move back to digital. I took them to several stores so they could actually hold the different cameras so they could get something they would be comfortable with. This is surprisingly getting harder and harder to do. Many of the box stores have either broken demo units or the shelf is just empty. Best Buy and Walmart are both absolutely horrid (in my area) for doing this. Ayden shooting from Cerro Gordo with his Vivitar 2001 Z. 2016. I told them whatever they got had to have A, P, and M modes and be under $300. They decided on the Sony DSC-HX80. Right before Christmas, this model was marked down to $280. Currently it’s listed at Best Buy online for $339.99. Small, not as fully featured as the RX series, but has everything they need to continue learning photography and within budget. It has been a great little camera thus far and I can see it being used for quite some time before needing to get into an SLR. Steven Jr’s shot of me shooting the sunset @ El Capitan State Beach, CA. Sony HX-80. 2017. I don’t know if photography will drive either of them the way it has driven me, but during this process, I learned a few things from them too. First, iPad/iPhone first behavior drives the expectations with regard to how “all” electronics should work. They were (at first) frustrated that they could not swipe or tap menus on a “real” camera. I personally still prefer physical buttons. Second, they don’t hesitate. I shoot primarily fashion, beauty, and portraits but love just about every genre of photography. When we travel I will get up early (or stay out late) and spend a half hour or more trying to get the scene just right. Not them. They see it and shoot. Without the constraints of information and camera geekery they have the freedom to compose and go. Third, they see what they see. Much like five photographers shooting the same subject and each comes back with a different interpretation, the boys just “see” things different. Call it youth or inexperience but how they perceive the world and decide to capture it is refreshing and sometimes putting down the camera and just watching them take in and capture the world around them is quite special. Steven Jr’s shot of his brother @ El Capitan State Beach, CA. Sony HX-80. 2017 I am not suggesting that everyone needs a film camera to learn photography (or to teach their kids). For me it was beneficial. Everything these days is instant. It’s what they are used to. Getting them to slow down, find better subjects, and work through what the resulting image would be was challenging. Film helped. Getting the opportunity to process and scan it was not only a learning experience but fun for them as well. It was a great starting point and to this day they still ask to shoot the film cameras from time to time. Steven Jr’s shot of a surfer in Santa Cruz, CA. Sony HX-80. 2017. I am not one to force my passions (sports, hobbies, etc) onto my children. I want each of them to be their own person. I want them to experience the world through their eyes and not mine. They came to me about learning photography. However, as I pack up and prepare for our weekend trip, I can’t help but smile as I grab my gear bag and one of them says, “Daddy, don’t forget my camera”.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Former Microsoft Managers Take on LinkedIn By Rachel Lerman PUBLISHED: APRIL 17 2017 Two former Microsoft managers have set out to challenge their ex-employer's LinkedIn service with the Thursday launch of a new professional networking site -- and this one pays users to reply to recruiting messages. Bellevue-based Nextio was founded by Anoop Gupta [pictured, top left], who had been a distinguished scientist at Microsoft and technology assistant to Bill Gates, and Aravind Bala [pictured, bottom left], a former engineering manager at Microsoft. The pair left Microsoft 18 months ago to start their own venture, the seeds of which were planted during their time trying to recruit talented engineers to Microsoft. Recruiters that worked with Gupta and Bala subscribed to services from LinkedIn -- which Microsoft bought for $26.2 billion last year -- that gave them access to more people's profiles and the ability to send direct messages to those LinkedIn users. Recruiters can pay LinkedIn thousands of dollars a year for those premium services, Nextio CEO Gupta said. But he thought the payment should go to the user who is being recruited. On Nextio, people can state preferences in their profile on when they are willing to be contacted. Want to talk about the Mariners game last night? Send away. Want to talk about interviewing for a job? That will be $8, please. Each person can indicate when they are willing to be contacted, along with their price for replying to recruiting or other promotional offers. The money can be sent to them or they can indicate if they would rather have the money donated to charity. The idea is to pay someone for their most valuable resource -- their attention, Gupta said. "We thought if the recipient actually got some money, it would make them pay attention to the message," Gupta said. "It says, 'Someone is willing to pay money to talk to you.' " Nextio will take a 20 percent cut of message payments. Another unique feature of Nextio is its Career Insights, which gives users a deep look into others' careers paths. The Career Insights feature uses data collected from people's public professional profiles to show the experience and skills of people in any job. Nextio has six full-time employees and has raised $2.2 million from investors including Tableau co-founder Pat Hanrahan and former Microsoft executive Craig Mundie. © 2017 Seattle Times under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Wal-Mart Discounts In-Store Pickup Next Article > Facebook Targets 30,000 Fake France Accounts Before Election PUBLISHED: APRIL 14 2017 Facebook says it has targeted 30,000 fake accounts linked to France ahead of the country's presidential election, as part of a worldwide effort against misinformation. The company said Thursday it's trying to "reduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts." It said its efforts "enabled us to take action" against the French accounts and that it is removing sites with the highest traffic. Facebook and French media are also running fact-checking programs in France to combat misleading information, especially around the campaign for the two-round April 23-May 7 presidential election. European authorities have also pressured Facebook and Twitter to remove extremist propaganda or other postings that violate European hate speech or other laws. Facebook ramped up its efforts against the spread of false news and misinformation on its service in December, a month after the U.S. presidential election. The company said at the time that it will focus on the "worst of the worst" offenders and partner with outside fact-checkers and news organizations to sort honest news reports from made-up stories. It was accused of allowing the spread of false news in the months leading up to the U.S. election, which critics said may have helped sway the results in favor of Donald Trump. Since December, the company has broadened its efforts beyond the U.S. Last week, it launched a resource to help users spot false news in 14 countries including the U.S., France and Germany. It's a notification, available for a few days, that leads users to a list of tips for spotting false news and ways to report it. Facebook's other efforts include participating with other companies and tech industry leaders to establish a "news integrity" nonprofit organization to promote news literacy and increase the public's trust in journalism. A nascent Facebook Journalism Project , meanwhile, is a lofty effort to work with news organizations to develop products, provide tools for journalists and generally promote trust in news. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

The academies were first introduced in 2016 and have expanded to 40 states.   “Everything we do begins with our associates,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Walmart. “That’s why we have invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today’s retail environment. These investments are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster check-out times.”   Walmart training academies are dedicated facilities where associates receive instruction on retail fundamentals and area specific skills. Since the program launched, the curriculum has expanded training to cover more than 65 positions, including customer service manager, online grocery pickup, and assistant store manager. Associates are trained through a combination of classroom and sales floor exercises, utilizing technology including tablet computers and cloud storage for training materials.     Walmart plans to have a total of 200 academies opened across all 50 states by the end of this summer. Since 2016, more than 52,000 associates have graduated, with more than 225,000 associates on track to complete training in 2017.   Associates who go through training academy programs are able to earn an income while they learn new skills, according to Walmart.

It doesn’t look like there’s anything to note about the purchase in terms of its relation to Tesla, however, besides its physical proximity… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services The report notes that Google plans to “eventually” build a data center on those 1,210 acres, part of the 107,000-acre Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Google last week bought land stretching across 1,210 acres at a private industrial park east of Reno, Nev., for $29.1 million, according to people familiar with the deal and documents filed late Friday in Storey County, Nev. The Alphabet Inc. unit aims eventually to build a data center at the 107,000-acre Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, according to these people… Google paid $29.1 million for the land, the WSJ notes. The Mountain View company is just the latest to join a plethora of others at Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, the largest of its kind, which also serves as home for the logistics centers for Walmart, Home Depot, PetSmart, and facilities for more than 100 other companies (including Tesla, of course).

 Wealthy shoppers have a new mentality that signals doom for Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Tiffany Hayley Peterson Apr. 17, 2017, 11:45 AM 14,558 facebook linkedin twitter email print Wealthier shoppers have become bargain hunters. Facebook/Neiman Marcus Wealthier shoppers have become bargain hunters, and that's hurting retailers like Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Shoppers with lower incomes have been hunting bargains for years. They started gravitating toward discount retailers like TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and dollar stores during the recession, and many never went back to shopping full-price. That has had a crippling effect on full-price department stores like Macy's, JCPenney, and Sears, which have been closing hundreds of stores in the face of falling traffic and sales. Now America's wealthiest shoppers are embracing that habit, signaling trouble ahead for the US luxury market. Wealthy shoppers are comparing prices among retailers on everything they buy, and their brand loyalty has plummeted. Sales of personal luxury goods, such as designer clothing and accessories, fell 1% last year, marking the first decline since 2009, according to Bain & Company data cited by The Wall Street Journal. A Neiman Marcus ad. Facebook/Neiman Marcus "There's no question that our core customer is visiting us a little less frequently," Karen Katz, Neiman Marcus' CEO, told analysts on an earnings call in December. "Customers, in general, are less loyal to any one retailer, and I think a lot of that is because of the price transparency of online. I think that's here to stay. I don't think that's going to change." In the most recent quarter, same-stores sales fell 6.8% at Neiman Marcus and 0.9% at Nordstrom, including a 6.8% drop at its full-priced stores. Saks' same-store sales were flat. Retailers like the high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. and the preppy clothing brand Ralph Lauren have also been struggling, and both recently pushed out their CEOs, The Journal notes. Price-comparison shopping is nothing new. Companies like Amazon are making it easier than ever for people to compare prices online by offering tools like barcode scanners, which customers can access through their smartphones and use in stores to easily check prices on specific items. Because that trend is reaching America's wealthiest customers and companies like Amazon and Walmart are breaking into the luxury fashion market, high-end retailers are struggling to set themselves apart. Neiman Marcus is tackling the issue by offering more exclusive products and "making sure the vendors that we do business with have less of a distribution in the US," Katz said. Meanwhile, Saks is trying to make its stores more "exciting," according to Jerry Storch, CEO of Hudson's Bay Company, Saks' parent. "We are focused on continuing to delight our customers with exclusive product offerings and custom all-channel shopping experiences, and by creating exciting retail destinations to increase foot traffic in our stores," Storch said in January.

So, it was no surprise that Leonard Court, the Chamber’s witness at a hearing on the anti-worker “Working Families Flexibility Act,” supported it. Court testified to all of the supposed protections against abuse of workers and loss of overtime pay the bill provides. But, he tried and failed to explain away why every significant labor or women’s group in the country opposes the bill known colloquially as the “comp time” bill. Most significantly, Court never mentioned the fundamental reason employee advocates hate the bill, the reason being that it’s a total fraud. ADVERTISEMENT Under current law, an employer that honestly wants to give an employee time off to compensate for the sacrifice of working extra hours can do so. No legislation is required. The employer simply pays for the overtime when it’s worked and then gives the employee unpaid time off when the employee requests it. The employee gets the money first and the leave later.   The comp time bill turns this around — to the detriment of the workers. It gives employers the right to hang onto their employees’ overtime pay for months and months without paying interest on it or necessarily ever giving compensatory time off. Calling this a scam is being gentle. Why is H.R. 1180 called the “comp time bill"? It’s because the overtime pay the employer withholds is put into a notional “bank” where it can be withdrawn and paid to the employee who takes leave at a time when the boss says it’s okay. The employee has no right even to use the paid time off when it’s actually needed or most convenient. Corporate Congress: A bill to replace overtime pay with 'comp time' is back, and it will hurt workers https://t.co/3oz2aGnFwv #FightFor15 pic.twitter.com/kaetpB3Uzk— Fight For 15 (@fightfor15) April 8, 2017 The employee can use the leave time “within a reasonable period after making the request if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.” Employees denied leave when they need it can’t afford to litigate over what a “reasonable period” is or whether their use of comp time is “unduly disruptive.” In any event, by the time they filed a complaint, the day they needed the leave would have passed, and years might pass before the complaint is litigated or settled.  Despite the claims of its sponsor, Rep. Martha RobyMartha RobyCalling the 'comp time bill' a scam is putting it gently Overtime pay isn't a cure-all: Make work flexible without the red tape 'Comp time' bill is back, but still hurts workers MORE (R-Ala.), H.R. 1180 does absolutely nothing to improve family flexibility. It provides no paid leave, paid sick days, paid vacation, or even fairer scheduling. But it does undermine the Fair Labor Standards Act and the norm of a 40-hour work week by giving a new right to employers: the right not to pay for overtime hours when the overtime is worked. The bill lets employers hold onto their cash for as long as an entire year before paying the employee for his or her overtime. While the employees’ overtime pay is in the comp time “bank”, it is at risk. The Small Business Association reports that 400,000 businesses fail and close each year. The Chamber’s witness says, “So what? The wages will be given priority in bankruptcy.” But instead of risking only last week’s wages for 40 hours of work, the comp time bank can hold up to 160 hours of overtime pay — four weeks’ pay, a loss many workers might not survive. Mr. Court dismisses the idea that comp time would be an interest-free loan from workers to corporations, but that’s exactly what it is. Imagine a Wal-Mart sized employer with a comp time bank holding 100 hours of overtime pay for each of 100,000 employees paid $10 an hour. That’s a $100 million loan, interest-free from the employees to Wal-Mart. The House might pass this gift to employers, but I trust that enough senators will look behind the family-friendly name and see this legislation for the anti-worker fraud that it is — and defeat it.   Ross Eisenbrey is the vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank created to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers in economic policy discussions.
