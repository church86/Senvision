Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Annual Christmas Spirit Campaign Looking For Volunteers, Sponsors Nov 03,2016 by Bethany Hooper OCEAN CITY – The Young Professionals of Ocean City are gearing up for their 6th Annual Christmas Spirit Campaign, and members are looking for volunteers and sponsors to help the children. Each year, the Young Professionals look to the community to sponsor a Christmas shopping day for underprivileged youth who attend Buckingham, Ocean City and Showell Elementary schools. Each of the schools, in addition to the Worcester Youth and Family Services, select an average of 10 children to participate in the event each year. The kids will meet at Outback Steakhouse in West Ocean City at 5:30 on the morning of Dec. 3, where a transit bus provided by the Town of Ocean City will take them to Walmart. Once there, each child is paired with a chaperone and given $100 to buy gifts for their families and themselves. “It’s fun,” co-chair Cate Nellans said. “It’s a worthwhile cause, and it’s worth it to see them shop. They always want to buy things for their mother or grandmother, and we always have to tell them it is okay to shop for themselves. They really want to shop for their families.” Nellans said the campaign is looking for individuals to chaperone and entertain more than 50 children that morning as they make their way from the Berlin Walmart to Outback Steakhouse, where they will receive breakfast with Santa. “We really need volunteers right now, especially as we go back to Outback for breakfast,” she said. “That is where we lacked help last year.” Currently, 16 individuals have signed up to participate as chaperones, but Nellans said the campaign is in desperate need of volunteers for each of the children. SonRise is already working with the group to provide entertainment and refreshments as kids wait to get their presents wrapped by the Young Professionals. Children in grades first through fifth will have the chance to participate in games in Walmart’s activity room and at Outback Steakhouse at the conclusion of their shopping trip. With just a month left, members are encouraging locals and businesses to either donate or sponsor a child for the event. Those wishing to sponsor have three levels to choose from, with options ranging from $100 to $500. Businesses that choose to sponsor a child will have their name put on the event’s banners. However, those who cannot afford to sponsor are encouraged to volunteer or contribute in-kind donations, such as wrapping paper, bows, ribbons and tape. Last year, at least 75 individuals and businesses, including Walmart, Outback Steakhouse, SonRise and Burley Oak, contributed to the shopping fund and the event’s festivities, according to Nellans. Fundraising is continuing to move at the same pace as last year, but additional funds above the required amount will provide more children with the opportunity to join the event, according to the event’s committee. Any money left at the end of the trip will be placed into the next year’s fund. The Young Professionals supplement the fund by hosting fundraisers throughout the year, including a Christmas in July celebration and a wine tasting event. The organization will also host its last fundraiser for the event at Burley Oak in the near future, although no date has been set. For more information, or to participate as a volunteer, message the Young Professionals Facebook page, or visit the Ocean City Chamber of Commerce website at www.oceancity.org and click on the Christmas Spirit Campaign banner at the bottom of the page. Volunteers must complete a form and background check before the event. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Bethany Hooper Bethany Hooper has been with The Dispatch since 2016.

The woman, who is identified in the complaint by the pseudonym of “Jane Doe,” was an employee at the Route 1 store in this township when the alleged sexual assault occurred on June 13, 2015. The overnight manager at the time, Henry A. Deleon, was charged a week later with sexual assault. He was indicted in January by a Mercer County grand jury and eventually pleaded guilty to a lower offense, fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, which spared him from serving time in prison. Deleon, 25, of Trenton, was sentenced in July to two years of probation. Walmart fired him after his arrest last year, a company spokesman said Wednesday. News of the attack at the store is being reported for the first time by New Jersey 101.5, which obtained a copy of the woman’s lawsuit in federal district court of New Jersey. The lawsuit claims Walmart officials ignored the woman’s repeated complaints about Deleon and that other female employees also had filed sexual harassment complaints against him. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages, alleging claims of a hostile work environment under the state’s Law Against Discrimination. The woman said she was forced to quit her job because of the “intolerable” work environment caused by Walmart waiting only until police arrested Deleon before firing him. A spokesman for Walmart said the company had not yet been served with a copy of the lawsuit. “We take the allegations seriously,” Randy Hargrove said. “Our associates are expected to act professionally at all times and if they do not we will take appropriate action.” Deleon is also named as a defendant. It was not clear Thursday if he had an attorney. Sergio Bichao is deputy digital editor at New Jersey 101.5.

Wal-Mart customer questions shift to new discount program Lee Rood , lrood@dmreg.com 6:16 p.m. CDT November 3, 2016 Walmart (Photo: Getty Images) Sherry Erickson doesn’t have a car, doesn’t splurge on cable, can’t afford the newspaper. Living on about $700 a month, the Des Moines east-sider takes saving money on groceries seriously. So much so, Erickson actually took a class in Ankeny on how to make the most of coupons and grocery store promotions, she said. That’s why the 54-year-old was alarmed this week when she went to Wal-Mart in Windsor Heights and learned the store had discontinued matching lower prices of competitors in print ads. A store cashier, she says, gave her the impression the store also had quit taking coupons. “Why are they doing this?” asked Erickson, who lives on Social Security Disability. “It’s the world’s biggest box store.” A local store manager said Friday Erickson needn’t worry: The store still takes coupons. In early October, it also dropped prices on more than 15,000 items, he said. That was in anticipation for Oct. 24, when the store quit matching competitor’s lower prices in print ads at the register. Instead, the store is telling customers to use Wal-Mart’s app, which includes a discount program called Savings Catcher. Savings Catcher refunds the difference in the lower price of an item advertised by a competitor and refunds it back to customers by way of a Wal-Mart e-gift card. The switch is happening at stores across Iowa because more people have been using the Savings Catcher app than price matching, according to Ryan Oshel, the Windsor Heights store manager. “People will save a lot of money on this,” Oshel promised. “It’s happening at stores around the state, but not 100 percent of Iowa.” Shoppers who use Savings Catcher on the Wal-Mart app take a picture of the receipt bar code or type in their receipt number and receive the difference in price on the e-gift card within 72 hours. Oshel said the store dropped prices ahead of the switch as an enticement. The slashing affected everything from laundry detergent to vitamins to frozen beef patties, he said. The Savings Catcher app, he said, searches Wal-Mart’s prices on the receipt and compares them with those advertised by competitors. It pays the difference when the competitor beats out Wal-Mart. Oshel said no retailer wants to quit taking coupons. “We love for people to use coupons. It’s savings for customers and like cash to us. If the coupon is 35 cents, we get reimbursed for that. Coupons are designed to get people to try a new product or get people to switch over.” Those who still favor price matching, however, have criticized the new app, which has been rolled out nationally since March. (Wal-Mart’s national PR folks have not said exactly how many stores are affected.) The website PriceMatchWithRachel.com, for example, says the app misses deals on some fresh produce, bakery items or items sold in multiples, such as two for $5. And the app only makes price comparisons with national retailers, not local chains. Other consumer advocates, however, say the app could speed up lines at the register. And, for better or worse, the e-cards guarantee the savings is spent back at Wal-Mart. Erickson says she’s relieved to hear Wal-Mart was still accepting coupons. But she’s not thrilled about not getting to take home her savings from price-matching in cash. “The whole principle is to have extra money to pay bills,” she said. She says she will probably still shop at Wal-Mart with coupons, but go to other stores more often when price-matching will save her cash.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Related Walmart stops accepting Visa at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

Walmart Adding Chase Pay As An Online, In-App Payment Option Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Adding Chase Pay As An Online, In-App Payment Option Image courtesy of Patrick November 3, 2016 1:29 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk Another Way To Pay mobile payment systems mobile payments walmart retailers chase pay jp morgan chase Despite the fact that Walmart already offers its own mobile payment system, the retailer is opening up doors to other forms of digital payments in an effort to cut costs on processing electronic transactions. Walmart customers will be able to use Chase Pay starting next year to pay for purchases both on Walmart.com and in the Walmart app, The Wall Street Journal reports, while shoppers can also use Walmart Pay in physical stores. Walmart is trying to reduce the fees it has to pay for taking debit and credit card payments, and conveniently enough, Chase has said that merchants who use its payment services could pay lower fees for card transactions than they would otherwise. In September, Walmart also said it would use Chase’s back-end system called ChaseNet to process card transactions at lower rates. “We believe the agreements we have announced will bring much needed competition to the payments markets,” a Walmart spokesman said. This isn’t Walmart’s first time at the mobile payments rodeo: along with its proprietary Walmart Pay system, the retailer is a member of the Merchant Customer Exchange, known as MCX, which is a group of companies that got together in 2012 and planned on building a mobile payment technology called CurrentC that would compete with others in the field. But because it’s not terribly easy to create an entirely new payment system, those efforts have apparently been put on hold for the time being. “MCX is focused on our core business working with our merchants and financial institutions,” the group, which also has an agreement to use Chase Pay, told the WSJ in a statement. “We see value in both MCX and Chase Pay,” Walmart’s spokesman added to the WSJ.

Published Nov 3rd, 2016 12:41 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas About two months into his new role as CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce, Marc Lore has seen several management changes, including at least three departures of high-ranking execs from the division based in San Bruno, Calif. Those departing are Neil Ashe, former president and CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce; Fernando Madeira, president and CEO of Walmart.com; and Diane Mills, a senior vice president of human resources for the eCommerce division. No departure date has been set for the executives because they are still working on projects, according to corporate spokesman Dan Toporek. Lore replaced Ashe as the division boss. “It’s a transitional time,” Toporek said, adding that many of the big structural pieces required for its e-commerce operations were now in place. Toperek told Talk Business & Politics Ashe and Maderia’s plans to leave were announced before Lore took over as CEO. The retailer confirmed that Brent Beabout, who oversaw the digital supply chain, left the company a few weeks ago. He will be replaced by Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust. Wal-Mart said the roles of the new team is being reshaped following the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition which was finalized last month. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said Aug. 8 that Ashe “has made great progress running and growing the business … re-platforming, nearly doubling the GMV (gross merchandise value) of online offerings, building a winning e-commerce team but now there is a natural inflection of leadership change.” McMillon also said the two brands — Walmart.com and Jet.com —will co-exist separately but be managed by Lore. He said Lore will take the best of both brands and blend improvements that benefit the entire company. Some of the first things analysts expect Lore to fix at Walmart.com is improved search capabilities and incorporating the popular customer pricing options as they fill their online baskets. McMillon said the pricing algorithm which adjusts as customers opt to buy in bulk or chose other low cost shipping options has helped Jet.com increase its average basket amount over the traditional online order. Jet.com’s average basket contains 6 items worth more than $80, compared to single items at most retailers. McMillon is also fond of the supplier relationships that Jet.com forged for its system. While some of the suppliers will likely never be a good fit for Wal-Mart’s everyday low price strategy, the retail giant may find areas to offer a wider variety of items online. Jet doubled its one-day delivery of first party products penetration rate from 25% to 50% of U.S. households since the site launched in 2014. Jet is approaching 99% of U.S. households for two-day delivery. In New York City Jet offers same-day delivery at no additional costs to its shoppers. Analysts now wonder what this might mean for Walmart’s $49 annual Shipping Pass service for two-day delivery. Jet is also making some headway in online grocery delivery as Walmart U.S. has been piloting the service in limited markets since 2014. Walmart announced in June plans to test online grocery delivery using Uber and Lyft in Denver and Phoenix. Jet is delivering fresh grocery only in select East Coast areas, but has plans to expand into more cities next year. Analysts wonder how Lore might change the retailers’ online grocery strategy. A criticism of Jet.com was that the online retailer was not making money. Lore said prior to the deal with Wal-Mart that Jet.com might not make money until 2020.

With a 7.9" Retina display, A7 chip with M7 motion coprocessor, Front and Back cameras, the iPad mini 2 is still a valid choice. It is ideal for casual use and as second screen while watching TV. It is also great for young kids. Walmart offers the iPad mini 2 32GB in white and space gray online at walmart.com for $219.99. Walmart's habbit using the original sales price of the iPad mini 2 as reference for calculating the savings is confusing. Apple has reduced the price of the iPad mini 2, at the time of the launch of the iPad mini 4. Walmart's stated $95.63 savings are not real. It's $49 compared to the current regular price of the iPad mini 2. At this point it is hard to predict if Walmart is cutting the price of the iPad mini 2 further closer to Black Friday. We have to wait for the highly anticipated Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad to find out. As many other retailers are releasing their Black Friday 2016 ad this week, there is a chance that Walmart is also releasing their ad before the Presidential election. Our initial release date prediction is November 11, based on past years. Find the best Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals on sale today in our Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals list.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Someone Just Bought Sony PS4 Pro At A Walmart Posted: Nov 3 2016, 12:25pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 1:43pm CDT, in News | Technology News   Credit: Juniper Roth Twitter   So much for waiting until November 10 for a Sony PS4 Pro. Why pre-order the Sony PS4 Pro and wait for its November 10, when you just can waltz into your local Walmart and buy one now? This is what person identified on Twitter as Juniper Roth in Tucson Arizona just did. He bought the $399 Sony PS4 Pro at his local Walmart and posted a bunch of photos of his new PS4 Pro. How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock We have seen journalists showing off their PS4 Pro review units they received this week. Now the first Sony fan has his PS4 Pro in his hands. The Sony PS4 Pro comes with a 1TB hard-drive. The photos published by Juniper Roth show the HDD slot of the PS4 Pro and the drive itself amongst other details. The series of photos is mini unboxing. See the photos below. The Sony PS4 Pro features increased performance to handle 4K gameplay and HDR. Sony briefed several journalists on the PS4 Pro and showed the side-by-side comparisons of games running on PS4 and PS4 Pro. The difference is dramatic and well worth the $100 extra. Not only does the PS4 Pro improve the quality of 4K optimized games, but also games with lower resolution using a technique called checkerboard rendering. The Sony PS4 Pro will be in stores that follow street dates on Thursday November 10. You can try your local Walmart if you can get them to sell you the PS4 Pro now. They have it in their storage already. So far we have not seen a PS4 Pro Black Friday deal and we do not anticipate to see one. It also looks like that Sony is not even offering a PS4 Pro Bundle for the Holidays. Based on the first released Black Friday 2016 ads there are also no new PS4 Slim bundles. Sony is not seeing the need to match Microsoft's Xbox One S Holiday bundle bonanza. Update: See the latest tweets from Juniper Roth below. The owner of the PS4 Pro is taking questions via Twitter.

The digital wallet will be integrated into the Walmart app for in-store purchases, allowing Chase Visa credit and debit cardholders to pay at the checkout by showing a QR code to the cashier. Chase Pay will also be added to Walmart's website next year, allowing customers to make online purchases while earning rewards and receiving offers. The service secures transactions with token technology, which utilizes one-time complex codes to process transactions and keep card information secure. Chase Pay differs from Apple Pay, which uses contactless NFC technology and is secured with Touch ID in addition to tokenization. Walmart has so far refused to adopt Apple Pay, opting for QR code payments services like Walmart Pay and Chase Pay instead. The retailer has said it is open to supporting other digital wallets in the future. Chase Pay was created in partnership with MCX, the consortium behind the indefinitely postponed payments service CurrentC. Walmart was a leading member of MCX between 2012 and 2015, when the consortium's three-year exclusivity window expired. In 2014, Walmart explicitly said it would not accept Apple Pay. Walmart's app is a free download on the App Store [Direct Link] for iPhone.

The credit card giant has launched an advertising campaign in which it offers a $10 credit to Manitoba cardholders who spend $50 or more at grocery stores in the province. Cardholders must register their number before Nov. 15 at visa.ca/Manitoba and they'll automatically receive the credit within 15 days of making their purchase. Visa is in the midst of a fee dispute with Walmart, which stopped accepting the card at its 16 Manitoba stores on Oct. 24. The retail giant vowed in June to stop accepting Visa at all of its more than 400 Canadian outlets if Visa doesn't lower its credit card fee, which it charges to all of its retail customers. A month later, Walmart started banning Visa cards at its stores in Thunder Bay. The ad campaign doesn't mention Walmart or the fee dispute. Carla Hindman, a spokeswoman for Visa Canada, said it's not unusual for the company to conduct promotions that encourage cardholders to use their Visa cards in new and different places. Asked if this particular promotion was aimed at encouraging them to buy their groceries from someone other than Walmart, Hindman said, "We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to." She said Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay after Walmart banned its cards in its stores there. The offer there was a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, said "We don't comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand." Prof. Sylvain Charlebois, a Canadian food-industry analyst at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, described this latest move by Visa as interesting and unusual. "Visa is positioning itself as the saviour of consumers and saying, 'Look, Walmart is complaining about our fee but here is what we're trying to do for you,"' he said. "It's the battle of who is being the protector of the grocery shopper." Walmart said it pays more than $100 million in fees annually for customers to use the various brands of credit cards, and that Visa's fees are too high. It hasn't said how soon it may extend the ban to other cities and provinces. Visa -- Canada's largest credit card firm -- has said it offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, but the retailer wants more. It said if it gives in, Walmart's fees would be lower than those charged to other grocers and many of its other retail customers. Charlebois said that's the crux of the issue for Visa Canada, and the main reason it's refusing to cave in to Walmart's demands. If it does, other retailers will demand a reduction in their fees, as well. "I think Visa may actually see this as a significant threat which could impact their entire business model, not just their business with Walmart," he said.

Chase Pay is currently live on “select merchant websites”, JPMorgan Chase says, but the service “will launch for mobile payments at participating merchant registers and a form of payment in select merchant apps later this year”. “We are excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with even greater convenience and value to our Walmart Pay app,” says Mike Cook, senior vice president and assistant treasurer for Walmart. “Adding Chase Pay as an option within Walmart Pay and online will create an enhanced experience for our customers.” Walmart Pay was unveiled in December 2015 and went live for iPhone users in April 2016, before completing a nationwide rollout in July this year. Chase Pay was unveiled during Money20/20 in Las Vegas in October 2015.

The progressive creep of the holiday shopping season has reached its largest point this year, with the first sales now starting shortly after the calendar turns to November. Shoppers looking for Black Friday 2016 sales already know what they’ll be getting from the e-commerce giant Amazon, which has released thousands of sale items and some special offers. Walmart has also started releasing some of its pre-Black Friday 2016 deals, a preview of the sales that will kick in at Thanksgiving. Amazon launched its Black Friday 2016 sales this week, listing tens of thousands of items with deep discounts through its Black Friday Deals Store. The store will remain open through December 22, with expanded options for how shoppers can order. The site will be offering a $5 gift card for those who buy one of the exclusive deals through Alexa voice shopping, for example. “This holiday season, we’re offering more deals than ever before and — for the first time ever — giving Prime members an opportunity to use Alexa voice shopping for purchasing their holiday gifts hands-free,” Doug Herrington, the senior vice president of North American Retail at Amazon, said in a statement (via Fox News). There are some other special offers to entice shoppers to Amazon this holiday shopping season. Members of Amazon Prime also get a 20 percent discount on pre-order and new release video games, Fox News noted. And shoppers who might need a bit of help finding the right present can check out the more than 20 gift guides offered by Amazon for Black Friday 2016.

The Black Friday 2016 ad has also leaked from Sam’s Club, BGR reported. Although the retailer hasn’t released all its details, the site noted that there will be deals on the iPhone 7 and other electronics. Below are some of the best Black Friday offerings from Sam’s Club (via BGR). $249 PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 bundle (save $50) $249 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 bundle (save $104) $548 60-inch Vizio 4K UHD SmartCast Home Theater Display TV (Save $400) $299 55-inch JVC Class 4K UHD TV (save $100 – online only) $348 50-inch Vizio 4K UHD SmartCast Home Theater Display TV (Save $250) $129.88 Fitbit Charge 2 (save $20) $99.86 Fitbit Alta with extra band bundle (save $30) There had been some concern among retail experts that Black Friday 2016 shopping might see a dip in enthusiasm, especially with the huge number of online deals cropping up. Howard Davidowitz, the head of retail consultancy and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates, told CBS News that Amazon’s early Black Friday sales could lead an even bigger push for shoppers to stay at home rather than fighting the crowds on Black Friday. “In the retail business what you are always looking for is how to get the jump on your competitors – that’s the game,” Davidowitz said. “Now, here is the price leader, the fastest-growing retailer in the United States — they’re getting the jump on everybody. I think it’s brilliant they are going to capture even more market share this way.” While Amazon may be capturing the early attention ahead of the holiday shopping season, the more traditional brick-and-mortar retailers will be getting their turn soon. Eric Jones of the website BestBlackFriday.com told CBS News that the major stores have yet to leak their Black Friday 2016 ads, and those doorbuster sales are likely to generate just as much excitement this year as they have in the past.

Henning  BAY CITY, MI — On parole for less than a month, a Bay City man opted to risk his freedom by stealing some "The Walking Dead" DVDs from a Walmart. The gamble didn't pay off, as he's now heading back to prison. Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill on Monday, Oct. 31, sentenced David M. Henning, 23, to 18 months to five years in prison. Henning is to begin chipping away at the term after he serves the remainder of his paroled term. The judge also ordered Henning to pay $258 in court fines and costs. Henning in September pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree retail fraud. In exchange, the prosecution dismissed a charge of unarmed robbery, a 15-year offense. The charges stem from Bay County sheriff's deputies on the evening of July 21 responding to the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township for a shoplifting complaint. Upon deputies' arrival, Walmart staff told them they observed a man and a woman stealing items. As they attempted to stop the culprits near the building's front doors, the male subject — Henning — shoved a male employee, court records show. Police allege Bay City man threatened to blow up food business The male employee grabbed Henning in a bear hug and another employee reached into a large, leopard-print bag Henning was carrying and retrieved numerous stolen items. The male employee eventually released Henning as Henning continued to struggle, court records show. Henning then went to his 19-year-old female companion, took her car keys, ran outside, and drove away in her car, court records show. The woman remained at the store and gave a statement to police, saying she only knew her cohort as "John" and that she brought him to Walmart to steal property, court records show. She added her cohort had gone on other recent Walmart shoplifting expeditions — stealing a Nerf gun in one — without getting caught. Among the items the pair stole were bobby pins, five CDs, five "The Walking Dead" DVD sets, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Empire" DVD sets, "Insurgent," "Allegiance," and "Divergent" DVDs and blonde hair dye, all totaling $254.33, court records show. Police later located the woman's vehicle at Henning's Bay City residence and noticed a leopard print bag inside it, court records show. With the property owner's permission, police searched the home and found Henning hiding underneath a pile of clothes, court records show. After being read his Miranda rights, Henning initially declined to speak with police but soon changed his mind. He said he went to Walmart to steal items and struggled with an employee, though he knew he shouldn't have. He further told deputies he has a problem with impulsive stealing and goes to classes for it, court records show. Henning on Monday, July 25, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on one count of unarmed robbery. The charge is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Lengthy criminal history Henning's rap sheet includes other offenses that occurred at Walmart. In January 2015, he stole Xbox games "Grand Theft Auto IV" and "Sniper Ghost Warrior" from the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township. On his way out of the store, he engaged in a scuffle with a loss-prevention officer. He ended up pleading guilty to second-degree retail fraud in exchange for the prosecution's dismissal of an unarmed robbery charge. In February, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail with credit for 52 days served. Two months later, a Bay County judge sentenced Henning to three years probation on a conviction of malicious destruction of a building between $1,000 and $20,000 for a crime he committed on Jan. 5 of that year. Bay City man pleads guilty to misdemeanor in Xbox game theft, 15-year felony dismissed In August 2015, Henning called Bay County Central Dispatch and said he was going to blow up T&M Bosco Distributing Co. at 407 11th St. Police searched the area and found no explosive devices. Police believed Henning had called in similar prank threats the previous year. "I made the call," Henning told police. "I used an old Obama phone that I had before I went to jail. I told the person that I was going to blow up Bosco's. Once I realized it was 911, I hung up the phone. I don't know why I did it." Henning was charged with a four-year felony count of false report or threat of a bomb or harmful device. On Dec. 7, 2015, Henning was sentenced to 16 months to five years in prison on the vandalism conviction for which he previously received probation. The Michigan Department of Corrections paroled him on Tuesday, June 28.

That Walmart closed during the winter, affecting around 130 employees.  "I know that the building has sold," Stephanie Addair, McDowell County Economic Development Authority executive director, said. "And back in May, I did have a conversation with the West Virginia Development Office. My representative is Chris Pauley. There were several companies that were looking at the building." The deed shows Walmart sold the building to Kimball ABG LLC, a company based in Illinois, for $175,000 on September 14. The address of Kimball ABG on the document also shows that's where Rural King, a farm and home company, is located.  Addair couldn't confirm that Rural King is the store replacing the Walmart building. But she did say the move is expected to bring more jobs to the area, regardless. "That was also a store people shopped at that we lost," Addair said. "And I think, you know, we need more things in our community to the citizens who live here." The vacant Walmart building behind me, has been out of commission since January. No representatives from Rural King we spoke with were able to confirm it's the store moving in to the building.   The corporate media contact from Rural King has also not returned our calls.

Chemung County Sheriff's Deputies began pursuing an unidentified suspect after security at the Walmart in Corning reported a man trying to leave the store with a cart full of stolen merchandise around 8:00 a.m., WETM-TV reported. Security was able to recover the items, but the suspect fled on foot. Deputies found the suspect about 40 minutes later hiding in a ditch on the side of County Route 64, and he fled again. The suspect ran to the parking lot of a nearby Jo-Ann Fabrics, and stole the key of a woman who was exiting her vehicle. The suspect reportedly fled the parking lot in the car with two sheriff's units in pursuit. The chase moved to State Rt. 352 in Steuben County before the fleeing driver collided with a car in the eastbound lane.

The exact details of the video aren’t clear — including where or when it was filmed — but it has made the rounds on the internet early this week, prompting anger and disgust from those who have commented on it. In the video, the couple reportedly stands alone in an empty aisle before starting to have sex. As Crave Online noted, the man appeared to look out several times to make sure the coast was clear before continuing the act. In all, the Walmart sex tape lasted about two minutes, the outlet noted. As the report noted, the Walmart sex tape wasn’t leaked to the internet — it was released quite intentionally. “This couple actually uploaded the footage to the internet themselves, because that’s what you do nowadays,” the report noted. “But hey, good thing the woman was wearing what barely qualify as shorts, as it made it easier on this classy dude.” [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] There are still plenty of questions about the explicit video, including the biggest question of why anyone would want to do something like that inside a children’s aisle. But the location of the video is still unknown, as is the exact store. And while it has been identified as Walmart in news reports, the tall shelves and plastic-wrapped boxes look like something more commonly seen in a warehouse club store like Costco or Sam’s Club. The Walmart sex tape is not the only bit of misbehavior in the retail giant making headlines. A few weeks ago, a man inside a Houston-area Walmart store was investigated by local police after he was seen dragging his young daughter through the store by her hair. Witnesses snapped pictures of the very public act of abuse, which the man reportedly continued throughout his shopping trip. Reports indicated that the man was attempting to punish his children for misbehaving. “His three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her,” the Houston Chroniclereported. https://t.co/cxLTYopGxf — ABC 7 WWSB (@mysuncoast) September 21, 2016 The story went viral after a fellow shopper snapped pictures of the Walmart hair-pulling incident and uploaded them to Facebook along with a story of how police at the scene allowed the man and his children to go free. As witness Erika Burch noted in her post, the young girl was pleading with her father to stop the punishment. “Me and Robert are in Walmart in Cleveland Texas getting lunchables for our babies for school. Robert said “Do you see what that guy is doing to that little girl?” I turned around to this this pos dragging this little girl by the hair of her head!! He had her hair wrapped around the buggy dragging her! She is begging him to stop! She was saying ‘please stop,I promise I won’t do it again please stop!’ I took my phone out snapped pictures and then told him to let the little girls hair go! He told me to mind my own business! I said ‘No I’m not! Right now this little girl is my business and you need to let her hair go now!…” There could be some consequences for the still-unidentified couple in the Walmart sex tape as well. As Dude Comedy reported (via Crave Online), the pair have been banned from the store. It is not clear if they are being investigated by police. Anyone curious to see the Walmart sex tape can see some (censored) images at Crave Online, though the full video is not available there.

Consider yourself warned: It looks like we have the makings of a holiday toy craze on our hands. "For the last four years, there has been nothing comparable to the instant sales success within weeks of launch as Hatchimals," Juli Lennett, U.S. toys industry analyst at The NPD Group, told CNBC. Hatchimals, an interactive toy that hatches from a plastic egg, has sold out online at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, Amazon and at most Target stores. And the bidding is already getting fierce on sites like eBay. "The closest comparable new launch of a property would be Disney Frozen in 2013, which had a movie tie-in. Hatchimals is off to an even stronger start than Disney Frozen," Lennett said. "This could be the 'Tickle Me Elmo' of 2016." Spin Master released the toy in early October and it quickly started flying off the shelves. All five "species" of the toy — Pengualas, Draggles, Owlicorns, Burtles and Bearakeets — sell for around $50 and are very hard to find. Adding to the frenzy is the fact that several major retailers have exclusive selling rights to specific types of Hatchimals. Wal-Mart is the only retailer that sells Burtles, Target has the exclusive rights to Bearakeets and Toys R Us is the sole seller of Owlcorns. Representatives for Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Spin Master were not immediately available to comment. Kids must nurture the speckled egg in order to begin the hatching process. The toy will tap and peck at the plastic egg until it cracks open and a furry animatronic creature emerges. Then kids can interact with the Hatchimal and teach it to walk and talk. An employee at a Target in Edgewater, New Jersey, told CNBC that the toy was sold out at that location and she had lost count of the number of times people had called the store looking for it. Hatchimals can be found on eBay at prices ranging from $100 and to nearly $1,000, and on Facebook Marketplace for between $100 and $200. Several eBay users have put the toy up for more than $9,999, but are accepting lower offers. John Rodrigues, a firefighter from Rye, New York, is one of those sellers, but he doesn't expect anyone to pay nearly $10,000 for a toy. "Unless it was going 100 percent to charity, I would never let anybody pay that kind of money," he told CNBC. Instead, the high price tag was a tactic to lure eBay users who were searching for Hatchimals, and were curious about the most expensive options, to his auction page. Once there, users could click the "make offer" button and send in an lower priced offer. Rodrigues said that several people have clicked the "buy it now" button, but had no intention of actually purchasing the item. He canceled those orders, but they still appear as sold items on his page. He has made one sale so far, garnering $100 for the toy, and earning himself about $40. The majority of eBay sellers appear to have sold the Hatchimals for about $120 each. A bundle of three Hatchimals sold for almost $300 and a bundle of four sold for $450.

IT organizations that build their own software are moving to make that software available under an open source license. Case in point is Walmart, which is now making a React/Node.js application platform dubbed Electrode available as an open source project. Alex Grigoryan, director of software engineering for the Application Platform at Walmart Labs, says even though Walmart has spent millions of dollars developing Electrode, the retailer has a vested interest in recruiting other IT organizations to contribute code to extend the core platform. “We’re looking for contributions that can help us stay on the cutting edge,” says Grigoryan. Electrode is only the latest in a series of open source projects that Walmart contributes code to on a regular basis. In fact, members of the Walmart Labs IT team told attendees at a recent OpenStack East 2016 conference that Walmart is considering making the software it uses to manage DevOps available as open source code. While Walmart would no doubt benefit from external code contributions, the code it’s making available also helps level the IT playing field against archrival Amazon for any company engaged in e-commerce. Other retailers may not have much more love for Walmart than they do for Amazon, but they do stand to benefit from the rivalry between the two retailer giants as Walmart essentially moves to arm the entire e-commerce sector with free software. Naturally, providers of commercial e-commerce software may not be quite as thrilled by that prospect. But Electrode does show how organizations are starting to turn custom software they create into open source code that furthers their own competitive agendas. As more IT organizations come to the same conclusion, the opportunity to change the way software is created and consumed across the enterprise winds up being nothing less than profound.

The latest Wal-Mart patent application, dated September 8, 2016, is titled “Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods.” The patent application claims a system for bringing shopping carts to customers. The system includes a plurality of sensors and motorized transport units. The units then interact with a user interface associated with each customer. Separate and related patent applications include a patent application allowing the motorized transport units to retrieve a locker, a mother vehicle containing a plurality of motorized terrestrial transport units, and an individual user interface to control the motorized transport units. ipbiz In general, the shopping carts are novel inventions, yet they essentially involve a ‘Roomba’ style robot attached to the underside of a shopping cart. This Roomba like device called a “motorized transport unit” will drive the cart around the store as directed by the customer. The system is based on a sensor-rich world including central computers that track inventory and match customer needs to what’s available in the store. Essentially, the system operates similar to an online search function. However, the whole process is done in real time by robots and computers. There is a limit to this concept though because the robots are limited to selections within the physical bounds of the store. popsci This can be advantageous though as it allows the robots to cross-sell items and suggest associated items based on previous customer selections in the store. forbes This type of marketing technique may eventually expand to carts taking “accidental” detours in order to promote products and offer specific coupons. computerworld The cart locates customers using a method which includes LEDs “mounted in the ceiling” at known positions throughout the store. A typical smart phone display screen can be used as a light sensor to receive and process data encoded from the LED light sources. The patent also considers low-energy radio beacons, typically using Bluetooth and audio beacons to communicate with the shopper. computerworld Four years ago, Microsoft partnered with the Whole Foods grocery chain and tested a similar idea. However, Microsoft suffered from a few technical issues. It tried to navigate carts by using infrared dots in combination with a laser. Yet, when the shopping carts were near windows or skylights, the infrared dots got washed out by the sunlight and couldn’t be detected. computerworld The main motivation for these patents is the competition that exists between “brick and mortar” stores and online shopping websites. Therefore, Wal-Mart is seeking to improve both customer experience and convenience. For example, during peak hours employees are not always available to answer questions about products or guide shoppers through the store. Shopping carts are also often left abandoned, aisles become messy, and inventory becomes misplaced. Wal-Mart hopes that their shopping carts will alleviate many of these shopping problems. ipbiz It seems that Wal-Mart wants to implement these carts in order to be seen as an innovative brand. Even if shoppers see this as a novelty item for their stores, Wal-Mart will nevertheless be recognized for this idea. As Wal-Mart said in a related company statement, “We want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop.” Wal-Mart also strives to find ways to “help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers.” In effect, Wal-Mart is patenting its new shopping cart technology to capitalize on the interests of its employees and shoppers alike. cbsnews Tags: #walmart #shoppingcarts #shopping #robot #technology #userinterface Leave a Reply Cancel reply ← Approving Generic Drugs via an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Don’t Cut The Cheese: The Importance of GI’s in Transatlantic Trade → Follow Us!

Higher wages. By Former Rep. Bill Owens (D-N.Y.), contributor - 11/02/16 01:12 PM EDT   © Getty Images On a recent Saturday morning I was catching up on some reading and happened across an article by Eric Levitz in New York magazine's "Daily Intelligencer" chronicling a recent speech given by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The chair of the federal reserve gave a speech today and I swear it was the opposite of boring. https://t.co/vuKu4erhu5— Eric Levitz (@EricLevitz) October 14, 2016 And that same day in The New York Times there appeared an article about "cleaner" Wal-Mart stores (that's not the real story). ADVERTISEMENT Levitz wrote that, in her recent speech in Boston, Yellen "made her own, tentative argument for abandoning pre-crisis orthodoxy," as we look back at the impacts of the "Great Depression and the stagflation of the late 1970s." In other words, we need a new economic game plan. I think it's fair to say that the economic concerns drove much of the support for Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump mulling woman, gay man for leadership roles Bottom Line Tim Ryan ponders Pelosi challenge MORE (R) and Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersOvernight Finance: Obama warns against quitting trade deals | SEC chief to step down | Dow at record high Press: Dems need a shake-up Leave Comey alone MORE (I-Vt.) during this election cycle. Yellen was essentially stating that, as a result of the Great Recession, we appear to have moved away from thinking that an economic shock like the Great Recession will only impact demand on a short-term basis, and will have no long-term impact on the economy's capacity to produce goods and services. It now appears that the long-term supply of labor has declined, pushing working-age laborers onto the "sidelines" of the economy, as she mentioned. Yellen's proposal is to run a "high-pressure economy," one that prioritizes high demand and a tight labor market over keeping inflation and deficits in check. The logic goes something like this: If business sales increase, capital spending occurs and the labor market tightens, which, in effect, draws in whomever is sitting on the sidelines. Now let's turn to Wal-Mart stores. As reported in The New York Times on Oct. 15, several years ago Wal-Mart began to see a decline in store sales and customer satisfaction, with "only sixteen percent of stores ... meeting the company's customer service goals." Walmart decided to pay its employees more and train them better. You'll totally believe what happened next.https://t.co/lDW4IWUZk5— Neil Irwin (@Neil_Irwin) October 16, 2016 What did Wal-Mart do? As previously widely reported, it raised wages. At that time, I commented that Wal-Mart had adopted Henry Ford's theory of "pay them more and they buy cars." An economist might describe Wal-Mart's actions as implementation of "efficiency wages," a well-known concept among economists. Many small business owners know intuitively that if you pay more, you generally get harder-working, more loyal and likely more productive employees. In addition, because you are offering higher wages, it is significantly easier to hire replacements for those who don't perform satisfactorily. The business mantra for years has been that cutting costs is the route to profitability. This can be true cyclically, as businesses need to periodically evaluate their costs to ensure that they are in line with the local marketplace and the revenue of the organization. In my view, no policy or philosophy can be adhered to for long periods without review and analysis. That said, given Yellen’s view (which I would call theoretical) and Wal-Mart's view (which I would call practical and pragmatic), the idea that raising wages may, in fact, increase demand makes great sense. The next question is, how do you do that? Should there be a government-mandated increase in the minimum wage as we have seen in states like New York, Oregon, California, etc., or should governments structure tax policy or other economic policies to encourage this behavior? A few thoughts that I have posited previously are now worth a second look. One thought is to offer tax credits to younger workers who obtain an education in high-demand fields (which tend to be geographic in nature), and require that they move to those geographic regions (where they have the best chance of employment) to qualify for the tax credit. Another possibility is to offer a tax break, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to shareholders who increase employees' wages, for which they would receive profits from the business (tax-free dividends). We need to be looking at what the next president and Congress can do in order to create higher-paying jobs in the United States. This is not just an issue for the employees, but for business owners as well. At some point, wage stagnation will result in dramatically decreased demand for goods and services, and that would likely create a long-term recession.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next If you were a child during a certain time in the 70's or 80's, no doubt you remember the Sears Wish Book. It was a giant (or so it seemed to a 7-year old) book filled with all sorts of toys, bicycles, toy kitchen sets, robots and other things kids dreamed of for the holidays. The book was a starting point for millions of Christmas wish lists. Those days are long gone, but other stores are stepping forward to fill the void with smaller toy books of their own in 2016. Wal-Mart Book Released You know the holiday season is getting close when the big toy books start to leak, that show the expected hottest toys of the season. The website BF Ads.net has just released a scan of the 32 page Wal-Mart Holiday Toy Catalog.  It includes more than 200 hot toys, many chosen by kids as their favorite. Some are "only at Wal-Mart" toys, so if your young one wants them, you will have to shop Wal-Mart: they won't be available anywhere else. But don't expect any great deals in the book: BF Ads says those will come with the Wal-Mart Black Friday ad in a couple of weeks. Toys r Us Toy Book Released Wal-Mart's book comes just days after the release of Toys R Us' 2016 Toy Book. This is one worth getting your hands on, according to BF Ads.net, because it actually contains valuable store coupons  and can be used now.  See the highlights here. Target Toy Book Released Target has also released it's 2016 Toy Spectacular catalog. While not as big as the Toys R Us or Wal-Mart books, it has some good toys at good prices, according to BF Ads, and gives a good idea of the hottest video games and electronics, in fewer pages.' All of these however are just to whet the appetite and help kids create wish lists. Where are the Black Friday ads? The real deals will appear in the Black Friday fliers, which are expected in the days right after Election Day. And we will probably all need some diversion after the election. As always, don't waste your money. _________________ “Don't Waste Your Money” is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc. (“Scripps”).

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 2, 2016 at 7:22AM Image source: Getty Images. Once again, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported an industry-leading number of postpaid net adds in the third quarter. Its 851,000 net postpaid phone additions marks 11 straight quarters T-Mobile has led the major wireless carriers. The Q3 numbers were reported Oct. 24. But investors who looked over the company's reported operating metrics for the quarter may have noticed that the number of postpaid phone subscribers on T-Mobile's books actually declined 514,000. That's a pretty big discrepancy that needs some delving into. Fortunately for us, T-Mobile was very forward in detailing what exactly is going on here. "The MVNO transaction" In T-Mobile's press release and 10-Q filing with the SEC, it makes reference to an "MVNO transaction" and details the impact on its operations. MVNO stands for mobile virtual network operator and T-Mobile is referring to a deal it struck with Tracfone to transfer over its Walmart Family Mobile sub-brand. T-Mobile previously accounted for those subscribers as branded customers, but with Tracfone now operating the brand, they'll be moved to its wholesale line. T-Mobile details all the accounting on its operating metrics release. Specifically, it's moving 1.365 million postpaid phone customers and 326,000 prepaid phone customers to Tracfone. (Not all of these are Walmart Family Mobile customers, but the vast majority are.) The company's transparency is quite welcome, considering its competitors' similar disclosures, or lack thereof. Sprint (NYSE:S) relegated a similar deal to a footnote in its earnings release, and AT&T (NYSE:T) completely ignores customers who switch from its retail wireless service to its enterprise service when counting net adds. Why T-Mobile is distancing itself from Wal-Mart T-Mobile partnered with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in 2010 to establish the Walmart Family Mobile brand. At that time, Wal-Mart's 5,000-plus stores offered a valuable geographic footprint for T-Mobile. It allowed it to reach customers in more rural areas where it didn't have many storefronts. But T-Mobile is aggressively expanding the number of stores it operates for both its flagship "Magenta" and MetroPCS brands. This year alone, the company plans to open 1,000 MetroPCS stores and 400 T-Mobile stores. The 400 new T-Mobile stores will reach an additional 30 million to 40 million people. T-Mobile isn't the only company adding new stores. AT&T plans to open 900 stores for its prepaid Cricket Wireless brand this year, and Sprint added over 1,400 new stores last year with its co-branded RadioShack stores. Even so, T-Mobile clearly feels its physical footprint is large enough that it can go without directly selling phones through Wal-Mart. How the move will affect T-Mobile's results going forward Walmart Family Mobile customers are typically lower-value customers than those in T-Mobile's flagship brand or its MetroPCS prepaid brand. T-Mobile is giving up some of the revenue those customers generate in its deal with Tracfone, but it received some capital to deploy on real estate, spectrum, or other capital expenses. (The companies didn't reveal the details of the transaction.) T-Mobile noted in its earnings release that had the transaction gone through at the beginning of the quarter instead of Sept. 1, its postpaid phone churn would have been 1.20% for the quarter. That's a 12-basis-point improvement over its reported results. Additionally, Walmart Family customers also had lower average revenue per account than T-Mobile brand customers. As a result, T-Mobile will see a modest boost in APRU. That will offset the negative impact of more family plans in T-Mobile's base. While the deal will have an overall net positive impact on T-Mobile's operating metrics, it's hard to know the real value it's getting out of the MVNO transaction without the exact details of the agreement. With the strong net additions T-Mobile reports every quarter, it won't take long for the company to make up the difference. Adam Levy has no position in any stocks mentioned.

As per the report, circulars from retailers like Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart repeat products, prices from holidays past. Target Corp.'s 2015 Black Friday circular's front page was almost identical to the front page of its 2014 circular. Both displayed Beats headphones, a Nikon digital camera, and DVDs with same prices, except an Xbox gaming console that changed price. WSJ noted, citing Brad's Deals, a website that tracks retail discounts, that Target's each Black Friday circular since 2008 has featured a Razor scooter, with the price fluctuating between $17 and $22. Wal-Mart Stores' Black Friday newspaper inserts for the past two years have included a $49 Toshiba hard drive, a $19 Pyrex Bake-n-Store set and a $49.97 Brother sewing machine. The report also noted that the circulars of Best Buy Co., Kohl's Corp., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. also have featured many items and prices without much change. For three years running, the front page of Macy's Black Friday circular has featured Rampage boots for $19.99. The past two circulars of Best Buy have showcased a $779.99 11.6-inch MacBook Air, $224.99 Klipsch Reference dual 8-inch speakers and a $74.99 Amazon Fire TV. Meanwhile, the retailers reportedly noted that they are simply catering to customer tastes, and that some products and categories such as toys and small appliances tend to be popular year over year. In order to mitigate risks in the crucial shopping time, they showcase the products that were successful in the previous year. For years, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, remained one of the busiest shopping days of the year, even though it is losing its preference these days with more and more online shopping. WSJ noted that the trend is likely to continue as the retailers are under pressure to contain costs.

As per the report, circulars from retailers like Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart repeat products, prices from holidays past. Target Corp.'s 2015 Black Friday circular's front page was almost identical to the front page of its 2014 circular. Both displayed Beats headphones, a Nikon digital camera, and DVDs with same prices, except an Xbox gaming console that changed price. WSJ noted, citing Brad's Deals, a website that tracks retail discounts, that Target's each Black Friday circular since 2008 has featured a Razor scooter, with the price fluctuating between $17 and $22. Wal-Mart Stores' Black Friday newspaper inserts for the past two years have included a $49 Toshiba hard drive, a $19 Pyrex Bake-n-Store set and a $49.97 Brother sewing machine. The report also noted that the circulars of Best Buy Co., Kohl's Corp., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. also have featured many items and prices without much change.

Hong / Associated Press Five nonprofits in the Pittsburgh region received a share of $1.26 million that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation provided to support healthy food and nutrition programs. From staff and wire reports Ampco-Pitt posts loss Ampco-Pittsburgh reported a third quarter loss of $23.1 million, or $1.88 per share, as the Carnegie metals industry supplier was weighed down by a tax-related charge of $22.6 million, or $1.84 per share. Sales rose 43 percent to $82.9 million, reflecting the March acquisition of Akers AB. The company has issued layoff warnings to 184 workers at Akers’ Avonmore plant in Westmoreland County. Ampco-Pitt said 164 workers will be affected by the notice. Separately, the company said it will pay $13.1 million to acquire ASW Steel, a specialty steel producer based in Welland, Ontario. Black Box reports loss but turnaround continues Losses at Washington County-based Black Box Corp. were down sharply for the three months ending Oct 1 as the company continues a turnaround plan. The struggling communication and information technology equipment company reported a net loss of $6.1 million for the quarter, which compared to a loss of $130 million for the same period a year ago. The earnings per share loss was 40 cents, which compares to a loss of $8.45 per share a year ago. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $164.3 million, off from $165.4 million a year ago. Walmart funds food programs Five nonprofits in the Pittsburgh region received a share of $1.26 million that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation provided to support healthy food and nutrition programs throughout Pennsylvania. The recipients are: 412 Food Rescue, Pittsburgh, $4,550 for food education programs; the city of Uniontown’s parks and recreation department, $32,000, and the city of Pittsburgh’s Department of Parks and Recreation, $20,000, for meals and nutrition education for children; and Valley Points Family YMCA, New Kensington, $25,000 and Beaver County YMCA, New Brighton, $55,000 for after-school and summer meals for children. Angie's List may seek outside help, possible sale Angie’s List may be seeking a partner or a buyer after watching its sales slide for more than a year. The Indianapolis company is working with Allen & Co. LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch to explore “strategic alternatives.” Last year, the Indianapolis company rejected a $512 million takeover offer from internet company IAC/​InterActiveCorp. It said the per-share offer of $8.75 was too low. Shares had fallen to around $6.30 by July. Angie’s List Inc. reported a third-quarter loss of $16.8 million. Gannett walks away from deal to buy LA Times publisher tronc Gannett Co., the owner of USA Today, dropped its $683 million bid for rival Tronc Inc. after financing fell through, ending a months-long pursuit that would have put some of the biggest U.S. newspapers under one roof. The companies’ handshake deal early last month, in which Gannett would buy tronc for about $18.75 a share, collapsed when bankers wouldn’t line up to fund the transaction, a person familiar with the matter said. Gannett said financing wasn’t an issue. McLean, Virginia-based Gannett has already bought the publishers of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Record of Bergen County this year and acquired 15 dailies in 2015. Gannett is trying to get bigger to compete more aggressively with online news sites for national readers and advertisers. U.S. factory activity picks up in October U.S. manufacturing grew last month at the fastest pace since July, a sign that American factories are coping with economic weakness overseas and a strong dollar. The Institute for Supply Management says its manufacturing index came in at 51.9 up from 51.5 in August. Anything above 50 signals growth. Production and export orders grew faster in October.

Photo credit: Timothy Hong By Bailey Brammer | Staff Writer The annual Dale P. Jones Business Ethics Forum began on Tuesday evening at the Paul L. Foster Campus for Business and Innovation with speeches by Bill Simon, former president and CEO of Wal-Mart, and Tom Mars, former general counsel for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The forum will run from Nov. 1-11 and will include lectures from leaders in the business world, as well as student competitions. “If something happens to you, and you end up in an unfair situation, the key to success is to keep your eyes on the next step,” Mars said. “When you trip and fall, get back up, as long as you’ve done the right thing.” Mars and Simon discussed how to react in the business world when accused with untrue allegations, using Mars’ own experience of being ousted by Wal-Mart after charges of bribery in 2014 as an example. In addition to Simon and Mars, other business leaders such as Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby, and Bert Smith, CEO of the Prison Entrepreneurship Program, will be giving lectures throughout the forum. According to the Baylor Business School website, the Business Ethics Forum has been held annually at Baylor University since 2005. “We have a broad theme for this year’s ethics forum. It’s ‘Just Business,'” said Mitchell Neubert, Chavanne Chair of Christian Ethics in Business at Baylor. “It’s about the idea of fairness and ethics in business, and that’s lived out in a variety of ways.” Three different competitions will also take place during the forum, according to Baylor Media Communications press release. These contests are designed to provide students with realistic ethical challenges and promote growth and leadership. “The forum helps you learn more about business and get out of a classroom setting,” said Pearland freshman Abigail Finger. “And competing gets people out of their comfort zones.” The 11th annual Business Ethics Case Competition on Friday will consist of teams of undergraduate and graduate students presenting an ethics case and their recommendations in formal business presentations. The winning team in each league will receive a $500 prize. Twelve teams of students from across the U.S. will contend in the 10th annual National M.B.A. Case Competition in Ethical Leadership on Nov. 10. The winning team will be awarded the grand prize of $5,000, and the second and third place teams will also receive lesser prizes. First-year business students at Baylor will have the opportunity to compete in the Ethics SLAM! Competition Thursday through Friday for a $100 gift card to the Baylor Bookstore. While these competitions offer students a chance to test the waters of the real world, Simon gave students some parting advice on dealing with ethics and business as they move forward in their careers. “There’s no gray in ethics, and there’s no gray in business,” Simon said. “When you make a mistake, the earlier you can acknowledge it and correct it, the better off you are. And, if you didn’t do anything wrong, stand up for yourself.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Bailey Brammer RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Baylor reveals Briles’ role in reporting rape case Anti-Trump protestors take message to Fountain Mall, met with Trump supporters Riverfront project gets funds to develop downtown Tweets by @bulariat Follow us on Instagram OWN LOCAL Widget TODAY’S ISSUE EDITOR PICKS Mayfield; Oklahoma carve up Baylor defense Football November 12, 2016 Baylor reveals Briles’ role in reporting rape case News November 12, 2016 Anti-Trump protests fill streets in Washington D.C.

On Wednesday, Oct. 19, a female said her wallet was stolen at some point while shopping at Walmart. She received a call later from her credit card company advising of suspicious activity. Transactions had occurred on her card at the Northstar gas station located on Midland Avenue, just south of Cataraqui Woods Drive, as well as Foot Locker at the Cataraqui Centre and other stores. Video surveillance from the gas station shows one of the two men using the tap feature on the credit card to purchase various items. The vehicle the three suspects were using appears to be a dark gray or blue Pontiac Torrent SUV with Ontario licence plates. Detectives are confirming if this is possibly associated to a registered owner from the Amherstview area. The first male is described as Caucasian, 30 to 40 years of age, with a thin build, partial beard and moustache, prescription eyewear, and possibly tattoos visible on his right forearm. He is wearing a black ball cap, a black T-shirt with white lettering or graphic on the left breast, blue jeans and brown shoes or sandals. The second male is described as Caucasian, 25 to 35 years of age, with a medium build, clean-shaven, and with short brown receding widow's peak hair. He is wearing a ball cap possibly red in colour, a blue or black hoodie with white lettering saying "Crooks & Castles" on the chest, light gray jogging pants with what appears to be Adidas in black on the right lower leg, and black shoes with white soles. The female is described as Caucasian, 25 to 35 years of age, with a thin to medium build and short dark hair. She is wearing a dark jacket or long-sleeved zip-up sweater with a red shirt underneath, blue or black pants with lighter-coloured lettering of symbols down the leg, and bright pink shoes.

No. 12 Florida State Capitol Watch Reports from the Courant's politics staff Politics Capitol Watch Lawmakers Seek Campaign Finance Reform After Petit Ad Lawmakers Call for Campaign Finance Reform Photo by Christopher P. Keating Presumptive House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin and incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford talk about proposed changes in campaign finance laws due to major third-party spending in the election campaign. Presumptive House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin and incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford talk about proposed changes in campaign finance laws due to major third-party spending in the election campaign. (Photo by Christopher P. Keating) Christopher KeatingContact Reporter The presumptive House Speaker called Thursday for changes in the state campaign finance laws with more disclosure on commercials by Republican funders like Wal-Mart and the Koch brothers. But Republicans countered that reform cuts both ways, and they want more disclosure about exactly who funded pro-Democratic campaigns like the recent one against Dr. William Petit, a Republican in a tight legislative race in Plainville. Both sides want individual donors to be disclosed at certain levels for contributions to third-party political action committees. The third-party PACs have been playing an increasingly large role in elections ever since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the doors to major funding in a case called Citizens United. “Sadly, the influx of outside third-party, special interest money, affirmed by the Supreme Court Citizens United ruling, has essentially in many instances allowed wealthy out-of-state funders to hijack our local legislative campaigns,’’ said Rep. Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin, who will be the House Speaker if Democrats retain their majority in next week’s election. Currently, the top five donors to the political action committees must be disclosed. Democrats say they will propose legislation in 2017 to expand that number and extend it to all donors beyond certain levels. Incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford said legislators thought that they were reforming the system when they approved public financing that was signed by Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell. Editorial: Nasty Spins Like Petit-Trump Ad Turn People Off To Politics This election reached a new low with an ad linking William Petit with Donald Trump's "attack on women and families." Mr. Petit is a Republican candidate for the state House whose wife and daughters were murdered in an attack that seriously injured him. "Poor judgment," Connecticut's largest labor... This election reached a new low with an ad linking William Petit with Donald Trump's "attack on women and families." Mr. Petit is a Republican candidate for the state House whose wife and daughters were murdered in an attack that seriously injured him. "Poor judgment," Connecticut's largest labor...Read the story “When you get a grant of $30,000 and someone from outside Connecticut with no interest other than maybe one or two bills can dump $100,000 in one day with no disclosure, how is that campaign finance reform?’’ Ritter asked. “It’s not.’’ Both Aresimowicz and Ritter favor challenging certain aspects of the Citizens United decision in Washington, D.C. “Maybe we’ll give the Supreme Court another chance,’’ Ritter told reporters at the state Capitol in Hartford. “When we have a new justice come January, which we hope, to take a look at some of these issues and say, ‘What Connecticut is doing is good for the state. Let them operate the system the way they want to operate it.’ " But House Republican leader Themis Klarides of Derby questioned how much the state legislature can do to change federal law. “Citizens United is Citizens United,’’ she told reporters. “It’s been held constitutional. We can’t do a lot on the state level.’’ Union Head Resigns Following Ad Linking William Petit To Trump And 'Attack On Women And Families' CHRISTOPHER KEATING A top union official resigned his post Thursday after a union-sponsored campaign ad targeting a candidate, the lone survivor of the 2007 Cheshire home invasion, led to a firestorm of protest.

A top union official resigned his post Thursday after a union-sponsored campaign ad targeting a candidate, the lone survivor of the 2007 Cheshire home invasion, led to a firestorm of protest. Paul Filson, the executive director of the SEIU Connecticut State Council, stepped down after a digital... (CHRISTOPHER KEATING) Klarides said that Democrats were hypocritical because a union-backed group called Labor United paid for campaign ads that tied Republicans to Donald Trump, including Petit and about a dozen others. “The hypocrisy of the Super PACs is really amazing to me,’’ Klarides said, adding that the first influx of Labor United money was $120,000. “All of that money came from SEIU, the biggest labor union in Connecticut. Is that within their legal right to do?  Absolutely. But that money comes from union dues. If you want to talk about who’s giving to what Super PAC, do I know who’s donating to that Super PAC? I don’t know. … If they want more transparency on our side, they better darn well expect to have the same transparency on their side.’’ Klarides charged that Democrats have been running away from their record during the campaign, taking some of the positions espoused by Republicans. “What galls me the most is they’re pro-business now – all of a sudden,’’ Klarides said. “They have been running away from their governor, which is understandable because he’s toxic..."

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 3, 2016 at 1:57PM With the S&P 500 only 3% below its all-time high, finding stocks that are undervalued by the market is not easy. When the rising tide is lifting all boats, stocks that are under water from their intrinsic value likely means they're being discounted for a reason. Usually, maybe -- but not always. There are plenty of mispricings by the market due to incorrectly reading a company's temporary problems as systemic ones. Today we'll look at three such cases where a stock has been beaten down, but its business still holds long-term promise. Image source: Flickr via Random Retail. Pennies on the dollar Over the past couple of years, few companies have profited as well from the economic malaise that has afflicted the country than deep-discount chain Dollar General (NYSE:DG). As consumers struggled to regain their financial footing, they flocked to dollar stores as a means of allowing their wallets to stretch to the maximum. Dollar General and rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) flourished as consumers liked the dollar-or-more treasure hunt of their stores. And as they installed refrigerators and freezers to give customers a wider selection of consumable goods (items that might have carried slightly lower margins but helped boost store traffic), their sales, profits, and footprints grew. But that all seemed to change with the second quarter as Dollar General and Dollar Tree stumbled, falling well short of analyst expectations. Shares of Dollar General have fallen nearly 30% from their all-time highs while Dollar Tree's are down an equally precipitous 25%. The main culprit was a change in consumer perception of their value proposition, while a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) refocused its energy on being the low-cost leader. Coupled with food price deflation and cuts in SNAP food stamp benefits, the retailer has been put under pressure. but those are factors that impact many discounters, including Dollar Tree and Wal-Mart. However, the long-term demand and need for the dollar stores remains intact. Currently valued at 14 times forward earnings and at a fraction of its sales, Dollar General is worth a look. Image source: Tractor Supply. Plowing under growth Rural retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) got hit especially hard after providing early guidance for its fiscal third quarter that saw it anticipate comparable sales, revenues, and profit all coming in lower than previously anticipated. Blaming weakness in both the energy and agricultural markets, Tractor Supply also said winter season products were falling short of expectations, suggesting its troubles might not be limited to just one quarter. The deflation being experienced by the discount retailers is also hitting the farm equipment supplier's customers, which are comprised largely of farmers and ranchers. If farm incomes are down due to the commodity cycle hitting its low point, Tractor Supply will have a tough time selling its big-ticket items, while the consumables business will be impacted by the falling prices, too. Yet its livestock and pet operations, which account for around 45% of its revenue, remain strong. Even though its business weakened in the current quarter, that segment still generated mid-single digit comparable-store sales increases. This will continue to assume a larger portion of its business as it grows its footprint from the 1,575 stores it currently operates, giving it a chance to pick off the higher-margin private label goods sales and increasing the amount of consumables it sells. When the cycle turns once more, it will be positioned to capitalize. Paying a $0.96 dividend that currently yields 1.55%, Tractor Supply is planting the seeds for the payout to grow in the future. Image source: Lear. Bolting together a plan Trading just a point or two below its all-time highs means auto parts maker Lear (NYSE:LEA) can't be considered a beaten-down stock, but that doesn't mean it's not still undervalued. Indeed, when it reported third-quarter results recently, it beat Wall Street expectations and raised its guidance for the rest of the year. It certainly looks like it's firing on all cylinders. Despite that, however, Lear remains an underappreciated stock, perhaps because of the more difficult time Ford, GM, and Chrysler are having moving cars this year compared to last. Although the automakers are still selling millions of cars,  2015 was a record year when more than 17.4 million cars were sold. As of this writing, though, October auto sales are expected to fall 7% from last year, the sixth month of falling sales, a situation that hasn't been seen since the financial markets' collapse. Lear, however, is still doing brisk business. The automotive seating and electrical distribution systems posted sales of $4.53 billion in the third quarter, beating analyst forecasts of $4.48 billion, with adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share coming in ahead of expectations of $3.02 per share. For all that, Lear is cheap across multiple metrics. Its stock is valued at just 8.5 times future earnings, it is priced at less than half its sales, and when you compare its price to its earnings, shares trade at just a fraction of their growth potential. That suggests there is a lot of upside still in this stock if Lear's shares simply trade up to a fair market valuation. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The GST council has approved a four-tier GST tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent that aims to lower tax incidence on most goods. However, luxury items like high-end cars and demerit goods including tobacco, pan masala and aerated drinks, will be taxed at the highest rate and will also attract a cess in a way the total incidence of tax remains at almost the current level. "With GST rates announced today, there is a good progress in this journey to have GST by April 2017. With half the CPI basket at 0 per cent and a majority of daily consumption essential items at 5 per cent, it will keep inflation in check. Looks good and progressive tax regime," said Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer. Beverages and snacks major PepsiCo said the food processing industry is looking forward to rational tax rates for carbonated beverages, savouries, fruit juices under the GST regime. "The GST Council discussions are going on currently and we are waiting to get more clarity -- it's too early for us to comment on the current developments," said PepsiCo India Region CFO Rajdeep Datta Gupta. Coca-Cola India has a similar response. It said it does not have details on the applicable GST rates, including the cess, as the company manufactures and markets beverages, including juices, juice with fizz, dairy products, iced tea and carbonated beverages such as soda. "At this point, we do not know which of these products are classified in which category. It is therefore difficult to comment on the impact of the announced rate slabs," said Coca-Cola India. As for air-condition maker Daikin, the move would bring about "a positive development" for the consumer durable industry. "This is definitely a good sign and positive development for the consumer durable industry. Lower tax will also add to the growth of the overall industry and the benefits in due time will be passed on to the consumers," said Daikin India CEO and MD Kanwal Jeet Jawa.   PTI First Published: Thursday, November 3, 2016 - 21:21 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus MOST READ TOP NEWS MOST VIEWED Did this Indian businessman just surrender Rs 6,000 crore?

Falk / Staff Photographer Pottstown's Marvin Pearson started losing his sight at 8 and was completely blind two years later. During that time, he inexplicably also lost his hearing. Now, at 18, he is a senior at Pottstown High School after spending three years at the Overbrook School for the Blind, and plays football. He scored a 65-yard touchdown and two-point conversion in recent games. by Kathy Boccella, Staff Writer Close icon Kathy Boccella Staff Writer After going blind and then deaf while still in grade school, Marvin Pearson learned how to get around his Pottstown neighborhood, even walking alone six blocks to a Walmart. Regaining some hearing after getting an implant in his left ear, he excelled at wrestling and track at Overbook School for the Blind, figured out how to defeat his two sisters on PlayStation games, and occasionally alarmed them and his mother by roller-blading around the house. Slideshow Blindness can't sack Pottstown running back Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon But that still wasn't enough. During the summer, Pearson contacted Pottstown High School and said he wanted to return to his hometown school for senior year - and there was one other thing. He was going out for varsity football. "I talked to him and said, 'It's going to be a process,' " recalled Pottstown head coach Gary Rodenbaugh. This fall, that process quickly evolved into a remarkable journey not only for his blind and hearing-impaired running back, but for Pearson's teammates, who say his contagious can-do spirit has made an otherwise so-so season a life lesson they will never forget. It was the viral video of a 65-yard touchdown sprint last month during the last play of a 48-0 rout that gave Pearson a burst of fame, including a TV appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he was given a $10,000 scholarship and the promise of a trip to meet his football idol, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. No one seemed to care that the other team's defense stood aside as Pearson tore down the field. The real highlight for the teen was his three-yard plunge for a critical two-point conversion in a victory over Upper Merion High School, because that time he fought off live tacklers to reach the end zone. "It was time to show I was just a football player, not a blind football player," said Pearson, recalling how six defenders couldn't bring him down until he was finally over the goal line. It was the epitome of what Pearson has done again and again since he began losing his sight at age 7: Finding a way to do just about anything other kids do. "People ask, 'How does your brother play football, how does he run track?' I say, 'I don't know,' " marveled his older sister MarDaije, a freshman at Chestnut Hill College. "It's like he never even lost his sight," she said, adding: "He doesn't think he has it worse than others. He feels equal to everybody else." Indeed, Pearson, who maintains a 3.6 grade-point average, is already sprinting toward his next goals, college and a career in sports management, a fitting choice for a kid who's juggling 17 fantasy football teams. "Marvin doesn't know what obstacles mean," said his mother, Ana Carmona. "He has none. If they're there, he does not see them." Growing up in Pottstown, Pearson was an active, sports-loving kid who played youth football in Conshohocken and, his mother recalled, was often "hardheaded." The child's stubborn determination would serve him well when seemingly out of the blue, his vision began to deteriorate. Doctors eventually determined that he suffered from retinal detachment, and laser surgery on both eyes didn't prevent a total loss of sight over the next two years. "I was never the type to cry," Pearson recalled of the experience. "I wasn't scared, but it was frustrating trying to prove to doctors and teachers that I couldn't see." About a year into his vision crisis, Pearson started losing his hearing as well. Carmona said neither the family nor doctors ever figured out the cause. Only the cochlear implant prevented him from completely losing touch with the outside world. Yet Carmona said the harrowing experience seemed to be harder on her than on him. "Marvin, honestly, he took it on the shoulder," she recalled. "It was me in the corner crying every night and angry with God." Pearson's relatives say he always remained focused on what he could do, not what he couldn't. He knew his way around his Bright Hope Community neighborhood, so it wasn't long before he ventured out with his cane, making it two blocks to an aunt's house or to a nearby park with an assist from one of his sisters. "He always just kept going and acted the same," said MarDaije. Sometime he insisted on riding his bike, and she would have to run alongside. At Pottstown Middle School, he wrestled and played football, although he wasn't cleared for full contact. He started high school at the Overbook School for the Blind, where he also played goal ball, developed for blind athletes, in which players try to score with - or block - a ball that makes noises with tiny bells. In transferring to Pottstown High this fall, Pearson, 18, knew it was a chance to pursue his unfulfilled dreams on the gridiron - for real this time. It's a road that few travel. The U.S. Association of Blind Athletes is tracking just two similar players in the entire country, defensive lineman Jay Spencer at St. John Paul II Catholic High School in Huntsville, Ala., and long snapper Jake Olson at the University of Southern California. But Mark Lucas, executive director of the USABA, said it's possible for a blind athlete to succeed in just about any sport as long as coaches are willing to provide adaptations. Rodenbaugh and his staff were more than willing to adapt. They drew up plays for Pearson to take the snap under center and plow forward behind a wedge of blockers, but they also saw the larger, intangible benefit of someone who could teach his teammates about overcoming adversity. Just 5-9 and 154 pounds, Pearson said he idolizes Brees because the Saints quarterback was once dismissed as too short at 6 feet. "We're both underrated," Pearson said. "He's small, I'm blind. And we're both individuals that people don't expect to be as tough as we are." At a recent practice, a few guys worked on the sidelines with Pearson while the first-team defense was on the field. He put his hands together to catch passes, and even threw a few strikes of his own, with a helper telling him how far to throw and pointing his left arm in the direction of the receiver. "Good throw, Marvin!" they said again and again. Teammates appreciate both his accomplishments and his attitude. Nehemiah Figueroa, 16, admires how Pearson works up the home crowd with a few front flips before a game. "Marvin basically proves that no matter what your disability is, you can do anything you want," he said. The 65-yard dash against rival Pottsgrove - in which the opponents didn't challenge Pearson as he sprinted for the touchdown with a teammate's guidance - came with mixed emotions. It had been the Pottsgrove coach's idea. "I just kind of shared with him, this was going to be an opportunity to get to the end zone," Rodenbaugh recalled. "Marvin, being a competitor, was like, 'I don't want them to let me.' I emphasized it was a sign of respect for what you've been able to do and what you've shown to the world." It also proved that Pearson sometimes literally doesn't know when to quit. Five yards past the goal line, he finally dove to the ground. "We were yelling, 'Stop, stop!' - if he kept on running, he would have hit a gate," his mother said. That momentum should carry him to college next fall. It sounds like Pearson might be leaning toward Kutztown University. "I talked to the coach," he said. "He sounds like the kind of guy who will give me a chance to play." kboccella@phillynews.com 610-313-8232@Kathy_Boccella Published: November 2, 2016 — 3:59 PM EDT | Updated: November 3, 2016 — 1:08 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

ELECTION 2016 What Twitter, Google, and Politics Have in Common The internet economy is broken, according to Doug Rushkoff, who sees the fallout in both tech companies and our elections. By Helaine Olen Helaine Olen is a veteran personal finance journalist, the author of Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry, and the co-author of the upcoming Everything You Need to Know About Personal Finance ... on an Index Card. @helaineolen Personal finance journalist@helaineolen WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement When Americans go to the polls next week, they will be finalizing an electoral cycle characterized largely by resentment--and Doug Rushkoff, for one, mostly blames the changes spawned by the internet. Instead of the once-promised glorious new age, one that would free us from the tyranny of the corporate state, we got income inequality, the housing bubble, increased corporate power, and, now, a presidential election like none other in our history. And Rushkoff, a longtime media theorist and author, says the tech industry is partly responsible. The problem, he says, is not the digital economy itself, but the fact that it adopted an economic model that no longer works. "The conflict here is not really between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. It's not even stressed out employees against the companies they work for or the unemployed against Wall Street so much as everyone--humanity itself--against a program that promotes growth above all else," he writes in his most recent book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity. (The title is a reference to San Francisco protests in 2013 and 2014.) I recently reached out to Rushkoff to discuss the book and how the economic problems he identifies are playing out in both politics and private business--including at Google and the currently much-beleaguered Twitter. (This Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity. And in the interests of full disclosure, Rushkoff mentioned my book Pound Foolish, which he blurbed, in Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus.) You write about Twitter's problems in your book. What has it done wrong? I feel like I'm watching the slow death of Twitter. I liked Twitter because it's super simple. It's an utterly transparent, easy-to-understand messaging system. People that subscribe to me see my messages in their feed. It isn't asking anything of me. Every once in a while there was an ad in the feed. I knew what it was. They are making money off this service. This is good. Everybody's happy, right? It turns out no. There's not room for that. Wall Street right now considers Twitter an abject failure because it turns out that they can't figure out how a 140-character messaging app can make more than $2 billion a year. That's not the way to make money with a company like that, a company that has a great sustainable revenue stream. Twitter could last a long time as a $2-billion-a-year business. It's not allowed to because the investors want home runs. They want 100 times that. They want $200 billion dollars a year or bust. A single or a double's not possible. Why does your book throw metaphorical rocks at Google? At first, Google represented the good guys. There were two kids in their Stanford dorm room who were going to take down Yahoo, which was the big Wall Street company. Now, Google has become not only one of the biggest companies in the world, but now even a holding company. They're appropriated the sharing, good-for-the-world ethos of San Francisco as a brand image, while actually working against all of those values. You think Google fell victim to something you call the growth trap. Can you explain that? One day they took too much money. What if Google had grown a little bit slower, but then got to stay one of the good guys? It would have been way better. There's no reason to grow that much, but that's really the growth trap. When you talk to the CEO of a Fortune 100 company, they'll say, "My shareholders are demanding 7.2 percent growth this year. The only way I'm going to be able to show that growth is by selling off one of my productive assets. It's like amputating one of my good arms in order to show growth on the balance sheet or by firing 10,000 competent employees." What the CEOs are realizing is that the long-term sustainability of their companies, or the long-term sustainability of the markets on which those companies are relying, is being surrendered to show growth because that's the prime, core command of the economy for the last 700 years. Our economy is doing exactly what it was programmed to. It's just that when you do this, on digital steroids, it starts happening in more extreme ways. That slow suck that sometimes people and nations were able to recover from now is a super-fast suck that we don't know how to deal with. So what do we need to do instead? What I'm talking about is pre-distributing the means of production before the fact. What does that look like? Take WinCo, the West Coast chain that's eating Walmart's lunch. It's the same business model as Walmart, except the workers are the shareholders. The workers are paid more. They own the company. They treat their regions differently because they live in the towns where they're working and they own the company that's impacting their towns. They have just as good prices as Walmart and so they beat Walmart. They have better customer service and better employee retention. That's distributive. How do you convince nascent companies to go along with this? You have to show people that the probability of having a total monopoly unicorn business is very low. It's 1 out of 100,000 that you will get to be Facebook, Google, or Exxon. It's really hard to be one of those. I think more people are looking at that and saying, "You know? Fifty million dollars is not so bad. No, I won't get to go to certain parties and I won't get on the cover of certain magazines, but I'll have $50 million." Right, but all we see are the companies and people who won the lottery, as you put it. How do we convince people to change when that's the model? I recently went to Silicon Valley, and I was trying to argue to young developers that tens of millions of dollars as your exit is enough. Be happy with that. But there's a certain ego thing. They want to be Mark Zuckerberg. They want everyone to know who they are. On the other hand, there are a lot of people out there that are realizing being a millionaire and working for a living is more fun than trying to be a multi-billionaire and never working. They're kind of seeing that. Basically, if you set your sights--and I hate to call it lower, but let's call it that--if you set your sights lower, you've got a company. God bless. You should be really happy with that. It's partly the digital culture that makes you need to have 10 million followers. You have to be Elon Musk or Travis Kalanick in order to feel OK about yourself. There are ways to do it. You just have to think about doing it small rather than at large scale or by creating a community of people who share in the value creations. Patagonia did by going private. Michael Dell did by going private so he could retake control of his company. His name is on it. It's a family business in a certain way, so he wants to think about how can this business survive rather than not. Once you take a lot of money, your investors will insist that you hit a home run. That means that you pivot away from your very viable and highly probable, profitable business strategy and adopt instead a scorched earth one-in-a-million unicorn strategy. How is this all playing out in the politics of 2016? People do have a sense that the system itself is rigged against them. That something is wrong and it's wrong on a fundamental level. It's depending on the operating system that's killing us all. They get that an establishment candidate in one way or another is going to be supporting this existing system. What many of them want, just like the people who are throwing rocks at the Google bus, is someone to break the thing. Donald Trump, if nothing else, is consummate with the digital media environment. He's an internet troll manifesting in the real world. He's born of the angry comment section after any article. Published on: Nov 3, 2016 Advertisement

Photograph: Brian J Clark/The Virginian-Pilot Sam Wollaston @samwollaston Thursday 3 November 2016 05.34 EDT Last modified on Thursday 3 November 2016 05.36 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Portsmouth in Virginia, and on the recording of a 911 call, a man is reported to have been shoplifting at Walmart. A police officer is on his way. A few minutes later and now we are with the police Taser camcorder. “Take your hand out of your pocket,” says the officer. “You’re not going to Tase me because you’re not going to arrest me for nothing,” says the man suspected of shoplifting. There is then a 15-second gap in the recording, because – the officer says later – the man knocked the Taser out of his hand and it hit the ground so hard that its camera stopped working, for 15 seconds. When it comes back on again, it is recording the aftermath of a shooting: audio mainly; voices, as the camera is lying on the ground, though the enormity of what has happened is immediately obvious. “Shots fired, suspect down …. Don’t die on me, brother; talk to me, man … He’s unresponsive, have medics standing by … I’m not getting a pulse, starting CPR …” During that quarter of a minute of camera malfunction, William Chapman, 18, has been shot and killed. Self defence, and all by the book, says Stephen Rankin, the officer. First-degree murder say Chapman’s family and the prosecutor (this is one of the rare cases that ends up in court). Over 90 minutes, This World: Unarmed Black Male (BBC2) forensically unpicks the case from that car park – a young man lying in a widening sea of blood, and a mum at home who does not yet know her boy is gone – to a verdict in the case against Rankin. The documentary makers are secured access to Chapman’s family, and also to Rankin himself, who talks. Plus Rankin’s partner and others because the film – unlike the court case, which can’t – goes back to before those shots were fired, to the first time Rankin fatally shot an unarmed man while on duty. Unarmed Black Male also puts Chapman’s death into the context of a year – last year – in which he was just one of 306 African Americans killed by police. So here is Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, being shot eight times from behind as he walks away; and Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was killed by mistake (“Fuck I shot him, I’m sorry,” says the officer); and Philando Castile in St Paul, Minnesota, shot after being pulled over for a broken tail light, the aftermath filmed by his girlfriend as her man bleeds beside her; also Micah Johnson’s reprisal sniper attacks on police officers in Dallas. It does not matter how much you’ve seen some of this footage, it still acts like a Taser to hope itself. So much of Unarmed Black Male is shocking, depressing and sad: the footage; the numbers; the grief of a mother, two mothers, mourning their sons; the anger of a community. And the picture it shows of a country divided by race. Divided to the extent that the witnesses – a group of (white) construction workers and the (black) Walmart employee who made the 911 call – see two different events: William Chapman attacking Officer Rankin, and not attacking him, respectively. Rankin was an accident waiting to happen and should not have still been a police officer, says his ex-wife and a former boss. A serious gun enthusiast, he referred to his firearms case as “Rankin’s box of vengeance”. But then, judging by this recruitment video you might think that was just the kind of person the Portsmouth police department was after. It’s like a game of Soldier of frigging Fortune, complete with metal-guitar solo, one of the most chilling moments in a chilling film. Possibly even worse is Rankin explaining that what normally happens in these cases is that you get three weeks of administrative leave while they investigate the incident, then you return to work and get a medal for a valorous act if that is appropriate, which it usually is. “Three weeks and a medal,” he says with a little smile. For killing someone. It might make you angry, watching. But James Jones’s absorbing documentary remains objective, open-minded and journalistic, allowing the events and the people to speak for themselves. And it is all the more powerful for that. In the end, Stephen Rankin gets 130 weeks – two-and-a-half years – not of administrative leave but jail time, after the jury finds him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. No medal.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Smart Real Estate Investment Trust Releases Third Quarter Results for 2016 TORONTO, ONTARIO–(Marketwired – Nov. 2, 2016) – Smart Real Estate Investment Trust (“SmartREIT” or “the Trust”) (TSX:SRU.UN) is pleased to report positive results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. Highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2016: The Trust improved its occupancy to 98.3% in the quarter (from 98.2% in the second quarter) based on leased and occupied space. Including the executed deals that will take occupancy after the quarter, this metric increases to 98.5% (from 98.3% in the second quarter) Developments and Earnouts of 54,845 square feet of leasable area for $17.9 million were completed, providing an unleveraged yield of 6.7% An investment property in Lethbridge, Alberta, was acquired totalling 53,392 square feet of leasable area for a total purchase price of $15.3 million, for which the Trust assumed an existing mortgage totalling $9.2 million with a term of 3.9 years and an interest rate of 2.73% $100.0 million of 2.987% Series O senior unsecured debentures and $250.0 million of 3.444% Series P senior unsecured debentures were issued for combined net proceeds including issuance costs totalling $347.4 million $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Series F senior unsecured debentures and $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.70% Series G senior unsecured debentures were redeemed Subsequent to Quarter End: KPMG opened for business on October 3, 2016 at the new Vaughan Metropolitan Centre and new leasing at the centre is very positive, with effective rents and timing ahead of expectations On October 25, 2016, the Trust completed the acquisition of a mixed-use retail-office centre in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, from a third party, totalling approximately 382,000 square feet of leasable area. The total purchase price of this acquisition was $62.0 million, which was be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing mortgage totalling $34.5 million with an interest rate of 2.87% that matures in 2017 On October 28, 2016, the Trust entered into an agreement to extend a loan receivable in the amount of $40.3 million issued to OneREIT for a period of one year that was due to mature on October 30, 2016 with an interest rate of 6.75%, resulting in a revised maturity date of October 30, 2017 with substantially the same terms except for a one-time prepayment option of $10.0 million that was exercised by OneREIT on October 31, 2016 Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT said, “Our two key focuses remain the health of our core retail holdings and the development of a strong pipeline of growth initiatives and we are pleased with the progress on both fronts. Despite a very competitive market, our principally Walmart anchored sites are able to attract new tenants and increase occupancy. The investments we are making in developing multiple projects in our large urban sites continue to have a modest negative impact on our current profitability but we are confident that these mixed-use investments will provide significant long term benefits for our Unitholders as they become part of our extended portfolio,” added Thomas.

The total purchase price of this acquisition was $15.3 million, which included $6.2 million paid in cash and the assumption of a mortgage of $9.2 million, adjusted for costs of acquisition and other working capital amounts. Key Financial Highlights Quarterly Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT’s key financial highlights for the three months ended September 30 (including the Trust’s share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $56.7 $92.6 -$35.9 (38.8)% Rentals from investment properties $174.1 $172.9 $1.2 0.7% Net operating income $115.1 $116.2 -$1.1 (0.9)% FFO excluding adjustments $83.5 $83.9 -$0.4 (0.5)% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $0.54 $0.54 $0.00 -% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $0.51 $0.52 -$0.01 (1.9)% Distribution $0.41 $0.40 $0.01 2.5% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 81.0% 76.9% 4.1% 5.3% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing – which are added back to FFO – in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million. Year-to-Date Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT’s key financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30 (including the Trust’s share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $232.2 $227.8 $4.4 1.9% Rentals from investment properties $541.0 $492.2 $48.8 9.9% Net operating income $356.3 $323.9 $32.4 10.0% FFO excluding adjustments $260.1 $229.2 $30.9 13.5% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $1.67 $1.58 $0.09 5.6% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $1.58 $1.49 $0.09 6.1% Distribution $1.24 $1.20 $0.04 3.3% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 78.4% 80.6% (2.2)% (2.7)% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust’s portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust’s portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing – which are added back to FFO – in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in AFFO of $29.6 million was primarily due to the increases described in FFO above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further offset by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $2.0 million. Non-IFRS Measures The non-IFRS measures used in this Press Release, including AFFO, FFO, NOI and payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-IFRS measures are more fully defined and discussed in the ‘Management Discussion and Analysis’ (MD&A) of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, available on Sedar at www.sedar.com. Full reports of the financial results of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are outlined in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related MD&A of the Trust, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2016: The Trust improved its occupancy to 98.3% in the quarter (from 98.2% in the second quarter) based on leased and occupied space. Including the executed deals that will take occupancy after the quarter, this metric increases to 98.5% (from 98.3% in the second quarter) Developments and Earnouts of 54,845 square feet of leasable area for $17.9 million were completed, providing an unleveraged yield of 6.7% An investment property in Lethbridge, Alberta, was acquired totalling 53,392 square feet of leasable area for a total purchase price of $15.3 million, for which the Trust assumed an existing mortgage totalling $9.2 million with a term of 3.9 years and an interest rate of 2.73% $100.0 million of 2.987% Series O senior unsecured debentures and $250.0 million of 3.444% Series P senior unsecured debentures were issued for combined net proceeds including issuance costs totalling $347.4 million $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Series F senior unsecured debentures and $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.70% Series G senior unsecured debentures were redeemed Subsequent to Quarter End: KPMG opened for business on October 3, 2016 at the new Vaughan Metropolitan Centre and new leasing at the centre is very positive, with effective rents and timing ahead of expectations On October 25, 2016, the Trust completed the acquisition of a mixed-use retail-office centre in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, from a third party, totalling approximately 382,000 square feet of leasable area. The total purchase price of this acquisition was $62.0 million, which was be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing mortgage totalling $34.5 million with an interest rate of 2.87% that matures in 2017 On October 28, 2016, the Trust entered into an agreement to extend a loan receivable in the amount of $40.3 million issued to OneREIT for a period of one year that was due to mature on October 30, 2016 with an interest rate of 6.75%, resulting in a revised maturity date of October 30, 2017 with substantially the same terms except for a one-time prepayment option of $10.0 million that was exercised by OneREIT on October 31, 2016 Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT said, "Our two key focuses remain the health of our core retail holdings and the development of a strong pipeline of growth initiatives and we are pleased with the progress on both fronts. Despite a very competitive market, our principally Walmart anchored sites are able to attract new tenants and increase occupancy. The investments we are making in developing multiple projects in our large urban sites continue to have a modest negative impact on our current profitability but we are confident that these mixed-use investments will provide significant long term benefits for our Unitholders as they become part of our extended portfolio," added Thomas.

Key Financial Highlights Quarterly Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT's key financial highlights for the three months ended September 30 (including the Trust's share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $56.7 $92.6 -$35.9 (38.8)% Rentals from investment properties $174.1 $172.9 $1.2 0.7% Net operating income $115.1 $116.2 -$1.1 (0.9)% FFO excluding adjustments $83.5 $83.9 -$0.4 (0.5)% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $0.54 $0.54 $0.00 -% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $0.51 $0.52 -$0.01 (1.9)% Distribution $0.41 $0.40 $0.01 2.5% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 81.0% 76.9% 4.1% 5.3% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $174.1 million, a $1.2 million or 0.7% increase over the same period last year. Net base rent increased by $0.2 million or 0.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating costs recovered increased by $0.1 million or 0.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth in the portfolio. The Trust recovered 95.9% of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 99.9% in the same quarter last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.3 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $0.6 million. In comparison to the same quarter in 2015, NOI decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in recoverable costs, net of recoveries, of $2.3 million attributable to additional shortfall and prior year adjustments as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in miscellaneous revenue mainly due to the increase in settlement proceeds and short term rental revenue of $0.9 million. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments decreased by $0.4 million or 0.5% to $83.5 million and remained the same on a per Unit basis ($0.54) compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFO excluding adjustments of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in NOI of $1.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $0.9 million and an increase in interest income of $0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO decreased by $1.0 million or 1.2% to $78.7 million and by 1.9% to $0.51 on a per Unit basis compared to the same quarter of 2015. The decrease in AFFO of $1.0 million was primarily due to the decreases described in FFO above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, further decreased by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $0.6 million. Year-to-Date Comparison to Prior Year The following table summarizes SmartREIT's key financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30 (including the Trust's share of investment in associates): (in millions of dollars, except per Unit information) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Change % Change Net income and comprehensive income $232.2 $227.8 $4.4 1.9% Rentals from investment properties $541.0 $492.2 $48.8 9.9% Net operating income $356.3 $323.9 $32.4 10.0% FFO excluding adjustments $260.1 $229.2 $30.9 13.5% Per Unit Information FFO per Unit excluding adjustments (fully diluted) $1.67 $1.58 $0.09 5.6% AFFO per Unit (fully diluted) $1.58 $1.49 $0.09 6.1% Distribution $1.24 $1.20 $0.04 3.3% Payout ratio (to AFFO) 78.4% 80.6% (2.2)% (2.7)% Operations Highlights Rentals from investment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totalled $541.0 million, a $48.8 million or 9.9% increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net base rent increased by $26.5 million or 8.2%, primarily due to rent increases from new and renewing tenants, partially offset by higher vacancies, and income from acquisitions that closed during 2015 and 2016, as well as Earnouts and completed Developments that occurred during 2015 and 2016. Property operating cost recoveries increased by $11.4 million or 7.1% due to the related increases in recoverable costs with the growth of the Trust's portfolio. In addition, the increase to miscellaneous revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. The Trust recovered 96.6% of total recoverable expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 98.8% in the same period last year. Non-recovery of most of the remaining costs resulted from higher vacancies, fixed recovery rates for some tenants, restrictions contained in certain anchor tenant leases, unfavourable property operating cost recovery adjustments made in 2016 for prior years of $0.6 million and favourable realty tax adjustments made in 2015 for prior years of $1.3 million. In comparison to the same period in 2015, NOI increased by $32.4 million or 10.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of: a) the growth of the Trust's portfolio mainly due to the Transaction that closed on May 28, 2015, resulting in an increase to NOI of $24.6 million and b) the increase to miscellaneous revenue, which was primarily due to $9.7 million settlement proceeds associated with the Target lease terminations net of other amounts. FFO and AFFO Highlights For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO excluding adjustments increased by $30.9 million or 13.5% to $260.1 million and by 5.6% to $1.67 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in FFO excluding adjustments of $30.9 million was primarily due to an increase in NOI of $32.4 million, an increase in salaries and related costs attributed to leasing - which are added back to FFO - in the amount of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, AFFO increased by $29.6 million or 13.7% to $245.7 million and by 6.1% to $1.58 on a per Unit basis compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in AFFO of $29.6 million was primarily due to the increases described in FFO above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further offset by adjusted salaries and related costs attributed to leasing of $2.0 million. Non-IFRS Measures The non-IFRS measures used in this Press Release, including AFFO, FFO, NOI and payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-IFRS measures are more fully defined and discussed in the 'Management Discussion and Analysis' (MD&A) of the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, available on Sedar at www.sedar.com.

Included in that model, apparently, are collard greens, a hearty staple of meat-and-threes everywhere. Collards are typically thought of as a value vegetable, but at Neiman Marcus, they’ll run you $66 plus $15.50 for shipping. What makes $81 collard greens so special? According to the store’s website, these are ready to heat in the microwave and seasoned with "just the right amount of spices and bacon." An order includes four 12-ounce trays meant to serve eight to 10 people, working out to $1.69 per ounce, which is... a lot. Neiman Marcus doesn't mention what particular spices go into the greens, but it's a good bet they're similar to what's found in a 27-ounce can of "Margaret Holmes Seasoned Southern Style Heat N Serve Collard Greens," available at Walmart for a single buck. As for the bacon, a 16-ounce package of Oscar Meyer is listed on Walmart’s website for $4.98. Passing on the Neiman Marcus ready-to-heat selection, a savvy shopper can get 54 ounces of pre-cooked collards and a pound of bacon — plenty for to mix in as seasoning — for about $7. That translates to $0.13 per ounce of greens (or $0.10 if you want to factor in that entire package of bacon). That’s a much better deal. To be fair, Neiman Marcus's greens are likely superior in taste if the company is starting with fresh produce, but is it worth that steep price? Anyone who does their grocery shopping at Neiman Marcus already knows they're paying a premium for $65 broccoli-cheese casserole, $85 cornbread dressing, $72 enchiladas, and so on. Of course, you could simply buy some fresh collards from the market and cook them yourself. Not everything has to be microwaveable, you know. Either way, don’t buy your food at Neiman Marcus. • [H/T: WHIO] • Neiman Marcus Will Sell You Six Dozen Fancy Tamales For $110 [EDAL] • All Rich People Things [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Read Restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Post-Election Letter to Employees My Cast-Iron Conversion This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Are Festive AF This Article has a component height of 6.

Falk / Staff Photographer Pottstown's Marvin Pearson started losing his sight at 8 and was completely blind two years later. During that time, he inexplicably also lost his hearing. Now, at 18, he is a senior at Pottstown High School after spending three years at the Overbrook School for the Blind, and plays football. He scored a 65-yard touchdown and two-point conversion in recent games. by Kathy Boccella, Staff Writer Close icon Kathy Boccella Staff Writer After going blind and then deaf while still in grade school, Marvin Pearson learned how to get around his Pottstown neighborhood, even walking alone six blocks to a Walmart. Regaining some hearing after getting an implant in his left ear, he excelled at wrestling and track at Overbook School for the Blind, figured out how to defeat his two sisters on PlayStation games, and occasionally alarmed them and his mother by roller-blading around the house. Slideshow Blindness can't sack Pottstown running back Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon But that still wasn't enough. During the summer, Pearson contacted Pottstown High School and said he wanted to return to his hometown school for senior year - and there was one other thing. He was going out for varsity football. "I talked to him and said, 'It's going to be a process,' " recalled Pottstown head coach Gary Rodenbaugh. This fall, that process quickly evolved into a remarkable journey not only for his blind and hearing-impaired running back, but for Pearson's teammates, who say his contagious can-do spirit has made an otherwise so-so season a life lesson they will never forget. It was the viral video of a 65-yard touchdown sprint last month during the last play of a 48-0 rout that gave Pearson a burst of fame, including a TV appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he was given a $10,000 scholarship and the promise of a trip to meet his football idol, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. No one seemed to care that the other team's defense stood aside as Pearson tore down the field. The real highlight for the teen was his three-yard plunge for a critical two-point conversion in a victory over Upper Merion High School, because that time he fought off live tacklers to reach the end zone. "It was time to show I was just a football player, not a blind football player," said Pearson, recalling how six defenders couldn't bring him down until he was finally over the goal line. It was the epitome of what Pearson has done again and again since he began losing his sight at age 7: Finding a way to do just about anything other kids do. "People ask, 'How does your brother play football, how does he run track?' I say, 'I don't know,' " marveled his older sister MarDaije, a freshman at Chestnut Hill College. "It's like he never even lost his sight," she said, adding: "He doesn't think he has it worse than others. He feels equal to everybody else." Indeed, Pearson, who maintains a 3.6 grade-point average, is already sprinting toward his next goals, college and a career in sports management, a fitting choice for a kid who's juggling 17 fantasy football teams. "Marvin doesn't know what obstacles mean," said his mother, Ana Carmona. "He has none. If they're there, he does not see them." Growing up in Pottstown, Pearson was an active, sports-loving kid who played youth football in Conshohocken and, his mother recalled, was often "hardheaded." The child's stubborn determination would serve him well when seemingly out of the blue, his vision began to deteriorate. Doctors eventually determined that he suffered from retinal detachment, and laser surgery on both eyes didn't prevent a total loss of sight over the next two years. "I was never the type to cry," Pearson recalled of the experience. "I wasn't scared, but it was frustrating trying to prove to doctors and teachers that I couldn't see." About a year into his vision crisis, Pearson started losing his hearing as well. Carmona said neither the family nor doctors ever figured out the cause. Only the cochlear implant prevented him from completely losing touch with the outside world. Yet Carmona said the harrowing experience seemed to be harder on her than on him. "Marvin, honestly, he took it on the shoulder," she recalled. "It was me in the corner crying every night and angry with God." Pearson's relatives say he always remained focused on what he could do, not what he couldn't. He knew his way around his Bright Hope Community neighborhood, so it wasn't long before he ventured out with his cane, making it two blocks to an aunt's house or to a nearby park with an assist from one of his sisters. "He always just kept going and acted the same," said MarDaije. Sometime he insisted on riding his bike, and she would have to run alongside. At Pottstown Middle School, he wrestled and played football, although he wasn't cleared for full contact. He started high school at the Overbook School for the Blind, where he also played goal ball, developed for blind athletes, in which players try to score with - or block - a ball that makes noises with tiny bells. In transferring to Pottstown High this fall, Pearson, 18, knew it was a chance to pursue his unfulfilled dreams on the gridiron - for real this time. It's a road that few travel. The U.S. Association of Blind Athletes is tracking just two similar players in the entire country, defensive lineman Jay Spencer at St. John Paul II Catholic High School in Huntsville, Ala., and long snapper Jake Olson at the University of Southern California. But Mark Lucas, executive director of the USABA, said it's possible for a blind athlete to succeed in just about any sport as long as coaches are willing to provide adaptations. Rodenbaugh and his staff were more than willing to adapt. They drew up plays for Pearson to take the snap under center and plow forward behind a wedge of blockers, but they also saw the larger, intangible benefit of someone who could teach his teammates about overcoming adversity. Just 5-9 and 154 pounds, Pearson said he idolizes Brees because the Saints quarterback was once dismissed as too short at 6 feet. "We're both underrated," Pearson said. "He's small, I'm blind. And we're both individuals that people don't expect to be as tough as we are." At a recent practice, a few guys worked on the sidelines with Pearson while the first-team defense was on the field. He put his hands together to catch passes, and even threw a few strikes of his own, with a helper telling him how far to throw and pointing his left arm in the direction of the receiver. "Good throw, Marvin!" they said again and again. Teammates appreciate both his accomplishments and his attitude. Nehemiah Figueroa, 16, admires how Pearson works up the home crowd with a few front flips before a game. "Marvin basically proves that no matter what your disability is, you can do anything you want," he said. The 65-yard dash against rival Pottsgrove - in which the opponents didn't challenge Pearson as he sprinted for the touchdown with a teammate's guidance - came with mixed emotions. It had been the Pottsgrove coach's idea. "I just kind of shared with him, this was going to be an opportunity to get to the end zone," Rodenbaugh recalled. "Marvin, being a competitor, was like, 'I don't want them to let me.' I emphasized it was a sign of respect for what you've been able to do and what you've shown to the world." It also proved that Pearson sometimes literally doesn't know when to quit. Five yards past the goal line, he finally dove to the ground. "We were yelling, 'Stop, stop!' - if he kept on running, he would have hit a gate," his mother said. That momentum should carry him to college next fall. It sounds like Pearson might be leaning toward Kutztown University. "I talked to the coach," he said. "He sounds like the kind of guy who will give me a chance to play." kboccella@phillynews.com 610-313-8232@Kathy_Boccella Published: November 2, 2016 — 3:59 PM EDT | Updated: November 3, 2016 — 1:08 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Published Nov 2nd, 2016 2:45 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores and its other retail subsidiaries filed an antitrust suit against owners of Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea tuna brands alleging conspiracy to fix prices and coordinate on can sizes. The federal suit was filed Monday (Oct. 31) in the Western District of Arkansas by attorneys Kutak Rock of Little Rock. A similar and original lawsuit against the three tuna brands was filed in August 2015 by Olean, N.Y.-based Olean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative. Since that filing, several other distributors, restaurants and grocery store operators have filed suit. The suit comes on the heels of other federal litigation resulting from the Department of Justice’s criminal probe on the matter. The DOJ’s investigation focuses on price fixing by the tuna industry’s major players Thai Union Group and Dongwon Industries who own Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Seas shelf-stable tuna brands — a $2.6 billion market. Wal-Mart told Talk Business & Politics it filed the suit to best protect its rights and the interests of its 260 million customers who shop its stores weekly. Wal-Mart also said there is strong evidence to support the price conspiracy claims in the complaint. In the Wal-Mart complaint the retailer said it purchased approximately $400 million per year of self-stable tuna from the defendants in the years under investigation from 2008 through the July 2015. The retailer also claims responsibility for 25% of the defendants’ combined total sales. The gist of the 38-page complaint relates to collusion by the tuna companies. The complaint alleges agreements to reduce can sizes across the industry, to issue collusive list prices, to limit promotional or discount activity, and refrain from offering products using tuna caught without fish aggregation devices (FADs) to consumers. The suit claims owners of Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Sea carried out the conspiracy through secret e-mails and telephone calls, conversations, and meetings facilitated by various industry groups. The price fixing became apparent to the public after the DOJ’s investigation began in July 2015. Because the conspiracy was actively concealed though secret communications, Wal-Mart claims it did not know it was being overcharged for packaged tuna until the federal investigation was launched. “The affirmative acts of the Defendant and their co-conspirator, including acts of further conspiracy, were wrongly concealed and carried out in a manner that precluded detection,” the complaint states. MARKET ‘NOT FUNCTIONING COMPETITIVELY’ The alleged conspiracy to reduce can sizes is said to have begun when Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea “collusively raised prices by decreasing the amount of tuna in cans sold to putative class members without also decreasing prices.” Wal-Mart’s case also states there were economic incentives for the tuna suppliers to conspire given since 1960 the supply of packaged tuna increased because of fishing innovation. However, the demand for tuna has fallen since 1985, suggesting that more supply and lower demand would push prices lower. Wal-Mart claims tuna prices have risen since 2007 with significant jumps since 2011. The suit said retail tuna prices in the U.S. jumped 10.9% in 2010 and 6.6% in 2012 amid a 7.7% drop in consumption. Wal-Mart claims the tuna companies violated the Sherman Act when they conspired to fix, raise or stabilize the price of packaged tuna products sold in the United States. The complaint asked the court to consider the charges and award damages at least three times the overcharges Walmart paid to the defendants in their relevant investigation period. The tuna industry has been had its share of litigation in recent years. In May 2015 StarKist agreed to pay $12 million to settle claims it was underfilling the cans sold at retail. The case was litigated in California federal court. All three tuna companies faced similar claims in 2012 and agreed to a $3.3 million settlement, also in California. The U.S. Department of Justice in December 2015 blocked a planned merger of Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea, noting that “consumers are better off without this deal.” “Our investigation convinced us – and the parties knew or should have known from the get go – that the market is not functioning competitively today, and further consolidation would only make things worse,” Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer note in a DOJ statement. Talk Business & Politics has sought comment from Starkist. Bumble Bee has said it does not comment about ongoing litigation or investigations. DEFENDANTS • Bumble Bee Foods of San Diego, Calif.

Moyer November 2 Follow @justinwmmoyer   What appeared to be a terrifying criminal abduction in Prince William County turned out to be a YouTube prank, police said Wednesday. Last week, Prince William County Police released video of what appeared to be a person being shoved into the trunk of a car at about 10 p.m. Friday at a Walmart in Woodbridge, and asked for the public’s help in learning more about the incident. But on Monday, police released additional video that showed those involved in the possible kidnapping calmly shopping together in Walmart afterward. So was the kidnapping real — or was it “playfighting,” as one witness reported? “From the beginning, we didn’t really know what it was,” said Sgt. Jonathan L. Perok, a spokesman for Prince William County Police. “We don’t want to call it a prank until we talk to the people involved.” Now, police have determined for sure that the kidnapping was faux. On Wednesday, they announced they contacted the “victim,” an 18-year-old Woodbridge man, who said the incident was staged. “The parties involved appeared to have filmed the incident to later post on YouTube,” the Prince William County Police said in a statement. No charges will be filed, police said. local local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

In the first nine months of 2016, Group revenues totalled €734.2 million, +7.9% or +9.7% on a like-for-like basis. Eric Hémar, Chairman and CEO of ID Logistics, comments: "Every quarter, ID Logistics' business grows at a good pace, both in France and internationally, where the large number of new contracts gaining momentum balances the negative impact of exchange rates in emerging countries. In addition, September brought the first contribution from Logiters, whose integration is progressing on schedule. In a contrasted geographical market environment, with our offer strategically positioned and the quality of our team, we are confident in being able to pursue our growth."

In the first nine months, revenues totalled €425.6 million, +12.4% versus the year-earlier period. This very strong performance was driven by a number of new contracts starting during the period, combined with good momentum, notably in volume, in existing contracts. International revenues rose +16.2% to €125.3 million in the 3rd quarter, and were up +2.3% to €308.6 million in the first nine months, taking into account initial consolidation of the Group Logiters, acquired at the end of August 2016 in Spain and Portugal, on September 1st. Negative currency impact, mainly due to the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and South African rand, was weaker in Q3 than at the start of 2016. On a like-for-like basis, revenues were up +2.9% in the 3rd quarter and +5.9% in the first nine months compared with the equivalent periods of 2015, where growth was strong. NEW CONTRACTS The Group is still taking part in a large number of invitations to tender and winning or starting new contracts, including the following: France The Group is extending its collaboration with long-standing client Carrefour and is beginning operations at a 20,000 m² platform at the Brie-Comte-Robert (Seine-et-Marne) site. It serves 461 Carrefour convenience stores in the Southeast part of the Paris region. ID Logistics is continuing to develop its e-commerce offering and has been selected by AuchanDirect, an online shopping and home delivery service, to operate a 25,000 m² mechanized platform at Chilly-Mazarin (Essonne), which will be able to deliver goods to central Paris and its inner suburbs within a few hours. International Worldwide retail leader Walmart has, for the first time, appointed ID Logistics to manage its logistics platform for non-food products (general goods, garden, office, DIY, toys, etc.) in Argentina. From a 13,000 m2 platform, ID Logistics will manage collection and distribution flows, store 16,000 SKU and carry out cross-docking operations. In Taiwan, the Group is starting a partnership with City'super, an upscale retailer specialising in chilled products, delicatessen goods and lifestyle products with more than 10,000 SKU. Lastly, the Group launches a platform in Russia for the international liquor group Bacardi, 15,000 m² close to Moscow to serve the whole of its retail, distribution, and restaurant clients. OUTLOOK In 2016, the priority of the Group is to focus on the operational and financial management of the numerous operations it has started, laying strong foundations for their future productivity improvement, and integrating the Logiters business. In 2017, the Group will thus be able to take advantage of its strong financial position and consider new acquisitions. NEXT RELEASE Publication of full-year revenues after the market closes on 31 January 2017. ABOUT ID LOGISTICS ID Logistics, managed by Eric Hémar, is an international contract logistics group, with revenue of €931 million in 2015.

It often seems like people are only dressing to scare or seduce. While some people actually do manage to create an amusing, good-natured costume, the majority suck. I thought we had seen the worst of the worst with these damn clowns. Clearly, I was wrong. Photo courtesy of creative commons / Mike Mozart For the very affordable price of $3.99, Walmart planned on selling “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up.” Yeah, you read that right. Somehow this mockery of mental illness and self-inflicted wounds got past all of the higher-ups at Walmart and was being sold for money. Thankfully, enough people signed an online petition to remove the product, according to pix11.com. Walmart released a statement explaining and apologizing for the incident. “The costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace,” the statement said. “It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it yesterday morning when it was brought to our attention.” Despite Walmart’s reasoning, this is still horrendous and unacceptable. Mental illness is a serious topic, especially on the impressionable youth who easily could have gone online in search of the perfect costume and seen this. It is extremely disheartening that grown people still do not take this seriously. Costume or not, mocking mental illnesses is not okay, and as of right now, neither is Walmart. -M.

Results Outlook Presidential Candidates OnPolitics Wal-Mart may help change conversation on US wages Politics Now Mark Barrett , mbarrett@citizen-times.com 2:30 p.m. EDT November 5, 2016 54 Shares The sign at Walmart's East Asheville store glows in the early evening Tuesday.  (Photo: Mark Barrett/mbarrett@citizen-times.com) While most of us have been distracted by an especially angry election season, The New York Times published an article on a development that may help soothe some of those hard feelings. The Times' Oct. 15 article suggested Wal-Mart's decision announced in February 2015 to pay its employees more, provide them with training and career paths, and give them more flexible and predictable schedules might be paying off. After increasing dissatisfaction with the state of its stores, a drop in a key sales measure that lasted five quarters and a wry observation from a consulting company that, "If an item is not on the shelf, you cannot sell it," the company raised its minimum hourly pay to $10 an hour for workers who complete a training course. The idea was to pay enough to get better employees, including workers who might aspire to a career with Wal-Mart. That was a big switch from the company's approach historically, in which human resources policies were designed to pay as little as possible to as few people as possible. The number of Wal-Mart employees in the United States fell 7 percent over a five-year period ending in early 2013, for instance, while the square footage of stores rose 13 percent. There's some evidence that the investment is paying off, although it is too soon to render a final verdict. The Times reported that sales at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year were up 1.6 percent for the most recent quarter, in comparison to a decline of 0.4 percent for general merchandise retailers overall. Profits were down, but the degree to which that reflects higher payroll costs or other costs is not clear What does all of this have to do with politics? One of the biggest sources of discontent among people considering who they will vote for in 2016 is a long-term trend of stagnant wages for many Americans, particularly those who do not have college degrees. When your pay either doesn't buy more from one year to the next or maybe even drops a bit once inflation is taken into account, it is natural to wonder what or who is to blame. Wal-Mart has a total workforce of about 1.2 million, and it's a good guess that many - by no means all - did not graduate from college. If many of those 1.2 million get a raise, employers hiring from the same pool of workers may have to give raises too. As big as Wal-Mart is, there are limits to how much it can change the national employment picture by itself. In September, there were 36.5 million workers who had only a high school degree or less and an additional 37.9 million who either had a two-year degree or some college without a degree. But with unemployment at around 5 percent these days, Wal-Mart's decision suggests employers may be finding they have to be more generous with their workers to keep them on the payroll. By at least one measure, hourly workers have seen an increase the buying power of their wages for more than three years now. That's a trend that could continue for a while, and perhaps even change Americans' attitudes a bit no matter who sits in the Oval Office in 2017. Crime scenes? But, there's always a "but." A labor union group called Making Change at Wal-Mart challenged the Times' story. "The New York Times didn’t talk to the many workers that still struggle with understaffed and understocked stores, erratic scheduling and poverty wages. It only talked to ones who were willing to push Wal-Mart's propaganda," it said in a news release. The release didn't say how the group knows whom the Times didn't interview, however. Reporters don't always name every source they speak to, especially in a story as involved as the Times' story is. Better documented than the group's complaint is the picture painted by an August story in Bloomberg Businessweek that says cost cutting at Wal-Mart stores has left them staffed with too few people to deter crime. The burden then falls to local police departments. The story says a log of police calls to one store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, runs 126 pages and documents more than 5,000 trips over five years. Bill Ferguson, a police captain in Port Richey, Florida, told the magazine: "The constant calls from Wal-Mart are just draining. They recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it." The mayor of a town in Indiana said he had instructed his police chief to declare the store there a public nuisance. Wal-Mart's CEO says dealing with crime is a top priority and the company says measures to bring down crime are working. Bloomberg Businessweek said police chiefs and officers it interviewed disagree. We don't know what the crime situation is at local Wal-Mart stores, and who should bear what share of the burden for policing Wal-Mart stores or any other store would be a good topic for a debate another day. But the problems suggest that overall, Wal-Mart still has some work to do - and needs more workers to do it.

The ranking is designed to identify the retailers currently setting the highest standards of performance as viewed by their trading partners, and to gain insight into what makes these retailers "best in class."   While Walmart’s long-standing dominance among U.S. retailers now has a formidable challenger in the overall composite score, the discounter continues to outrank all other retailers in the areas of clear strategy and supply chain management.    A major factor in Kroger’s performance this year, according to Kantar, was its ability to innovate and maximize the shopper experience by applying insights derived from both suppliers and its own shopper insights firm, 84.51. Manufacturers voted Kroger No. 1 in the categories of “best retailer to do business with,” “best buying teams,” “most innovative merchandising,” and “best practice category leadership.”       In addition to being tied for the overall No. 1 position, Kroger ranked first in the following categories: "best retailer to do business with," best practice category leadership," "best buying teams," and "most innovative merchandising."     The company also tied for first in the "clearest strategy" category.   Click here for more.     Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Macy’s unloads five stores Sears executive jumps ship for party supplies specialty retailer Online fashion retailer files Chapter 11 CEO shakeup at Whole Foods Safeway to acquire 87-year-old specialty grocery Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Target axes kids’ shopping carts Unusual deal gives Aeropostale new lease on life — and it just got better Flip-Flop Shops on the move Target first out of the gate with holiday hiring plans Solutions Spotlight Holiday Uptime: Preparing Your Network for the Holiday Rush Your network connection is more than just a means of connecting your point-of-sale system – it’s a driving force of your online and in-store experiences.

Share Home MOBILE Contact LOGIN LOGOUT ✕ ≡ Will Fresh kill local grocers? Have you tried Walmart�s new Pickup? You go to Walmart.com or their app and order groceries. Employees shop for you before you drive to the store to pick up everything. No walking around the store, standing in line, or getting stuck longer than you wanted. Walmart took the idea from AmazonFresh. Amazon started AmazonFresh in Seattle, delivering groceries to your door so that you didn�t have to go to a store. It then entered 16 other major markets. Amazon�s only problem was keeping produce, dairy and meats cold enough once delivered. Leaving those items outside a door all day isn�t as easy as leaving your latest DVD purchase. Walmart capitalized on that idea and created Pickup. You schedule a time to visit the store guaranteeing that your items are kept fresh. Not to be outdone, Amazon has decided to create pickup locations in Seattle. Customers can order what they want online and have it waiting for them at a gas station-esque store where they pull up and their groceries are put in their cars. This gives them the ease of ordering online while keeping all items as fresh as possible. The only question is, if these Amazon and Walmart succeed in our community, how long before local neighborhood groceries go out of business? Have you used Walmart Pickup? What are your thoughts on it? Any other tech questions? Email me at Ashley.LexChron@gmail.com Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

In September, in Huntsville, TEXAS, Wilma Price was driving through a Walmart parking lot when she saw a homeless man holding a sign that said, “Dog in pound. Need help.” Price, who runs a rescue called Mr. K’s Pet Shelter, stopped to find out his story. She learned the homeless man, named Patrick, had been arrested and jailed for trespassing, and that, because of that, his dog ended up in the animal shelter. She took Patrick to the shelter, and paid the $120 necessary for him to get his dog — named Franklin — back. The story was picked up by the website Life with Dogs, CBS News, People.com and many more. Dozens of other websites reprinted or rewrote it — most of them doing a decent job of passing along the facts. Then there was the Alabama Observer. It reported that the story took place in Huntsville, Alabama, that the dog’s name was Wilbur, that the homeless man’s name was Mark Spencer, and that the good Samaritan’s name was Elizabeth Masterson. The story had no links to actual news sources, and little attribution. It wasn’t the only website to get the facts askew, but it was the only one that appeared to be making up entirely new names for everyone involved. At least three other websites published versions of the story with those erroneous names. One wonders what might be the motivation for substituting illegitimate names into a legitimate story. Might the exact same story have happened with different people at a Walmart in Huntsville, Alabama? Clearly not. Might the website be trying to cover its rear, legally? Maybe. Might there be something more nefarious going on, such as diverting donations intended for Patrick (whose last name isn’t Spencer) to some guy named Mark Spencer? We hope not. Might a computer program be doing the website’s writing? Highly possible. Apparently, a bogus Go Fund Me campaign to raise funds for Patrick was launched by someone neither Wilma nor Patrick knew, and, using photos from Wilma’s Facebook page, it raised $3,000 before the page was removed from Go Fund Me. That’s $3,000 Patrick and Franklin didn’t get. Wilma Price, meanwhile, started a campaign for him too, and it has raised more than $15,000 for Patrick on GoFundMe. Price said Patrick has been helping her organization with rescue efforts since the two met, and her Facebook page documents their adventures together. Snopes.com looked into the story and couldn’t figure out how or why the Alabama Observer version had new names inserted into it. There is no contact information on the Alabama Observer’s web site, and no description of who operates it. Snopes reported it appears to accept stories submitted by users, as opposed to having its own reporters or freelancers. We think there’s a good possibility it’s one of those websites that runs news stories through computer programs that rewrite them (with mixed results, or should I say “stirred outcomes?”). How else could you explain the opening of this recent Alabama Observer story about clown sightings in Ohio? “The developing rash of reported dangers including clown-faced villains has law authorization offices crosswise over Ohio and somewhere else attempting to recognize true blue dangers while cautioning deceptions are no giggling matter.” (Photos courtesy of Wilma Price) Bookmark on Delicious Digg this post Recommend on Facebook Pin it on pinterest share via Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet about it Subscribe to the comments on this post Bookmark in Browser Tell a friend Posted by John Woestendiek November 2nd, 2016 under Muttsblog.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Walmart in McDowell County has been sold Share Article By MetroNews Staff in News | November 01, 2016 at 7:29PM KIMBALL, W.Va. — The Walmart in McDowell County, which closed earlier this year, has been sold. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports the McDowell County Clerk’s Office said the store in Kimball was sold in September for $175,000, according to a specialty warranty deed on file. Walmart announced in January the closure of more than 250 under-performing stores worldwide with more than half of those in the U.S. The list included the Kimball store. The state had been contacted by the Rural King chain, but no announcements have been made about the store being bought. County officials said selling the Walmart property is good for the county because it would bring back jobs lost during the store’s closure.

Unlucky Louie showed up at the club for his penny game complaining of an aching back. “Did you strain a muscle?” I asked in sympathy. “At Wal-Mart,” Louie groaned. “One of those ‘World’s Strongest Man’ events should be trying to pull the shopping carts apart.” Louie got snarled up in today’s deal. As the declarer at five diamonds (not North-South’s best spot; as the cards lay, they could have made six clubs), he ruffed the second heart and drew trumps. Louie next cashed the A-K of clubs. The queen fell from East, but after Louie took the jack and ten, the suit was blocked. He couldn’t reach dummy’s fifth club and lost two spades to go down. SINGLETON “I needed either defender to have the singleton queen,” Louie sighed. Louie can get untangled. He can draw two trumps, ending in dummy, and lead a club to his nine. When that strange finesse wins, Louie can draw the last trump, lead a club to his ten, and cash the A-K and the fifth club for a spade discard.

Partner next rebids three hearts. What do you say? ANSWER: If your partner had solid hearts, he could have jumped to four hearts at his third turn. Since his actual bidding suggests a distributional minimum, settle for game. Raise to four hearts. To try 3NT with only one spade stopper might be a losing action.

Photo courtesy Salvation Army Sebastian Echeverry Staff Writer From Belize to Argentina, from Vietnam to Cambodia, retired Navy man Gordon Kulju has seen much of the world. But, despite witnessing so much culture, he said a sight he has no complaints about is his apartment in Long Beach. After serving from 1963 to 1969, Kulju found a roof over his head in Bells Shelter, a Salvation Army-run facility that was his home for some time until he was housed in his current apartment through a program with the organization. “It’s a good program,” Kulju said. “They helped me get into the apartment and gave me money for the deposit.” To make his apartment feel more like a home, Major Judy Hedgren, Salvation Army social service/community coordinator, introduced Kulju to the Welcome Home Kit program. The kit supplies military veterans with dishes, pots, pans, flatware, kitchen towels, utensils, bath towels, bath mats, a trash can, soap, a toothbrush holder and a $40 gift card to WalMart. The program started in 2013, according to Hedgren, and every year since then, the Salvation Army tries to help approximately 100 veterans. From 2014 to 2015, the number of veterans helped has climbed from 65 to 135. As of press time, Hedgren said 75 veterans are already signed up for the program. To receive aid from the Welcome Home Kit program, a veteran’s case worker must get in contact with the Salvation Army after the client is housed via the government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program called HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH). Since 2008, HUD and the Veterans Association (VA) have awarded HUD-VASH vouchers to veterans based on geographic needs and the quality of local public housing agencies. Once the VA determines which areas of the country have the highest number of homeless veterans, it identifies its facilities in the area. HUD then selects housing agencies nearby to the identified facilities and sends the agencies invitations to apply for the vouchers. Congress appropriated $50 million in 2011 to serve approximately 7,000 voucher families and $60 million in 2016 to serve approximately 8,000 families, according to HUD.gov. Hedgren said she enjoys working closely with veterans. Enlarge Since the program’s introduction in 2013, the Salvation Army has aimed to help veterans with household essentials via the Welcome Home Kit program. The numbers above show how many veterans have benefited from the kits. Infographic by Sebastian Echeverry “My husband served with the 82nd Airborne Division during the Vietnam War,” she said. “So, this morning, it was neat to talk to a veteran who served with the 101st Airborne Division during the same war. It was nice to talk about his experience.” Hedgren said that a struggle veterans face when they get a new home is they don’t always know what they need to purchase for the home. The Salvation Army pre-purchases all the materials for the veterans and includes additional items if the veteran has kids to care for. “At first, the program was just for female veterans and their children,” Hedgren said. “When I took over, I opened it up for the men as well.” The items are purchased using the organization’s credit card. The money collected for the credit card comes from various donations and charity events. The Salvation Army recently hosted a golf tournament to raise funds for the kit program. “The more support we get, the more we can do,” Hedgren said. With Christmas and other holidays quickly approaching, she said that donors can call the Salvation Army and request to specifically help military families. If people choose to help in that way, all proceeds go toward a veteran and his or her family. Hedgren said that the support from people helps maintain approximately 70 percent of veterans housed. “Gosh, I was in shock with all the things they gave me,” Kulju said. “They gave me really nice stuff for my home. It helped me so much, I couldn’t believe it.” He still makes visits to the Salvation Army’s facility, collects food from a food bank and keeps in contact with Hedgren. Having traveled to different corners of the globe, Kulju said that the poverty he has seen in various countries is sickening and that even though the area in which his apartment is located isn’t the best, there is no other place like home. Citizens can call Hedgren at (562) 247-3524 or email judy.hedgren@usw.salvationarmy.org to help with the organization’s program. Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Wal-Mart ousted as largest employer in the state; held spot for 18 years Share Article By MetroNews in News | November 03, 2016 at 4:07PM CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A national retailer is no longer the state’s largest employer. Walmart is the second largest employer in the state for the first time since 1998. WVU Medicine, formerly West Virginia United Health System, employs the most workers in the state according to WorkForce West Virginia’s March 2016 data. The exact employment numbers are not released to maintain employer confidentiality. But, according to information from the first quarter of 2016, the state’s top five largest private employers are WVU Medicine, Wal-Mart, Charleston Area Medical Center, Kroger and Mylan Pharmaceuticals. WVU Medicine and Wal-Mart swapped positions on the list while the remaining three employers held the same rankings from 2015. There have been some position changes in the next five largest employers. Lowe’s Home Centers is sixth followed by St. Mary’s Medical Center, Cabell Huntington Hospital, Wheeling Hospital and Res-Care, Inc. WorkForce WV indicated the top 10 employers in the state had 4,395 more people working for them than in 2015. Fourteen employers that had never made the top 100 list before are on the 2016 list.

The event will take place at the Walmart on Hwy 18 on Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. to benefit the Good Samaritan Center’s Food Pantry & Soup Kitchen. “Last year’s food drive was so successful, so we are hoping to fill even more of our police trucks again this year,” Chief Stewart said. “The Good Samaritan Center does so much to help our community, and we want to give back.” The Good Samaritan Center’s focus is to provide struggling low-income families with food and to assist the Department of Human Services and the American Red Cross to handle emergency food situations. Over the last year, Good Samaritan’s Food Pantry has helped over 1,200 people with over 27,500 meals, while their Soup Kitchen, that serves a hot lunch meal to those in need, has served approximately 80,000 meals over the last year. “The Chief and his officers work extremely hard and put their lives on the line every day to make sure every neighborhood, every business and every resident and visitor to Laurel is safe,” said Kathy Clem, executive director of the Good Samaritan Center. “I am so humbled that they want to give back even more to the Laurel community through this Fill-a-Truck Food Drive. I encourage residents who come out and support the Food Drive to also, take the time to tell the officers how much you appreciate the work they do and let them know that they have your support.” The department will also accept donations of non-perishable food items and cash donations for The Good Samaritan Center.

Mounds of dirt where fresh, green landscaping should be surrounded the facility while the buzzing of an electric saw could be heard nearby. The Jacksonville public safety complex was originally set to open in August after construction started last year. Delays pushed the opening to October; then November. As of Thursday, it appeared officials waiting for the long-delayed complex would need to wait a little longer. Weather delays at the start of construction plus a few minor changes and additions to the project have pushed the completion date to late December, officials said. And the city likely won’t get to open and use the facility until early next year, they said. “It’s been a little frustrating, of course,” said Jarrod Simmons, city administrator. “It was originally supposed to be open in August, but hopefully we’ll get everything moved in by the end of December and have it open by the first of the year.” Construction began last year on the $12.5 million, more than 46,000 square-foot complex. Located on the south end of the city behind the Walmart Super Center, the complex features far more space than the current municipal courtroom and police and fire departments. It will also have state-of-the-art technology, including retina scanners at the jail. Greg Harper, superintendent on the project for head contractor, Boatner Construction in Gadsden, said much of the continued opening day changes are because of weather delays near the start of construction. “We lost three months due to rain when we started … that’s 110 working days,” Harper said. “We’ve made up for some of that, but not all of it.” Harper also said that the city has made some changes to the project in recent months, which added to the construction time. “Some of it’s due to security and equipment needed for the jail,” Harper said. “And they wanted keypads for the fire department.” Police Chief Tommy Thompson said he didn't think it would take his department more than a week to fully move into the new complex. Thompson said most of the move would consist of radio equipment and files. “It’s exciting … everything will be nice, neat and clean,” Thompson said of the new building. Thompson said the new building would be a major upgrade over the current police department. “It will things we’ve never had before like a training room and exercise room … and the records room will be bigger,” Thompson said. “We’ll actually be able to go to a place where everyone in the department can have a meeting instead of having to leave the department to meet somewhere else.” Municipal Court Judge Joseph Maloney said the new facility would offer more space than he currently has at City Hall. And once the complex opens, municipal court will be held on Tuesdays at 1 p.m. instead of 5:30 p.m. like it is currently. “City Hall has a number of employees who use the parking lot, making it insufficient to use for court during the day,” Maloney said. “The new courtroom will have plenty of parking.” Staff writer Patrick McCreless: 256-235-3561.

Done Editing Tags 5 Comments Share this article 27 27 27 Sarah Jaffe is one of the best labor journalists working in the United States today. She’s brought her fearless, blunt voice and thoughtful eye to the Nation, Salon, In These Times, Washington Post, Atlantic, and more. Barbara Ehrenreich described her new book, Necessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt, as “American history at its freshest and most compelling”; Frances Fox Piven called it “a vivid portrait of the contemporary protest movements that just may transform America.” Necessary Trouble covers a wide range of movements that rose up in the wake of the financial crisis. What do you see as the through-line connecting them? I used the financial crisis as my starting point because it felt to me that the movements happening afterward were different than what had come before. So if I had to choose one through-line it would be that; that these were movements that came out of a massive crisis of capitalism, and that one way or another were searching for big, deep, fundamental changes to the inequality that is now impossible to ignore. The issues of economic and racial and gender inequality, of labor's declining power, of a plummeting faith in our political leadership class as power concentrates in the hands of an ever-smaller group of elites had all begun before 2008, but after 2008 it was much, much harder to ignore them or to think that surface-level tinkering was going to fix them. How did you come to this set of interests—to writing about labor and social movements, and this book specifically? My go-to answer to this question is always punk rock and lousy jobs. But in the case of this book, the movements happened to me. I was a part-time freelance journalist from the time I finished college (in 2002) until I decided to go to journalism school in 2007. And while I was working on that degree and deciding what kinds of things I wanted to cover, what kinds of jobs I would pursue, the bottom fell out of the economy and I found myself trying to figure out what a credit default swap was. I already wanted to write about labor and work and economic issues, but that all became much sharper as I looked around and saw banks getting bailed out and whispers of rebellion—the Republic Windows and Doors workers, who are in my book—just under the surface. I got an internship at The Nation, and then got a job with Laura Flanders at what was then GRITtv, and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to political journalism. And then things just kept happening, and I kept covering them. In a real way, this book is the product of my entire full-time journalism career. You trace a history where unions were vulnerable to red-baiting, were—with the exception of some public sector unions—"disaffected with the [1960s] social movements," didn't organize the South because they couldn't or wouldn't tackle racial divisions effectively. But in the recent movements you study, unions are largely supportive and in some cases are key backers. How did unions (and the institutional left more generally) come around? Where do you see gaps in that support for new movements, and on the flip side, what do they bring to the table? I am a labor journalist and a once and (maybe) future union member; the way that workers wield power in and around the workplace and the economy is the subject nearest to my heart. I am fascinated by the history of the labor movement and the tension within it between making fundamental changes to society or eking out the best deal for its members. For a long time, the largest swath of the labor movement thought it had reached a sort of detente with capital, that the boss was content to share some of the proceeds in exchange for a committed workforce that didn't oppose bosses' gains. It took a while for labor to realize that the boss never stopped trying to wipe it out, but I think it's impossible now to pretend that there's a future for unions that isn't fought for tooth and nail. Entire books have been written by people with much more experience than I have on how labor came around, but for me the thing that's interesting is watching the labor movement embrace social movements again sometimes cynically, sometimes with real honesty that they have a lot to learn. This book covers the Wisconsin uprising, the Chicago teachers strike, OUR Walmart and the Fight for $15, all of which are in some ways outside of the box for the labor movement, as well as movements like Occupy Wall Street or the movement for black lives where labor realized that it had to get involved. The road of course is bumpy. Labor doesn't act monolithically; unions with a lot of members of color have been quicker to embrace the movement for black lives and the struggle at Standing Rock, while police unions in the former case and particular building trades in the latter have resisted. And let's be clear, short-term interest in maintaining jobs in a still deeply unstable economy isn't a small concern. But the fact that these debates are happening—that unions are joining marches for justice for Philando Castile and Eric Garner, that they are traveling to Standing Rock to stand with the water protectors, that these debates are happening within labor because after all workers are killed by police, workers are redlined, workers lose homes to (illegal) foreclosures, workers drink poisoned water and they don't—or shouldn't—stop being union members when they walk out the workplace door at the end of the day. Your book points to the importance of organizing and mobilizing outside the realm of electoral politics, but in recent years we've seen presidential campaigns that seemed to harness some movement energy—while working to keep it within an electoral campaign mode. You note that President Obama refused to use his movement after being elected in 2008. Do you have a mental image of what might have happened, for good or ill, if he had worked to keep it active? In a similar vein, where do you see the movement energy stirred up by Bernie Sanders' primary campaign going? I don't know what might have happened if Obama had been willing to use his movement, but I've had a lot of conversations with movement people about the weakness of the left in general around 2008. We went from a deeply unpopular, in many ways really horrifying Republican administration to a new young president with an organizing background and a mandate for "change" in a moment when the economy was exploding, and in that moment the left didn't do what it should have. A bit out of trust that Obama would do the right thing and a bit simply out of a lack of capacity. I don't think we're in that place now. For one, the shock of the crisis has faded and the anger remains and if anything is stronger now. The energy that went into the Sanders campaign was not created by Sanders; I was just talking with someone about Bernie's 2010 non-filibuster and how it was this moment where this guy who was barely known to a large swath of the country, outside of committed left-leaning political junkies, decided to stand up and fight. No one knew who that guy was in 2010, and if you'd told me in 2010 or indeed in 2015 that he would get over 12 million votes in a presidential race I would have asked where you got the good drugs. But he went from being the lone voice in the wilderness to someone that channeled the existing anger and frustration of a lot of people. Looking forward, I'm less interested in what *Bernie* does with his movement—because just as I'm not sure Obama ever actually had the ability to command people that he's often assumed to have had and refused to use, I don't think the Bernie energy is just about Bernie. I'm interested in what is happening in state-level fights and strikes and the camps at Standing Rock and the people who just today were blockading bank lobbies in solidarity with Standing Rock. I'm interested in the people who have joined an organization in their neighborhood, the people who have started a new one, the people who are having reading groups and who are planning to pressure the next president. Ultimately it's dangerous to assume that you just elect the right person and things will change. That was the real lesson of 2008. Hillary Clinton's campaign has been less movement-framed and affiliated than either of those campaigns. As we anticipate a Clinton presidency, how might her relationship to movements play out differently than did Obama's once he was in office, and which of the movements you chronicled seem most important in advancing a post-election agenda? I am looking at a Facebook feed full of critical responses and frank anger at Clinton's failure to respond to Standing Rock in a meaningful way, so that feels fresh right now. But there are so many things that will require pressure, I hate to choose one. The movement for black lives stayed out of the presidential race and continues to work in cities like Charlotte and Chicago and Oakland and around the country; Hillary Clinton very cannily avoided actually endorsing a $15 an hour minimum wage, so that fight will have to continue; from day one there will be a lot of people who distrust Clinton's closeness to Wall Street; and I'm anticipating that if we do have our first woman president, sexism is going to crop up in very nasty places and we're going to need a feminist movement that doesn't assume it has won because the president is now female. Also, presuming Clinton does win, there's going to be a lot of anger from Trump supporters that will not go away, and progressives really need to be prepared for that and to have answers for right-wing populism, to be willing to do the hard organizing to beat back the racism and xenophobia that intensify in periods of uncertainty, change, and economic strife. It's not easy work, but it is important work.  5 Comments Share this article 27 27 27 5 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Hingle Ben Simmons had some pretty harsh things to say about the NCAA during his days at LSU. And days before the new documentary he stars in premieres, it’s not exactly shocking that his roasting of the antiquated and hypocritical organization made headlines. But watch the hour and a half film—One and Done, debuting Friday night on Showtime—and the most shocking aspect of it isn’t how hard the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft had it during his one season at LSU. It just might be how lonely it is at the top. Cameras documented his journey, and his family’s, from a high school prodigy to a basketball savior considered among the most hyped prospects since LeBron James. And half way through we learn that as Simmons chased his dream—to play in the NBA and not necessarily in college—there was a cost. College basketball’s best player was pal-less, exactly the opposite of how you expected Simmons to roll. It’s a Saturday and Simmons is making his way through an LSU tailgating scene. At 6'10" and sticking out like sore thumb, he’s mobbed by undergrads and middle-aged Tigers fans. They all want a piece of him—a picture, a handshake, a conversation. And while he obliges, it’s the kind of vapid human interaction famous individuals know all too well and the kind that makes Simmons reflective in offering up one of the documentary’s most honest and poignant moments. “I know people who want to try and be my friend because I might be in the NBA, might have a nice contract and be on TV and be famous,” says Simmons. “But I’m not friends with anybody.” It almost makes you feel sorry for the guy who is going to make more money before he’s 21 than most people ever will. The freshman that dedicated his life to reaching the NBA roamed the Baton Rouge campus without a crew. He ventured to Walmart to pick up supplies solo. His roommates are basically nowhere to be found. College basketball’s best player was pal-less, exactly the opposite of how you expected Simmons to roll.   “You don’t normally think about that with somebody on the cover of magazines and on SportsCenter’s Top 10,” says Maura Mandt, the documentary’s co-director and an executive producer. “That was a very interesting juxtaposition for Ben to not really be able to trust a lot of people.” It was just one of a number of interesting anecdotes that came out of a project that was two years in the making for Mandt and her team. The Simmons family approached her with the idea and Mandt made sure everyone—parents, siblings, and the star—knew going in that honesty was mandatory. She warned them “you’re not going to be able to see the doc; nobody is getting paid; you’re going to hate me about five times through this whole process. “I gave them the worst case scenario,” says Mandt, “but Ben was committed to wanting to share this journey.” Image via Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports The access the Simmons family granted is pretty startling. We watch intimate FaceTime conversations between Ben and his sister, who serves as sort of unofficial manager/advisor/liaison during his college season. We see him mature from wide-eyed teenager playing video games to a bonafide brand. And once Simmons’s season with the Tigers officially ended, life got a lot more complicated. While management agencies and sneaker companies battled to earn the signature, he’s caught in the middle. At one juncture, his father questions his sister’s guidance and motivations. “I don’t think anyone is going to feel sorry for Ben and I don’t think they should feel sorry for Ben,” says Mandt. “Ben certainly doesn’t feel sorry for Ben. But a lot of times when there’s somebody with that type of fame you lose empathy for them as a human being that goes through struggles and challenges.” Now that he’s officially a member of the Association, hopefully Simmons can start to form actual bonds with someone who isn’t blood—even while he rehabs a broken foot. Because the number of qualified individuals he can easily relate to—ones making bank and doing things mere mortals can only dream of—only gets smaller from here.  Tags: Features, Interviews, Basketball, LSU Tigers, NBA, Philadelphia 76ers, Ben Simmons, Sixers, NBA Draft 2016  Like  Follow  Chat SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Enter Show Comments 0 NowTrending Lateststories Cris Collinsworth 'Gently' Ethers Bill Simmons About Losing His HBO Show BY Jose Martinez 2 hours ago Sage Steele Fires Back at Mike Evans Over His National Anthem Protest BY Jose Martinez 3 hours ago Study Finds Male Athletes Are More Likely to Choke Under Pressure Than Female Athletes BY Gavin Evans 3 hours ago Watch ESPN's Dan Le Batard Shut Down a Troll Who Told Him to Teach His Dad to Speak English BY Chris Yuscavage 4 hours ago The 10 Best Finessed NBA Contracts in the Last 10 Years BY Keane Macadaeg 5 hours ago Is Manny Pacquiao Hinting at a Rematch With Floyd Mayweather in This Instagram Post?

Considering how well that one went, it's not surprising she waited this long. This speech, at least, seemed to be wholly original, although you wouldn't have been surprised if she had begun by saying, "Four score and seven years ago." On the other hand, it was so vapidly platitudinous and basic that if her speechwriters were cribbing from anyone, it was Dr. Seuss. The aspiring first lady spoke in Berwyn, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb, and to say that she seemed out of place is an understatement. This is not exactly a woman who shops at Wal-Mart and enjoys breakfast at IHOP. But the town is in Pennsylvania, a state her husband desperately needs to win. The only other states whose names she managed to drop were Ohio and North Carolina. Any guesses why? Melania took the stage to the strains of "Aquarius," an appropriate choice since the event felt more like a love-in than a political speech. Indeed, she spoke so often of "love" that it made you think she had taken a hit of Ecstasy before going on. She began by saying it had been 500 days since her husband announced his candidacy (hasn't the time just flown by?) after descending on the magical escalator in Trump Tower. Read more: Critic's Notebook: 'Trump Tower Live' Is Not Ready for Primetime "This is not an ordinary campaign. It is a movement!" she declared, and there are plenty of voters who would be happy to inform her exactly what kind of movement it most closely resembles. "He will make a fantastic president!"  She blissfully referred to her "partnership" with her husband, although disappointingly failed to provide the details of their prenup. Talking about her childhood in Slovenia surrounded by "beautiful rivers and forests" - you could imagine woodland animals serenading her with Disney tunes - she said that as a young girl she dreamed of going to America. "America meant that if you could dream it, you could become it," she told the cheering crowd, which is certainly true if your dream is marrying a billionaire and living in a golden palace. Discussing the blood, sweat and tears of being a highly paid fashion model in Paris, Melania described herself as a "young entrepreneur." She proudly referred to becoming an American citizen in 2006, a year after she married Trump. So at least now we know the best path to citizenship. She said about her husband, "He certainly knows how to shake things up," which is appropriate if the definition of "shaking things up" includes destroying the fabric of American society. She finally got around to disclosing her plans should she become first lady, which have something to do with being "an advocate for women and children." She promised to provide them with a "beautiful life" so they can "drink freely of love," which, considering her Eastern European accent, had a distinctly vampirish vibe. Read more: Critic's Notebook: Melania Trump Plays Blame Game as Anderson Cooper Tries to Keep a Straight Face The proceedings became truly surreal when she informed the crowd that social media "can have a bad side" (really, Melania, you think?) and that "our culture has gotten too mean and too rough." It made you wonder if she actually knows who she's married to. She added that she would "work hard to improve everyday life for women." (Just a suggestion, Melania, but the best way to start would be by keeping them far away from your husband.) Delivering the absurdly ironic sound bite that will have comedy writers working overtime the next few days - you can be sure that Laura Benanti will be reprising her impression for Stephen Colbert -  Melania declared, "We must treat each other with respect and kindness, even when we disagree." That is, she forgot to add, unless Donald gets elected.

(Photos by Todd Burke, left, and Jacqueline Lee / Daily News) By Jacqueline Lee | jlee1@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 3, 2016 at 11:31 am | UPDATED: November 3, 2016 at 12:39 pm Related Articles Silicon Valley millionaire Clyde Berg found ‘factually innocent’ sex abuse of wife In the state Assembly District 24 race, where voters are choosing between shades of Democrat, money speaks. There are no major differences on social issues between Palo Alto City Councilman Marc Berman, who won the June primary with 28.2 percent of the vote, and Palo Alto patent attorney Vicki Veenker, who ended up second in the eight-person primary with 22.2 percent. Both support spending more for universal preschool and education, back the countywide Measure B sales tax hike for transportation improvements and advocate legalizing recreational marijuana across the state. Where they differ is reflected by the nature of the special interest groups — from charter school backers to Realtors against rent control to women-in-power advocates — that have lined up behind them. Together, these independent groups have spent more than $3.4 million as of Wednesday for television and online ads, mailers and polling. About 90 percent of the outside funding has benefited Berman. EdVoice, a super political action committee (PAC) that pushes for education reform policies often opposed by teachers unions, spent more than $1.8 million on Berman this year, campaign reports show. EdVoice gets its money from philanthropists and entrepreneurs such as Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and Apple, and Carrie Walton Penner, granddaughter of the founder of Walmart and a staunch advocate for charter schools. Bill Lucia, president of EdVoice, previously told The Daily News it views Berman as the best candidate for public education because of his track record as a former development director of the Silicon Valley Education Foundation. Berman said in an interview Tuesday that charter schools are a good option in many parts of the state, including East Palo Alto, where students do not have a traditional high school. “Charter schools have less regulation and do not necessarily have to follow the same rules and regulation as tradition schools, so they have the flexibility to try new things,” Berman said. “Sometimes those things work … and in those instances, they should be shared with other schools in the area.” Veenker, on the other hand, has the endorsement of a traditional Democratic union stronghold: The California Teachers Association/Association for Better Citizenship contributed $16,700 to her campaign. She said charter schools are an important part of the public school system, but appropriate oversight is needed where tax dollars are spent, especially when the money is diverted from traditional schools. “To look at (charter schools) as the solution for solving our educational problems misses the point,” Veenker said. “We need to look at improving all schools for students.” The candidates disagree on how to weed out bad teachers and retain good ones. Berman says one fix is to increase the amount of time it takes for teachers to get tenure from two years to four. The state’s teachers unions have long resisted change to tenure laws, most recently winning a state Supreme Court appeal this summer to uphold job protection for teachers. Berman said giving tenure after two years is bad for good teachers because schools are sometimes hesitant to permanently hire someone after only 18 months of teaching. School districts spend hundreds of thousands of dollars firing bad teachers, Berman said, and many of those cases are settled, resulting in the teacher moving to another district. Veenker said if she’s forced to vote on changing the tenure law, she’d support the change to four years. But her preference is to address the process for teacher layoffs, which she said is based on seniority, takes too long and costs too much. Veenker said she wants teachers to keep getting tenure sooner than later for job security. It’s also one way to attract good teachers in an area hurt by the high cost of housing, she added. The neck-to-neck race has top Democrats choosing sides: Berman has endorsements from Rich Gordon, who terms out of the seat they’re running for, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Menlo Park Councilman Peter Ohtaki, a Republican and the third-highest vote-getter in the June primary, also has endorsed him. Veenker is backed by Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian and Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt. The rest of the money After EdVoice, the California Real Estate Independent Expenditure Committee-California Association of Realtors spent the most on Berman, $358,856. Berman, who does not support rent control, also has the endorsement of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. “I’ve been a leading advocate for additional housing in my time on the Palo Alto City Council,” Berman said. “Increasing supply is what we need to focus on. I’m perfectly fine with it existing where it currently exists, but rent control is not the answer.” Veenker said rent control is a tool that should be left on the table. “Many rely on it to stay in their homes,” Veenker said in a statement. “We are in a housing crisis. I support solutions including a state housing bond and tax incentives for affordable housing.” As of Wednesday, the following outside groups, among others, also spent money on ads for Berman: • Californians Allied for Patient Protection Independent Expenditure Account, $287,156; • Building and Protecting a Strong California, a Coalition of Firefighters, Building Trades, Realtors and Correctional Officers Organizations, $126,036; • and the California Dental Association Independent Expenditure PAC, $109,576. Veenker has support from the following committees: • Silicon Valley Progressive Women for Equity and Oportunidad Supporting Vicki Veenker for Assembly 2016, $268,226; • California Chiropractic Association PAC, $65,000; • and the Women in Power PAC, $10,000. The last filing deadline before the election showed that as of Oct. 22, Berman directly raised about $690,008 this year in monetary contributions and Veenker about $559,208. With a personal life experience as a working mother, a 30-year career as a patent attorney with chemical and technical experts and her advocacy work through the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, Veenker said she would bring her perspective as a woman to the state Capitol. “We don’t have women setting the agenda in many cases,” said Veenker, who plans to focus on improving laws around campus sexual assault, equal pay and better maternity and paternity leave. Veenker’s biggest independent expenditure proponents are women’s groups striving to place more progressive women in Assembly. Women currently hold 19 of 80 seats. Berman says he cares just as much as Veenker does about issues affecting women. One thing he wants to do in his first year in office is to craft a bill of rights so sexual assault survivors know what help they’re guaranteed. Environmental fight Veenker’s campaign has sought to portray her as more passionate about the environment than Berman. It has released a polarizing television ad with images tying Berman to the single-use plastic bag industry and this week questioned the spending from Dart Container Corp., a single-use Styrofoam company, on Berman’s behalf. Berman’s campaign said Wednesday he has not sought Dart’s support and would not have accepted direct contributions from it. The help came in the form of an independent expenditure, like that of EdVoice and others, which are made without candidates’ involvement. “We do not appreciate or condone their involvement in our race, and their actions are completely independent from our campaign,” Berman’s campaign said in a statement. Berman’s campaign also noted he voted last November to expand Palo Alto’s ordinance to prohibit sale of plastic foam products, including those made by Dart, in local stores. Veenker, who has the endorsement of the Sierra Club and California League of Conservation Voters after the groups interviewed both candidates, said she questions whether Berman can fully represent the district on environmental issues since he has a financial interest in his father’s company, which makes reusable plastic bags. As a councilman, Berman had to recuse himself from a vote on single-use plastic bags, so there could be other bills he has to sidestep, Veenker said. Berman said he, like Veenker, supports Proposition 67 to uphold a ban on some plastic bags. “This will be decided before I ever take the oath of office,” Berman said. “There will be no opportunity for a conflict to come up in the future.” Berman said he’s disappointed Veenker chose to run an ad that shows “plastic bags blowing in the wind” to intentionally mislead voters into thinking his family makes those bags. Veenker has said she will pursue a state statute to reduce petroleum use and work on water conservation. She wants to offer tax credits for research on water use technology, like smart grids for water; give subsidies to farmers who adopt such technology; and discourage water use by altering rates. Berman said his environmental priorities are reducing dependence on oil, improving vehicles’ fuel efficiency and protecting natural resources. District 24 encompasses Atherton, East Palo Alto, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Portola Valley, Sunnyvale, Woodside and parts of Cupertino and San Mateo County.

San Diego County Board of Education (Anderson, Gonzalez, Robinson, Munoz, Shea) It’s For The Children… Yeah, right.  In 2012 and 2014, the American Federation of Teachers labor union local 1091, led by union boss Jim Mahler, financed the take-down of community based San Diego County Board of Education board members, and installed his own labor union members. In 2014, an independent board member, Doug Perkins, beat the union candidate, Rick Shea, but Perkins fell ill and resigned. The union-dominated board jumped on the opportunity and appointed Shea, giving the labor union 100 percent control of the board. However, in the 2016 June primary, pro-reform candidates supported by the Charter Schools Association, won two seats.  The third and deciding vote on the five-member board will be determined in a run-off between pro-reform candidate, former State Senator Mark Wyland, and labor union supported and appointed, Rick Shea. Reformers won two of the seats in the primary with support from the Charter Schools Association in fighting back against the AFT labor union onslaught. The Charter School Association helped community candidates representing parental choice for poor and minority kids, and who wanted a fair hearing before the board after the union board continually turned down charter school proposals, often with parents in the audience who spoke movingly about how school choice would help their children. Mark Wyland Now the AFT labor union is writing attack articles supporting Shea, aimed at discrediting Wyland. The AFT claims that Wyland’s campaign is being funded by Walmart, Michael Bloomberg, Reed Hastings of Netflix, Doris Fisher of the Gap clothing stores, “and a number of other billionaires who want to participate in stopping Rick Shea from being re-elected to the San Diego County Board of Education.” (Wasn’t Shea appointed?) The Walton Foundation has a long history of school choice support, as does Bloomberg, Fisher and Hastings. “It drives the union elite crazy that philanthropists are pouring unprecedented amounts of money into edu-politics in an attempt to balance the playing field,” wrote Larry Sand, a retired teacher, and president of the California Teachers Empowerment Network. While in the State Senate, Wyland authored numerous pieces of legislation in several areas of education reform, including: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), vocational education, civic education, improved reading skills and comprehension, and accountability. Wyland also authored significant legislation to ensure citizen oversight for school bond expenditures. Voters need to ask ‘what is going on with the San Diego County Board of Education?’ “Charter schools are autonomously operated public schools, run pursuant to the terms of a limited-duration charter, or contract, granted by a designated sponsoring organization, typically a local school district or the state board of education,” explains the Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository. “Hence, chartering bodies are the ‘gate-keepers’ for charter schools–deciding who initially gets charters and whether or not they can keep them. This Article examines the administrative aspects of that gate-keeping process and recommends new arrangements that will allow the public values underlying the gate-keeping function to be better served.” County Boards of Education are quite powerful and serve a very important role. Perhaps this is why the American Federation of Teachers labor union is working overtime and double-time to control who is elected to the San Diego County Board of Education. County Boards of Education are of special concern to teachers’ unions because these boards can approve charter schools previously turned down for charter by their school districts. Teachers unions currently have mounted a campaign to destroy charter schools, despite a recent national survey, which found 78 percent of parents support charter schools opening in their neighborhood, and the support was greatest among low-income parents. Many charter schools are public schools, and usually receive less funding than ‘regular’ public schools. But they often represent the only alternative for low-income, minority parents in low-performing districts. County Boards of Education also approve Local Control and Accountability Plans, or LCAPs applications for state funding that are supposed to be used to help poor kids and English language learners, as well as foster children. The big urban districts, where the teachers’ unions are the strongest, soak up most of this money, while typical middle class suburban districts end up with less.  This can be justified, at least in theory, if the extra money effectively helps bring up the intended groups so they are prepared for jobs or college and contribute to the economy. But, there is no accountability built into the system, so it’s up to the county boards of education to hold districts accountable when they approve the LCAPs. Interestingly, not a single LCAP in San Diego has been rejected. American Federation of Teachers Guild, local 1931 labor union In San Diego, the American Federation of Teachers Guild, local 1931 labor union, representing community college teachers, is run by Jim Mahler, a real live “union boss.” Mahler has replaced 44 school board members with his union members.  His website even brags about these: “Directed Political Campaigns which replaced Incumbent Community College Board, School Board, and Board of Education Members with Pro-Education, Pro-Worker Candidates.  44 successful wins: 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016.” Additionally, union boss Mahler has had his AFT Local 1931 labor union spend money in city council races and others where there is no connection to his community college labor union. How the times, and education politics, have changed. In 1988 then-president of the American Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, spoke in support of a mechanism to give teachers the ability to submit a proposal to create a new publicly funded school that was free of regulatory constraints in order to try innovative approaches to teaching and test their impacts – Charter Schools. In 1990 the Brookings Institution published John Chubb and Terry Moe’s Politics, Markets, and America’s Schools, recommending rebuilding the American education system based on principles of market competition and deregulation, and suggested that, through parental choice and school autonomy, student achievement would improve. Is There Corruption within the San Diego County Board of Education? In a striking series of events, in early summer, Rick Shea, as vice-president of the board, signed a letter suspending Superintendent Randy Ward, ostensibly because of a lawsuit brought by notorious San Diego attorney Cory Briggs. An appellate court handed down an opinion in September calling Briggs’ conduct in another case “unethical and possibly criminal.” It is virtually unheard of to suspend a superintendent as the result of a lawsuit; but Shea and the union board commenced an investigation of Ward, who has since resigned. Following Ward’s suspension, the board then publicly interviewed three candidates for “interim” superintendent: John Roach, Larry Perondi, and Edward Velasquez.  Roach was superintendent for Carlsbad, Perondi superintendent for Oceanside school districts. Both are well known, experienced in San Diego and with the county office of education, and both have sterling reputations. The Board chose Velasquez, a former L.A. superintendent, who had also been a superintendent in San Ysidro, a poor, mostly Hispanic district at the Mexican border with a history of financial issues according to news reports. During this period, the board also sought the legal advice of William Trejo, a Los Angeles lawyer who had worked at San Ysidro with Velasquez. At their August 10 meeting, the board heard comments from the public and board members regarding the hiring of Velasquez and attorney Trejo.  It was disclosed at that meeting by Attorney Barry Green, the attorney for Superintendent Ward, that Velasquez had been sued for sexual harassment and retaliation, and had not been exonerated. Green said the lawsuit was settled for $460,000 of taxpayer funds. Further, Board member Mark Anderson said that attorney Trejo’s law firm had an extensive public record of unethical and questionable behavior, and he had not disclosed this to the board, as is required by the rules of professional conduct. Attorney Green stated in his public comments that Trejo had numerous conflicts, and was not a specialist in education law. Green told the board it had several well-known and reputable education law firms it could have hired instead. The board did not do even minimal due diligence, since the information regarding the sexual harassment lawsuit against Velasquez, which was easily accessible, as well as the public comment before the San Ysidro school board from a teacher opposed to hiring Velasquez. Messy Solar Deal  Also at the August 10 board meeting, attorney Trent Miller made public comments regarding a messy solar deal negotiated by Velasquez and Trejo: “…the San Diego Free Press, on April 29, 2016 , they reported that Velasquez and Trejo brokered a deal with the eco business solar company which is also known as Manzana energy and Manna Energy. According to that report they settled a $12 million dollar judgment with the solar company by entering into another contract with the same company for $23.7 million in 2015. The same paper states that the job could have been done for $7 to $10 million. The same paper states that the solar company was paid in full up front and that there’s no deadline for completing the project. It also states that there were no solar panels installed in any of the 7 schools in San Ysidro. So as a concerned citizen I ask myself would I hire a contractor to do work 2 to 3 times the value of what it should have been done for? With no deadline for them to complete the project and nothing’s been done? “I practice law, I’ve got a law degree, and I passed the bar but I don’t think anybody here needs any of those things to see that something’s wrong there something’s corrupt there, something’s not right.” “Mr. Shea, you’ve been the board member for north county and you alone signed the letter putting Mr. Ward on leave and you must have been aware of the deal between Velasquez and Trejo and the solar company we’ve heard a lot about tonight. I can’t believe that you want to bring this type of politics into our district. This is not San Ysidro. I think it’s insane and if you want us to vote for you in November……..I can’t do it.” Shea voted twice, at the August 10 meeting and again at the September 14 meeting to hire both Velasquez and Trejo, and never responded in any way to the charges or concerns about the two.  Board member Anderson voted “no” in each case, and included persuasive comments to explain his vote.

Jennifer Garner and Matthew McConaughey graced the stage to present in different categories. Beyond everyone’s expectations, Beyoncé came out to perform on stage and breathed a new life in the crowd. Many people have speculated what Beyoncé was there for because country music is definitely not her forte. There was one celebrity appearance that was not surprising thought.  Taylor Swift returned to her roots after three years of putting out hit pop albums.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Smoking Shortens Life Of People With HIV More Than HIV Itself Posted: Nov 3 2016, 9:19am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 9:22am CDT, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images For smokers with HIV, smoking may now be more harmful than HIV itself   It has been consistently shown that smoking while being HIV positive is even more hazardous than having the AIDS virus. Those people who have HIV and are also regular smokers ought to know that their smoking habit is harming them even more than the AIDS virus they are infected with. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Their lifespans may undergo an abridgement thanks to their oral fixation regarding the “cancer stick”. The study regarding this appeared in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. Smoking is more common in AIDS patients in the US population than the rest of the demographic sample. The difference is one of almost twice as many people being smokers who also have HIV. Kicking the “coffin nail” habit is the biggest game-changer that AIDS sufferers can accomplish for the sake of their health.  At least, the lifespan is extended by several years if AIDS patients quit smoking. Nowadays we already have drugs that help curb the AIDS virus. Thus other measures to fight AIDS such as a nutritious and clean diet, salubrious exercise and lots of rest and relaxation are just the tip of the iceberg. With all these interventions, AIDS may soon be manageable like diabetes. Smoking in particular is very bad for those who are HIV positive. Heart disease, cancer, lung disorders and infections are common in those who smoke while having AIDS. During the course of the study, computer models were used to determine the life spans of patients with AIDS who also smoked. The really surprising fact was that smoking reduced the life span of AIDS sufferers more than AIDS itself. This was an eye-opener and quite a shock. When patients do not follow the prescribed regimen and palliative measures for AIDS, they end up dying sooner than usual.    While everyone knows that smoking is injurious to health, just how bad it is can only be seen by this example of HIV sufferers who also smoke. The patients have the option of quitting the habit anytime. Even those who are well into their old age may benefit immensely by quitting smoking. It is never too late to throw away that last cigarette into an ash tray and never touch another cigarette for the rest of your life. Therefore, one of the major palliative measures that ought to be implemented by physicians who treat AIDS patients is convincing these patients that they should quit smoking as soon as possible.

Not only have you likely seen them behind their cameras at many a community gathering, but if you’re a photographer—pro or amateur—you may also be familiar with their business, San Juan Photo & Digital. It’s essentially a one-stop shop for photographers—they offer printing, camera repair, scanning, photo restoration, even classes for those looking to take their skills to the next level. But it wasn’t until recently that the couple realized they offered perhaps one of the most in-demand services in South Orange County—film processing. “We get phone calls all day from people from all over South Orange County saying, ‘Thank goodness, finally! This is the 12th place I’ve called!’” Scott said. He attributes the recent influx of interest in film, in part, to the fact that a lot of big box stores like Costco, Target, Walmart, CVS and Rite Aid have stopped processing film within the last year or so. He and Diane have seen a wide range of new clients come in—from first-time film users in their teens and 20s, to people bringing in their parents’ rolls of film, or older photographers who never migrated to digital shooting. “It’s bringing the joy of photography back,” Scott said. “They’re coming in, and it’s like Christmas morning. They can’t wait to see their prints—they have something real to hold on to. “Everyone remembers the joy of picking up your vacation photos,” Scott added, “that’s part of the fun of photography.” Scott said “years ago in the salad days,” he and Diana could count on 150 rolls of film coming in every Monday. But after film fell out of fashion, there were times when they considered getting out of the processing business. “But we hung in there,” Diana said with a smile. “That’s a good message in life—just stick with it. We’re glad we’re still doing it. We’re the last man standing.” Scott said their patrons enjoy the personable interactions, which most big box stores didn’t offer, and knowledgeable staff. He added that it’s also important to provide services such as transferring film to digital. Diana said the renewed interest in film has “breathed life” into the processing part of their business. And she’s happy, because film is “much better” than digital anyway. “Film has silver in it, that’s why it lasts,” she said while listing the benefits of film photography. “You can do a lot to film and it hangs in there.” San Juan Photo & Digital employee Cheryl Wayland, who has been printing with the Schmitt’s for 28 years now, summed it up nicely. “Film is alive and well in the heart of San Juan,” she said. San Juan Photo & Digital is located at 32281 Camino Capistrano, Suite C-104, in the Plaza Del Rio Shopping Center.

The Marketplace has more than 65,000 square feet and 17 tenants, including Spectrum Health, TrueValue and Snap Fitness. With 100,750 square feet, CW said Greenville West is the largest shopping center in Greenville. The tenants at Greenville West include JCPenney, Sears, Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Penney stick with holiday openings Kohl's Shoppers walk toward the Kohl's at the Towne Center in Fayetteville on Thanksgiving in 2014. (Ryan MacCammon) Print Email Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com By Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 03, 2016 at 1:18 PM, updated November 03, 2016 at 3:09 PM comments Two more big-name retail chains have unveiled plans to open on Thanksgiving once again in 2016. J.C. Penney will open at 3 p.m. on the holiday, according to CNBC. Kohl's will follow at 6 p.m. Those are the same hours as last year for both companies. Kohl's and J.C. Penney both have several locations around Central New York. They're the latest retailers to confirm Thanksgiving hours, but you can bet they won't be the last. Traditional Black Friday shopping destinations like Target and Best Buy have yet to announce their plans, but it's likely they'll include holiday hours. And many Wal-Mart stores are open 24 hours on Thanksgiving, with Black Friday deals in recent years launching in the evening. The announcements from Kohl's and J.C. Penney should firmly put to rest any notions of a massive wave against Thanksgiving shopping. Sure, a handful stores have switched to Black Friday-only hours and many have never opened on the holiday at all. But Amazon has already started its Black Friday deals and experts say big brick-and-mortar retailers often feel pressure to keep pace with the internet giant. All the online hype and Thanksgiving hours have certainly dampened Black Friday's insanity in recent years. Sales are now more spread out across the entire Thanksgiving weekend and really throughout the whole holiday shopping season. But plenty of people do still show up to shop in person on Thanksgiving and Black Friday too, even if it's not quite the retail juggernaut it was in years past. We'll have more on which stores will open when on Thanksgiving and Black Friday as chains make their announcements. And watch for a complete guide to holiday hours soon.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson by Lisa Baertlein, Reuters Close icon Lisa Baertlein Reuters By Lisa Baertlein Slideshow Whole Foods founder Mackey retakes helm in turnaround Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc is staking its future on blunt, vegan co-founder John Mackey, betting the man who built the high-end health food grocery chain has the best shot of leading its turnaround. Whole Foods on Wednesday said Mackey would resume his job as solo chief executive officer six years after he split the role with co-CEO Walter Robb, known as the businessman who carried out Mackey's vision. The Austin, Texas-based grocer has reported five quarters of falling sales at established stores, and while the decline may be easing, Whole Foods faces intense competition from retailers ranging from Kroger to Walmart and Amazon. "I like our positioning, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it ... We've got to up our game and that's what we are intending to do," Mackey said on a call reporting quarterly earnings. He declined to elaborate on turnaround plans. Mackey follows in the footsteps of other co-founders who re-established control of their companies, said retail expert Bill Bishop. Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz and Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs each returned as CEOs when their companies faltered. Whether Mackey, whose steadfast presence at the chain was briefly broken by a five-month break to hike the Appalachian Trail in 2002, can pull off that turnaround is not clear. "In this fast-changing, very competitive market, the question is whether the founder will have the skills to right the ship," said Bishop. Mackey is an outspoken Libertarian with a proven knack for capitalizing on nascent food trends. He adheres to a strict diet, but has come under fire from food purists for selling meat and "natural" versions of junk food such as chips and sugary drinks. He also has courted controversy. For years before the company's purchase of Wild Oats, Mackey used the alias "Rahodeb," an anagram of his wife's name, to post comments on Web forums praising Whole Foods and criticizing Wild Oats. Giving a single person command will make big changes easier, said Roger Davidson, retail consultant at Oakton Advisory Group. "You need the vision and direction coming from one leader," said Davidson, who was an executive at Wild Oats when it was purchased by Whole Foods in 2007. "They need to make some hard decisions and go with them," he added, arguing the company should slash its long-term plans for 1,200 stores in half; speed up investment in its new, value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain; and remodel stores. (The story was refiled to correct the alias in the tenth paragraph to Rahodeb, not harobed) (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Bill Trott) Published: November 3, 2016 — 8:47 AM EDT | Updated: November 3, 2016 — 12:16 PM EDT We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets Amazon, Idea, Apple ahead of rivals in customer experience, says survey Our Bureau   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Mumbai, November 3:   Amazon, Idea Cellular and Bigbasket are some the brands that have beaten their rivals when it comes to dealing with customers, according to Forrester’s India Customer Experience Index, 2016. Based on a survey of more than 18,000 metro Indian online adult consumers that measures and ranks the CX quality at 72 brands in India, Forrester’s CX Index 2016 reveals that Apple provides the best customer experience in the PC and mobile manufacturer categories, and Idea Cellular in the wireless service provider industry. This year’s findings show that most brands in India increased their CX Index scores this year but it is the foreign brands leading the CX rankings. Of the eight industries surveyed, five had leaders that were foreign MNCs — Best Price (Walmart) in traditional retail, Amazon in digital retail, American Express in credit cards, and Apple in PC and mobile manufacturing. On the home front, Tata AIG and Bharti AXA lead amongst the auto and home insurance providers, Kotak Mahindra in banks, and Idea Cellular among wireless service providers. Overall, the PC manufacturer industry improved three spots from 2015 to share the leadership of the industry rankings for 2016 with credit card providers and banks. In the telecom services space, Idea Cellular was the provider with the highest score. The wireless service industry’s eight-point improvement in its average score was one of the biggest changes for any industry. “Improvement in the industry is the result of steep competition. For instance, incumbent brands felt sufficiently threatened by new player Reliance Jio to offer better products, services, and rates. India’s telecom regulatory body also focused on service quality issues late last year, pushing service providers to improve their operations. Despite this, the industry only moved from poor to OK, leaving a lot of room for improvement,” Forrestor Research said in a note.

Expat in mexico. Is MagicJack Still Useful? I think, before I even joined this forum, that I looked it up for a recommendation on using MagicJack several years ago! Based on what I read, I dutifully went out & bought one at WalMart and it actually saved our bacon when nothing else worked to communicate back & forth with the US. One of the things I remember from living in Mexico back in the late 70s was how EXPENSIVE phone calls could be. I was reminded in the 80s when I consistently ran up phone bills of $600 a month while courting my wife!! Now with the advent of so many other devices & means of communication... let's list some: email, Facebook, Skype, Whatsapp, Snap Chat, Face Chat, cell phones, texting, (and probably many more I'm not even aware of)... What do you find most useful, economical & dependable for communicating with friends & loved ones from there in Mexico? I still have my MagicJack - in fact I upgraded to a MagicJack Plus... but I haven't had occasion to even pull it out to use it the last couple of times we've been there.   #2 (permalink)   3rd November 2016, 07:49 PM pappabeemx New Member   Join Date: Jun 2016 Location: San Antonio Tlay Posts: 14 Rep Power: 0 8 likes received 32 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. I had MJ for years but when I got down here I found that service and help was next to useless. The prices went up and the service when down. I currently have 4 MJ two of which I purchased and two that were replacements that didn't work. I'm using Ooma now. $4 per month and great service. The connection is good and it resets itself after all our power blackouts and "off/n/on's"   #3 (permalink)   4th November 2016, 12:55 AM Howler Member   Join Date: Apr 2013 Location: Broken Arrow, OK Posts: 511 Rep Power: 95 233 likes received 650 likes given Originally from usa.

The connection is good and it resets itself after all our power blackouts and "off/n/on's" Thanks, PBMx!! One thing I liked about MJ was that I had a(nother) phone number that anyone can call from here in the US as a local or "short-distance" (not international) call that would be received by email & recorded on my computer, accessible through iTunes. Pretty convenient, especially when I'm not available to take the call right away. Does Ooma have a similar operation & function? I had an IT friend of mine who recommended it for home use, here in the US, several years ago when Ooma was still quite new - it hadn't even appeared in commercials on TV yet. He recommended it because it used the internet (VOIP?) to communicate & route calls, therefore costing less than traditional phone service. Final question(s) about Ooma: How easy is it to set up and how portable is it for moving from place to place? Again, thanks for your response!!   #4 (permalink)   4th November 2016, 07:58 PM pappabeemx New Member   Join Date: Jun 2016 Location: San Antonio Tlay Posts: 14 Rep Power: 0 8 likes received 32 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. OOMA doesn't have all the bells and junk the MJ has but that just makes it easier to use. It will not send text messages to your cell for messages missed nor will it notify you if you had a missed call at the time of the call. It will allow your caller to leave a message. It is very easy to install, none of that web page junk that MJ wants you to do. I don't know how easy it is to move from one location to another, I've never needed to do that. All I can tell you is that I'm very happy with it and wouldn't go back to MJ if they paid me.   #5 (permalink)   5th November 2016, 02:07 AM Howler Member   Join Date: Apr 2013 Location: Broken Arrow, OK Posts: 511 Rep Power: 95 233 likes received 650 likes given Originally from usa.

I've gotten some good feedback about Ooma, but I'm still wondering what else is popular with the rest of you on the forum. Otherwise, am I to assume that rates have become so inexpensive (and service so good) that landline & cellular phones are just fine...?   #7 (permalink)   5th November 2016, 02:55 AM pappabeemx New Member   Join Date: Jun 2016 Location: San Antonio Tlay Posts: 14 Rep Power: 0 8 likes received 32 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. OOMA does need a phone line and you can call in and dial out on it. My line has a 512 AC and that's Texas. My wife talks to her sister and daughter almost every night for a few hours and I've never had any additional costs.

Expat in mexico. In terms of you calling to the States, many very affordable cell phone plans in Mexico now include unlimited calling throughout Mexico, the US and Canada (even includes roaming, so when you are in the US or Canada you can still use it for free). My husband's plan is $199/month (pesos), and includes 2GB data. The only disadvantage is that it is long distance for those in the US to call you. How we deal with this is WhatsApp. When my husband is in Mexico and I'm in Canada, if I need to reach him I send him a WhatsApp message, then he calls me back for free.

Expat in mexico. Regarding MagicJack, I have an old one I still sometimes carry around when I travel internationally, but I honestly can't remember the last time I used it. WhatsApp also allows for phone calls between two phones which have the app (free within the limits of your data plan or if you are using WiFi). MagicJack also has a free app for smart phones, which I used and it was OK. I'm pretty sure you can link it to your current MagicJack phone number, then as long as you have WiFi or data, people can dial your MagicJack US number and reach your smartphone in Mexico.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 3, 2016 at 11:11AM Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill. There are a lot of things that need to change at Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), but nothing more so than the ludicrous amount of money the burrito chain pays its executives. Even after their compensations were cut in half last year, its co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran earned nearly $14 million each. That's unconscionable when you compare it to their counterparts at companies like McDonald's, Panera Bread, and Noodles & Co., to mention only a few. And the situation is magnitudes worse when you also factor in compensation for 2014. Executive 2015 Compensation 2014 Compensation Steve Ells, Chipotle co-CEO $13.8 million $28.9 million Monty Moran, Chipotle co-CEO $13.6 million $28.2 million Stephen Easterbrook, McDonald's CEO $7.9 million $7.3 million* Ronald Shaich, CEO Panera Bread $4.9 million $3.4 million Kevin Reddy, CEO Noodles & Co. $861,287 $934,242 *The CEO of McDonald's in 2014 was Donald Thompson. Data source: Company proxy filings. Ells' and Moran's compensation packages are particularly egregious in the wake of its food safety crisis, which began last year with an E. coli outbreak at a number of its restaurants in the Pacific Northwest. To a certain extent, it's to be expected that a company like Chipotle would have something like this happen at some point in its corporate existence. After all, it's happened at virtually every other major food company in the United States, be it fast food chains such as McDonalds, Taco Bell, or Jack in the Box or grocery stores such as Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, or Costco. But what's important to appreciate is that Chipotle left itself especially vulnerable to food borne illness outbreaks. As Austin Carr points out in an incredibly detailed review of Chiptole's crisis for Fast Company magazine, while the chain served the equivalent of the population of Philadelphia on a daily basis prior to outbreaks, it had only four people assigned to its quality assurance team, tasked with tracking the quality of ingredients sourced from suppliers. It's easy to draw a straight line between this and the fact that Chipotle had not one, but multiple foodborne illness outbreaks over the last year of E. coli, norovirus, and salmonella. Additionally, because it didn't have a system in place that adequately tracked its food supply when the outbreaks unfolded, it had no idea where they came from. To this day, it still doesn't know. That's the responsibility of the CEO -- or, in this case, the co-CEOs. And it should be reflected in their compensations. Indeed, to put this in perspective, Chipotle as a whole earned only $7.8 million in the third quarter of this year. At that rate, the entire company is making about as much as its co-CEOs. The good news is that Chipotle's board will presumably be under an enormous amount of pressure from analysts, investors, and commentators to more appropriately tailor its executives' compensation packages. That should leave more money for shareholders. At the same time, however, while I'm bullish on Chipotle's stock, exorbitant pay like this could certainly lead one to wonder whether the company is being run for the sake of its top executives or, as it should be, its shareholders.

Head Of Target’s Grocery Business Steps Down Amid Lackluster Results Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Head Of Target’s Grocery Business Steps Down Amid Lackluster Results Image courtesy of Mike Mozart November 3, 2016 11:30 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave off target target supermarkets groceries The Target executive tasked with turning around the retailer’s so-so grocery sales is stepping down after less than two years on the job. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports that Anne Dament, Target’s senior vice president of grocery merchandising, is making her exit only 18 months after being a marquee hire by then-new CEO Brian Cornell. When Cornell took over the reins as top exec in 2014, one of his goals was to reinvent Target’s grocery business, which makes sense when you look at his background at Safeway, PepsiCo, and Sam’s Club. Dament had been a colleague of Cornell’s at Safeway. While the retailer has long dabbled in fresh food, first with full-on grocery sections in Super Target stores and then with smaller-format supermarkets in its regular outlets, the company had never made a full-on commitment to becoming a competitor to traditional grocery chains. At the same time, Walmart emerged as a major player in the supermarket business. There is also additional competition from newer specialty chains and existing brands that have improved their offerings to keep up with changing tastes. “We’re not really special and we’re not a full grocery,” Target’s chief operating officer admitted in 2015. “And so we’re sitting in the middle of no man’s land.” Why doesn’t Target just give up on groceries? After all, fresh food can be a hassle — spoilage, increased shipping and storage costs, thinner profit margins — but it can also mean increased foot traffic, which is incredibly important for a retailer trying to compete with Amazon and other online shopping options. Need milk? Target has that — oh, and they also have that bathmat you’d been meaning to buy. It goes the other way as well: You’re buying that bathmat, so you might as well pick up some groceries and save a trip to another store, right? A recent Nielsen study showed that, regardless of the primary reason for going to a supermarket, fresh food ended up in the shopper’s basket 27% of the time. But analysts say Target has yet to convince enough shoppers that they should be picking up groceries for the week. “They’re just in a really tough spot,” Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones, tells the Star-Tribune. “They don’t have enough groceries to drive people to the store regularly. Groceries for Target never turned out to be a destination like they thought it would be.” November 3, 2016 By Chris Morran@themorrancave off target target supermarkets groceries Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related no more supertargets Target Isn’t Going To Have Full-Service Grocery Stores, Still Wants To Sell More it's pronounced groce-ray Two Reasons Target Is Having Trouble Selling Groceries meet the new guy New Target CEO Promises To Not Turn Retailer Into A Grocery Store sale fail Meat’s On Sale At Target: Raise Prices By 30 Cents nothing to buy Target CEO: “Unacceptable” That Its Stores Have Empty Shelves Previous After $4.8M In Property Damage, Millions Of Dehumidifiers Recalled Next WI Scientists Study Important Question Of How To Keep Cheese Curds Squeaky Longer Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

November 3, 2016 WSP The e-commerce pioneer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) envisions a future that goes beyond online retail as it continually searches for ways to reach out to customers. Other than its widely used online store, the company is increasing its physical presence with 22 pop-up shops across 12 states, and will expand to 100 pop-ups next year. The outcome of their physical stores that opened early this year must have exceeded expectations since Amazon is planning to open up 20 more brick-and-mortar grocery stores in a span of two years. In fact, Business Insider, citing documents from Amazon, reports that the company will ultimately roll out 2,000 grocery stores that carry Amazon Fresh products over the next decade. When that happens, the company would become the fourth-largest grocery chain after Walmart and Kroger. The report also mentions that Amazon is opening 20 pilot grocery stores in places like the Bay Area, Las Vegas, Miami, New York, and Seattle in the next two years. The company is anticipating the varied needs of consumers by diversifying the store concepts. Half of the stores will be “click-and-collect” drive-in shop where Amazon consumers can pick-up their online purchases. The other half will be traditional grocery stores complete with shelves, carts, and fresh grocery items that consumers can see, touch, smell, and inspect for themselves. The “click-and-collect” store would be 10,000 square feet while the physical stores around 30,000 square feet. Furthermore, Amazon’s new stores will be exclusive for Prime Fresh members only. The subscription costs $14.99 per month for Fresh delivery service while $99 per month for Prime membership is available only in select cities. While the grocery market accounts for $800 billion worth of spending in the United States, the industry Amazon wants to experiment with is precarious and volatile. Considering that grocery items have limited profit margin, if Amazon goes exclusive, the company can use the subscription fees to cover the high operational expenses of running a grocery chain. Amazon started experimenting the idea of having a grocery chain in 2007 when it launched Amazon Fresh in Seattle. The subscription offered delivery services for a limited assortment of groceries. The convenience of “Amazon Fresh” gained traction among consumers who dislike the inconvenience of visiting grocery stores. Little by little, the service expanded to other U.S. markets like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and many more. And in June, Amazon brought its Prime services in London, which is the first time it’s ever been offered outside the United States. With over 4,500 stores in the US, Amazon is competing with giant retail stores like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in the massive $800 billion grocery market. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart accounts for almost 20% of grocery store spending in the United States. However, Amazon wants to further dip its toe in the grocery arena by offering a more consumer-accommodating alternative to grocery shopping. After years of offering trouble-free online retail services to consumers, Amazon might now be ready to accept the geographical limitations of running a grocery chain. Amazon Stock Action Amazon shares found a little support around the $800 level following the company’s big earnings miss after the market closed on Oct. 27. Should they drop below the $775 zone, the next strong support looks like $750 and then $742. Shares of Amazon, which have gained nearly 15% year to date and 23.8% year-over-year, have posted a weekly loss of 5.4%. The stock’s $774.39 price-per-share puts Amazon’s current value at about $357 billion.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon WELCH, W. Va. — There are few better places to understand how Donald Trump could become U.S. president than McDowell County, whose county seat, Welch, straddles the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River. This corner of Appalachia’s severely depressed coal country has become a sensation because Trump is more popular here than in any other place in the U.S. The abrasive real estate developer won 91.5 per cent of the vote in the Republican primary on a promise of better days. Or, as he likes to phrase it, “making America great again.” He did this by pledging to revive coal mining, which has fallen on increasingly hard times because of concerns over the carbon emissions it produces and competition from cheaper fracked gas from the Dakotas and elsewhere David Thompson is one of the few miners in the county who still has work. Wiping grime off his face after an eight-hour shift “more than a mile underground” during which he had shoveled “33 blocks of 100 feet of coal,” he said he and nobody he knew trusted politicians any more. Trump was different because he did not regard him as a politician. “Seems like he’s got a level head on him,” Thompson said. “He knows how to make money, to put businesses in. He’s advanced himself.” To understand just how bleak life is here, Walmart closed its store in January after 12 years trying to make a go of it. Small wonder. The county’s population has shrunk from 100,000 to 20,000 in the past few decades. Unemployment has been above 50 per cent for several years. Country music and religious programming dominate local airwaves. Candidates for sheriff vow they will bring “Christian values” to their work. Trump has become a hero in such down-and-out places because he offers hope. His commitment to revive the coal industry smacks of opportunism, but such words resonate with millions of Americans who feel the 21st century has left them behind. It is a message that contrasts sharply with that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. She vowed months ago that part of her environment agenda was to “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” “We’re on the backburner for everything and it just ain’t right,” said Thompson, 57. At a time when “everybody’s scrapin’ to make ends meet,” he called Clinton out as “a professional politician.” He blamed her for supporting Obamacare, which he says most working people in West Virginia cannot afford, and the email scandal. “If I’d been caught with all those secrets where I shouldn’t have had them, I’d now be in jail,” he said. However, Clinton’s worst sin was that she wanted to close the remaining mines. “If she gets in there I think the coal miners will have it tough makin’ a livin’ because of the (Environmental Protection Agency),” Thompson said. This remote valley has voted Democrat for generations. This fall, it was hard to find anyone who would admit they would still do so. One of the exceptions is Johnny Bishop, who sells an eclectic assortment of used mining helmets, belts and lamps, overalls and American flags from his roadside flea market. “I will vote for Clinton because my father was a Democrat but between her and Trump, I see nothing but trouble,” Bishop said. “I remember John Kennedy’s train stopping here during the 1960 campaign. But we don’t have a train station any more. Hell, we don’t even have a bus stop.” Although he was backing Clinton, Bishop, who lost his job in the mines years ago and whose six children had left to find work, said she “wasn’t right about coal. I think it’s got a good future. All she is doing is following (U.S. President Barack) Obama, but she sure has got everybody here riled up.” Frances Blankenship, editor of the Welch Daily News, doubts coal could come back, although she wishes it would. Her family has lived in McDowell Country for generations. She was in despair not only about the collapse of mining, but the social crisis it has triggered. “Most young people have moved away,” she said. “Worse than that, a lot of those who stay are overdosing. We are losing two or three of them every month that way.” As for the choice voters faced on Nov. 8, Blankenship described Trump as “pitiful” and Clinton as such a liar “I don’t believe anything she says. I really wish we had a third party to vote for.” Still, she was sure the county “would go hard for Trump. Throw a stone out on the street and you’ll hit somebody who is voting for him.” That’s what Thompson is counting on. “I am just one person but I say, ‘Give him a chance and let’s see,’ ” he said. “He might pull something out of his hat. Ya never know.” Related Matthew Fisher: Clinton looks like she’ll stagger across the finish line, but presidency will be crippled Matthew Fisher: At a southern rally, Donald Trump supporters predict a ‘landslide’ — ‘God wants this’ Matthew Fisher: Americans openly fear election will be catalyst to divisive war between bitter social groups Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) NEW YORK — The world was a much different — and cheaper — place in 1908. That, of course, was the last time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series before their Game 7 extra innings victory over the Cleveland Indians in the early hours of Thursday morning. In 1908, a Hershey candy bar cost just 2 cents. That’s only 51 cents in 2016 dollars, if you adjust for inflation. A Hershey bar today costs you three times as much – $1.59 on Target’s web site, according to Food Timeline and Oregon State University political science professor Robert Sahr. Official government inflation numbers only go back to 1914. A box of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes was only 10 cents, 108 years ago. That’s $2.56 in today’s dollars. A 24-ounce box now costs $3.45 on Jet.com, the e-commerce site being bought by Walmart. So it looks like cocoa has been a hotter commodity than corn! Baseball players also weren’t making nearly as much money in 1908 as they are now. According to Baseball-Reference.com, the Cubs ace pitcher Mordecai “Three Finger” Brown took home an annual salary of $3,500 in 1908. That works out to only about $90,000. A rookie in Major League Baseball today earns a minimum salary of $507,500. And World Series MVP Ben Zobrist made $10 million this year. That doesn’t include his signing bonus, or any other incentives. Fans didn’t have to pay as much to see the game Wednesday night either. A seat in the grandstands at Chicago’s West Side Grounds (Wrigley Field didn’t exist yet) cost just $1.50 for a World Series game in 1908. The stock market looked a heck of a lot different in 1908 too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading around 63. Yes, 63. Two digits. It’s currently hovering around 18,000. And the companies in the Dow were nothing like today’s leaders in finance, technology and retail. No American Express, Apple or Home Depot obviously. Amalgamated Copper, American Sugar, Colorado Fuel & Iron, National Lead and U.S. Rubber were some of the leading components. So was U.S. Steel, which still exists today but is nowhere as big as it once was. (Or even as big as it was in the late 1950s when Hyman Roth told Michael Corleone in “The Godfather Part II” that the mafia was bigger than U.S. Steel.) GE is the only Dow component that still is in the index today. And it only joined in 1907, replacing Tennessee Coal & Iron. 40.712784 -74.005941 Related stories Cubs defeat Indians 8-7 in Game 7 of World Series, earn first title since 1908 Professor has best response when student skips class for World Series Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Tumblr Reddit Pinterest Email Popular See November’s supermoon, the biggest one since 1948 This is why you’re seeing people wearing safety pins Ku Klux Klan announces Trump victory parade in North Carolina Young sons of slain NYPD Sgt.

ZTE Cymbal-T Flip Phone Released in the US with Android Lollipop, Snapdragon 210 GO It sells for $99.95 via Home Shopping Network Nov 3, 2016 13:31 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  ZTE is already present on the U.S. market, but the Chinese handset maker is mostly known for its cheap devices rather than its flagships. Some of the company's high-end devices like the Axon lineup have been well received in the U.S. The latest smartphone launched by ZTE in the United States is the Cymbal-T, a low-end Android device that features a now unusual clamshell form factor. However, that shouldn't matter that much since there's a huge market for entry-level smartphones as well. The good news is the ZTE Cymbal-T will be available in the U.S. for just $99.95 outright. The phone will be available via Home Shopping Network, Best Buy, as well as Walmart stores. It's also worth noting that the Cymbal-T sells on TracFone for $99.99 and you won't need to sign up for a new contract in order to get one. On top of that, TracFone offers customers 1 year of service with 1200MB of data, 1200 minutes, and 1200 messages for one year, included in the phone's price. ZTE Cymbal-T Since the Cymbal-T is a fairly basic device, Android fans shouldn't expect any impressive features. In fact, the phone doesn't even come with a rather recent version of Android. According to ZTE, the Cymbal-T ships with Android 5.1 Lollipop on board, and we don't think there will be any major OS updates available in the future. Spec-wise, ZTE's low-end clamshell sports a 3.5-inch display, along with a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a secondary 2-megapixel secondary camera in the front. Under the hood, the Cymbal-T packs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal memory, which can be further expanded up to 32GB via microSD card. When it comes to connectivity, ZTE's entry-level handset does its job admirably, since the phone features 4G LTE support, as well as Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth. No word on battery capacity though.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #ZTE Cymbal-T#ZTE smartphone#clamshell smartphone#ZTE entry-level#TracFone smartphone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it ZTE Cymbal-T (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news ZTE Officially Unveiled the Axon 7 Max with Dual-Camera Setup ZTE Officially Launches ZTE Axon 7 Mini with 5.2-Inch Display ZTE Crowdsources Mobile Device and Awaits Input Through Project CSX ZTE Axon 7 Mini Specs Leak, Point to Snapdragon 617 and 5.2-Inch Display OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE 5 photos    ZTE Cymbal-T New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Samsung Announces Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy S7/S7 edge more on: Samsung Galaxy S7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

(AP) — Authorities say a man who died in a crash on an upstate New York highway was fleeing police after getting caught stealing merchandise from a Southern Tier retail store. The Chemung County Sheriff’s Office says 35-year-old Adam VanCise, of Palmyra, was caught leaving the Walmart in the town of Horseheads with a cart full of goods around 8 a.m. Wednesday. He fled on foot to a nearby store, where he stole the car of a woman who had just gotten out of her vehicle. He then drove a few miles west into Steuben (stoo-BEHN’) County. Police ended the pursuit when it became too dangerous. Moments later they came upon the car after it had crashed into another vehicle in Corning. VanCise was pronounced dead at the scene. Two people in the other vehicle suffered non-life threatening injuries.

(AP) — Authorities say a man who died in a crash on an upstate New York highway was fleeing police after getting caught stealing merchandise from a Southern Tier retail store. The Chemung County Sheriff's Office says 35-year-old Adam VanCise, of Palmyra, was caught leaving the Walmart in the town of Horseheads with a cart full of goods around 8 a.m. Wednesday. He fled on foot to a nearby store, where he stole the car of a woman who had just gotten out of her vehicle. He then drove a few miles west into Steuben (stoo-BEHN') County. Police ended the pursuit when it became too dangerous. Moments later they came upon the car after it had crashed into another vehicle in Corning. VanCise was pronounced dead at the scene. Two people in the other vehicle suffered non-life threatening injuries. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

This Mom Dressed Her Baby Up As Harry Potter For the Cutest Photo Shoot Ever Woman's Day 03-11-2016 Lyndsey Matthews Lots of moms take photos of their babies every month as a way to document their first year, but photographer Kayla Glover took that idea to the next level. When her daughter Lorelai was born this past May, Glover decided to add themes to each of the monthly photo shoots-so far she's captured Lorelai as Minnie Mouse, Ash Ketchum and Cruella de Vil-but her masterpiece is this adorable baby Harry Potter photo shoot. © Kayla Layla Photography "I have been a fan since I was a child and still have all of my original books," Glover wrote on her blog about Harry Potter. "I used to wait in line at Wal-Mart or Barnes & Noble to get my copy at midnight on release day." © Kayla Layla Photography So when Lorelai turned three months old, she decided to make her monthly photo shoot a tribute to the famous boy wizard. Since Lorelai already had part of the Harry Potter look down thanks to her big eyes and brown hair, the look "was a cinch," Glover says. All she had to do was give her a pair of round glasses, a Gryffindor scarf and a wand to hold and the look was complete. © Kayla Layla Photography "They are still to date my favorite images of her," Glover says. "I am excited for the day that I can introduce these books to her and hope she loves them as much as I did." So what's the next theme for Lorelai's photo shoots? Replay Video Could Anti Trump Movement Turn Into Something More? WASHINGTON (AP) — Demonstrators upset over the election of Donald Trump have marched in cities around the country over the past week, and some are making plans to be in Washington for his inauguration Jan. 20. But whether marches will become a movement is an open question. Wochit News Farewell To The Irreplaceable And Magnificent Gwen Ifill Gwen Ifill, simply one of the best political journalists in the country, has died of breast cancer at age 61. She was best known as the host of Washington Week, the PBS show that aired Friday nights out of the WETA studios in northern Virginia. Ifill also moderated two vice presidential debates and was an author as well. Wochit News To Help Baby Avoid Heart Defects, Mom's Blood Sugar Needs Close Monitoring A new study suggests increases in a woman's blood sugar levels during early pregnancy may affect her baby's risk of congenital heart defects. According to UPI, researchers led by Dr. Emmi Helle of Stanford University in California measured blood sugar levels of more than 19,000 pregnant women during their first trimester. For every 10 milligrams per deciliter increase in blood sugar, the study found the risk of delivering a baby with a congenital heart defect rose about 8 percent.

Youth Villages is a private nonprofit organization with the mission to help emotionally and behaviorally troubled children and their families live successfully. Individuals, families or groups may become Holiday Heroes by either requesting a child’s holiday wish list and shopping for the child, making a financial contribution to the Holiday Heroes Fund or making in-kind donations. A $100 donation will purchase all of the items on a child’s wish list, and a $200 donation will provide gifts to a child and his or her siblings. Youth Villages appreciates donations of any size along with toys. Toy donations are accepted during Youth Villages’ Toy Drive set for the weekends of Nov. 5 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Nov. 6 from 12 a.m. to 5 p.m. and also Nov. 12, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Nov. 13, 12 a.m. to 5 p.m. in front of Toys ‘R’ Us at the Outlets of Mississippi at 200 Bass Pro Dr., Pearl.

(Photo: FILE PHOTO) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE With proper preparation, your smartphone can be your secret savings weapon for holiday shopping and year round. By loading and signing up for cashback apps, store loyalty and other discount programs you can save both time and money. I suggest bringing a portable battery or two for long shopping excursions such as Black Friday, because these apps will contribute to burning through your phone’s battery life faster. TCPALM Thanksgiving day edition available early for eager shoppers Here are the apps I recommend you add to your arsenal: Amazon: With Amazon Lightning deals constantly changing, the fastest way to order is with Amazon’s shopping app. Use the app’s visual search to help with comparison price searching, which comes in handy for price-matching. Many retailers including Target, Walmart, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Staples and Office Depot, match Amazon prices year round but some suspend price matching for Black Friday weekend. With Amazon’s Black Friday sale now underway, it’s worth comparing prices in local stores and matching prices. Also starting Nov. 15, the app will have a new feature for iPhone users called Package X-Ray where you scan a barcode from your package and can see inside without opening it. (Note: This feature doesn’t sound ideal for parents trying to keep gifts a mystery from tech-savvy snoopers.) Ebates: When I shop online, Ebates.com is the first website I go to and now the cashback website, which also has a smartphone app, offers in-store cashback at select retailers. To earn cashback when shopping in-store you need to add a Visa or American Express card to your Ebates account and then select cashback offers to link to your card. To earn cashback online or on the app, head to Ebates first and then click on the store name to earn a percentage back on your purchase. You’ll also get a bonus for signing up and Ebates sends users cashback via check or PayPal every three months. Plenti: If a trip to Macy's or the AT&T store is in your shopping plans, you'll want to sign up for Plenti, which is the nation's first coalition loyalty program developed by American Express. The credit card company teamed up with AT&T, ExxonMobil, Macy's, Hulu and other retailers to offer loyalty rewards and you can earn points by simply paying your AT&T wireless bill. Register at a participating retailer, online at Plenti.com or through the Plenti smartphone app. Once you have 200 points, you can get $2 off at select stores or save up 1,000 points for $10 off. Plenti also has an online marketplace where you can earn points for shopping online similar to earning cashback with Ebates. Shopkick: Get points or "kicks" just for walking into stores, which adds up to free gift cards. Scan select items in the app for more kicks. You also can link your credit card to your Shopkick account to earn kicks at specific stores but I can't guarantee the safety. Days after I linked my credit card more than a year ago, I had a breach on my card and had to get a new one. It may have just been a coincidence and I haven’t had a problem since I linked my new credit card. Target Cartwheel: Through Dec. 24, every day Target has 50 percent off a different toy with its Cartwheel app. But you can save on hundreds of items each day with the app. One of the best ways to find current discounts is to scan items with the app, or browse by category. You can also use Cartwheel with store and manufacturer coupons plus some store coupons are loaded in the app and can be found under the checkout section. If you don't have a smartphone you can also make a Cartwheel account at Cartwheel.com. You'll be able to add discounts to your account online but will need to print out your Cartwheel barcode and bring to the store. Target Kids’ Wish List: Another Target app to use with Cartwheel to save even more is the Kids’ Wish List app. When you make a wish list, you get a 10 percent off coupon for the wish list items, which includes toys, sporting goods, outdoor products, video games, electronics, kids’ apparel, accessories, shoes, kids’ home products and kids’ music, movies and books. The coupon is a one-time only coupon, which can be used in-store and at Target.com through Nov. 23. Some exclusions apply. Sam’s Club: Members of the warehouse club will want to download the new Sam’s Club Scan & Go smartphone app to bypass the checkout lines. With the app scan items as you add them to your shopping cart, pay from your phone when you’re ready to checkout and then show your receipt on the phone on your way out of the store. ibotta: Normally I use ibotta to earn cashback on my groceries but there are also cashback offers for stores like Best Buy and Groupon and I expect more offers will be available closer to Thanksgiving. To use the app, you complete tasks, which include viewing a recipe or answering a trivia question, to unlock the rebate. For specific cashback item offers, scan the item’s barcode to confirm you're buying the correct item, and take a photo of your receipt through the app. For some stores, such as Best Buy, you’ll need to present a QR code on your phone prior to checking out. Once you have $20 in your ibotta account, you can cash out by depositing money in a PayPal or Venmo account or selecting a gift card. TCPALM Your Black Friday headquarters: Find everything from leaked ads to hours More store apps: I have many stores’ apps on my phone including Kohl’s, JCPenney, Walmart, Sears and Kmart’s Shop Your Way Rewards program, Macy’s, Michaels, A.C. Moore, Jo-Ann Fabric and more. I use some to access my loyalty cards, check prices and to easily find store coupons. An added bonus of using the Kohl’s app in-store is free shipping on all orders.

Lehigh Valley Craft Beer: Tastings, new places opening, upcoming events & more LV Business Cycle Manufacturing Another monster warehouse pitched for Bethlehem Nicole RadzievichContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Look what California billionaire Ed Roski Jr. has in store next for Bethlehem. BETHLEHEM — California billionaire Edward Roski Jr.'s company is pitching a 1.2-million-square-foot warehouse on former Bethlehem Steel property. The plans, which will go before the city Planning Commission as early as Nov. 10, do not name a tenant for the building proposed at the Majestic Bethlehem Center, but city officials say it is expected to bring up to 129 jobs. Majestic spokesman Ed Konjoyan could not immediately be reached for a comment. The warehouse, proposed for 3633 Commerce Center Blvd., would add to the nearly 2.5 million square feet of warehousing and distribution centers (more than 43 football fields) that already have taken root at Majestic Bethlehem Center. Majestic also is constructing and marketing a million-square-foot building with the possibility of a 930,000-square-foot expansion, making it likely the biggest one in the Lehigh Valley. "This is what this [development] was planned for — distribution and warehousing," said Alicia Miller Karner, city director of community and economic development. "There is a lot of land back there, and it has excellent access to Route 412 and Interstate 78."

Republicans have promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act pretty much since the law’s enactment in 2010. The Majestic complex is being built on 441 acres in a remote part of the former Steel property that was made accessible by Commerce Center Boulevard, which began construction in 2004. The park, which Roski's Majestic Realty acquired eight years ago, has the potential for manufacturing and distribution buildings in excess of 8 million square feet. The first tenant, Crayola, moved into an 800,280-square-foot warehouse in 2013. Majestic has since welcomed a Wal-Mart fulfillment center. California Cartage Co. recently signed a lease for nearly 540,000 square feet of warehouse space.

The appetite for large warehouses continues to grow in the Lehigh Valley as retailers adjust their distribution networks to boost online sales, according to a new report. The Lehigh Valley, as well as eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, has emerged as one of the most robust regions for warehouse... (Anthony Salamone) Majestic abuts Lehigh Valley Industrial Park VII, which has landed warehousing and distribution tenants such as Zulily and Primark Stores Ltd. The industrial park is a piece of a larger redevelopment plan for the once 1,800-acre Steel plant, which began shutting down two decades ago. Showier pieces of Steel's redevelopment include the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem and SteelStacks arts and entertainment complex. Warehouse development is a fast-growing trend in the highway corridors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, given the proximity to New York City and Philadelphia. New warehouse construction has grown 8 percent in the Lehigh Valley's Interstate 78 "submarket" since Jan. 1, making it one of the fastest-growing markets in the United States, according to the 2016 Mid-Year Industrial Logistics & Transportation report recently released by commercial real estate services company Colliers International Group Inc. Colliers also says new activity and anticipated deals should result in a higher volume of warehouse transactions in the second half of 2016. Some critics say warehousing provides fewer and lower paying jobs than other types of development while adding more trucks to the streets. But advocates for the Bethlehem projects say the warehouses are well-suited for the former Steel land due to its location near the widened Route 412 and Interstate 78. It is also located in remote areas of the brownfield that would be difficult to attract other types of businesses.

But did you know many of the largest retailers already know what most of their deals will be? Yeah, they will be adding specials and door-openers and other limited quantity inventory — and probably aren’t disclosing those items — but most of the products are already lined up. So why not get a head start and then relax until Thanksgiving afternoon? You can do just that if you check out the multi-retailer BlackFriday.fm website. The starting retail chain lineup for Black Friday 2016 includes Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s, Macy’s, GameStop, Toys R Us, J.C. Penny, and Kmart. But the list goes much, much deeper. In all, almost 150 chains and stores are on the site now. Within the site, you can search for deals by product category or by store name. Related: Black Friday 2016 For each retailer, you will see in-store and online Black Friday Sale starting days and times. You can locate the nearest location if they have brick-and-mortar stores and you can also search where to find the best deals in the stores or online for that retailer. You can download coupons and scan the stores’ latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday ads. Note that some of the retailers still have their 2015 ads on the site, but many are set with 2016 deals. You can set up an account on the BlackFriday.fm website and start a wishlist that you carry while shopping with an iPhone or Android app. You can also opt-in or out of email updates regarding Black Friday. Unfortunately, the alerts are all or nothing, so you cannot, for example, ask for ads for 55-inch or larger 4K TVs under $250, which would be nice. If you like shopping deals, if you need some tech upgrades, or if you want to put a semblance of organization on holiday shopping, the BlackFriday.fm site can possibly give you some order and control.

Biola University About Undergraduate Graduate Online Athletics News & Events Directory The Chimes About Us Positions Biola's student-run newspaper for 80 years News Features Sports A&E Opinions Blogs Photos & Videos Tweet Email Print Students should be aware of gentrification By Justin Yun November 3, 2016 0 Comments Our dollars can change city landscapes and influence local economies.   |   Eliana Park/ THE CHIMES     Comedian Louis CK spoke nostalgically between quick staccatos of laughter as he humorously explained how Americans sidelined mom-and-pop businesses for Walmart on the Opie and Anthony radio talk show. In an age of increasing urban gentrification, millennials are changing the landscape of some of the world’s largest cities into cosmopolitan centers of trendy restaurants and hipster coffee shops. A kernel of truth can be extracted from the comedian’s rant. Millennials, especially college students, need to be more aware of the businesses they buy from. Conscientous spending According to PBS, gentrification “is a general term for the arrival of wealthier people in an existing urban district, a related increase in rents and property values, and changes in the district’s character and culture…[displacing] poor communities by rich outsiders.” Los Angeles is one of the more notable frontiers for businesses looking to gentrify neighborhoods. As students attending a university that takes the namesake of a Southern Californian city, we should be more aware of how we spend our dollars. When we buy products from businesses who change whole neighborhoods and urban city blocks by exploiting its “Bohemian culture,” we strengthen the businesspeople responsible for raising rents and marginalizing poor people. Frieda Buckley from Bath, United Kingdom explains in an article by The Guardian, “In the end gentrification will create huge social unrest and we shall all—rich and poor—suffer the consequences.” Gentrification is the reason why people are being displaced because of the Silicon Valley tech boom, and the reason why a Google employee decided to live in his truck, as explained by an article by Business Insider. Gentrification is a complicated problem, and there is not a single solution to reverse the social and economic effects of it. According to the aforementioned PBS article, “Gentrification has been the cause of painful conflict in many American cities, often along racial and economic fault lines.” This fundamental trait of gentrification is certainly applicable to Los Angeles. Members of the Latino community are fighting gentrification in Boyle Heights—“Known for low-income housing, mom-and-pop stores, taco stands, service workers and mariachis,” according to The Guardian. Residents are afraid this would “drive up rents, drive out residents and erase a cradle of Chicano identity.” Impacting the local economy Struck by urban wanderlust, many college students are always looking to the trendiest parts of Los Angeles to satiate their weekend adventures and thrills. L.A. is not only one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country, but also a vibrant hub of cultural foods from all over the world. Where we buy our food from can make a difference in the local economy. As we grow older, our incomes will grow and the influence our dollars have on businesses will likely increase. Once a bazaar for the immigrant community, the once proletarian Grand Central Market has been one of the most visible subjects of the city’s urban development. Expensive delicatessens and au courant eating places have replaced simple vegetable and fruit stands. The history of the city and even the now trendy marketplace can reveal a rich narrative of race and culture in America. Your dollar can shape how businesses shape the local economy and influence the culture of communities nationwide. Students should save wisely and spend with their eyes wide open.   By Justin Yun Justin Yun is the Opinions editor and hopes to facilitate a diverse and thought-provoking dialogue about campus life and current affairs.

 Whole Foods founder Mackey retakes helm in turnaround Reuters Nov. 3, 2016, 1:02 AM 644 facebook linkedin twitter email print John Mackey, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, speaks at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills Thomson Reuters By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc is staking its future on blunt, vegan co-founder John Mackey, betting the man who built the high-end health food grocery chain has the best shot of leading its turnaround. Whole Foods on Wednesday said Mackey would resume his job as solo chief executive officer six years after he split the role with co-CEO Walter Robb, known as the businessman who carried out Mackey's vision. The Austin, Texas-based grocer has reported five quarters of falling sales at established stores, and while the decline may be easing, Whole Foods faces intense competition from retailers ranging from Kroger to Walmart and Amazon. "I like our positioning, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it ... We've got to up our game and that's what we are intending to do," Mackey said on a call reporting quarterly earnings. He declined to elaborate on turnaround plans. Mackey follows in the footsteps of other co-founders who re-established control of their companies, said retail expert Bill Bishop. Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz and Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs each returned as CEOs when their companies faltered. Whether Mackey, whose steadfast presence at the chain was briefly broken by a five-month break to hike the Appalachian Trail in 2002, can pull off that turnaround is not clear. "In this fast-changing, very competitive market, the question is whether the founder will have the skills to right the ship," said Bishop. Mackey is an outspoken Libertarian with a proven knack for capitalizing on nascent food trends. He adheres to a strict diet, but has come under fire from food purists for selling meat and "natural" versions of junk food such as chips and sugary drinks. He also has courted controversy. For years before the company's purchase of Wild Oats, Mackey used the alias "harobed," his wife's name spelled backward, to post comments on Web forums praising Whole Foods and criticizing Wild Oats. Giving a single person command will make big changes easier, said Roger Davidson, retail consultant at Oakton Advisory Group. "You need the vision and direction coming from one leader," said Davidson, who was an executive at Wild Oats when it was purchased by Whole Foods in 2007. "They need to make some hard decisions and go with them," he added, arguing the company should slash its long-term plans for 1,200 stores in half; speed up investment in its new, value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain; and remodel stores.

(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo Black Friday (Nov. 25) will be here before you know it. If you’ve paid any attention to your emails, digital marketing or store campaigns, you’ve realized that retailers are already promoting pre-Black Friday deals. We’ve done both local recon and e-commerce research to nail down some of the top Black Friday tips to help you score the best deal this holiday season. Do your research When it comes to scoring the biggest and best Black Fridays deals, it’s best to do your research and plan ahead of time. We recommend scouring the Internet, reading consumer reviews, comparing prices, paying attention to your emails for extra deals and checking your local businesses' social media spaces and ads. Businesses like Overstock, Shopbop, Walmart, Amazon and local shops are starting to promote Black Friday or Pre-Black Friday sales the first week of November. Black Friday isn’t just one day this year Many major retailers launch their Black Friday sales as early as 2-3 weeks before the official day and continue with some of the best deals through Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday, and the week before Christmas. If you’re looking to get the best deal, don’t impulsively shop — stay patient. We chatted with a few local businesses to get the lowdown on the best time to shop here in Des Moines. Meredith DeGroot, spa director at spa810, said, “Beginning on Black Friday through mid-January are the best times to shop during this season, depending on what items you are shopping for. On Black Friday, customers will receive a $10 gift card with any purchase.” Local business owner Amy Hassebrock said, “Local shoppers can save the most money at Matilda Muse or Aimee, both located in the East Village, on Black Friday or Small Business Saturday. These are the only sales we have the entire year.” Taylor Fame of RAYGUN echoed the same thought, “If extreme couponing isn’t your gig, we’d recommend that local Des Moines shoppers save money by staying local and visiting as many local shops as possible. There are so many places to stop in the East Village, that it’s easy to walk around and weigh your options. For RAYGUN and most other local businesses, the best deals will be on or after Black Friday, starting on Small Business Saturday and running through the rest of the holiday season.” Take advantage of technology The most deals of the year are promoted on Black Friday, but not necessarily the best deals. With the help of smart phones, there’s a smarter way to shop on Black Friday. This year, consumers can research online and then use apps to follow product pricing for drops throughout the year. We recommend trying out apps and online resources such as Camel Camel Camel, SlickDeals, Flipp, Shopular and 2016 Black Friday Deals by dealnews.com. Research while you shop If you’re out shopping on Black Friday or other high-traffic holiday shopping days, there’s a very good chance that you’ll be waiting in line to check out. Take advantage of your wait and do some quick research on your smart phone to price-check your item. Make sure there aren’t other or better sale prices online. Use comparison shopping apps like Amazon mobile or Red Laser to ensure you’re not overpaying for anything on your holiday list. Deepen your discount with coupons To find the year’s best bargains, examine local papers and online for printable or mobile coupons to pack on your big shopping day. If you plan to shop Macy’s and other big-box stores on Black Friday, go to Raise.com prior to shopping and purchase discounted gift cards — $100 gift card for $90, for example — and use them when paying. We also suggest following deal sites like TheKrazyCouponLady.com or Coupon Sherpa, which both provide extra savings. 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2eWRIbq

The start of the holiday shopping season seems to get earlier every year. Which makes sense because the holidays make big bucks for stores. According to a National Retail Federation survey, this year holiday gift sales in November and December are expected to top 55 billion dollars. That means the average person will spend about 935 bucks on gifts, food, flowers, and everything needed to deck the halls. If you want to beat the Black Friday rush, you can start seeing savings now. Walmart launched its holiday gift guide. It features sale prices on items like TVs and Barbie’s Dreamhouse. Amazon has a Black Friday deals store. It has sales on gifts like clothes, electronics, and toys. The site will feature new deals every day, sometimes every five minutes, until December 22nd. Happy shopping!

Simplify your blog reading and don't miss a post by subscribing to my blog via email (choose to get daily or weekly updates delivered right to your inbox). The following closet tip is a guest post on divided containers from regular contributor, Kristin at The Gold Project. It is not a secret. I am a huge fan of divided trays. I use them in almost every room in my house. I like that they make my drawers look uniform and put together and they also do not cost a fortune. You can find them at just about any retailer; Wal-Mart, the dollar store, Ikea, Target, and the list goes on. Today, I am sharing the top ways I use them in my home and at work. Divided Containers for Hair Ties I have all of my hair ties divided out by type: headbands, bobby pins/barrettes, small ponytail holders, large ponytail holders, and clips. Divided Containers for Mailing Drawer Mail used to be a crazy beast in my house. That is until I got a system that works for me. I set up this system in 2014 and it is still going strong today. My extra checks get a compartment, my address stamp gets another, and then envelopes are organized by size. Divided Containers in Work Desk Drawers Opening my desk drawers at work makes me happy. I see a drawer full of bright office supplies divided by type. I have highlighters in one compartment, erasers in another, then tape, pencils, and pens. Divided Containers for Makeup I have tried several different ways to organize my small makeup collection, but I always go back to a divided tray. I like to keep all of my lip products together, my eye products together, and foundation type of products together. So, when I am putting on my makeup in the morning, I know exactly where everything for each area of my face should be located. Do you use divided trays to organize in your home? I would love for you to share your ideas with me. My name is Kristin and I am a middle school career education teacher by day and a mommy/wife/blogger by night. I am married to my high school sweetheart and we have two loving children. We recently made a life-changing move to Arkansas, so our new house is always under construction. I get excitement out of finding new creative, functional, and cute ways to organize things! I also enjoy writing and documenting life as it happens. So, I put these loves together and created The Gold Project. With the help of my husband, I am attempting to turn our house into a home. So, check out this special place of mine and take this journey with me!

There are so many affordable options available, including digging around for some small boxes you may have on hand. Even the plastic trays from grocery store cookies can be reused, especially when you have a very shallow drawer! Reply Comments Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The opposition campaign — fueled by national and in-state business interests — still holds a decided money advantage. The Defeat the Tax on Oregon Sales Committee has now raised nearly $26 million. Among interesting recent contributions: $125,000 from the JP Morgan Chase & Co., and another $175,000 from Wal-Mart (which has given $250,000 in total now). The Yes on 97 campaign has continued to be funded largely by public employee unions. It’s reached the $14 million mark. Proponents have also received some campaign help from an associated committee, Defend Oregon. The National Education Association put in another $250,000, setting its total contributions at $2.1 million. Service Employees International Union Local 503 — the largest union representing Oregon state government workers — just reported $201,260 in staff help. All told, the union local has given nearly $3 million. The corporate tax initiative would raise an estimated $3 billion a year. It would impose a 2.5 percent tax on sales by corporations with at least $25 million in annual revenues in Oregon. Some other notable new contributions from the state’s disclosure database: • In the heated race for secretary of state, the Oregon Education Association gave another $25,000 to Democrat Brad Avakian. Polls show him locked in a tight race with Republican Dennis Richardson. The teachers’ union has now given Avakian $150,000 this year. • Republican gubernatorial candidate Bud Pierce received another $50,000 from the Republican Governors Association. The group has given him a total of $175,000 in recent weeks. That’s a lot more help than Richardson received from the group in his 2014 race for governor. But it pales next to the $2.5 million the GOP governors gave to Republican Chris Dudley in his 2010 race, which he narrowly lost to Democrat John Kitzhaber.

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriMore By Lisa Baertlein (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc <WFM.O> on Wednesday said sales declines at established stores are easing and that its co-founder John Mackey will take over as the company's sole chief executive, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent after hours. The pioneering organic and natural food grocer said Walter Robb, who has split CEO duties with Mackey for six years, will step aside at year end. "The streamlining of management is seen as a good thing," said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney, who added that shares likely got a bump from short covering by investors who bet they would fall after the report. The news signaled a potential turn for the company known as "Whole Paycheck". It has been lowering prices and experimenting with its new, value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain to fend off competition from traditional supermarket operators like Kroger Co <KR.N>, discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> and aspiring grocer Amazon.com <AMZN.O>. Whole Foods said same-store sales were down 1.6 percent for the first month of the current quarter through Oct. 30. That was less steep than the 2.6 percent drop for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 25, and marked the fifth straight quarter of declines. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods, which said customers are buying more items per visit, forecast same-store sales that are flat to down 2 percent for fiscal 2017. Executives said that deflation and competition pressured revenues, and that Whole Foods planned to step up its advertising, particularly over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fourth quarter net income rose 57 percent to $88 million, or 28 cents per share. Analysts had expected a per share profit of 24 cents for the latest quarter. Revenue was up almost 2 percent to $3.5 billion for the quarter, held back in part by deflating prices for staples including meat and eggs. The decision to make Mackey sole CEO on Dec. 31 puts the spotlight on an outspoken executive known for his Libertarian political views and leadership in the U.S. health food movement. Robb told analysts the more streamlined structure is right for the company at this juncture. He will continue as a director and senior adviser to the company. Shares of Whole Foods were up 3.9 percent to $29.63 in extended trading. The company has a relatively high percentage of short interest, pegged at 11.4 percent of shares outstanding in mid-October versus 2.0 percent on average for consumer companies.

Why are you running for office? I’m running for office because I was involved with the “no Walmart” group that started last year. My parents always taught me to be part of the solution, not the problem. I graduated from Poquoson High School in 1995, I’m a single mom of 3 kids who all attend Poquoson Schools, and so the future of this city means a lot to me. 2. Why should people vote for you? People should vote for me because I’m not a politician. I’m self-funding my own campaign, accepting no donations. I’m hoping to get the city more involved like it used to be years ago. City Council can’t be the voice of the city if they are unaware of what the city wants. 3. What’s your favorite thing about the area you want to represent? My favorite thing about Poquoson is that it’s a small town. This city will rally around you in times of need. They have excellent schools and are one of the top safest places to raise a family. 4. What is the biggest problem your area is facing, how will you fix it? There are a few problems that Poquoson currently faces, flooding, inadequate man power and facilities for our first responders, new middle school, underpaid teacher salaries, just to name a few. These will need to be addressed and handled one problem at a time, giving adequate research, ideas, and planning to each. 5. Describe Donald Trump in max 3 words? Blusterous, loud mouth 6. Describe Hillary Clinton in max 3 words? Unsecured, dishonest 7. What do you do for a living? Why do you do it? I review/process terms and conditions in contracts. I get to work at home, which give me the flexibility with my kids that I need as a single mom. 8. You’re going to be marooned on a tropical island for a week, you can only bring 1 thing – what is it? Water 9. What do you think of Colin Kaepernick? I’m Korean, adopted by white parents at the age of 9 months. This country doesn’t oppress black people and people of color. People do that. The flag and our national anthem stand for something far greater than the hate some people in this country carry in their hearts. There are always going to be bad apples in a bunch. The moment you start classifying every single apple as being bad because of one, is when you as the individual start becoming just as judging and tainted as the bad apple itself. 10. Would you vote to fund light rail expansion in your area? I don’t not believe this project effects Poquoson. 11. Will you respect the outcome of the election? Yes 12. Favorite TV Show? My favorite TV show is Criminal Minds. Click here to get to know another candidate.

Epstein Published Wed, Nov 2, 2016 Updated Wed, Nov 2, 2016 SHARE TWEET EMAIL The developers behind the successful Larkin Center of Commerce just east of downtown Buffalo are trying to work their magic a second time, aiming to convert a pair of Niagara Falls properties into a sprawling new commercial complex in the Cataract City. Reger Holdings LLC said Wednesday that it planned to convert two former big box store properties it recently acquired at 5535 and 5555 Porter Road into the Niagara Center of Commerce, a new project that could reach over 528,000 square feet when the existing buildings are combined with new construction. The existing buildings, which once housed Walmart and Sam's Club, have a total of 248,000 square feet capable of handling warehouse, distribution, light manufacturing and flex office space. But if Reger gets enough demand from new tenants, the facilities could be expanded and a third building could be constructed to exceed a half-million square feet in all, on 21.4 acres of land near the Niagara Thruway and the Niagara Falls International Airport. "We're excited for this opportunity to convert these former big box retail stores into an industrial hub and create a positive economic impact for the city of Niagara Falls and its residents," said Reger Chairman and CEO Gordon J. Reger. The properties consist of a 116,290-square-foot warehouse at 5555 Porter, which could be expanded by another 86,650 square feet, and a 131,650-square-foot warehouse at 5535 Porter, which could grow by 93,490 square feet. According to a brochure from CBRE, which is marketing the space for Reger, the buildings currently have eight overhead dock doors and three grade-level doors, with room to add more 11 more loading dock doors and possibly even railroad tracks. A third warehouse of 100,014 square feet, with up to 10 more docks, could be added. And there's significant room for parking. West Seneca-based Reger is a third-generation family-owned real estate investment and development firm that originally started as a plastering and construction business in 1946. It shifted into real estate and has focused in the last 20 years on acquiring and developing various commercial properties nationwide from Maine to Alaska. It owns about 6 million square feet of commercial and industrial space, including Lake Avenue Plaza in Hamburg and the Lancaster National Speedway, as well as several residential and mixed-use projects. In October 2010, Reger teamed up with other investors, including James Cornell and Peter Krog, to acquire and redevelop the former Seneca Industrial Center at 701 Seneca St. into the 1.3-million-square-foot Larkin Center of Commerce. Originally constructed around 1906 by the Larkin Soap Co. to house for manufacturing, retail and administrative functions, it's comprised of 12 contiguous buildings on over 30 acres, and is the largest building in the Larkin District. It now houses almost 100 business and professional service tenants. email: jepstein@buffnews.com Click here to see the comments. Add yours now!

Whole Foods Co-Founder John Mackey to Take Over as Sole CEO Bloomberg 11/2/2016 Craig Giammona Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

Robb will cease to be co-chief executive officer on Dec. 31, but he’ll remain on the board and serve as an adviser to Whole Foods, the Austin, Texas-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Robb has been at the company for 25 years. Quotes in the article Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 32.03 +1.73 +5.71% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.49 -0.74 -1.04% The move puts pressure on Mackey to fix the current crisis at a company he helped found more than 36 years ago. Mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continue to make inroads into Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. The company has been trying to fight back by offering more discounts and even starting a new chain focused on younger shoppers, but the payoff isn’t yet clear. Though sales slid last quarter, cost cuts allowed the company to post better-than-expected earnings. That helped send the shares up as much as 6.6 percent to $30.38 in late trading. The stock had been down 15 percent this year, hurt by Whole Foods’ longest sales slump in more than a decade. Profit was 28 cents in the fourth quarter, topping the 24-cent estimate of analysts. But same-store sales dropped 2.6 percent in the period -- worse than the 2.1 percent decline predicted by analysts. Total revenue of $3.5 billion was in line with estimates. Comparable sales are expected to range between flat to a 2 percent decline in fiscal 2017, the company said. Whole Foods expects to record an expense of $13 million this quarter tied to Robb’s departure, including $10 million for a 30-month noncompete agreement. “In a year that presented many headwinds for food retailers, we made measurable progress on positioning our company for continued success,” Mackey said in the statement.
