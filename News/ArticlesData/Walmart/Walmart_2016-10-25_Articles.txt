The sign read, "Dog in pound. Please Help." Patrick is the name of the 30-year-old man Price met outside of the Walmart and he was asking drivers for $120 to buy his dog, Franklin, out of the pound in Huntsville. "I understand the love for a dog," Price told Chron.com. "When you have something in your heart for animals, it's something special. Not everyone has that." She went on to say that she came to recognize that "animal love" in the heart of the man holding the sign.

"A lot of people tell you they'll help you out, or they'll come back later, but Wilma actually did come back. I felt relief." After a phone call to a friend of Price's, Patrick and Price were on their way to the pound to buy back Franklin. The reunion brought tears to both of their eyes. As for Franklin - Price says the happy pooch was shaking out of joy and excitement when he saw Patrick again. "Wilma literally saved my life. I don't know what I would have done without my dog," Patrick said. "What would motivate me every day to better myself? Honestly, that's my dog for me. Without Franklin, I'm just another homeless guy. When Wilma came back, that's when I had my first hope of continuing on." Patrick and Price are still keeping in touch and the two of them are working to get Patrick and Franklin off of the streets and into a permanent home. Patrick says he plans on staying in the Houston area. He is in the process of getting proper identification from the government.

The response from the public is overwhelmingly positive with over $7,800 raised in five days. "I'm living up to all the support people are giving me," Patrick said.

Published Oct 26th, 2016 12:56 pm JJoyner@nwabj.com / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. ––––––––––––––– Wal-Mart Stores has partnered with Oregon-based Digimarc Corp. to test a barcode invisible to the consumer and wrapped around a product package, enabling the object to be scanned from a distance, without rotating it to look for a code. In July 2015, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon posted on Instagram a photo of a Great Value-labeled product on a scanner with the caption: “Walmart’s Lab 415-C, our associates are working on some incredible innovations. Technologies like invisible watermarking could transform the way our customers check out.” Walmart Labs spokesman Bao Nguyen said the retailer has been working with Digimarc on the technology. “We take the same information that’s inside that typical barcode and replicate it hundreds of times across the package,” said Larry Logan, Digimarc’s chief marketing officer. “Think of a postage stamp that’s replicated across all sides of the package — except it doesn’t look like that. There’s no discernible characteristics like the zebra stripes. To a consumer, it’s imperceptible. It’s incorporated into the artwork of the label.” Logan says the new barcode has the potential to make supply chains and retailers more efficient and also help the customer by providing additional product information and content – including the brand’s story – while increasing convenience. Logan said the technology can increase convenience for the consumer in many ways, including opening the door for being able to scan products through the act of placing the item in their shopping cart. At the same time, the ability to scan the product from a distance on any side increases efficiency within the supply chain system and in the store, with potential applications for in-store detailing and loss prevention, Logan said. He also said the barcode would make checkouts faster, increasing retailers’ Items Per Minute count, a key metric in boosting their bottom line. Retail industry data from the past few years cast doubt on customers’ willingness to scan items in the store. A 2012 eMarketer study showed just 9% of adults in the U.S. used a QR code in the past year, and the research projected that adoption would continue to be slow. However, Logan said the all-over barcode is more convenient than QR codes, because consumers don’t have to turn the package around, looking for a code. And, he says the Digimarc Barcode is a solution consumers want. Customers “are demanding” more product information from in-store packaging, he said, pointing to a 2015 survey that showed 78% of U.S. adults wanted more information than what appears on a product’s packaging to determine whether they will purchase it. Three-fourths of those consumers were likely to research and purchase online when they don’t get the information they need from the package. “That number jumps to 87% for millennials,” Logan said. The Digimarc-commission poll looked at 2,000 U.S. adults and was conducted by Harris Interactive of New York City. An increasing amount of information is required on packaging. The all-over barcode can free up space on the package, or the company can place different content on each side or area of the package, Logan said. Larry Logan It could take a while for the Digimarc Barcode to be broadly adopted within the retail industry, if it happens at all. However, earlier this month, checkout scanner company Honeywell International of New Jersey announced that its scanners have the option of Digimarc Barcode capabilities. And a few consumer packaged goods companies near Digimarc’s headquarters in the Pacific Northwest have adopted the technology, and Wegmans Food Markets of Rochester, N.Y., has adopted the technology for its private-label brand. One potential hurdle in the widespread use of Digimarc codes is the upfront costs. Digimarc Barcode costs $400 per SKU, $50 for a licensing fee related to the content delivered to the consumer and $350 for the pre-press company to “enhance the graphics” on the package, Logan said.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Education Walmart $1 million Grant to CBCF Supports Interns Policy Education Walmart $1 million Grant to CBCF Supports Interns By Kenneth Mallory - 10:00pm October 26, 2011 770 9 SHARE Facebook Twitter Walmart’s recent $1 million grant to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation is an injection of sorely needed funding to support the organizations’ highly coveted Emerging Leaders Internship program. A Walmart official stated the company was “honored” to partner with the CBCF. “Diversity is core to Walmart’s success and we are always honored to partner with organizations that share our commitment to helping minority students succeed in life. The congressional internship program is a wonderful example of an initiative for African-American students that works,” said Kimberly Woodard, Walmart’s director of federal government relations and CBCF board member, in a statement. “The program’s success over the last six years has raised the bar for congressional internships and we commend the CBCF for its commitment to promoting diversity on the Hill.” According to information provided by the CBCF, Walmart has provided $2 million to support the program since 2006. Traci L. Hughes, Communications Director for the CBCF, told Politic365 in a phone interview that Walmart’s monetary support was “invaluable.” “More than 80 of our students have benefited from the internship program and clearly the training and exposure they have received served them well,” said Hughes. “Many of them have gone on to work on Capitol Hill. They’re currently earning law degrees, MBAs, and have even started their own companies.” The internship program spans a semester and CBCF says the program “… prepares participating students for careers in public service or the private sector.  As a result of Walmart’s funding, interns also receive a stipend and housing during their internships.” According to the CBCF, Walmart’s funding will also help sponsor its Semester in Washington internship program, a project formed through a partnership with the George Washington University. Former CBCF intern and Hampton University graduate Darien E. Nolin — now a financial analyst for a federal agency and MBA candidate at the Johns Hopkins University — spoke to Politic365 about the value of the CBCF’s internship programs. Nolin said that his CBCF internship afforded him an opportunity to develop more professional relationships with other interns and those working in Congress as he benefited from “… the amount of exposure that it brought and the amount of confidence it gave [him] to pursue other things.” And it appears that Nolin is among CBCF intern alums making remarkable educational and professional strides. “When you look at today’s economy and see what our former interns are doing and where they are working, it affirms the quality and reputation of our program as the best training ground for college students interested in public and civic service,” said Muriel Cooper, CBCF Senior Media Manager, in an email to Politic365. CBCF provided the following list of the CBCF’s Class of 2009 Walmart Emerging Leaders and the different educational and professional endeavors they are currently engaged in: Keith Benjamin: Legislative Associate for the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO and co-Chair of The Young & Powerful Group DC Chapter. Dshawna Bernard: Co-President of CoverME TTT designed to assist children in low income communities throughout the nation.

Police say Cassi Kelley, 37, of Carlisle was observed around 7:10 p.m. taking makeup, a blanket and other items from the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 4450 E. McCain Blvd. without paying. An officer stopped and searched Kelley and wrote in a police report she had a small baggie with clear rocks inside her purse. Police say Kelley told the officer the rocks were "bath salts" and that they did not belong to her, the report said. Kelley then began kicking the officer before being placed on the ground until another officer arrived, according to the report. The rocks field-tested positive for cocaine, police said. Kelley faces charges of theft of property, possession of a controlled substance and refusal to submit, according to the report. Kelley's bail was set at $15,000, and she was not listed on the Pulaski County jail roster as of Wednesday morning. A court date is scheduled for Wednesday.

It offered exactly what was in the description. Judging by the social media outcry, few people will wear it trick-or-treating this Halloween. The mock gashes simulating a suicide attempt were, according to a Change.org petition that ran over the weekend, "not a joke, not a costume, and not funny." The wound makeup was also indicative of a wider trend of treating mental illness as a scary Halloween curiosity, as The Washington Post reported Tuesday. The retail giant agreed to pull the product. (Victory!, the petition now reads.) "This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace," said Walmart in a statement, according to WABC 7. "It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention." Along with collecting candy and carving pumpkins, pointing out racist, offensive or ill-conceived costumes has become something of an annual Halloween tradition. (For a seven-year run, the late website Gawker documented October spikes in blackface.) Colleges and universities have entered the fray this year, cracking down on outfits that stereotyped or sexualized minorities. In early October, the University of Florida sent out a reminder it had a 24-hour phone line for counseling, should anyone be troubled by a costume. The university also issued a warning: "Also, keep in mind that social media posts can have a long-term impact on your personal and professional reputation." That is true even if the costumes are not worn, but discussed. In December 2015, a Yale University lecturer resigned after penning an email in a measured defense of students' choice to wear costumes that were "a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive." More recently, Brock University in Ontario, Canada, issued a costume protocol for its annual Halloween party. The guidelines, according to the Brock University website, were designed to pay respect to "stories and experiences of marginalized groups." Outfits barred from the party included religious headdresses, Day of the Dead makeup or "any costume of Caitlyn Jenner." Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog The shortlist of controversial costumes in 2016: Clowns. In Mississippi's Kemper County, wearing a clown costume will carry a $150 fine until Nov. 1, thanks to an ordinance approved in mid-October by the Kemper County Board of Supervisors. New York American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Rowland disagreed with the Mississippi county's prohibition, arguing that most outfits were protected as speech under the First Amendment. It was "a ridiculous use of government authority," Rowland told the AP, "to dictate which Halloween costumes people can wear." The county joined several high schools and school districts around the country, from California to New Jersey, that have banned clown costumes following the wave of "creepy clown" sightings. Maui from Disney's "Moana." The Polynesian demigod Maui, who will be played by Dwayne Johnson in the upcoming animated movie "Moana," was depicted in a costume released by Disney in September. The costume, a full-body suit that included tribal tattoos and fake brown skin, was met with derision and anger on social media, as The Post reported. (At least one person compared it with the suit of human skin from the horror movie "Silence of the Lambs.") Disney stopped selling the Maui costume just a few days later, telling CNN in a statement, "The team behind Moana has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some." Kidnapped Kim Kardashian. In the wake of a robbery at gunpoint at the beginning of October, the normally prolific social media star Kim Kardashian went quiet. That did not stop costume retailer Costumeish.com from offering, euphemistically and fleetingly, the $69.99 "Parisian Heist Robbery Victim Costume Kit." The costume, which included a mouth gag and black wig, was removed from the Web store on Oct. 11. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The Toy Book The Leading Trade Publication for the Toy Industry New Products Toy Report Editorial Calendar Articles Commentary About Us Contact WIT Member Spotlight: Anne Marie Kehoe October 26, 2016 By Guest Blogger by Genna Rosenberg, Principal at GennComm & WIT Executive Board Member Whether you call them wonder women, girl heroes, girls action stars, or girls with power, each corner of the toy industry is filled with powerful women knocking down barriers, pushing through walls, and empowering those around them. They support, promote, and inspire each other through connections, purpose, and empowerment. Providing opportunities to women economically is smart business, and no one knows that better than this industry’s own superhero, Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president, toys at Walmart and recipient of the 2016 Women in Toys Retailer of the Year Award. She is a real-life action hero in the toy world, committed to providing opportunities for women-owned businesses at Walmart. The Toy Book recently had the opportunity to sit down with Kehoe and discuss the role women are playing in the toy industry, Walmart’s commitment to source from women-owned companies, and what it’s like to be a bonafide Wonder Woman. Why is it important for Walmart to source from women-owned businesses? The short answer is that empowering women economically is smart business. Our women’s empowerment work is a step forward in our commitment to help people live better and a defining issue for our business and the world. For Walmart, empowering women helps us better understand and serve our customers, find the best talent, and promote economic growth in the communities we serve. Walmart’s Women’s Economic Empowerment program has the potential to be a game-changer for women and for economic growth. By tapping its core competencies as a global retailer, Walmart will empower more women to access markets and develop careers in the global supply chain, transforming their lives and the lives of their families. Two of WIT’s youngest members and co-creators of Poketti pitch their plush toys to Walmart. Through its Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative, Walmart is paving the way for women-owned companies. How do toys and WIT fit into the overall mission? Through Walmart’s Global Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative, we’ve set goals and we are taking practical steps to help change the lives of countless women around the world. We are committed to sourcing $20 billion from women-owned businesses for our U.S. business and double sourcing from women suppliers in international countries where we do business. Additionally, we have set goals to empower nearly 1 million women through training and promote diversity and inclusion representation within our suppliers. Through its annual Empowerment Day held each year at the Dallas Toy Fair, WIT has been an incredible pipeline to women-owned business leaders. Our buyers are able to network with companies they may not have access to, and manufacturers can pitch their products to Walmart, participate in learning sessions and panels, and empower women to reach their goals. WIT is an important partner in this endeavor, and the event works as a two-way street. WIT members provide us with a robust pipeline to mine for new and innovative products we can provide to our consumers, and we provide WIT members an opportunity to meet with buying teams to which they may not normally have access. What does it mean to be recognized as a WIT Wonder Woman? It was really an honor to be recognized. But with the honor comes great responsibility, which I take very seriously. Throughout my career, I’ve strived to create pathways for women from all areas and WIT gives me an opportunity to do just that. I strongly believe in WIT’s objective—and am a member of the Empowerment Committee and advisory board. I am committed to the organization’s mission of providing a collaborative, supportive environment and unparalleled opportunities that foster relationship building and innovation, all designed to help them advance women in their careers and succeed in business. Kehoe accepts her Wonder Woman 2016 Retailer of the Year award. What is the story behind the “Women Owned” logo that Walmart helped develop? Women are our biggest customer base by far, and when given the opportunity, many women will buy from women-owned companies. In partnership with the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and WEConnect International, we developed the “Women Owned” logo to help customers easily identify products made by women-owned businesses sold through any retailer, not just Walmart. All women-owned businesses that are WBENC and/or WEConnect certified are eligible to display the logo on their product packaging. Can you give an example of a success story that came as a result of Walmart’s Women Economic Empowerment initiative? During the very first WIT Women Empowerment Day, our buyers met Jodi Norgaard from Dream Big Toys. She had a line of dolls, books, and apps called Go, Go Sports Girls that promote self-appreciation and healthy life skills. When our team met with Norgaard, we saw something unique and wanted more, so we gave her some suggestions and agreed to a test in 50 stores. Within two years, her product was in 162 stores and we are proud to provide her products, which support creative play and social-emotional growth through sport, and encourage girls to dream big. In another example, we are currently selling doll clothes made by apparel merchandising students from the University of Arkansas. A few years ago, through our Women’s Empowerment Initiative, we reached out to students at Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas to design a doll clothing line for My Life As dolls in Walmart. The program allows students to interact directly with professionals in the apparel industry, build their resumes and portfolios with hands-on experiences, and showcase their work in a national retail arena. What’s next for Walmart and its Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative? As a company, we don’t believe that we have to choose between being a successful business and a responsible one. We have a model for making a difference that works. And when we combine the Walmart model with women’s empowerment, we have an incredible opportunity to make a difference on the big challenges facing our world.

If I see one more millionaire comedian go to a Trump rally and make fun of how low-class and uneducated some of his supporters are, I’m gonna put my fist through my computer. I mean for God’s sake, duh, yes, many of them are lower class and under-educated. That’s the problem. That’s why they’re angry. That’s why I’m angry. We know that their country has failed them. You see shill comedians on corporate media churning out that smug, classist condescension every day, but it’s not just the faux funnymen punching down on the disempowered for the benefit of the ruling class. I’m seeing more and more pundits and think pieces talking about how it looks like Trump’s going to lose the election, but we’re still going to have to deal with his supporters on the alt right when he’s gone. Excuse me? “Deal with” them? How are you planning on dealing with them, exactly? By ending the predatory trade agreements that have gutted rural America? By ending the Walmart/welfare system and imposing a livable minimum wage and a top-notch, fully-funded public education system? By closing the gaping tax loopholes that allow billionaires to avoid helping the human beings they’re crushing into the dust for unprecedented profits? By imposing congressional term limits and changing laws that enable the wealthiest Americans to literally buy the votes of the entire legislative branch of the federal government to keep the Walmart economy in place? Is that how you’re planning on “dealing with” them? Because it sure doesn’t look like that’s what you’re planning to do. It looks like you’re all doing everything you can to elect an extremely wealthy former Walmart executive with a consistent record of corporate cronyism and taking massive donations from billionaires all over the world, whose husband passed one of the most damaging of the aforementioned trade agreements in NAFTA. It sure looks like you voice boxes of the neoliberal think tank are using the monolithic consolidated media power legislated into existence by Bill Clinton’s Telecommunications Act to elect his Wall Street-friendly wife to the most powerful government office on the planet, at the expense of the people being choked to death by the very policies they’ve both been granted unfathomable amounts of wealth and power for facilitating. Why Punching Down Will Never Be Funny https://t.co/S2UfL7Ahei pic.twitter.com/UKIOOwxZn5 — BuzzFeed Canada (@BuzzFeedCanada) October 6, 2016 If people want to make fun of Donald Trump, that’s fine by me. He’s weird and goofy and he says horrible things sometimes, and if you pick on him, at least you’re punching up. He can go cry about it in one of his mansions. But don’t pick on his supporters just for being the natural casualties of an exploitative and predatory plutocracy. It’s not cool, and it’s not funny. Demagoguery only ever works on a desperate population. Do you think Nazi Germany happened because everyone just woke up one morning with a bad case of anti-Semitism? If you do, you didn’t pay attention in history class. World War I had left Germany traumatized and depleted and the Treaty of Versailles had the German government paying reparations fees to the Allies who’d defeated them, which they couldn’t afford, resulting in French and Belgian troops invading Ruhr to take goods and raw materials. There was some recovery, but then the Great Depression hit. Hitler was just the first hateful and charismatic opportunist to come along and say to these people, “Hey! You know how you have all these problems? Well, it’s those guys’ fault!” His party was a joke in the year 1928, receiving less than three percent of the vote, but then the economy tanked after the Wall Street crash of 1929, and people got desperate. Demagoguery is built upon desperation. Did you know racism wasn’t really a thing for Europeans until they migrated to the Americas? I mean, there was definitely hatred and prejudice, but it was the Irish against the English, the English against the French, etc. They never thought of their skin pigmentation as an identifying characteristic, never thought of themselves as “white people,” until they came to America. White slavery and indentured servitude were highly profitable practices in early colonial America, and in order to keep the European slaves and the African slaves from just teaming up and taking everything from their extremely wealthy owners, white slaves were promised a small amount of land and money for their services in exchange for keeping the black slaves in line. In their desperation, the European slaves were all too eager to help oppress their African brothers. Make them desperate, then divide and conquer. Here’s a little talk by the brilliant Tim Wise about the slavery stuff if you’re curious. Demagoguery can only ever come from desperation; you can’t scapegoat without a problem. Yes, racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia are being used to rally the victims of our exploitative system on the political right, but if you end the exploitation, you end the desperation. And that’s all Bernie Sanders was ever trying to do, for them and for all of us. #Berners, We Need To Start Collaborating With The #Deplorables https://t.co/Rew8AF2mOi #NotMeUS #LoveTrumpsHate #NeverHillary #wikileaks — Merth (@womanINtransit) October 24, 2016 Yesterday I read this great new Nation article by Dennis Kucinich, one of the last surviving anti-war Democrats. In it, he said the following: “It is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders.” That really gets at something I’ve been trying to articulate in my own little way from my humble soapbox here at Inquisitr, not just with regard to war, but with everything. There needs to be some collaboration between the left and the right if we want to fix this broken system because the real divide isn’t left and right, it’s top and bottom. The clear-eyed rebels on both the political right and the political left all agree that we need to end corporatism and restore government transparency and democracy to America. Let’s start there. If we can get those things, the next step will be made clear. We can’t get there if we’re playing along with the game where we get pitted against each other for the amusement of the aristocracy like something out of The Hunger Games to the jeers of sycophantic corporate comedians. We’ve got to stand together and make them take us seriously.

More than 110 individuals shopped for winter coats, boots and hats with volunteers. by Jonathan Weaver More than 100 children and elderly adults shopped for clothing to keep warm this winter with the Kittanning Salvation Army last night. Families with empty shopping carts lined up outside of the Kittanning WalMart about 6PM before families large and small were paired with volunteers to shop for coats, boots, hats, gloves and snow pants until about 7:30PM. Kittanning Salvation Army Lieutenant Amber Imhoff said families signed up for Project Bundle-Up at the end of September. “Every Salvation Army location in Western Pennsylvania does Project Bundle-Up – we do it different than the other locations. Most of the other locations do multiple trips or write vouchers, and we’re the only location that does all of our kids at once and all of our seniors at once,” Imhoff said. “We have 115 this year, and we try to be in-and-out in an hour-and-a-half, give or take. “We help a lot of working-class families that are maybe working minimum-wage jobs or maybe one of the parents was laid off or had a medical issue in the past year.” Volunteers stemming from local Parents Time Out (PTO) organizations, local churches and the Salvation Army’s Womens Auxiliary shopped with local families. Armstrong Junior/Senior High Cheerleading Coach Soney Hockenberry said more than a dozen seventh through 12th grade cheerleaders came to help as well. A Kittanning Senior High cheerleader who graduated in 1976, Hockenberry is also a physician office manager at ACMH Hospital in East Franklin Township – where she found out about the need for volunteers. “There was an e-mail that went out from the Salvation Army that they needed help – I gave (the cheerleaders) less than 24 hours notice and we have a nice group that came,” Hockenberry said. “I am just so very proud of them. They didn’t have to do it, it was less than 24 hours notice and I was just getting e-mails all (Monday) night and (Tuesday) (saying) ‘I can be there, I can be there.’ Very proud of them. “It is an important lesson to learn in life.” Sophomore Olivia Emmonds, of Ford City, and Senior Caitlynn Becker were two of the varsity cheerleaders who volunteered last night. It was the first Project Bundle-Up experience for both. “It was a great thing we heard about, so we figured ‘Why not come help?,” Emmonds said. Both girls are part of student organizations that also volunteer regularly – including Student Council, LEO Club and SADD. Lieutenant Amber said more than 50 volunteers responded following the e-mail blast. “It’s just a good night because, if the kids pick it out, they’re more than likely to wear it once it’s cold – especially the teenagers,” Imhoff said. “If they like it, they’ll wear it.” Even with a $5,000 allocation from the Carnegie-based headquarters, the local Salvation Army budgets about $7,000 more in the annual General Operating Budget to accommodate the local need. “I always get a little nervous but it always works out,” Imhoff concluded. “It’s important because in the winter-time here, it gets cold.” Brian McKean and wife Erika Armor – originally of Vandergrift – took their three children (three year old Matthew, nine-year-old Chad and six year old Jasmine) to WalMart as part of Project Bundle-Up. McKean said he was “very thankful” for the opportunity. “Very thankful for people volunteering to come and do this and help families out who are in need,” McKean said. “It’s a wonderful thing.” Jasmine was particularly-pleased with her cheetah-print coat and hat. Amy Kirkwood, of Kittanning, walked with the five-member family. It was her first Project Bundle-Up volunteer experience after working with another agency in the past. “It’s definitely nice seeing how excited (children) get,” Kirkwood said. “It’s nice the kids get to pick their own stuff because a lot of times, they’ll get hand-me-downs.” Kirkwood plans to volunteer again this holiday season with her four-year-old daughter, Hailey. More than 150 local residents received winter clothing last year. “We get a lot of hugs – you see a lot of volunteers with tears in their eyes, because they make a relationship with (the needy families),” Imhoff said. Those who purchased clothes last night will not qualify for the next two years. Next year, those families and those that did not register in-time are referred to the Salvation Army’s free Clothing Room. Local residents can also sponsor families’ in-need year-round by stopping by the Kittanning Salvation Army along South Jefferson Street. The average child is about $75 and senior citizen $100.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ben Guarino October 26 Follow @bbguari Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone. Self harm isn't a "scary costume" for all to wear :-) pic.twitter.com/BLRpSXGY0J — t i f f (@tiffxxc) October 24, 2016 Until recently, for $3.99 plus shipping, consumers could purchase an item called “Razor Blade Suicide Wound Latex Costume Make Up” from Walmart’s online store. It offered exactly what was in the description. Judging by the social media outcry, few people will wear it trick-or-treating this Halloween. The mock gashes simulating a suicide attempt were, according to a Change.org petition that ran over the weekend, “not a joke, not a costume, and not funny.” The wound makeup was also indicative of a wider trend of treating mental illness as a scary Halloween curiosity, as The Washington Post reported Tuesday. The retail giant agreed to pull the product. (Victory!, the petition now reads.) “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace,” said Walmart in a statement, according to WABC 7. “It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” Along with collecting candy and carving pumpkins, pointing out racist, offensive or ill-conceived costumes has become something of an annual Halloween tradition. (For a seven-year run, the late website Gawker documented October spikes in blackface.) Colleges and universities have entered the fray this year, cracking down on outfits that stereotyped or sexualized minorities. In early October, the University of Florida sent out a reminder it had a 24-hour phone line for counseling, should anyone be troubled by a costume. The university also issued a warning: “Also, keep in mind that social media posts can have a long-term impact on your personal and professional reputation.” That is true even if the costumes are not worn, but discussed. In December 2015, a Yale University lecturer resigned after penning an email in a measured defense of students’ choice to wear costumes that were “a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive.” More recently, Brock University in Ontario, Canada, issued a costume protocol for its annual Halloween party. The guidelines, according to the Brock University website, were designed to pay respect to “stories and experiences of marginalized groups.” Outfits barred from the party included religious headdresses, Day of the Dead makeup or “any costume of Caitlyn Jenner.” The shortlist of controversial costumes in 2016: Clowns. In Mississippi’s Kemper County, wearing a clown costume will carry a $150 fine until Nov. 1, thanks to an ordinance approved in mid-October by the Kemper County Board of Supervisors. New York American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Rowland disagreed with the Mississippi county’s prohibition, arguing that most outfits were protected as speech under the First Amendment. It was “a ridiculous use of government authority,” Rowland told the AP, “to dictate which Halloween costumes people can wear.” The county joined several high schools and school districts around the country, from California to New Jersey, that have banned clown costumes following the wave of “creepy clown” sightings. Maui from Disney’s “Moana.” The Polynesian demigod Maui, who will be played by Dwayne Johnson in the upcoming animated movie “Moana,” was depicted in a costume released by Disney in September. The costume, a full-body suit that included tribal tattoos and fake brown skin, was met with derision and anger on social media, as The Post reported. (At least one person compared it with the suit of human skin from the horror movie “Silence of the Lambs.”) Disney stopped selling the Maui costume just a few days later, telling CNN in a statement, “The team behind Moana has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some.” Kidnapped Kim Kardashian. In the wake of a robbery at gunpoint at the beginning of October, the normally prolific social media star Kim Kardashian went quiet. That did not stop costume retailer Costumeish.com from offering, euphemistically and fleetingly, the $69.99 “Parisian Heist Robbery Victim Costume Kit.” The costume, which included a mouth gag and black wig, was removed from the Web store on Oct. 11.

up next: now reading: Nev., N.C. Focus-Group Moms Expect Clinton Victory Maria Lorenzino/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP Nev., N.C. Focus-Group Moms Expect Clinton Victory By Alexis Simendinger October 26, 2016 Maria Lorenzino/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Election Day cannot come too soon. Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump, and even her detractors predict victory. Trump will behave badly when he loses. Neither Clinton’s email controversies nor Trump’s alleged groping of women and professed “locker room talk” tipped the scales definitively toward the next president. And on the day after millions of votes are tallied Nov. 8, many couples, their relatives and friends will have to patch up deep divisions, often under the same roof, prompted by a presidential contest that frustrates, worries and embarrasses them. Those were among findings from two voter focus groups Tuesday, one in Las Vegas and another in Charlotte, N.C., in which mothers ages 54 and younger were asked about the presidential election. The swing voters were participants in the final sessions convened as part of a series sponsored by Wal-Mart and conducted by polling firms Public Opinion Strategies and Penn Schoen Berland. “Wal-Mart Mom” focus groups of undecided and leaning voters last met in August. The mothers in North Carolina joined their husbands or male partners Tuesday during a discussion focused on a 2016 gender chasm: couples who disagree about who would be a better president and expect to effectively checkmate one another with their ballots. “I hate her,” Kyler, a 46-year-old white male Trump supporter from Charlotte, said of Clinton. “I’m voting against her.” His wife, Tasha, 45, said her strong support for the former secretary of state has made her marriage feel like “the worst it’s ever been” in terms of friction and disagreements. “I don’t want to discuss it with him. I don’t want to hear anything,” she said dismally. Tasha feels as if she has not been able to escape the conflict: The presidential candidates and their surrogates dip into North Carolina every few days, and campaign ads on radio and television are constant. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Clinton two percentage points ahead of Trump (Libertarian candidate Gov. Gary Johnson is included in the North Carolina average, pulling in 5 percent). The focus group of 10 Las Vegas women appeared similarly anxious Tuesday about the direction of the election and their choices. Scary, angry, worried, frustrated, and “a mess” were words they used to describe how the presidential campaign made them feel. Some said they were unsure if they would vote, or found themselves weighing whether a vote for Johnson was a wasted effort. “The commercials, we mute it,” Blanca, a 33-year-old Trump supporter originally from El Salvador, told the group. Clinton is “a liar and our country is not safe,” the mother of four added emphatically. In contrast, Veronica, 34, Hispanic and married and also the mother of four children, believes she will vote for Clinton. There are many things about Trump she finds objectionable, but perhaps none more than the New York businessman’s assertions that the election will be rigged against him. “How do you say you’re going to make America great again, but you have no faith in the Democratic process?” Veronica wondered. When all the ballots are counted, “I think he’ll demand a recount,” she predicted. “He can never accept defeat at any level.” In Nevada, Clinton has stretched out a lead since early October to nearly four points in a close race, according to the RCP average. In both focus groups, participants were well informed about the major party nominees, but they bemoaned the name-calling and mudslinging. They said it had been difficult to sort out details about what Clinton and Trump each proposed to accomplish, if elected, and how they would do it. Trump’s behavior and rhetoric during the campaign – positive and negative -- were simple for focus group participants to recall without prompting. But Clinton, even among her admirers in the two states, appeared to be something of a cipher. What was her message to voters? Her experience … children … families, they ventured after some thought. A number of the Wal-Mart Moms said Trump had helped create such a personality-driven contest. If he loses, as they think he will, they wondered if the damage might be localized to him rather than have wider repercussions. But Coretta, a 45-year-old Las Vegas mother of five children who said she is uncertain how she’ll vote, believes Trump has been toxic. “I think he’s helped guarantee that the Republican Party is finished,” she said. As majorities of participants in the two focus groups predicted Trump would fall short, they also wondered if he could have defeated Clinton had he been less absorbed with himself. “I hope he’s humbled by the whole thing,” said 29-year-old China, an African-American mother of three children in Las Vegas. “We need to be encouraged to be our best, not for him to be his best,” said Nevada mom Phelicia, 40, referring to all Americans. Some focus group couples in Charlotte said they’d arrived at their preferences for Clinton or Trump as protest votes, or as second choices (after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lost, and GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas dropped out). Torry, 48, an African-American who said he voted early in North Carolina for Trump, noted he had been a Sanders admirer during the primaries. His significant other, Dontressa, 43, backs Clinton with enthusiasm. The couple watched the presidential debates, but on separate TVs in different rooms of their house. Allison, 34, the mother of three children, is white and a Trump supporter in Charlotte who also said she began the presidential contest as a Sanders backer. Her husband, Jose, who was born in Mexico and became a U.S. citizen, said he plans to vote for Clinton. Allison joked that the former secretary of state should be in jail, while her husband said Clinton should be in the White House. “I think she’s the best candidate,” Jose explained, noting that Trump’s disparagement of Mexicans as rapists and criminals slammed a door for him. Asked how he and his wife would resolve their different views going forward, he replied, “We’re adults. We don’t cross a line.” Alexis Simendinger covers the White House for RealClearPolitics.

Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of Flipkart, Sachin Bansal had earlier said the company has not thought of listing on the bourses. Investment by the world's biggest retailer Walmart Stores Inc in Flipkart seems to have run into trouble with sources stating the deal is facing hiccups. Walmart was in talks with Flipkart to invest between $750 million and $1 billion for a minority stake. Late last month, reports surfaced about Walmart looking to pick up an equity stake in Flipkart. Both Flipkart and Walmart have a common competitor in the form of Amazon and a strategic deal made sense. According to sources, financial number issues have cropped up putting a spanner in the works of the deal. On Tuesday Flipkart's Chief Financial Officer Sanjay Baweja abruptly quit the company, less than two years of joining India's largest e-commerce marketplace. Flipkart had a successful sale season this year and it is widely believed to have done better than Amazon in sales. However, Flipkart has been looking for funding for some time now and the latest setback can prove to be difficult for the company. Sources add the doors are not entirely shut, but at the moment the deal looks difficult. Walmart spokesperson in a statement said, "As a policy, we don't comment on speculative reports." We have reached out to Flipkart for a comment and will update the story when we receive a reply. Flipkart is going through a revamp after it saw a slew of top management exits this year. Current CEO Binny Bansal and the head of category management, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, are locked in a battle for supremacy with Amazon. The recent Big Billion Days sale was successful for the company and it says it has seen a 30% improvement in revenue on business as usual days. In July this year Flipkart-owned Myntra acquired fashion e-tailer Jabong from the troubled Rocket Internet. Jabong was allegedly facing corporate governance issues when it was acquired. Walmart, on the other hand, is keen on expanding in the ecommerce sector and not alien to investments. The company has invested in China's second largest marketplace, JD.com and in August acquired the US-based Jet.com for about $3.3 billion. Walmart had earlier tried to establish a footprint in India, but a bribery scandal in Mexico and other differences let to a breakup of a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises. Publicly available data shows Flipkart has raised about $3.2 billion in funding over 12 rounds from 16 investors. Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of Flipkart, Sachin Bansal had earlier said the company has not thought of listing on the bourses. In contrast, Jeff Bezos has poured $3 billion in Amazon India, taking the overall investment pledge to $5 billion in the last two years.

This year, the retail giant has encouraged its private label suppliers to use labeling that helps consumers understand how to recycle their product. By joining How2Recycle, suppliers are able to use the program’s on-package recycling label to communicate to consumers how to recycle different types of packaging. “We believe a best practice is to use labeling that helps customers recycle, such as the How2Recycle label, to communicate the recyclability of a package. The How2Recycle label is also a great conversational tool between merchants and suppliers to discuss if a package is designed with recyclability in mind.” Jack Pestello, SVP, Private Brands, Walmart U.S. The How2Recycle label now has over 55 members, and is growing steadily. Consumers should expect to see the label on select Great Value and Equate products in the coming months. “We cannot understate the importance of the support of retailers like Walmart in the How2Recycle program, who are leveraging their influence in the supply chain to make a true difference to support the accuracy of recycling claims,” says Kelly Cramer, Senior Manager at Sustainable Packaging Coalition. “We very much look forward to welcoming more suppliers to How2Recycle in the near future.” ABOUT HOW2RECYCLE The How2Recycle Label is a U.S.-based standardized labeling system that clearly communicates recycling instructions to the public. How2Recycle is a project of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition®, a membership-based group that brings together business, educational institutions, and government agencies to collectively broaden the understanding of packaging sustainability and develop meaningful improvements for packaging solutions.

money transfer pricing option News provided by MoneyGram Oct 25, 2016, 17:51 ET Share this article DALLAS, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI) announced today a new cross border money transfer product for Walmart customers sending from any U.S. Walmart location to any Walmart Mexico location. Walmart2Walmart Mexico powered by MoneyGram is a new service that offers customers a $6.50* transfer fee when sending between $51 to $800. Customers can send money from over 4,500 Walmart locations in the U.S. to more than 1,250 Walmart locations in Mexico; including all Bodega Aurrera, Mi Bodega Aurrera, and Superama locations. "Our new Walmart2Walmart Mexico product is a big positive and offers MoneyGram and Walmart customers exceptional service at a great value when they need to send money to friends and family in Mexico.  MoneyGram and Walmart work side-by-side each day to ensure our customers are receiving the financial services they depend on at an affordable price," said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chief executive officer. "This new product along with other recent MoneyGram and Walmart initiatives, demonstrates our shared commitment to each other and to making money transfers easier and more affordable for customers and their families in the U.S. and Mexico." The U.S. to Mexico corridor is the largest country-to-country remittance corridor in the world. According to the World Bank, more than $24 billion was sent from the U.S. to Mexico in 2015.  Most customers make money transfers for family support purposes or special occasions such as religious festivals or emergency transfers.

Walmex, as the unit of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is known, reported a profit of 10.05 billion Mexican pesos ($543 million) in the three months through September, compared with 5.92 billion pesos in the year-earlier quarter. Net profit from continuing operations rose 17% from a year before to 6.7 billion pesos. Walmex agreed in August to sell clothing store chain Suburbia to department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool SAB for around $1 billion. Sales rose 11% to 126.86 billion pesos, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, a measure of operating cash flow, rose 12% to 11.79 billion pesos. The median estimate of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal called for net profit of 6.59 billion pesos on sales of 127.15 billion pesos, and Ebitda of 11.94 billion pesos. Walmex shares closed down 0.4% on the Mexican stock exchange ahead of the report. The Mexican economy has been growing below potential and is expected to expand just over 2% this year, while retail sales have remained robust, increasing 8.3% in the first eight months. Retailers cite the positive impact of job creation, consumer credit and growth in remittances from Mexicans living abroad, which are boosted in peso terms by a weaker local currency. On the other hand, inflation crept above the central bank's 3% target in mid-October, while consumer confidence has sunk to multiyear lows in part because of the sharp peso depreciation.

Most people against Walmart say it will hurt local business. Well, I am having a hard time thinking of any local businesses that sell anything that most hard-working residents and families need at prices we can afford. My wife and I have three young daughters. We both work hard and struggle to pay our mortgage and bills. What we need is one place to get our children's clothes, toys, school supplies and many other items from electronics to household and bath items at affordable prices. Berkshire Crossing is ideal but difficult to get to for many and a traffic nightmare. Not to mention it is not pedestrian friendly. We also have very little extra time, staying busy with after school activities, homework, dinner and the everyday craziness life throws at us. One-stop shopping is ideal these days. We do not live in the days Mom stays home and has the time to shop all around town going to one store for clothes and another for school supplies and running all over town for different items. Walmart will be cleaning up an empty eyesore and spending the money to prepare a site not wanted by any other business and creating a space which will attract other businesses. As far as jobs go. A job is a job. I would rather work at Walmart than not work at all. We live in a low income housing neighborhood and see the effects of welfare abuse and unemployment everyday. I understand the need for jobs in Pittsfield. We need to take what we can get. We cannot live in the fantasy world of a new age GE type company coming here. Without easy access to the Mass. Turnpike large manufacturing companies won't even look at Pittsfield. Finally, downtown. Downtown Inc. and the city of Pittsfield need to realize the glory days of shopping North Street are over. Let North Street have its theaters, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, coffee shops and fancy hotels and rename it the entertainment district.

BARCELONA, Spain—Walmart, the world largest retailer and one the largest employers, aims to give back to the OpenStack community. In a session at the OpenStack Summit here, Andrew Mitry, lead architect for Walmart's OpenStack effort, and Megan Rossetti, part of the OpenStack Operations team at Walmart, detailed how the open-source model is working for the retail giant. Mitry explained that Walmart started on its OpenStack journey four years ago with a proof of concept (PoC) deployment. That original PoC made use of leftover and idle hardware as an initial test case for Walmart. The PoC was successful and now OpenStack has helped transform the way Walmart works. "Today, 100 percent of our e-commerce runs on OpenStack," Mitry said. "We are now focused on transitioning our retail back-office workloads onto OpenStack, as well." Mitry noted that now it's not just web applications that Walmart is moving to OpenStack, but a lot of data intensive applications, as well. "[OpenStack] has become the de facto cloud platform within Walmart," Mitry said. Today Walmart is running 170,000 computing cores on OpenStack, but perhaps even more noteworthy is the fact that Walmart is not just a consumer of open-source; it is also active contributor with more than 60 open-source projects. Among the open-source projects that Walmart has started are OneOps,an application lifecycle management platform. Walmart has also developed the Electrode node.js application platform as an open-source effort. Open-source activity is not a side job for Walmart's IT staff but rather is considered to be part of day-to-day operations. Additionally, Mitry noted that developers are recognized for their open-source contributions. "Large companies that have been around for a while have awards for patents and other innovations," Mitry said. "We actually now have company awards around open-source contributions." Rossetti noted that open-source is now also part of the overall management process with goal setting for employees on open-source contributions. Additionally, as new developers come to Walmart, the company includes open-source contribution training as part of the on-boarding process. "One of our goals is to make it as seamless as possible to push open-source code out the door," Mitry said. By embracing open-source, Mitry commented that it has also helped Walmart attract developer talent to the company as well as helping retain existing developers. The overall culture chain in support of open source has helped generate a lot of excitement and energy for Walmart's developers. So, instead of developers thinking that the work they are doing will be hidden inside a big company and never noticed, code has a wider impact and developers are part of a larger ecosystem of open-source contributions. Additionally, Mitry noted that even though Walmart is a large company, individual development teams might still be small, so being part of a larger community is helpful. "It's not just 'hey I'm doing this little thing inside of this big company that no one notices,'" Mitry said. "[Open-source] creates excitement in what developers are doing, in being able to share it and talk about and even have other people contribute and use the code outside of the company.

(Walmart.com) NEW YORK — Walmart has removed a Halloween costume accessory from its website after it stirred controversy online about suicide. The retail giant had been selling “razor blade suicide scar wound latex costume make up” online for $3.99. The accessory depicts two cuts and a razor blade in the person’s hand. Outrage over the costume prompted a Change.org petition to stop Walmart from selling the item. “This is not just a disgrace to the sensitivity to those who suffer from self-harm, but a shame on Walmart for making light of the situation,” part of the petition read. “This ‘costume’ is real life for many people, many people who are contemplating volumes higher than self-harm. Suicide is not a joke, not a costume, and not funny.” Several Twitter users also reached out to the company to voice their distaste for the costume. @Walmart suicide isn't a costume. stop glamorizing mental illness and self-harm. it is far from it. — beanette (@kittyjnicks) October 23, 2016 Hey @Walmart what's the deal? Think it's funny to joke about self harming? How dare you. pic.twitter.com/0gcaNH1j05 — Jessica Shaw (@JessiBooShaw) October 25, 2016 @Walmart a suicide Halloween makeup kit, seriously? Mental health is not a joke to sell for a quick buck. WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN — Aretina (@aretina01) October 25, 2016 The petition gained hundreds of signatures before Walmart pulled the item from the online store. “The costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it yesterday morning when it was brought to our attention,” Walmart said in a statement. Related stories Funny or distasteful?

Responding to Food Safety Concerns, Walmart Invests $25 Million in China by Leon Kaye on Tuesday, Oct 25th, 2016 Corporate Responsibility Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) A Walmart in Shenzhen, China. Walmart pegs its future growth on the sales from stores in China, but glimpses into those outlets’ recent financial performance suggests such hopes are disappearing. Much of Walmart’s struggles can be attributed to China’s cooling economy and fickle consumers who found that Walmart’s offerings did not necessarily match their tastes. But food contamination scandals, such as the 2011 pork mislabeling fiasco and the tainted donkey meat scare that rocked the company almost three years ago, significantly contribute to the challenges the world’s largest retailer confronts in the world’s most populous country. To that end, Walmart announced this week that it will invest at least $25 million in food safety research. The retailer promised to revamp its supply chain while assuring nervous customers that its food products are safe. The company’s corporate headquarters and its foundation, along with IBM and Beijing’s Tsinghua University, will partner together to improve food authentication systems and the tracking of the company’s supply chain. Much of the focus will be on the safety of poultry, 12.7 million tons of which are expected to be consumed in China this year, trailing only pork as the nation’s most popular source of animal protein. Key to the securing of Walmart’s food supplies is the use of blockchain, an automated database system that digitally tracks food items from farmers to food processors, distributors and eventually store shelves. With blockchain, supply chain managers can seamlessly track everything remotely in a ledger, from expiration dates to warehouse temperatures – and such technology is designed so that it is nearly impossible to alter. This program will be monitored by staff at the new Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing, where they will be joined by researchers from the University of Arkansas. In addition to the supply chain technology investment, staff at this center will also research food-borne contaminants, as well as develop a food safety risk assessment model that will eventually be available to other companies and organizations worldwide. The staff will also test new technologies that can improve poultry safety across China. Walmart really had no choice but to ramp up its spending on food safety measures, as the country’s government implemented stricter food inspection and safety measures last fall. This commitment builds upon Walmart’s spending on food safety in China, which after the donkey meat scandal, reportedly tripled to almost $50 million by 2015. The combined amount of money Walmart spent on food safety is not huge when one considers the size of China’s grocery market and its fierce competitiveness. Estimates suggest China’s total grocery sector is worth an estimated $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and Walmart faces plenty of rivals including Tesco, Carrefour, Bailan and Wumart. Add the increasing popularity of e-commerce in China, and Walmart has a long road ahead if it is going to regain the trust of Chinese consumers in a challenging economic climate.

(NYSE:WMT) Consensus Estimates Update: Consensus Vs. Actual By William Abels - October 24, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter In looking at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s latest quarterly report, we can see that 10 analysts had expected that the firm would post earnings of $1.02 for the period ending on 2016-07-31.  On 2016-08-18, the firm reported actual earnings of $1.07 for fiscal Q2 representing an EPS surprise amount in per share dollar terms of $0.05.  Just prior to the release, analyst’s estimates had a standard deviation of 0.03.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 0.96 for the period closing on 2016-10-31. This is the Zacks Consensus estimate calculated as the arithmetic average of all the individual analyst EPS estimates according to their own proprietary methodology (BNRI Accounting).  Investors are expecting that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) will issue their earnings release on or around 2016-11-17. In comparing the results to the same quarter a year ago, the firm posted earnings of $1.03 for the period which endend on 2015-10-31. Analyst Sentiment Leading up to the next earnings announcements investors should pay close attention to the analysts sentiment on the stock and which direction they are revising their estimates.  Over the past 6 months 5 sell-side analysts have lowered their long term earnings per share estimates on the stock.  During that same period 3 analysts have increased their earnings expectations for the firm.  So what does this mean?  Typically if a large percentage of analysts lower their revisions, the company is more likely to disappoint the Street.  If a large number of brokerage firms increase estimates prior to earnings, the company is more likely to impress with their numbers. Looking ahead to long term projections, Zacks has calculated a long term mean estimate of 3.71.  This is the best estimate for both revenue and earnings over the next three to five years.  Three months ago this number stood at 4.34. Analyst Price Targets Now turning to where analysts believe Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares are headed.  According to the 19 analysts covering the shares, the consensus price target stands at $75.042.  The standard deviation of all estimates is $8.723.  The most aggressive analyst on the name has a price target of $90.  The analyst with the most bearish outlook on the stock has a target price of $50.  The latest analyst revision was recorded on 2016-10-21. Each of the 19 covering analysts have also provided a Buy, Sell or Hold recommendation on the stock.  As of 2016-10-23, 7 have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, 0 have a Buy rating, 9 have a Hold rating and 0 have a Sell or Strong Sell.  Taking a look back three months ago to compare sentiment, at that time 4 had a Strong Buy, 0 had a Buy, 13 had a Hold and 0 had a sell rating.  Zacks breaks all of the recommendations down into a integer based number in order to get an average recommendation rating on the stock.  The scale is on a 1 to 5 basis where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a mean recommendation of 2.58.  In looking at the historical ratings numbers we can see that the stock had a mean rating of 2.75 one month ago, 2.88 two months ago and 2.79 three months ago.    William Abels LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest Netflix Up More Than 3% October 5, 2016 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Closes Fast-Casual Prototypes as Part of “Strategic...

These eight of its largest 20 holdings are beating the market. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Oct 24, 2016 at 7:42PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has led the holding company to outperform the S&P 500 by an average of 11.1% from 1965 through 2015. Just one hundred dollars invested in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth $1.1 million today. Investors can get in on the Oracle of Omaha's stock-picking prowess by buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway or by buying shares of the public companies in its portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, Berkshire held shares of 44 such companies, with only 20 accounting for more than 0.5% of its total stock portfolio.  Buffet is beating the broader market so far in 2016, with Berkshire's Class A shares (the super-pricey ones) and B shares (the ones most investors would buy) up 9.4% and 9.2%, respectively, compared with the S&P 500's 6.2% total return. The following eight of Berkshire's largest 20 public holdings have outperformed the broader market so far in 2016.

Market caps and return data to Oct. 14. * Kraft Heinz began trading on July 6, 2015; it's returned 26.8% since then vs. the S&P 500's 6%. **Visa began trading in March 2008; it's returned 519% since then vs. the S&P 500's 98%.    Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks to avoid First up is Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT). While the discount retailer's financial performance and stock-price performance have perked up in 2016, there's no reason to believe, in my opinion, that the stock will beat the market again over any significant period. Quite simply, Amazon.com has been eating Wal-Mart's lunch, as folks increasingly embrace not only online shopping, but online shopping at Amazon in particular.  For the first six months of calendar year 2016 (Wal-Mart's fiscal 2017), the retailer's revenue edged up 0.7% as reported and 3.4% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, its operating income for this period declined 2.6% as reported and 0.1% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share declined nearly 3%.  For the full year, analysts expect revenue to increase 1%, but adjusted EPS to fall 5.4%.  Most buy-and-hold investors should also pass on agricultural equipment titan Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). Its returns listed in the chart conceal the fact that it's an extremely volatile cyclical stock, meaning its fortunes are largely tied to the macroeconomic environment. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but making money in such stocks even over the long haul depends a lot upon the timing of your buys. In fact, Deere's price is still lower than it was at its all-time high about eight years ago. Moreover, the company continues to struggle -- year-over-year revenue and earnings per share dropped 8% and nearly 25%, respectively, in the first half of 2016 -- because agricultural industry fundamentals remain weak.   Warren Buffett's best-performing stocks worth buying What stocks are worth buying largely depends upon your primary objective. Verizon, IBM, and Kraft Heinz -- with their 4.5%, 3.5%, and 3.3% dividend yields -- are solid choices for income-seeking investors. Visa is an attractive choice for investors most focused on stock-price appreciation. Its recent acquisition of its Visa Europe unit should help bolster its competitive position against MasterCard, while its recent deal with online-payments giant PayPal provides additional growth potential. Under this deal, PayPal will promote Visa as a payment option and stop encouraging customers to link bank accounts rather than using Visa cards as funding choices.  The best buy for most investors from a long-term total return basis (stock-price appreciation + dividend yield), however, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Apple Image source: Apple. Buffet bought an initial stake in Apple in the first quarter and came back for more shares in the second quarter. He obviously saw value in this humongous long-term winner, with its share price down from its all-time high set in early 2015.  Apple's stock is down more than 12% from its all-time high, as of Oct. 21. It had been down even more, but it's had a nice run-up in price over the past quarter thanks largely to posting better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, the positive buzz surrounding last month's launch of the iPhone 7, and rival Samsung's halting production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone earlier this month after several phones overheated and caught on fire. The core reason behind Apple stock's recent struggles is simple: The company's revenue has been declining because quarterly year-over-year sales of the iPhone have been declining -- and the iconic smartphone accounts for about two-thirds of the company's top line. Falling revenue has hurt profit growth, as is typical. With Apple's stock trading at a reasonable 13.1 times forward earnings, there are reasons to believe that the market is providing long-term-focused investors with a buying opportunity. Apple is a company with "innovation" programmed into its genes. Granted, co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs had a huge part in this, but no leader of a company of any significant size is fully responsible for its success. Couple the company's creative chops and cult-like following with its status as a cash-generating machine – it currently has $62.6 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet – and it seems reasonable to assume that the iPhone won't be Apple's last huge winner. Apple's had modest success with its Apple Watch, but the fast-growing wearables category is still relatively new, so there's surely more growth opportunity here. Moreover, Apple is reportedly working on developing technology for a driverless car, and it wouldn't surprise me if it made a big splash in the nascent virtual-reality market in the near future. There will never be a shortage of new technologies ripe for a company like Apple to wrap in consumer-friendly packages to help drive mass consumer adoption, as it did with the smartphone.

Back in my day, we would go to Walmart, pick out a costume from the few choices that were there and call it a day. These days, both adults and children like to dress up in costumes for Halloween. And the planning begins weeks, sometimes months before Halloween. My children start seriously thinking about their costumes in September, although they mention some of their ideas months before that. There’s one thing they know about me when it comes to Halloween costumes — I am anti-mask. I always encourage them to stay away from masks as much as possible, mainly because I remember the masks of my childhood — those ones with the tiny eye holes and nose holes that left you very little room to breathe or see. The ones that smelled strongly of plastic and gave me a headache after five minutes of wearing them. The ones that could instantaneously cause your face to start sweating the second you pulled it on. The ones that were held together with a flimsy rubberband that usually snapped long before your night of candy collection was over. My children insist they don’t mind masks, and they swear masks won’t cause them to not see oncoming cars as they run into the streets on Halloween night. They must get their mask tolerance from their dad because it used to feel like torture to me to have to put those things on when I was their age. I leave their costume choice up to them, but just between you and me, I always show them pictures of mask-less costumes online in the weeks before Halloween. It’s my way of sending subliminal messages to them to choose a costume without a mask. I went 50/50 this year with my anti-mask campaign. My daughter will be Hermoine Granger from the Harry Potter book series. For those not familiar with that series, Hermoine doesn’t wear a mask. But she does have a wizarding robe and a cool magic wand. My son decided to wear a costume with a mask this year, despite the fact that I kept showing him a really cool Indiana Jones costume online. Dr. Jones was his second choice; he ultimately decided to go as Kylo Ren from the Star Wars movies. Kylo Ren wears, you guessed it, a mask. He also carries a light saber, which I’m sure is really the big draw to that costume. What self-respecting 11-year-old boy doesn’t want to carry around a light saber? His friends have all agreed to dress as other Star Wars characters and walk around together when they are out trick or treating. My daughter, of course, wants to tag along with her brother and his friends. This poses a dilemma for me. I’m not comfortable with the idea of my children, at their current ages, wandering all around town, even with a couple of their friends. So many cars are darting around, kids are more worried about their next score than they are about watching traffic, and visibility is awful since it is so dark out, and many of the costumes are black. It can be a dangerous time for kids. I do want my kids to have a taste of independence now and then. This year we’ve reached a compromise. They’ll walk with friends, but one of their friend’s moms (who shares my concerns) and I will follow them around at a respectable distance. They’ll be able to feel like “big kids,” and I won’t be at home worried about their safety all night. It’s a compromise we can all live with. And if they get into a situation they don’t feel comfortable with, I’ll just be a minute away. Who knows? Maybe I’ll even put a costume on, so their friends won’t even know I’m lurking in the background. BCR Copy Editor Shannon Serpette can be reached at sserpette@bcrnews.com.

Image: AP In an attempt to clean up China’s safety scandal-plagued pork industry, Walmart is taking a page out of Bitcoin’s book. The company is partnering with IBM and a local university to develop a pilot program using blockchain technology to track the country’s pork supply for its Chinese stores, the company announced last week. (Hat tip to Coinbase for first reporting on it.) But while making it may improve China’s pork industry in the short term, it could ultimately exacerbate the larger issues with factory farming. “Food authentication and supply chain tracking is a critical step to quickly finding and helping address sources of contamination around the world,” an IBM press release read. “[Blockchain] could serve as an alternative to traditional paper tracking and manual inspection systems, which can leave supply chains vulnerable to inaccuracies.” China’s appetite for pork has spiked over the last decade, and its farming sector has struggled to meet demand. In 2006, the country consumed 46 million metric tons of pork, according to the US Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service. By 2014, it had jumped to 57 million metric tons (it has since dipped a bit, to 55 million in 2015). The added pressure on the food system has led to a bombardment of crises, from pork shortages leading to price hikes, to revelations of diseased meat being sold to consumers. It’s also contributed to the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Not wanting to have to join the likes of McDonald’s—which issued a public apology in 2014 when it discovered a supplier had sold it tainted meat—Walmart is trying to get ahead of the problem with the new pilot. Blockchain technology is essentially a digital ledger that keeps track of information with an unchangeable “block” of information. In this scenario, “farm origination details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, storage temperatures, and shipping details” would be uploaded to the blockchain and linked through a code on the product package, according to IBM. This would directly address, and ideally prevent, some of the problems the pork industry has encountered, like food safety. However it doesn’t address other problems. China has been trying to counteract the rising popularity of more Western meats like pork and beef by pledging to reduce the country’s overall meat consumption by 50 percent by 2030. This is an attempt to curb the farm industry’ impact on antibiotic resistance and climate change. Walmart’s blockchain pilot, if it works as intended, could risk increasing demand as consumer trust in the industry grows. Blockchain may be a good solution for health risks in the short term, but in the long term, experts agree we need to focus on how to curb global meat consumption to a more sustainable level—not make it even easier and cheaper to get pork chops at Walmart.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Credit: Rawpixel Ltd/iStock Marketers are a hardworking bunch, averaging 45.9 hours a week on the job, compared with only 45.1 for their non-marketing counterparts. More than half -- 54% -- take less than 30 minutes a day for lunch, with 30% taking only 15 minutes or less. These data come from project management software company Workfront based on an online survey conducted this summer by Regina Corso Consulting among 606 U.S. adults ages 18 and older employed full or part time at companies with 500 or more employees. The report states that "demands on marketers have only increased in the last year. While the vast majority of marketers express an optimistic view of their work life, troubling trends in the number of hours spent at work and the prevalence of inter-team conflict have arisen." Indeed, 98% of respondents reported experiencing conflict with other teams. Not surprisingly, 29% say blocks of uninterrupted time would help them be more productive. All the more reason to just skip that lunch completely. Here's a well-earned customer reward: In just the latest evidence almost anything can happen at Walmart, shopper Cecilia Rivas made national headlines earlier this month when she gave birth in the checkout line at a Payson, Utah, store. She insisted on paying for her merchandise before the blessed event. Less widely noted, the store invited her back a little over a week later for a surprise baby shower, with gifts that included a stroller, a Graco Pack 'n Play pen, and plenty of diapers and wipes. A Walmart employee who interpreted for Ms. Rivas with Salt Lake City's Fox 13 described her as "surprised but happy." Last month MillerCoors told distributors it would launch a low-cal beer called Goldwing in an apparent attempt to take on hot-selling Michelob Ultra. But Goldwing's wings are being clipped before it even has a chance to fly onto shelves in planned test markets in Texas and Louisiana. In a note to distributors this week, MillerCoors said it was putting the test on hold. "We heard a range of feedback on Goldwing. But one point that came through loud and clear is that what we're doing with Coors Light and Miller Lite is working, so now is not the time to shift focus," stated Chief Marketing Officer David Kroll. "So while Goldwing tested very well with drinkers, we're going to hold off and redirect that planned investment behind Coors Light and Miller Lite." Beer Business Daily gave the move a positive review. "It's a Herculean effort in self-restraint, and I think it will serve them well in the long-term," stated editor Harry Schuhmacher. From beer to water: Pur has launched an online and integrated marketing campaign from Arnold Worldwide showing a "Water Bar" featuring tap water from locales nationwide served up to customers. As each is informed about the contaminants -- all at perfectly legal limits -- in the water, such as mercury, chloroform, and lead, they get turned off and leave. The message from the Helen of Troy brand is that "water that meets safe drinking standards may not meet yours." The idea is to steer people to KnowYourWater.com to find out what lurks in their local supply, and get across the point that Pur removes lead and 70 other contaminants. You want content? Here's some content. Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard has declared something of a war on "crap content" in recent speeches. And that's something this "cleaning dance" video from Pittsburgh Steelers star Antonio Brown for P&G and Rite Aid -- linked to a contest giving away a free trip to Super Bowl LI to a lucky shopper -- clearly is not. The 30-second video can be found on Mr. Brown's Facebook page as well as YouTube. "Dancing while cleaning has long been a universal human behavior," said P&G Brand Manager Eric Rose in a statement. "So we thought it would be fun to reward our most creative shoppers that tackle cleaning in style." The agency behind the effort is Integer, with plans for local TV promotion. Taco Bell's 'Taco Heros' Credit: Taco Bell As Chicago Cubs fans try to forget Tuesday night's 0-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians, Taco Bell gave fans half a reason to celebrate. The Yum Brands chain will give away Doritos Locos tacos after Francisco Lindor of the Indians stole second base during in game one of the World Series. Mr. Lindor is the fifth player to steal a base during the chain's "Steal a Base, Steal a Taco" promotion, which first ran in 2007. He joins Jacoby Ellsbury, Jason Bartlett, Ángel Pagán and Lorenzo Cain in being applauded by the chain as a "Taco Hero." The free tacos, one per person, will be available at participating restaurants from 2-6 p.m. local time on Nov. 2. The offer was mentioned on air during the game on Fox and was promoted by both Taco Bell and Major League Baseball on social media. Blue Bunny is a hit with Cleveland fans. Credit: Courtesy of Blue Bunny Meanwhile, ice cream brand Blue Bunny got in on the giveaway game in its own way Tuesday. With the World Series starting in Cleveland right near the Cleveland Cavaliers making their season debut and commemorating last season's championship, there was plenty for sports fans to celebrate. LeBron James joked days earlier that having an ice cream truck outside of the two arenas would make the night even better. So Blue Bunny sent a truck of ice cream to Cleveland and handed out treats to fans in the area between Progressive Field and the Quicken Loans Arena. Olson Engage was the agency on the project.

Bridge the Gap is a special committee of BEEF that focuses on raising money that directly benefits the instructional needs of the Bixby school district. Courtesy Bridge the Gap With the current state of education funding, a group of Bixby parents decided to take matters into their own hands, forming Bridge the Gap in May. And the Bixby community is showing its appreciation. Since the official formation of Bridge the Gap in May, the nonprofit committee has raised just under $200,000, with all of the money going directly to instructional purposes for all school departments, says Tristy Fryer, Bridge the Gap committee chairman. Bridge the Gap is a special committee of the Bixby Educational Endowment Foundation (BEEF) with its focus on “bridging the gap” between state funding and the financial needs of the Bixby school district. “It was really a leap of faith,” says Fryer, “and we are so grateful to BEEF for allowing us to partner with them.” The committee, made up completely of parent volunteers, had its beginnings in the spring of this year. “We were just disgusted with the lack of funding,” says Fryer, a former Bixby North Elementary teacher who has two children in the district. “We just want to be a voice for all students including those who don’t have someone to be their voice,” she says. “And we want to make sure all Bixby students have the instructional materials they need.” In July, the committee held its first annual charity golf tournament, which raised more than $40,000; “that was our biggest event so far,” Fryer says. She and the rest of the Bridge the Gap committee are hoping to see a similar community response on Jan. 28, when they host the Sparta Gala at the SpiritBank Event Center. The event will include dinner and a live and silent auction. In August, Walmart at 111th Street and Memorial Drive made its show of support for Bixby schools. An effort to solicit donations was made by committee members, who spent a few hours one Saturday asking for school supply donations outside of Walmart. “We probably received about $1,200 worth of supplies that way,” says Fryer. However, later, they received a call from the Walmart management, offering them two truckloads of extra school supplies, including notebooks, pencil cases and backpacks, says Joely Flegler, a Bridge the Gap committee member. Flegler estimates the donation at over $20,000 worth of supplies. As an additional show of support for the school district, on Oct. 8, Flegler opened up her front yard as a craft show venue, with proceeds benefiting Bixby school libraries. Flegler, a mother of three Bixby students, has been holding craft shows in her home for years, she says. But when she realized the needs of the district’s art departments last year, she decided to create an outdoor craft show to give back. Last year’s show featured 17 craft vendors; this year, that number increased to 24. “We had so many vendors this year, the event extended into my neighbor’s yard,” Flegler says. “This is just another example of what makes the Bixby community such an amazing place to live,” Fryer says. “Our parents continue to make Bixby a strong, great community to live in.” Over the summer, Bridge the Gap, with the help of parents, teachers and students, manned a ride at the Green Corn Festival, which earned them $500. “We have had kids set up lemonade stands, teachers make videos to help us raise money,” Fryer says. “We are having to be creative, to hustle, to do whatever we can to raise money for the school system.” Various area businesses, including Hot Coffey Design, Pinot’s Palette, The Vineyard on Memorial, Doc’s Country Mart and T-Town South Fitness, have all held special fundraising events or donated their services to the school district and Bridge the Gap. With the committee’s success in rallying the community, school districts around the state have taken notice. “We often get calls from parents in other districts asking how they can start something like this in their school district,” says Fryer. As for the future, Fryer says that, as long as the budget crisis in education continues in Oklahoma, the goal is to continue fundraising and awareness efforts. “We just have to keep fighting.” Updated 10-26-2016 Back to Top READER COMMENTS Name Remember email (we never post emails) http:// Message   Textile Help Back to Top Contact GTR News Contact GTR News Sections General News Tulsa Weather Columns Civics Economy & Business Variety Dining & Entertainment Fashion Faith Home & Garden Health & Wellness Saluting Our Military Calendar Kudos GTR Puzzles Recipes Education Union Education Jenks Education Broken Arrow Education Tulsa Education Owasso Education Bixby Education Sports Composite Football Schedule Union Sports Jenks Sports Broken Arrow Sports Mid-Town Tulsa Sports Owasso Sports Bixby Sports

Brooks, 54, has compiled a new 10-CD box set, “Garth Brooks: The Ultimate Collection,” that will be available only through Target stores starting Nov. 11 at the eye-opening price of just $29.99. Nine of the discs compile favorite tracks from his back catalog under various themes, including “Old School,” “Cowboys,” “Anthems” and “The Covers.” The box also includes a copy of his new studio album, “Gunslinger,” two weeks before it hits stores everywhere else. Longtime fans probably already own the bulk of the music on “The Ultimate Collection.” After he left his label, Capitol Nashville, in the early ’00s, Brooks regained control of his masters. In 2005, he signed a groundbreaking deal with Walmart, which became the only official place to buy Brooks’ entire back catalog. He ended up issuing several similarly low-priced box sets and collections through Walmart, leading up to his 2014 comeback tour, which filled the Target Center for a record-breaking 11 performances that November.

Surprising, and worth it There are a half dozen previously unreleased tracks sprinkled through the first nine discs of “The Ultimate Collection,” including live duets with Don McLean, Billy Joel and Brooks’ wife, Trisha Yearwood. The box’s version of “Gunslinger” also boasts two songs that won’t be available elsewhere, one of which is the “25th anniversary edition” of his hit “Friends in Low Places,” recorded with guests George Strait, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line and Keith Urban. Brooks has plenty riding on “Gunslinger.” His concerts remain hugely popular with audiences and his current tour passed the two-year mark last month. But his 2014 release, “Man Against Machine,” earned a tepid response from fans and critics and failed to produce any big hit singles. Given Brooks’ famously competitive spirit, you can bet there’s nothing he wants more than to hear his new music in heavy radio rotation. Just in case that’s not enough, Brooks also has a new holiday album coming out on Nov. 11. It’s called “Christmas Together” and it features festive duets with Yearwood. It’ll be available on its own, but Target is giving it away free to those who pre-order it bundled with “The Ultimate Collection” on target.com. MORE MUSIC NEWS The Replacements’ Tommy Stinson is set for a big year in 2017, when he revives his early solo band Bash and Pop for a new album and tour. He has spent the month of October, though, playing small venues across the country as Cowboys in the Campfire, a stripped-down project with Chip “Sippy Fly” Roberts. He promises “all kinds of musical shenanigans in all sorts of places with as few instruments as necessary. We’ll be playing new songs, old songs, maybe even some make-’em-up-on-the-spot songs.” The tour wraps Sunday night with a show at the Triple Rock Social Club. With 35 years spent shooting local concerts, both as a freelancer and official house photographer for First Avenue, Daniel Corrigan has captured images of them all, from Prince and the Replacements to AC/DC and Bruce Springsteen. More than 500 of his images are collected in the new book “Heyday: 35 Years of Music in Minneapolis.” Corrigan and local writer Danny Sigelman, who penned the introductory essay, will be on hand to launch it Friday night at the Entry. The Mighty Mofos, Dosh and Porcupine are set to perform with Lori Barbero and Paper Sleeves spinning between sets. “Heyday” hits stores on Tuesday, and an exhibition of Corrigan’s work opens Nov. 16 with a reception at Mill City Museum. Perhaps you’ve heard we’re about to elect a new president? Congressman Keith Ellison wants to remind you to vote and is hosting a concert Wednesday night at Aria in Minneapolis. The strong local lineup includes Jeremy Messersmith, Dessa, Aby Wolf, Sophia Eris and DJ Shannon Blowtorch. Tickets are $12, see keithellison.org/gotvconcert for further details. Mill City Nights has a similar show booked Nov. 7, the night before the election, featuring hip-hop group Dilated Peoples, St. Paul rapper Allan Kingdom and other local favorites. The $10 tickets are on sale now through axs.com. As part of its ongoing efforts to bring classical music to new venues and audiences, members of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra will headline the Turf Club on Thursday. An eight-musician ensemble is playing Mendelssohn’s Octet for Strings, which the organization describes as “arguably the greatest piece of music ever written by a 16-year-old, and a work of great emotional range and scope.” The $20 tickets include one free drink. In 2011, Colorado jam band Big Head Todd and the Monsters celebrated their love of the blues with “100 Years of Robert Johnson,” an album they recorded with B.B. King, Charlie Musselwhite and other legends under the Big Head Blues Club moniker. They have revived the concept for a new tribute to Willie Dixon that’s due out next year. To preview it, they are touring once again as the Big Head Blues Club, this time joined by three second-generation blues stars, Mud Morganfield, Billy Branch and Ronnie Baker Brooks. They headline the Cedar Cultural Center on Thursday, a rare chance to see the band play such an intimate local venue.

Israel Sampson Edge, 35, who told booking officials he lives at 109 Pineview Drive, was accused of assaulting a woman with a knife shortly before police were called at 12:45 a.m. to the store at 1725 New Hope Church Road. Police spokeswoman Laura Hourigan said there no life-threatening injuries, but officers charged Edge with assault with a dangerous weapon inflicting serious injury and assault on a female. State criminal law does not define “serious.” Police also charged him with carrying a concealed weapon. When officers got Edge to the Wake County Detention Center, they charged him with having oxycodone, cocaine, crack cocaine, MDMA and marijuana inside a jail as well as six pipes used to smoke crack cocaine. They also filed a separate charge of cocaine possession, which is a felony regardless of how much of the drug is involved. The state Department of Public Safety had listed Edge as a parole absconder, and police listed his address in arrest warrants as the state’s Alexander Correctional Facility in Taylorsville. According to state records, Edge was convicted in Wake County in 2003 of robbery with a dangerous weapon, second-degree kidnapping and felony larceny. He was released on parole on July 25. A magistrate ordered Edge held without bond.

Business 'Razor Blade Suicide Wound' makeup is latest 2016 costume to cause furor Ben GuarinoThe Washington Post Until recently, for $3.99 plus shipping, consumers could purchase an item called "Razor Blade Suicide Wound Latex Costume Make Up" from Wal-Mart's online store. It offered exactly what was in the description. Judging by the social media outcry, few people will wear it trick-or-treating this Halloween. The mock gashes simulating a suicide attempt were, according to a Change.org petition that ran over the weekend, "not a joke, not a costume, and not funny." The wound makeup was also indicative of a wider trend of treating mental illness as a scary Halloween curiosity, as The Washington Post reported Tuesday. The retail giant agreed to pull the product. (Victory!, the petition now reads.) "This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace," said Wal-Mart in a statement, according to WABC 7. "It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention." Picking a Halloween costume from the internet is not as easy as it looks. This year, undecided voter Ken Bone — in his cozy red sweater — will probably be an insanely popular choice for those who want a viral costume: It’s timed perfectly for Halloween, it’s simple to put together, and it looks pretty warm. And also, quite a few people will immediately “get” who you are. If you don’t want to be one of several Bones at your Halloween party this year (which we can almost guarantee will be the case), we have a couple of other suggestions for various levels of the meme literate. (Abby Ohlheiser / The Washington Post) Along with collecting candy and carving pumpkins, pointing out racist, offensive or ill-conceived costumes has become something of an annual Halloween tradition. (For a seven-year run, the late website Gawker documented October spikes in blackface.) Colleges and universities have entered the fray this year, cracking down on outfits that stereotyped or sexualized minorities. In early October, the University of Florida sent out a reminder it had a 24-hour phone line for counseling, should anyone be troubled by a costume. The university also issued a warning: "Also, keep in mind that social media posts can have a long-term impact on your personal and professional reputation." That is true even if the costumes are not worn, but discussed. In December 2015, a Yale University lecturer resigned after penning an email in a measured defense of students' choice to wear costumes that were "a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive." Home Depot pulls 'peeping Tom' Halloween decoration after Toronto mom's complaint Amy B. Wang With its leering eyes, furrowed brow and hands cupped around a pockmarked face, there is no mistaking what the "Scary Peeper Creeper" is meant to imitate: the head of a "peeping Tom" looking in through a window. "Perfect for scaring friends and family during Halloween or any other time of the year,"... With its leering eyes, furrowed brow and hands cupped around a pockmarked face, there is no mistaking what the "Scary Peeper Creeper" is meant to imitate: the head of a "peeping Tom" looking in through a window. "Perfect for scaring friends and family during Halloween or any other time of the year,"... (Amy B. Wang) More recently, Brock University in Ontario, Canada, issued a costume protocol for its annual Halloween party. The guidelines, according to the Brock University website, were designed to pay respect to "stories and experiences of marginalized groups." Outfits barred from the party included religious headdresses, Day of the Dead makeup or "any costume of Caitlyn Jenner." The shortlist of controversial costumes in 2016: Clowns. In Mississippi's Kemper County, wearing a clown costume will carry a $150 fine until Nov. 1, thanks to an ordinance approved in mid-October by the Kemper County Board of Supervisors. New York American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Rowland disagreed with the Mississippi county's prohibition, arguing that most outfits were protected as speech under the First Amendment. It was "a ridiculous use of government authority," Rowland told the AP, "to dictate which Halloween costumes people can wear." The county joined several high schools and school districts around the country, from California to New Jersey, that have banned clown costumes following the wave of "creepy clown" sightings. Maui from Disney's "Moana." The Polynesian demigod Maui, who will be played by Dwayne Johnson in the upcoming animated movie "Moana," was depicted in a costume released by Disney in September. The costume, a full-body suit that included tribal tattoos and fake brown skin, was met with derision and anger on social media, as The Post reported. (At least one person compared it with the suit of human skin from the horror movie "Silence of the Lambs.") Disney stopped selling the Maui costume just a few days later, telling CNN in a statement, "The team behind Moana has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some." Kidnapped Kim Kardashian. In the wake of a robbery at gunpoint at the beginning of October, the normally prolific social media star Kim Kardashian went quiet. That did not stop costume retailer Costumeish.com from offering, euphemistically and fleetingly, the $69.99 "Parisian Heist Robbery Victim Costume Kit." The costume, which included a mouth gag and black wig, was removed from the Web store on Oct. 11. Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Halloween Dwayne Johnson Yale University Crying inside?

Investor confidence in riskier assets has dipped somewhat, as oil prices fell further by more than one percent on concerns about a global supply glut, and Apple Inc. posted its third successive quarter of declining iPhone sales. Yuan worries receded to a certain extent as China's central bank fixed the yuan's daily midpoint at a stronger level for the first time in four days. The dollar retreated from near nine-month high, giving emerging market currencies some reprieve. Apple stock fell in after-hours trading Tuesday after a mixed earnings report. Its earnings per share beat expectations while revenue came in line with estimates on lower sales of its flagship iPhones. Chipotle shares also fell in extended trading after its sales declined sharply for the fourth straight quarter. Meanwhile, Twitter shares rose after reports that Walt Disney is once again interested in buying the struggling social network. Boeing, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Hilton Hotels, Southwest Air, Tesla Motors, Buffalo wild Wings and Cheesecake Factory are among the prominent companies due to unveil their earnings cards later in the day. Biopharmaceutical company OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced positive survival results from the Phase 2 Borealis-2 trial of apatorsen in Metastatic Bladder Cancer. Brown & Brown, Inc. announced that it has received a temporary injunction against certain former employees of Brown & Brown and their new employer, AssuredPartners, Inc. MoneyGram launched a new cross border money transfer product for Walmart customers sending from any U.S. Walmart location to any Walmart Mexico location. Google parent Alphabet announced that it would suspend plans to expand its fiber networks business and lay off 9 percent of the division's staff amid mounting costs and missed subscriber goals. Elsewhere, most Asian stocks fell as oil prices retreated and a big rise in Australian inflation weakened the case for a surprise November rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia. The major European averages are currently down about 1 percent as investors digest a slew of mixed earnings reports. German consumer sentiment lost some steam heading into November because of the "increasingly difficult" external trade environment and the perceived rising risk of terrorism in Germany, a monthly report from market research firm GfK showed today. On the other hand, a gauge of French consumer confidence improved as expected in October. U.S. advance goods trade balance figures for September, wholesale inventories numbers for September, Markit's U.S. flash PMI report for October, U.S. home sales data for September and U.S. crude oil inventories data are set to be published in the New York session. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday in reaction to disappointing earnings reports from the likes of 3M and Caterpillar, weaker oil prices and sluggish consumer confidence data.

But, a strong U.S. dollar hurt international operations. Shartia Brantley reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Increased store traffic helped Wal-Mart post better than expected earnings. The world's largest retailer posted its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, which rose by 1.5 percent. The company reported earnings per share of $0.99. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting $0.98. But headwinds remain for its roughly 4,600 stores. It's consolidated revenue declined as international operations have been hurt by a strong U.S. dollar. And Wal-Mart said that it expects growth to slow to one percent at stores open more than a year during the current holiday quarter amid a competitive environment. Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure from costs associated with e-commerce, store remodeling and increased employee wages. The company says these investments have generated more sales and better customer service. Shares were up in early trading.

Several shoppers noticed the 'razor blade suicide scar wound latex costume make up' kit online for $3.99 and reached out to the retailer on social media. An online petition was started, but was discontinued after the retailer pulled the item from its website. Walmart pulled the costume from its website and issued a statement, 'This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.'

The mixed-use centre comprises a new Walmart Supercentre, a Home Depot and a number of national retailers such as Dollarama, L'Equipeur (a Canadian Tire banner), and TD Canada Trust, along with a number of food and service offerings. The 382,000 square foot mixed-use centre is 99% leased and incorporates a fully leased 62,000 square foot six-storey office building. "The high quality tenant base and the centre's dominance in its urban market fits very well with SmartREIT's existing retail portfolio," noted Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT. "The total purchase price of approximately $62 million will be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing first mortgage providing solid FFO accretion to the REIT," Thomas added. The City of Pointe Claire, located on Montreal's West Island, has a thriving population base with strong demographics and household income. "We have the potential to add additional density to this centre which fits perfectly with our strategy to intensify our portfolio with additional retail as well as residential, seniors' housing, and even storage in selected locations, expanding each centre's offering to meet the needs of its community. By leveraging the capabilities of our extensive development platform, we are now working on adding value to a number of our existing retail sites as well as developing major urban mixed-use projects such as the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre," further added Thomas. About SmartREIT SmartREIT is one of Canada's largest real estate investment trusts with total assets in excess of $8.6 billion. It owns and manages in excess of 31 million square feet in value-oriented, principally Walmart-anchored retail centres, having the strongest national and regional retailers as well as strong neighbourhood merchants. In addition, SmartREIT is a joint-venture partner in the Toronto and Montreal Premium Outlets with Simon Property Group. SmartREIT's core vision is to provide a value-oriented shopping experience in all forms to Canadian consumers and to create high quality mixed use developments in urban settings. With SmartREIT's 2015 acquisition of SmartCentres, SmartREIT has transformed into a fully integrated real estate provider. SmartREIT and SmartCentres have had a long and successful alliance, helping to provide Canadians with value-focused retail shopping centres across the country. Now, the alliance has grown even stronger, the result is a fully integrated real estate provider with expertise in planning, development, leasing, operations and construction - all under one roof.

The mixed-use centre comprises a new Walmart Supercentre, a Home Depot and a number of national retailers such as Dollarama, L'Equipeur (a Canadian Tire banner), and TD Canada Trust, along with a number of food and service offerings. The 382,000 square foot mixed-use centre is 99% leased and incorporates a fully leased 62,000 square foot six-storey office building. "The high quality tenant base and the centre's dominance in its urban market fits very well with SmartREIT's existing retail portfolio," noted Huw Thomas, CEO of SmartREIT. "The total purchase price of approximately $62 million will be funded by existing cash and the assumption of an existing first mortgage providing solid FFO accretion to the REIT," Thomas added. The City of Pointe Claire, located on Montreal's West Island, has a thriving population base with strong demographics and household income. "We have the potential to add additional density to this centre which fits perfectly with our strategy to intensify our portfolio with additional retail as well as residential, seniors' housing, and even storage in selected locations, expanding each centre's offering to meet the needs of its community. By leveraging the capabilities of our extensive development platform, we are now working on adding value to a number of our existing retail sites as well as developing major urban mixed-use projects such as the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre," further added Thomas. About SmartREIT SmartREIT is one of Canada's largest real estate investment trusts with total assets in excess of $8.6 billion. It owns and manages in excess of 31 million square feet in value-oriented, principally Walmart-anchored retail centres, having the strongest national and regional retailers as well as strong neighbourhood merchants. In addition, SmartREIT is a joint-venture partner in the Toronto and Montreal Premium Outlets with Simon Property Group. SmartREIT's core vision is to provide a value-oriented shopping experience in all forms to Canadian consumers and to create high quality mixed use developments in urban settings. With SmartREIT's 2015 acquisition of SmartCentres, SmartREIT has transformed into a fully integrated real estate provider. SmartREIT and SmartCentres have had a long and successful alliance, helping to provide Canadians with value-focused retail shopping centres across the country. Now, the alliance has grown even stronger, the result is a fully integrated real estate provider with expertise in planning, development, leasing, operations and construction - all under one roof.

Pharmacy Locations, through County Law Enforcement - - Focus on Safe Drug Disposal Helps Combat Opioid Abuse, Misuse and Diversion - News provided by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Oct 25, 2016, 16:55 ET Share this article CHESTERFIELD, England, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it will provide more than 60,000 drug deactivation pouches to families in West Virginia to encourage the safe and responsible disposal of leftover prescription pain medications. Mallinckrodt purchased and donated 55,000 pouches as part of a statewide initiative announced today by U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). Each of the state's 55 counties will receive 1,000 pouches for their residents. Sen. Manchin's office will work with each county sheriff's office and local law enforcement, drug prevention coalitions and senior centers to distribute the pouches free of charge. Mallinckrodt also is making the pouches available at Walmart store pharmacy locations across the state. The user-friendly pouch-based systems deactivate prescription drugs and render chemical compounds safe for landfills. After placing unused medications in the specially formulated pouch and adding regular tap water, the pouch can be sealed and thrown away with the household trash. The pouches are completely biodegradable, providing an environmentally responsible way to deactivate and dispose of drugs. These donations are part of Mallinckrodt's 1-million pouch donation initiative to help combat the abuse of prescription pain medications, which is one of the top public health threats in the U.S. today. "As a company focused on the health and well-being of our patients and communities, Mallinckrodt has long been a strong advocate of addressing the complex issues of opioid misuse and abuse that cause so much harm to families," said Mark Trudeau, Mallinckrodt President and Chief Executive Officer. "We share the concerns of parents across the nation, and believe that providing patients with a safe, environmentally responsible way to dispose of unused medications is critical in this fight against prescription drug abuse," added Trudeau. "Mallinckrodt is committed to working with policy makers, community leaders, law enforcement and industry partners to ensure the responsible use of pain medication and prevent unused medications from ending up in the wrong hands." The initiative reinforces Mallinckrodt's long-standing commitment to the safe and responsible use of medications and collaboration with community leaders and organizations who share its goal of building public awareness of the critical role of responsible drug disposal in the fight against prescription drug abuse. A national survey of U.S. adults who used opioids showed that nearly 6 out of 10 had or expect to have leftover opioids, according to findings published online June 13, 2016, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal. Nearly 68 percent of those who used prescription pain relievers non-medically in 2012-2013 got them from friends or relatives, according to the 2013 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY Mexico's Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX), the country's biggest retailer, posted a 69.7 percent rise in third-quarter net profit on Tuesday, helped by stronger sales and its divestment of a clothing chain. The company reported net profit of 10.050 billion pesos ($519 million) in the July-September period, up from 5.921 billion pesos in the same period a year prior. Third-quarter revenue at Walmex was 126.863 billion pesos, 10.8 percent higher than the year-earlier period. Quarterly net profit was above expectations of 6.517 billion pesos predicted in a Reuters poll of seven analysts. During the quarter, the retailer reached an agreement to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool (LIVEPOLC1.MX) for about $852 million.

Nokia says telecoms gear market tough, but outpacing Ericsson BARCELONA/HELSINKI Nokia said on Tuesday it was outperforming arch-rival Ericsson in a weak telecoms equipment market, but its shares fell as its dividend plans and profitability forecasts missed analysts' expectations.

October 25, 2016 Recycling Today Staff Subscribe Municipal / IC&I The How2Recycle Label has jumped in membership numbers, which it credits to the support of retailer Wal-Mart, which has encouraged its private label suppliers to use labeling that helps consumers understand how to recycle products. By joining How2Recycle, suppliers can use the program's on-package recycling label to communicate to consumers how to recycle various types of packaging. Jack Pestello, senior vice president, private brands, Wal-Mart U.S., says, "We believe a best practice is to use labeling that helps customers recycle, such as the How2Recycle label, to communicate the recyclability of a package. The How2Recycle label is also a great conversational tool between merchants and suppliers to discuss if a package is designed with recyclability in mind." The How2Recycle Label now has more than 55 members. Consumers should expect to see the label on select Great Value and Equate products at Wal-Mart in the coming months. "We cannot understate the importance of the support of retailers like Wal-Mart in the How2Recycle program, who are leveraging their influence in the supply chain to make a true difference to support the accuracy of recycling claims," says Kelly Cramer, senior manager at Sustainable Packaging Coalition, the organization behind the How2Recycle Label program. "We very much look forward to welcoming more suppliers to How2Recycle in the near future." The Sustainable Packaging Coalition is a project of GreenBlue, based in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Education Related Effort to standardize Rhode Island’s recycling bins expands Himes to host free technician training class Orange County, Florida, launches recycling education campaign Most Shared Recon Services to install Zenrobotics system in its C&D facility Seattle composting facility accepts compostable coffee pods Tomra launches loyalty program in Michigan supermarkets Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Launched in April, the new beverages are lightly flavored and, unlike other Sparkling Ice products, contain no sweeteners, artificial colors or preservatives. The essence line is currently distributed regionally at major grocery and mass channel retailers, including Walmart, Kroger, Stop and Shop, Publix and Target. In an email to BevNET, Talking Rain CEO Kevin Klock said that after six months on the market, the essence line is “off to a solid start” and performing “well enough” to launch nationally in 2017. As the essence line picks up new distribution, Talking Rain will focus on marketing initiatives intended to drive awareness of the products and how they are different from not only from competing carbonated water brands, but also other Sparkling Ice drinks, as well. Right now, the essence waters are packaged in the same 17 oz. slim plastic bottle used across the Sparking Ice portfolio, which includes iced teas and lemonades. However, the product lines look quite similar and merchandising them alongside each other might cause some customer confusion. It’s one of the reasons that Talking Rain is having “ongoing discussions” about new label and bottle options for the essence water line, according to Nina Morrison, Talking Rain’s vice president of community and customer relations. Brand-building aside, Klock said that an increasingly competitive pricing landscape for sparkling water, especially for multi-packs, represents the biggest challenge for the essence line. “Competition is $3.99 in a 15-pack of cans and private label is selling as low as $1.99 for a 12-pack,” Klock said. “It’s always been a commodity category.” Nevertheless, Talking Rain views an opportunity for Sparkling Ice essence to gain traction with sparkling water consumers because it comes in a resealable package. BevNET spoke with several Talking Rain executives at the NACS 2016 show, who pointed to the brand’s screw cap bottle as an advantage to can-packaged waters, particularly for single-serve sales. Sparkling Ice essence waters are also being positioned as complementary products to the brand’s flagship drinks, according to Talking Rain’s vice president of sales Chris Hall. It’s a strategy grounded in company research which found that current customers of Sparkling Ice’s primary line are also buying essence waters. As Talking Rain looks to 2017, the company is preparing for a “big splash” in messaging and new marketing campaign that cuts across the entire Sparkling Ice portfolio, one that comes with a $20 million budget for media buys. Newly installed CMO Brian Kuz said next year’s marketing efforts will be “a little bit louder” and supported by a new advertising agency, Seattle-based Wexley School for Girls. Kuz, the former Global Head of Trade Marketing and Insights at Red Bull, sees an opportunity for Sparkling Ice to one day become synonymous with sparkling water beverages, one that begins with developing a strong consumer connection to the brand. “A true, trusted, loved brand proposition — you will see it next year with the new campaign,” Kuz said.

Featherstone Benjamin J. Selig John Collins Terre Haute, Ind (WIBQ)  -  Terre Haute police are investigating the death of a local Terre Haute radio personality. Around 11 a.m. Monday Terre Haute City Police were called to 5362 Jackboot Court in the Village Quarter Apartment complex for a well being check.  Police found the body of Matt Luecking in a bedroom of the apartment.  Investigators believe that Leucking was beaten with a baseball bat while in bed. An autopsy is being conducted today. It is unclear what the connection between the suspects and Luecking maybe. Officers say that the Luecking’s vehicle could not be found. Within an hour of arriving on scene officers were informed that two males had used Lueckings credit card and identification to charge purchases at the Clinton Walmart. Walmart employees became suspicious after one of the males appeared to be looking at the identification in order to sign for the charge.  When confronted, the two males fled the store leaving behind the bank card and identification belonging Luecking.  Store employees obtained the license plate number of their vehicle and provided it to police along with security video. Officers traced the plate to 3652 Walker Ramp Road in Rockville, and that is where detectives found the suspects loading bags containing personal items into Luecking's car. Police arrested 24 year old John Collins of Terre Haute on a preliminary charge of murder. Police later arrested 28 year old Benjamin J. Selig of Rockville on a preliminary charge of Assisting a Criminal. Officers have also arrested 25 year old Kathleen E. Featherstone of Terre Haute on Felony Murder, Robbery, and Burglary charges. She has been arrested before in connection to an allgeded attack on a woman in 2014 in Linton. For previous coverage of that story click here.

Walmart Pulls “Suicide Scar” Halloween Costume Makeup Kit Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Pulls “Suicide Scar” Halloween Costume Makeup Kit Image courtesy of @Migdalia_Rivera October 25, 2016 10:26 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Too Real walmart halloween costumes inappropriate makeup kit removing the product third-party seller Already this fall, several retailers have pulled Halloween decorations and costumes from their shelves and online stores because they were too dangerous, too creepy, or could be used to further a rash of suspicious incidents involving people dressed as clowns. Now, Walmart is joining those ranks: the retailer is removing what it calls an inappropriate “suicide scar” costume makeup kit.  WABC in New York reports that Walmart pulled the “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Makeup” kit from its website after it drew the ire of health advocates and customers who called the costume insensitive to mental illness and glorifying self-harm. The retailer says that the product, which was sold for $3.99 online, was offered by a third-party company and was not actually from the retailer. “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention,” the company said in a statement. Before Walmart pulled the kit, customers shared their outrage over the inappropriate costume on social media and through a petition on Change.org. “Strong enough words do not exist to describe how horribly wrong this is,” one person posted on the petition, which has since been taken down. “I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner and know how damaging exposure to this could be. This shows an absolute lack of sensitivity and empathy for people affected by mental illness. I am absolutely appalled,” another petition signer said. Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone.

(CBC) Related Stories Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste How you can cut waste, save money and eat well CBC Marketplace Coming soon to a grocery store near you: ugly food, to save you money Got Mason jars? More grocery stores encourage 'bring you own container' initiatives 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste 'Astronomical' amount of food could be going to food banks, says farmer Doughnuts and pastries. Stalks of still-crunchy celery. Bags of bright, plump oranges. It sounds like a shopping list, but it was all in Walmart's garbage. CBC's Marketplace went through trash bins at two Walmart stores near Toronto to see how much food the company throws away. Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Over the course of more than 12 visits to the stores, Marketplace staff repeatedly found produce, baked goods, frozen foods, meat and dairy products. Most of the food was still in its packaging, rather than separated for composting. Also in the garbage: bottles of water, frozen cherries that were still cold and tubs of margarine. Watch the Marketplace investigation on food waste online In a statement, Walmart said it believes the food Marketplace found was unsafe for consumption. In many cases, however, the food was well before its best-before date and appeared to be fresh. Or, if it needed refrigeration or freezing, the food found was still cold. What's in Walmart's garbage1:04 Marketplace staff looked for food waste at all the major retailers, including Costco, Metro, Sobeys, Loblaws and Walmart. While staffers found bins full of food at some Walmart locations, other chains had compactors making it impossible to see what they throw out. Marketplace found cartons of milk days ahead of their best-before date, and Parmesan cheese with months left before it needed to be thrown away. On one trip, Marketplace staff found 12 waist-high bins full of food. After Walmart was contacted, it locked up the bins behind the stores where the food was found. These bags of oranges were found in a Walmart Canada garbage bin on one of 12 trips to a Toronto-area store. (CBC) Ali-Zain Mevawala says he threw out a shopping cart full of produce every day when he managed a Walmart produce and bakery department. Mevawala, formerly with one of the company's Edmonton stores, says if a piece of fruit or vegetable didn't look perfect, it had to be thrown in the trash. "I really felt bad because I know a lot of people in the city or in this country, even in this whole world, they don't even get to eat proper food." 'What's wrong with all those bags of oranges?' Food waste is a worldwide issue. In Canada, a study from Value Chain Management International says across sectors, including at the farm, during processing, in retail stores, restaurants and in homes, $31 billion worth of food is wasted each year. Retailers are responsible for about 10 per cent of that waste, according to the 2014 study. Ali-Zain Mevawala says he threw out a shopping cart full of produce every day when working as a produce and bakery department manager at a Walmart store in Edmonton. (CBC) One of the report's authors says retailers are just doing what buyers expect. "Much of that waste is usually us not willing to buy products that have a blemish in them," says Martin Gooch, CEO of Value Chain Management International. There are challenges in donating food, including location. It's easier to redistribute food in Toronto than in smaller communities, he says. He adds that retailers are working to address in-store processes and training so waste is reduced. Despite laws preventing companies that donate food from being prosecuted if someone gets sick, a key challenge is public opinion, should something happen, says Gooch. CBC Marketplace went through trash bins at two Walmart stores near Toronto to see how much food the company throws away. (CBC) "Someone who'd gotten sick from a product that was donated, that would create a whole bunch of attention … which a retailer or manufacturer has no way of combating." After viewing Marketplace footage, Gooch says the amount of food waste discovered demonstrated there is "room for improvement." "What's wrong with all those bags of oranges?" he said. Gooch did say some of the items Marketplace uncovered, such as bagged salad, could be unsafe if they had passed their "use by" date. Walmart responds Walmart declined an on-camera interview with Marketplace, but the company sent a statement that said it has many initiatives to decrease food waste throughout the company, including giving unsold food to food banks. After Marketplace contacted Walmart, the company locked up the bins behind the stores where the food was found. (CBC) "On some occasions, food which has not passed its best-before date is deemed unsafe for consumption," Walmart said in its statement. "As a rule we don't place fresh food items on display for sale if the quality is not acceptable." Some of the products may have been returns, the company said. Mevawala says he was given a different reason for the waste when he worked at Walmart. "Once I asked my manager, 'Why do we have to just throw it away? Why can't we just, you know, give it away to some people that really need it?'" he says. "And the manager [said], 'If you just give it away to people, then why are they going to buy it from us?'" Walmart Canada says Mevawala's claim doesn't reflect its approach to food waste.

And while there are many benefits to eating organic foods, the biggest downside is often the cost. According to Consumer Reports, organic foods are 47 percent more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Organic foods are usually pricier because of costs that go into getting certified and maintaining organic farming practices. Not only does it take more time to raise food in this way, but farmers can’t cut corners by using pesticides to kill overgrown weeds or control infestations. Moreover, organic foods spoil faster because they aren’t treated with waxes or preservatives, so farmers have to absorb greater losses. While some organic produce is safer than its non-organic counterparts, that isn’t the case for all your favorite fruits and vegetables. So, before you blow this month’s grocery budget, check out these organic foods that aren’t worth their organic price tags. Vacilando / Shutterstock.com 1. Fruits With Inedible Peels When it comes to fruits with inedible peels — like avocados, oranges, melons, bananas, mangoes, pineapples and kiwis — you don’t have to buy organic to indulge. While fruits with soft or edible peels should always be organic, it’s generally safe to eat non-organic fruits with inedible peels, because pesticides usually don’t get transferred to the fruit inside. The biggest difference between organic and non-organic avocadoes are the prices: Organic avocados cost about 30 cents more per pound. Additionally, organic cantaloupe is about 50 cents more per pound, and bananas are about 10 cents more. While it’s okay to buy the conventional versions of these fruits, you should still wash the peels before cutting into them to avoid transferring potentially harmful residues that can linger on the outside.

Just like fruits with inedible peels, vegetables with thick skins don’t absorb as many pesticides. Additionally, people remove many of the “dirty” layers before consuming the produce. Layers of onion and cabbage have to be peeled away before the veggies are cooked and consumed; sweet corn needs to be husked; sweet peas must be shelled; and eggplant has a tough exterior that needs to be cooked down to consume. Carrots even make the list of safe veggies, if you take the time to peel the skins, where pesticide residue can linger. On the other hand, experts advise eating organic versions of vegetables without peels, as well as those with soft exteriors. Many of these foods are listed on the Environmental Working Group’s 2016 “Dirty Dozen” list, which includes celery, spinach, sweet bell peppers, cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Along with being safe to eat, non-organic vegetables with thick skins are significantly cheaper than their organic counterparts. For example, organic sweet corn costs anywhere from 10 percent to 200 percent more than the conventional variety. Find Out: The Ultimate $100 Dinner Party Menu Elena Schweitzer / Shutterstock.com 3. Quinoa Once a niche ingredient, quinoa has become a popular source of protein. However, you don’t need to buy organic quinoa to partake. Because quinoa has a natural coating that tastes bitter to pests, farmers don’t need to spray this crop with pesticides. Most quinoa packagers remove the coating during production, but it’s wise to give the grain another rinse before you cook it. Non-organic and organic quinoa have the same nutritional profiles; it’s actually the color that makes the difference. While red and white quinoa have similar calorie counts, vitamins and minerals, red quinoa is a better source of riboflavin — it has a whopping 15 percent of the daily value per serving, based off a 2,000 calorie diet. The cost of quinoa, organic or not, has skyrocketed in recent years due to limited supply from importers, according to the Washington Post. Currently, Eden Organic red quinoa costs $12.59 a pound, while regular red quinoa from Roland is about $9 a pound. Since this is one of the foods you don’t need to buy organic, you can enjoy significant savings — and health benefits. showcake / Shutterstock.com 4. Maple Syrup Organic and regular maple syrup are produced in basically the same way and usually don’t require pesticides or fertilizers. Both non-organic and organic maple syrup producers are required to have state licenses and be inspected by the USDA. Currently, a 25-ounce container of organic Crown Maple Syrup costs nearly $38, while the same amount of MacDonald’s Maple Syrup is about $16. That’s a $22 difference. Because there is little nutritional value in buying organic, maple syrup lovers should consider saving their money.

Seafood If you see organic seafood for sale, be wary — there are no federal regulations that make seafood organic. And since organic seafood isn’t regulated, that means it might not have been tested for toxicity. Hence, you’re paying a pretty penny for a potentially false claim. Labeling farm-raised seafood as wild-caught is an issue that dates back at least a decade. In 2005, the New York Times ran a story revealing that fish sold as wild salmon by several high-end New York City markets was actually farm-raised and selling for as much as $29 a pound, while actual farmed salmon sold for $5 to $12 a pound. The USDA is working to create guidelines that would allow for the sale of certified organic seafood, but that could be a few years away. For now, if you want to eat seafood that’s safe for you and your family, look for varieties that are low in mercury, such as salmon, trout and catfish, and focus on buying seafood that’s caught using sustainable practices. siambizkit / Shutterstock.com 6. Eggs Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to buy organic eggs to enjoy food that’s free of hormones. Unlike other farm-raised animal products, like dairy, beef and lamb, it’s illegal to give hormones to chickens. Experts disagree on whether factory eggs have a higher risk of salmonella contamination than the farm variety. Currently, hens that lay organic eggs must be free range, which means they are not housed in cages and have access to the outdoors. Additionally, they must be fed an organic diet and receive no antibiotics. When it comes to nutritional value, it’s actually the hen’s diet that matters most — not its organic status. Instead of paying for organic eggs, look for eggs that have high levels of omega-3s, a status that comes from improving a hen’s diet and increasing time spent outdoors. Buying conventional eggs will also help you save at the grocery store. Organic eggs run about $6 a dozen, while non-organic options are about $3 a dozen. Andrii Gorulko / Shutterstock.com 7. Spices Think twice about paying double for those organic spices. One of the world’s most expensive spices, saffron is more expensive per ounce than gold. And when it goes organic, the price skyrockets. Compared to regular saffron, which runs about $1,000 per pound, organic saffron costs a budget-busting $3,100 a pound. Since you’re not liable to eat a lot of saffron, the risks in eating the non-organic version is minimal. Other common spices are more affordable than saffron, but the organic label will still set you back. Simply Organic Grind to a Salt is about $10 for 5 ounces. Morton salt, meanwhile, costs less than a dollar for 26 ounces. And Simply Organic garlic powder is about $4.75 for just over 3.6 ounces, while McCormick garlic powder is only $3 for just over 3 ounces. Moreover, NPR reported that organic spices can actually be unsafe for consumers. In 2012, a number of large grocery retailers recalled organic celery seed because a batch tested positive for salmonella. It’s not uncommon for organic spices to become contaminated with bacteria and insects because, in order to comply with organic standards, they aren’t treated with radiation to kill pests. Even if you buy regular spices instead of organic ones, you might spend a pretty penny for just a tiny jar. To save money stocking your spice cabinet, experts recommend grinding spices up yourself.

She is especially disturbed because she says her uncle died from suicide by hanging.  She says years later a friend and co-worker died the same way.  She believes the product trivializes the pain of losing a friend to suicide. Boland said every time she sees the ad, “I see my late uncle. I see one of my best friends I worked with.” We invited Walmart to comment on Boland’s concerns, but have not received a response.  The product was available on line as of early Monday evening, however late Monday evening a link to the product was no longer working.  It’s not clear if that’s the result of a technical glitch or if the product is no longer available. 38.701439 -90.148720 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Watch KPLR right now!

Alexandra Avila’s co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an “illegal immigrant” even though she’s a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed this week in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila’s computer’s screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: “How’s Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.” The Republican presidential candidate’s promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump’s campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. “It’s been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,” said Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler. “His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn’t violate social norms anymore.” Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump’s 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: “Found Jesus — he stabbed me twice.” When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an “illegal immigrant,” drawing laughter from Avila’s boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying timecards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her “La Trumpa” and added: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” “Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience,” Fiedler says. After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned. Alexandra Avila Ryan J.

Parker, a former truck driver for Crete Carrier, has filed a petition for an “en banc” review in a lawsuit that accuses his former employer of discriminating against him because of his size. Earlier this month, an appeals court ruled that Crete had the legal right to suspend a driver after he refused to undergo testing to see if he suffered from obstructive sleep apnea. An en banc review, which is a case that is heard before all of the judges of the court rather than by a panel of judges, is typically used for unusually complex cases. In the petition filed on Oct. 24 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, Parker’s attorney, Joy Shiffermiller, says the appeals panel incorrectly found that the Americans with Disabilities Act permits employers to require a class of employees to get medical exams and that it improperly relied on Medical Review Board recommendations to make the judgment. The petition cited five cases – Cossett v. Minnesota Power & Light (8th Cir. 1999); Wisbey v. City of Lincoln, Nebraska (8th Cir. 2010); E.E.O.C. v. Wal-Mart Stores (8th Cir. 2007); Hawkins v. Anheuser-Busch (8th Cir. 1983); and Kirby v. Colony Furniture Co. (8th Cir. 1980) – that Parker’s counsel believes to be in conflict with the recent appeals court decision. Parker also argues that the panel incorrectly applied the case, Conroy v. New York State Department. of Correctional Services (2nd Cir. 2003). “The Panel misapplied the Conroy case and erroneously found that an employer can require a medical exam from a class of employees despite no individualized evidence of business necessity,” the petition stated. In July 2013, Crete told Parker that it was scheduling him for an in-lab sleep study because of his size. Crete required sleep studies for drivers with a body mass index of 35 or more. Parker’s most recent Department of Transportation physical at the time listed his BMI as above 35. According to court documents, Parker was 6-foot-5 and 311 pounds, which equated to a BMI of 36.9. Parker responded by visiting a certified physician’s assistant, who wrote a prescription stating, “I do not feel it is medically necessary for Robert to have a sleep study.” Despite the note, Crete responded by taking Parker out of service. Parker, who started working for Crete in 2006, continued to refuse to undergo Crete’s sleep study. He alleged that the request violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, noting that he had no documented sleep issues and that he had been recognized for his accident-free record. “Parker has not had any medical incident which required sleep apnea testing, or testing for any other sleep disorders,” the petition stated. Parker contends that he passed medical examinations in 2012 and 2014 and that neither exam indicated concerns of respiratory dysfunction or of his ability to safely drive a commercial truck. “Crete cannot by law require the sleep study without showing it was necessary,” the petition stated. “Further, Parker presented the credible medical documentation indicating that there was no medical necessity for a sleep study, which was ignored by the Appellee.” Citing the Conroy case, the appeals court said Crete satisfied the burden of showing a reasonable basis for concluding that the class poses a genuine safety risk, and the exam requirement allows the employer to decrease that risk effectively. “The Panel’s reasoning is flawed for a couple of reasons,” Shiffermiller wrote. “First, the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act permits exams for all new hires is not persuasive, because the Americans with Disabilities Act permits a post hire pre-employment physical, as indicated, but specifically prohibits medical examinations and inquiries of existing employees. “On behalf of Parker, I would submit the statute actually mandates an individualized inquiry and not an assumption that all truck drivers with a BMI over any specified level should submit to a sleep study or be presumed to be incapable of safe driving, despite all evidence to the contrary. It is submitted that to adopt the Appellee’s position flies in the face of the statutory language and the body of case law requiring individualized direct threat evidence.” Parker’s counsel also argued that the panel shouldn’t have used the Medical Review Board’s draft recommendations as a basis for its decision without citation by either party nor any opportunity for comment.

We also take a look at Costco following its break-up with American Express. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 26, 2016 at 5:25PM Many investors were bearish on Costco (NASDAQ:COST) as the wholesale retailer made its transition from American Express to Visa. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen and Fool.com contributor Dan Kline talk about how the company managed to make the switch with just a few minor stumbles, as they focus on the more pressing challenges the company is going to have to address in the next few years. The team also dives into Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) buyout by Bass Pro Shops. Find out why the outdoor sports giants are banding together, details behind the deal, and what this will mean for the combined entity going forward. A full transcript follows the video.

It is Tuesday, Oct. 11, and I am joined via Skype by Fool.com contributor Daniel Kline, who is beaming in from an area of the country that has been in the headlines quite a bit recently -- that's West Palm Beach in South Florida. How are you doing, Dan? Dan Kline: I'm happy to say we're still here. Shen: Yeah, I was really happy to hear that you guys came out OK following the hurricane. I heard it was pretty rough. Kline: I don't want to minimize the people who actually lost property or got hurt, but compared to what they were predicting, it wasn't that bad. It was very windy, very rainy, scary. I'm sure if you live right on the ocean, it was terrifying. But they were predicting 125 to 130-mile winds, and we only got about half that. So, we're very lucky. Shen: Yeah. It seems like certain regions were right in the path, others were able to avoid it. Overall, I think, especially in your situation, having just moved down to Florida in the past month or two, and having to encounter what was generally considered to be one of the biggest storms in recent memory, that's interesting timing, to say the least. Kline: I'm hoping none of my neighbors put together that I have bad luck when it comes to the weather. They're predicting snow for next week. Shen: Our two big stories for today, first, we have the multi-billion dollar deal that was recently announced between the privately held Bass Pro Shops and its major outdoor retail rival Cabela's, ticker C-A-B. Second, we'll take a look at investor favorite Costco, just to see how the company is faring after its switch from American Express. Dan, let me provide a little bit of background for Bass Pro and Cabela's before we dive into the details behind the buyout. In case anyone has never had the opportunity of visiting one of these stores before, or even heard of them, maybe if you're a die-hard city dweller, both Bass Pro and Cabela's are two of the major big box stores catering to outdoor enthusiasts. They sell apparel, equipment, accessories for activities like hunting, fishing, camping. That includes firearms as well. With that, Dan, I'm going to let you take it away. Can you give us a little bit of detail behind the deal? Kline: These are two very similar companies. They each have around 100 stores, they each have around 20,000 employees. And it was sort of the case of, given all the internet competition, there wasn't really room for two players. It's not necessarily that they have too many stores. But if you combine them, their buying power goes up, their branding goes up, their marketing goes up, or both go down, and it gets easier to not have to compete with each other when they're both looking at Amazon and other online retailers selling a lot of the same things. It's worth noting that these aren't just stores. They're destinations. They're 180,000 to 200,000 and up square feet. They have shooting galleries, live animals, restaurants that serve wild game. It's a really fun place to go. And in some ways, those have been the most resilient retailers -- stores where there's a reason to go when you're not necessarily going to buy anything. Shen: Yeah. I want to point out, based on that, we were talking about before the show as well, it's really incredible, some of the attractions that their biggest flagship stores offer. For Cabela's, they take two different approaches. They have their current smaller store approach, think 40,000 to 100,000 square feet. Then, there's the legacy format, their larger stores, going up to 250,000 square feet, the biggest location being in Hamburg, Pennsylvania. You mentioned shooting galleries and things like that. This has, of course, the shopping, but then a restaurant, aquarium, museum, animal displays for regional game for hunters. You can actually take a virtual tour of that store specifically with Google Street View technology to give you a sense of how large it is and what it has to offer. Bass Pro Shop actually takes it to the next level. Their stores are largely in the 150,000 to 250,000 range for their Outdoor World flagship branding. The largest store in the Bass Pro fleet is an unbelievable 535,000 square feet. They basically took over an old sports and concert arena in Memphis, Tennessee, called the Pyramid. Think of a former stadium that's now a big store that has two restaurants, a hotel, a bowling alley, an aquarium, the tallest free-standing elevator in the world which leads to an observation deck at the top of the Pyramid. The Pyramid itself is one of the tallest in the world. To put that in perspective, that 535,000 square feet for that store, by comparison, the average Wal-Mart Supercenter -- which is huge, walking through that is its own experience -- they're only 180,000 square feet. So, this thing is just absolutely enormous. Kline: It's worth noting that most of the Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops are not in malls, they're in outlying areas, cheaper real estate. The big store has something important going for it. There's a reason to go there. I used to walk around with my son when he was four or five into one of these. But, we'd buy a little candy, maybe have lunch there. I'm not a big fisherman or hunter, but we would look at the stuff and play with the shooting gallery. And I spent a little bit of money. It was very crowded on the weekends, so the destination draws. The problem with that is, on Tuesday, as someone who has a background in retail, you don't have the same customer base. There's no families out on Wednesday afternoon looking to browse and not buy. So, you have the positive that this huge store almost functions as a museum. But you also have the negative that, a lot of the week, it's not that busy. So, going forward, there's a pretty big opportunity, and it sort of ties in to the Cabela's small format. You have all these malls around the country that have realized they can't just be stores. They have to have movie theaters and bowling alleys and restaurants and other destinations to drive business, because people aren't shopping in retail stores the way they used to. A smaller-format Cabela's, maybe with one attraction, builds into that really well. You're going to see a lot of vacancies in malls. There's a lot of Sears and K-Mart anchor stores that are going to become vacant. And the new Bass Pro Shops/Cabela's is really going to get some deals to be able to expand, if that's what they want to do. Shen: Absolutely. I love that idea, actually. They definitely have the attraction/entertainment aspect down. There's plenty of stories and testimonials you can hear from customers, especially in the more rural parts of the country where these stores cater to the people who are into fishing, gaming, and camping, where they will drive hours to go to one of these stores, because the selection and the things to do are limitless when you get to one of these bigger flagship locations. Kline: This is really just a smart mash-up. You simply didn't need two companies of a similar size fighting with each other. As we've talked about, we saw this happened in sporting goods. Sports Authority went out, and Dick's has been thriving because of it, because there's a certain amount of sporting goods -- and Cabela's and Bass Pro Shop are loosely in the sporting goods space -- that you want to touch. You don't necessarily want to buy a fishing rod that you've never handled. So, a certain percentage of people might go into a Bass Pro Shop, handle the fishing rod, and then go buy it online for cheaper. But, that person might at least buy something on the way out. Maybe they need some lures, maybe they really want some fudge, it doesn't really matter, they're going to spend money. They don't have to advertise to get you to not drive down the road to Cabela's, and that's an advantage. Shen: Yep. Diving into a few of the details behind the deal. Keep in mind, Bass Pro Shop is privately held, where as Cabela's is publicly traded. So, the cash offer for Cabela's was $65.50 per share. In total, that's about a $4.5 billion deal. Part of that deal, also, is Cabela's has its CLUB store co-branded credit card. That was previously managed by an entity they created, World's Foremost Bank. Part of the negotiation process was finding some financial firm card processor to take over that part of the operation. Capital One will be taking over that. There will be no change for customers themselves who are part of the Cabela's CLUB, and also the Bass Pro side -- they have a card and loyalty program, too. So, all that will keep going in operation as the companies come together. The combined entity will actually have a network of about 180 stores and 40,000 employees. The new company will also remain private, with the deal expected to close in the first half of 2017. Dan, did you have a chance to pull up any info on the buyout premium? I have to say, overall, Cabela's shareholders should generally be pretty happy based on the previous trajectory that their stock had seen in the past year or so. Kline: Yeah, it's about a 19% premium, if I remember correctly, over where the stock was trading when the deal was announced. It's one of those where you can't exactly say that's all it is, because the stock had moved at various points as this deal has been rumored and talked about. This is one of those cases where the quarterback of the football team and the head cheerleader, everyone wants them to get together, so eventually, they're going to go to prom together whether they like each other or not. What they're not talking about, because you don't want to scare people, is there's going to be some synergy from this. There's going to be some cost-saving. They're going to keep both brands. Supposedly, they're going to keep both headquarters. But the reality is, if you have a guy who's in charge of purchasing sleeping bags at Cabela's and a guy at Bass Pro Shop, there's no reason to have those separate, people. So you're going to start to see some back-office functionality. And maybe they'll have separate marketing teams. Maybe they'll have separate brands. But purchasing and payroll and some of those things are going to come together, so it's going to get cheaper for these two brands to exist. Shen: Also keep in mind that their geographic footprint of the store fleets themselves are pretty complementary. Bass Pro has the large majority of its stores in the eastern part of the United States. Only about a dozen locations spread out between Colorado, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. Cabela's adds about 30 to 40 more stores in those states in the western part of the country. So, while there's quite a bit of overlap toward the East Coast, Cabela's gives Bass Pro Shop that exposure in the more western states.  Then, going back to that premium that you mentioned, the 19%, that's to the Oct. 2 close, right before the deal was announced. But when Cabela's announced that they were pursuing strategic alternatives back in December of 2015, since that point, that's a 40% premium, that $65.60 per share. Then, if you go back even further than that, which is part of the story of why this deal even came to be, is that an activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, they took an 11% stake in the company in October, and immediately, they stated their intention to push Cabela's toward finding an entity to buy it out. Since that point -- about one year ago -- there's a 96% premium since the Elliot Management stake was disclosed. Again, for a stock that hasn't traded in the $65 range since around early 2014 -- the shares peaked around $71 during that period -- this is a pretty nice takeaway for shareholders. I think a lot of people who came in during that peak are happy to recoup quite a bit of their investment. Kline: You have to be happy. But the reality is, the reason the stock has gone up since this rumor has happened is, there was only one logical buyer, and a deal was going to happen. It was simply the right thing to do. Even just looking at going from 100 stores to 180, you improve your supply lines, improve your warehouses. Even as you look at your online ability to fulfill orders, you now have locations and warehouses, so you can leverage things like ordering online and picking up in stores. The stock basically doubled since it became a rumor, because it just made so much sense. And now that it's happened, there's every reason to believe it's the right move. Shen: Yep. Final takeaway if you're Cabela's investor: As it stands right now, the offer from Bass Pro Shop values the company at about 22.5 times trailing 12-month earnings. So, quite favorable based on Cabela's outlook. Frankly, the company was in a tougher spot before Elliot Management came along and started pushing the company. Kline: Yeah, it had a rough quarter. When you're looking at this type of store, comparable sales is really the metric. Comparable-store sales were down 1.3% to the most recent quarter. That's not a disaster -- that's not Sports Authority numbers. But you look at all the people creeping up on it. You have a stronger Dick's, you have Amazon, you have various online retailers, REI, which is a much smaller-format store that inches up on this. So, you can see where the pressure was coming from. Getting bigger fast is a really good way to push back against that. Shen: The company ultimately had quite a few challenges to overcome if they wanted to work on their revenue, their profitability, expanding their network of stores. Ultimately, you mentioned some of those other names, this is a retail environment that does not take hostages. Kline: Yeah. To wrap up, this is also a case where a healthy company was having very negative stock pressure because of the short-term nature of many investors. Nobody was looking and saying, "OK, down 1.3%, but Cabela's is well-positioned, it's in the right places, it has a type of store that's doing well even in the internet economy." By going private, the company can now say, "We're going to invest, we're going to do certain things, and we're not going to be tied to the quarterly reporting cycle." For a retail store in a quickly changing environment, that might mean shuttering the very big store, or making a big change to a format, or opening up 10 new mall stores, and that might not reflect well in the one, two, three quarter picture. But, as a private company, you can take the long view in a way that, frankly, retail companies can't when they're publicly traded. Shen: But, one thing I will counter that with before we wrap up on this deal is that, the company, bottom line, net income fell 10% in 2014, another 6% in 2015, all this while revenue grew 11% over the same period. So, definitely, there are parts of the business that they needed to work on, frankly. Overall, in the outdoor sporting goods industry, with this tie-up and combined entity, there's still a ton of competition. Keep in mind, you mentioned REI, there's also Dicks, you also mentioned Gander Mountain, Big 5, Academy Sports, Modell's. That doesn't even include the e-commerce side of it. Besides Amazon, there are a lot of smaller players that are pure plays online. So, Bass Pro with Cabela's, larger entity. I think they have a pretty bright future. But ultimately, on the investing side, Cabela's shareholders, there's not much to do at this point but see the deal go through. It's expected to close in the first half of next year. Next up, we have our discussion of Costco. Before we dig into the company following its breakup with American Express, I wanted to thank Tommy John for supporting the show. Tommy John is revolutionizing men's underwear with a focus on fit, fabric, and function. Shirts that stay tucked, socks that stay up, and underwear that keeps everything in place, whichever way a man moves. It's funny that, when I was still wearing a suit everyday for work, I thought that all guys suffered together and were willing to put up with socks that would bunch up around your shoes every hour, having to retuck your shirt all the time. The Fool might let me get away with more casual dress around the office, but after having the opportunity to wear Tommy John gear, I have seen the light. Think of it like a mattress. You invest in that because you spend a third of your life sleeping. Well, you spend most of the remaining two-thirds in underwear most of the time. Tommy John can make that two-thirds of your day so much more comfortable with its breathable, lightweight, non-pilling and quick-drying fabrics. Tommy John offers a wide selection of styles, and the company provides a best-pair guarantee. If their underwear isn't the best you have ever worn, it's on Tommy John. As a special offer to our listeners, get 20% off your first order by going to tommyjohn.com/fool and using the promo code "fool". Plus, you can get free shipping on any order over $50. That's tommyjohn.com/fool, with promo code "fool". All right, Dan. Costco. This is right in your wheelhouse. I know you've been following this company for some time. Can you give us some background? I mentioned American Express a few times. What exactly happened with this transition that they've made to Visa? Kline: Costco switched from its long-term credit card provider, American Express, to Visa. It was very much an abrupt transition, at least in the stores. There was messaging for almost a year to card holders. But basically, you went into Costco on June 19, and you could use your American Express. When you went in on June 20, that card no longer worked. The retailer no longer even took American Express at all, and you had to use your new Visa card. When that happened, the media exploded. "Oh my God! People are going to leave Costco! They're never going to handle this, this is a disaster!" Some of its rivals, BJ's and Sam's, offered free entry to their stores for people holding the old cards. It had seemed like they made a mistake. That was backed up a little bit by the fact that Citigroup, which provides the cards, was overwhelmed with calls, about 1.5 million calls in the first few days. It seemed like people were having big problems, it was causing checkout problems, and this was going to create some real ill will. The reality is, things smoothed out pretty quickly. Within a few days, the call volume was well down. I talked about with some of the Citigroup people about this. Once people figured out the switch, they realized, "OK, now I have a Costco Visa, not a Costco American Express." And the rewards were actually a fairly decent amount better, an extra percent on gas and some tick ups across the board. This was played up like it was going to be a huge drag on earnings. I think -- you have some of the numbers in front of you -- it just wasn't. Shen: I think the company specifically mentioned in one of its recent reports that the switch to Visa from AmEx has saved the company enough money in fees to offset some of the falling-through prices that it's seen that have negatively impacted its business. So, we see that the transition wasn't the end of the world, wasn't as big of a negative impact that a lot of people feared it would be. That was definitely a news cycle that got a lot of headlines. But what about longer-term outlook for Costco? Something I know they've had challenges with is with e-commerce, that's been lagging, it seems like it's passing them by entirely. What do you think? Kline: I don't want to say I expect the bottom to fall off Costco. I think there's a certain percentage of its users that, "Internet be damned, it's fun to go to Costco and sample things that you wouldn't sample." Like, someone has cut up a Twizzler into little pieces -- you know what a Twizzler tastes like, but it's still fun to get one for free as you walk around and look for bargains and hunt for things, and come home with a pallet of meatballs even though you're a vegetarian. There's sort of the thing about going to Costco that's always going to protect some of their business. But as you mentioned, they've done very little on the internet. They send emails, they have some Web specials. But for the most part, it's not a great shopping experience, it doesn't feel like going to Costco in any way with the bargain hunting. It's not what they've built on. I do expect that, at some point, people are going to realize that the cost savings aspect of Costco -- you pay your $55 membership so you can save money by buying whatever it is, your toothpaste for your breakfast cereal in bulk quantity to save money. The problem is -- and, I'm a Costco member and an Amazon Prime member -- many of the things I used to buy from Costco in inconvenient quantities can be purchased from Amazon in the amount that I actually want them in. So, instead of having to buy six deodorant sticks, and I have to remember where they are over the next eight months or however long it takes to use them, I could just order the same thing from Amazon at roughly the same price. Costco has not had major sales dips because of this, but at some point, you have to think they're going to. Shen: Yeah. I think, it's kind of similar to the topic we were talking about previously. Maybe not as directly. Bass Pro and Cabela's create these attractions. But at the same time, I have been to a Costco on Friday evening and seen whole families there, and it's the Friday night entertainment. It's very amusing to see. And powerful, I think, as part of Costco's business model. This warehouse model translates very well to that in-person shopping experience. Now, how do you take that appeal and attractiveness of the warehouse bulk shopping experience and translate that into e-commerce, especially in a situation where, arguably, in most cases, those bulk orders and the savings you get translate to more expensive logistics for the company to get that item or order to you? It's going to be difficult. Kline: Absolutely. I'm guilty, I spend a Sunday afternoon entertaining my 12-year-old by promising him a $1 churro at Costco, and walking around. I mean, you can eat -- I can't, I have a gluten allergy -- but they have cheap pizza and hot dogs. People will go and have lunch and browse the store and come home to find a book on sale, or something ridiculous they never planned for. I don't think you can replace that aspect. I think the problem is, there are some interesting digital things you can do in bulk. Amazon has actually beat them to the punch. Amazon owns a company called Woot.com. I don't know if you've ever heard of Woot, but what they do is a sale of the day. It's now morphed into more than that, but basically, they take a few items that they purchased -- on clearance, likely, from someone else, or have in their own warehouses that wouldn't sell -- and they put out, "OK, today we have this HP laptop, it's $249," and that's maybe half of the regular price. And people go crazy and buy them. I know I buy a lot of t-shirts from them. I've ordered things and thought, "Oh boy! It will be great to have a 12-pack of HDMI cables!"  I think that's very much like the Costco experience. You go to their website every day, and you don't know what's going to be there. Then, you make a purchase that might not be the smartest purchase. Costco could do that. They have a user base. They could even do it on a broader level. They could put a car on sale, they could put health insurance on sale, or, "Come into a store and get a hearing aid exam." There's a lot of ways that Costco could leverage its physical stores, its ability to buy product. If you've ever watched Shark Tank, whenever we talk about Costco, they're notorious for negotiating, getting the price down and getting things very cheap. So it's not crazy to think Costco could say, "OK, Christmas is in 10 weeks, we're going to have a different toy every day on our deals site," and mimic that in-store experience. Shen: If they are able to successfully launch something like that -- and, I do know of Woot, but I did not know that Amazon had taken it over. That's news to me. Ultimately, this is a company with $120 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. And in that time, their net income margin is usually around 2% or less. So, profitability is really thin. People talk about the business benefits from those membership fees -- Kline: It's roughly 70%, 66% to 70% of profits, depending on the quarter. Shen: There you go. That would be something the company has to manage and work around as they transition to e-commerce. That is something they will really have to invest in and face off against, and realize it's a do-or-die situation at some point in the future. Kline: There are some trends. The Costco members, overall, are good. When you look at the same-store sales, and you subtract out the fact that gas prices are a drag because gas prices have been lower, they actually post some slight gains. It's basically flat when you factor gas in. That's not bad. But when you look at the membership numbers, overall membership revenues are up because they've managed to transition some people into more expensive memberships -- either business membership, and in a couple of countries, they've raised prices. But the overall renewal rates have ticked down a very slight amount, about 0.1% when you look at the different markets. That is by no means a cause to panic. It could absolutely be that a small amount of people, with the credit card, just went, "Nah, I never really used this, I'm not going to take the new credit card." About 85% of the credit card portfolio moved over, which is pretty close to the active number of people on the old credit card. So, that 15% that wasn't active, some of them might have said, "Nah, I'm not going to renew this, I'm just going to cut this card in half and not pay my membership fee this year." So, these aren't warning signs. They're almost like baby warning signs. You look at them and it's like, "OK, if they start to lose 0.1% here and 0.1% there, at what point does it snowball and become renewal rates going from 89% to 83%?" Then it becomes a real problem. Shen: Absolutely. OK, I take it that you're still relatively bullish with Costco, and think the prospects will be able to -- Kline: I think they have a lot of time. I think there's an absolute flaw in their business. They pretty openly said they don't care that much about the internet, and they'll get to it when they get to it -- I'm really paraphrasing, nobody said anything that brash. That's indirectly what they said. But, I think because of the nature of their business and the fact that the mall as a destination has maybe faded, that Costco as a destination can buy them two or three years to figure out an internet strategy, or figure out more things like gas, that you can't buy on the internet. Amazon is not an effective delivery method for a tank of gas. So, if Costco can bring me in for gas, an eye exam, a hearing aid exam, maybe they'll add haircuts, maybe they'll expand their restaurants, it doesn't necessarily have to be directly competing with Amazon. Just has to be continuing to give people reasons to pay that $55 and occasionally visit the store. Shen: Yeah.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Top VPN services that don’t keep logs (late 2016) Brittany A. Roston - Oct 26, 2016 7 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Everyone has their own reason for using a VPN, but they all share a common element: the desire for privacy. It may be something as simple as wanting to keep your data private while using an open WiFi network, or something as serious as avoiding state-sponsored hackers or bypassing government firewalls. Using a VPN service that keeps a bunch of data on its users and their activities is risky, and thanks to a bunch of companies that don’t keep logs, avoiding them is simple. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access is one of the more popular VPN services. The company does not keep traffic logs, or any logs at all for that matter. The company allows its subscribers to use up to five devices on the VPN at the same time. Features include unlimited bandwidth, P2P support, multiple VPN gateways, PPTP/OpenVPN/L2TP/IPSec, SOCKS5 Proxy, and more. You can set the VPN up manually on your device, but there’s also an app that includes a kill switch feature, which cuts off Internet access if the VPN happens to drop out, keeping your data as secure as possible. The service is fairly inexpensive at $6.95 if you subscribe on a monthly basis, with both $39.95/year and $35.95/half-year subscription options also being available. PIA also gives subscribers ways to pay anonymously, including using the balance on a gift card. Supported retailer gift cards include Starbucks, Walmart, and a bunch more. Anonymizer Anonymizer is yet another privacy-centric VPN service, one that makes no bones about comparing itself with ExpressVPN and some other competing services. Some of its bigger boasting rights include a full two-weeks trial, as well as not requiring a credit card during that time, supporting six simultaneous devices, and not keeping any logs. There’s software for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Pricing is $79.99/year; unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be any monthly or six-month pricing options. BlackVPN There’s a good chance you’ve heard of blackVPN, as it pretty heavily pushes the privacy aspect of its service. The company says that it does not keep any logs, including things like DNS and traffic logs, nor the user’s real IP address or Internet activity. Features include support for up to three devices simultaneously, P2P support, shared IP support, and support for all the major desktop and mobile operating systems. Price depends on which package you get. If you just get the “Privacy VPNs,” which can be used for P2P downloads, the cost is 5 Euros a month or 49 Euros a year. If you add US and UK VPNs on top of the Privacy VPNs, the cost goes up to 9.50 Euros per month or 99 Euros per year. For those wanting to keep things extra private, you can pay for blackVPN services via Bitcoin. PrivateVPN PrivateVPN is slick but somewhat pricey for those in the US (as payments are made in Euros). However, the company says it does not keep logs and it does have some notable features, including support for up to four devices at once, a software client that guards the connection, port forwarding, support for OpenVPN/PPTP/L2TP/HTTP Proxy, and AES-256 CBC encryption on OpenVPN. As mentioned, though, this is one of the more expensive options at 7 Euros per month, 18 Euros for three months, and 66 Euros per year. If you do choose PrivateVPN, though, you can pay with PayPal, Payson Direkt, and Bitcoin. All the major desktop and mobile operating systems are supported. ExpressVPN Another great option is ExpressVPN, which says it “has a strict no logging policy.” There’s unlimited bandwidth, speed, and server switches, 99.9-percent uptime, 256-bit encryption, more than 136 VPN locations, PPTP/OpenVPN/SSTP/IPSec, support for up to three connections at once, and more. ExpressVPN has its own software available for Windows, Mac and Linux, iOS and Android, and routers. This service is more pricey than Private Internet Access, though, at $59.95/six-months, $99.95/year, and $12.95 per month.

Beginning with a Top Five remake of his father's "Long Gone Lonesome Blues" in 1964, Williams has made the Billboard country singles charts over 100 times, scoring 10 Number One hits. Nine of those chart-toppers are among the tracks on the just-released Curb Records box set Hank Williams, Jr: A Country Boy Can Survive, which takes its name from his enduring 1982 classic. The defiant country-rock hit celebrates its 35th anniversary next year. The four-disc box set is available exclusively at Walmart. Related Hank Williams Jr.: 'I Don't Give a Sh-t About the Election' Outspoken singer says his attention is on new album 'It's About Time' in a candid video interview Focused on the astounding success Williams experienced beginning with 1979's "Family Tradition," the set features all but one of the 30 Top 40 hits from 1979 to 1990. Other cuts include his first Number One, 1970's "All for the Love of Sunshine," recorded with the Mike Curb Congregation vocal group, and popular album cuts such as "Outlaw Women," "Dinosaur" and "The Blues Man." A fourth disc is packed with live performances of such classics as "If Heaven Ain't a Lot Like Dixie," and the self-referential "If You Don't Like Hank Williams" and "My Name Is Bocephus," the latter first featured on the platinum-certified 1986 LP Montana Café, which was followed by his two-year reign as CMA Entertainer of the Year and three consecutive ACM Entertainer of the Year trophies. To date, Williams has charted 37 albums with Curb Records, beginning with 1977's One Night Stands, and has amassed album sales in excess of 70 million worldwide. In 1982, he became the only artist to simultaneously hold down nine spots on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart at the same time. His most recent LP (and first for the Nash Iabel) It's About Time bowed at Number Two, his highest peak on that chart since 1990. Earlier this year, Williams played a series of co-headlining dates with Chris Stapleton. Hank Williams, Jr: A Country Boy Can Survive track listing: Disc One – Hits "Family Tradition" "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound" "Women I've Never Had" "Outlaw Women" "Kaw-Liga" "Old Habits" "Dinosaur" "The Blues Man" "Texas Women" "Dixie on My Mind" "All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)" "A Country Boy Can Survive" "Honky Tonkin'" "The American Dream" Disc Two – Hits "If Heaven Ain't a Lot Like Dixie" "Gonna Go Huntin' Tonight" "Leave Them Boys Alone" "Queen of the Heart" "The Conversation" (w/ Waylon Jennings) "Man of Steel" "Attitude Adjustment" "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" "Major Moves" "I'm for Love" "This Ain't Dallas" "Ain't Misbehavin'" "Country State of Mind" "Mind Your Own Business" Disc Three – Hits "Born to Boogie" "Heaven Can't Be Found" "Young Country" "If The South Woulda Won" "My Name Is Bocephus" "Early In the Morning and Late at Night" "There's a Tear in My Beer" (w/ Hank Williams) "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over for Monday Night Football" "Finders Are Keepers" "Ain't Nobody's Business" "Good Friends, Good Whiskey, Good Lovin'" "Hog Wild" "America Will Survive" "A Country Boy Can Survive" (Remix) "Red, White & Pink Slip Blues" "All for the Love of Sunshine" (w/ Mike Curb Congregation) Disc Four – Live "Intro"/"Hank Williams, Junior-Junior" (Live) "My Name Is Bocephus" (Live) "Workin' for MCA" (Live) "I Really Like Girls" (Live) "If You Don't Like Hank Williams" (Live) "Sweet Home Alabama" (Live) "Spoken Intro"/"La Grange (Live) "Trouble in Mind"/"Short Haired Women (Live) "The Conversation" (Live) "Man of Steel" (Live) "I'm for Love" (Live) "If Heaven Ain't a Lot Like Dixie" (Live) "All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)" (Live) "House of the Rising Sun" (Live) "The Ride" (Live) "A Country Boy Can Survive" (Live) "Family Tradition"/"Hey, Good Lookin" (Live) More News Flashback: Hank Williams Jr. Sings About Father's Firing From the Opry See Hank Williams Jr.'s Swaggering 'Fallon' Performance Flashback: See Hank Williams Jr.'s 'Simpsons' SUV Jingle All Stories Don’t Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Bison meat is seeing a comeback as prices increase. Buy this photo GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) — A bison’s physical makeup is a symbol. With its large head and stout horns, it takes on challenges head-on. It does not cower in the presence of danger. It is a brooding force on four solid legs, strong and steady, radiating power and grace. A bison is a product of a generational herd. It knows the meaning of survival and that its strength is in numbers. They are mighty, yet guarded, hidden among the great plains of North America, thundering through grasslands hundreds of years after a near extinction. On a clear and crisp day, John Flocchini stood on a hill overlooking his 2,800 bison as they grazed on the Durham Ranch. He swiveled his head slowly as the sun reflected off his black-tinted sunglasses, looking west over the rolling hills. He’s a long way from his hometown of San Francisco. California might be where he was born, but he was made in Wyoming, right here on the ranch. Along with his bison, he has thrived and survived, reported the Gillette News Record. The origins of the Durham Ranch In the late 1800s, Armando Flocchini Sr. immigrated from Italy to California when he was a young boy. Growing up in the Bay Area, he started working at a local business called Durham Meat Co. The owner at the time took a liking to Flocchini, enjoyed his work ethic and dedication to the company. Flocchini later became a partner in Durham and eventually bought out the company in the 1930s. In the 1960s, Flocchini and his thriving business wanted to expand. With common meats like the Durham shorthorn cattle coming in and out of the San Francisco company, the head of the business had an urge to move toward a more niche meat market. After months of searching for a plot of land, Durham Meat Co. found a 55,000-acre ranch near Wright, nestled among some of Wyoming’s best pastureland. In 1965, Durham Meat Co. named the plot of land the Durham Ranch and it has been raising and producing bison in Campbell County since. Armando “John” Flocchini III, the ranch’s owner and operator, recalls the day when he decided he wanted to work in the family business. He was on a third-generation hunting trip in Canada. He was 17 and playing hooky during the first week of his senior year of high school. An early graduation present, he called it. As they sat around a campfire, his father asked him what he was planning on doing with his life. “I fell in love with the ranch when I was a kid,” Flocchini said. “Back in California, I would sweep the floors and package steaks as a kid. When my family took trips out to the ranch during the summer, I would stay with my grandparents for months at a time. I never wanted to leave.” On those long summer days, John remembers working with his granddad, his mentor. “He taught me the whys and wherefores about ranching,” he said. “I was doing everything from fencing to picking up rocks in hayfields just because I just loved it.” After graduating with an agriculture degree from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California, John, the fifth of seven Flocchini children and the oldest boy, picked up and moved to Wyoming to take over the reins at the ranch. The bison market In the 1970s, there were about 30,000 bison roaming on American grasslands. About the same time, television mogul and bison rookie Ted Turner bought his first plots of farmland to raise cattle. The bison industry was small and had little growth for years. In the 1980s, a couple of things came together. Flocchini said one was Turner’s purchase and involvement in the industry and the second was a cooperative that was formed in North Dakota. Suddenly, there was a demand for bison that wasn’t there before. But the demand was primarily for the breeding stock. The prices of the breeding stock started to climb to ridiculous numbers. “The prices were out of this world,” Flocchini said. “But the problem was there was no real and true foundation for the meat market. There was demand, but it wasn’t strong nationally.” After a sudden issue with the cooperative and some poor weather, the industry all but crashed in 2000. Bison meat began to pile up in storage freezers and the whole market got backed up. Flocchini said Durham didn’t have reason to worry as much because it operated both the production and marketing side of the process. “Most producers do not have that advantage,” he said. “We controlled the marketing part of it, which is a nice place to be in.” Around the country, prices dropped significantly, which was hard on a lot of people, but it also was an opportunity for a new foundation and a fresh start. A new foundation In 2002, Turner opened up his first Ted’s Montana Grill in Columbus, Georgia, with George McKerrow Jr., the same man who founded the LongHorn Steakhouse. About that same time, supermarket giants such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods started buying up bison by the truckloads. The new foundation started to catch on. The bison industry and the major marketers went into a full promotion mode. They got the word out on how great bison meat is, how nutritionally valuable it is compared to beef and how healthy and flavorful the taste is. “While it was relatively low-priced in the marketplace, consumers were being re-introduced to bison and it took off,” Flocchini said. “It gained a super floor to where now, it’s a popular product coast to coast.” In fact, Turner’s interest and success in the industry started to grow so much that Flocchini and Durham sold Turner his first 1,000 head to start one of his larger ranches in Montana. While bison is considerably pricey today, the demand is staying strong for it. At Whole Foods, ground bison sells for $10.99 a pound and strip steaks sell for $25.99 a pound. Sam’s Club offers bison in the form of steaks, hot dogs and even ground chuck. “We, as an industry, are pretty confident that we’re not going to have the same issue we had in 2000,” Flocchini said. “We have the market now, which wasn’t established back then.” Since the crash, bison demand has only gone up. Dave Carter, director of the National Bison Association, said the carcass price for bison in 2004 was $1.60 a pound. Over the course of seven years, the price skyrocketed to $4 a pound and two months ago, the per-pound price was as high as $4.65. With the price of bison nearly doubling from January 2009 through June this year, Carter said that the industry needs commercial-scale ranches like Durham to keep up with demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the increase in bison prices outpaces a 42 percent increase for similar beef grades, a 41 percent rise in pork and an 18 percent rise for chicken. “When John says that the industry has had a good four, five years since 2011, I think he’s being too modest,” Carter said. “We’ve seen slow growth since at least 2004 and we see both the demand and the fair market price lasting a very long time.” Carter said the average American eats about 55 pounds of beef a year. Of that beef, bison contributes a mere 0.08 pounds. “So even if Americans tripled their bison intake, it’d only be enough for a Quarter Pounder for each person at the dinner table a year,” Carter said. There are about 90 million cattle in the United States and only 500,000 bison. Durham Ranch contributes about 3,000 of the 60,000 bison that are processed a year. To compare, cattle are processed at a rate of 125,000 a day. “We’re in a growth mode,” Flocchini said. “We’re marketing somewhere close to 3,000 animals a year, close to 50 or 60 a week.” Since Durham and its parent company have taken off, they have been partnering with other companies around the country because they can’t grow enough of their own for the demand. “It’s a great problem to have,” Flocchini said. Bison can bring in twice as much money as beef, and Carter said they can’t keep up with demand. “We’re still a very small business,” Carter said. “But the demand is growing and we’re constantly looking for ranchers and producers to help us raise and harvest buffalo.” The bison craze Producers, innovators and cooks around the country are finding new ways to get bison on plates in a number of ways. Chefs in Austin, Texas, are selling bison and bacon bars, Elon Musk’s brother is serving grass-fed bison tartar in Colorado and Patagonia, the global adventure outfitter, recently launched its own grass-fed buffalo jerky, made from buffalo that roam the wide-open prairie on Dan and Jill O’Brien’s Cheyenne River Ranch. “We’re in a niche market,” Flocchini said. “Right now, these specialty products are really popular. It’s fitting really well with the CrossFit folks, the paleo diet folks and people who want that leaner, more tasty meat.” Like all meat, bison is rich in protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and other nutrients. The National Bison Association promotes it as having only 2.4 grams of fat and 143 calories in 3.5 ounces cooked, compared to 8 grams of fat and 200 calories in a piece of “select” beef. Bison meat is also promoted as a great source of omega-3 fats. With the new school of thought emerging in the bison industry and the lure of a more holistic and organic meal, there seems to be two trains of thought: the grass-raised, grain finished or pure grass-fed. Durham Ranch finishes its bison on grain for two reasons. One is so that when someone buys bison meat with the Durham Ranch label, the taste will be consistent. The second reason is so that Flocchini is allowed to market fresh product year-round. “Most grass programs are seasonal,” he said. “They have to put stuff in the freezer because they’re not in the kind of condition to be a year-round producer. That’s what this grain finishing helps us do. It’s a numbers thing and a product quality thing.” Bison grow to market size much more slowly than cattle. Putting them on a diet of grain for the last three to six months of their lives helps speed up the process. The drawback is that grain-finishing causes a rapid decline in omega-3 levels. “We harvest our animals in the field with a mobile harvester. That way, we can pull right into the field where the animals are comfortable,” O’Brien said. “We don’t get those high cortisone or stress hormone levels in our meat like you do in industrial harvesters. We harvest humanely unlike anywhere else.” The Durham Ranch harvests its animals in Colorado under USDA inspection. While both philosophies have their pros and cons, Carter said it is vital for the bison industry that the two co-exist. “It is extremely important that both the 100 percent grass-fed way and the grain-finished way thrive while the demand is high,” he said. “We don’t see it as if they are competing against each other. All we ask is that there is honesty across the board when it comes to telling our customers where the meat comes from.” Whether consumers are eating their bison off toothpicks at a farmers market or by the pound at their local supermarket, Carter believes the two methods are important to the industry. “We encourage consumers to simply tell us what is important to them when they buy,” he said. “The diversification of the market is key to our success.” The future In 1986, Durham Meat Co. bought Sierra Meat Co. in Reno, Nevada, and the company’s headquarters has been stationed there ever since. Reno is where Chris Flocchini, the company’s president and chief operating officer, handles the top of the ever-expanding umbrella that includes wild boar caught in Texas and elk raised in New Zealand. “Looking at it from an industry perspective, it’s been profitable for the producer and the marketer,” John Flocchini said. “It’s kind of a sweet spot. Everyone is making good money and the product is moving.” Business is good, life is good, the beasts are happy. But is it almost time for John to pass the bison baton? “We’ve started to look around,” he said. “We might have to dip into the nieces and nephews and see if there are any takers.” The five daughters John and his wife, Gaylynn, share haven’t shown any early signs of interest. But why give it up, why retire now? When reflecting on the opportunities and experiences the family business has given him, he immediately talked about a hunting trip with Bruce Bochy, manager of the San Francisco Giants. One mutual friend lead to another and over a four-month period, Flocchini hunted with Bochy, sat in his office at AT&T Park and met Giants legend Willie Mays. “We’ve been blessed, all of us,” he said. “The community in Wright and Campbell County has been good to us and we’ve been good for them. I’m approaching 60, but I don’t plan on leaving soon. I love it.” Marketplace Auctions Hay Real Estate Tractors Share and Discuss Guidelines User Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The officer was off duty and had stopped at the Walmart on Highway 70 when the theft occurred. Officials said the officer left her car unlocked and was gone only a short amount of time. Investigators are not sure if the officer was targeted or if it was a random theft.  They are especially concerned with the service weapon, a 9mm Glock handgun. Two magazines on the belt could each hold 17 rounds. Officials would not say how many rounds were in the weapon or the magazines at the time of the theft.  Investigators are hoping someone with information will come forward. The parking lot has several surveillance cameras and investigators were checking to see if the theft was caught on video, but have not said whether they found anything. The name and status of the officer have not been released. Copyright 2016 WBTV. All rights reserved.

It gets sad to read news about people or pets that die because someone left them locked in a car that was not ventilated properly. It is not easy writing about the topic either, so do no think that editors do not get affected by this at all. This time, someone made a mistake and called the police after seeing what appeared to be a child with long hair sleeping in the back seat of a Honda Civic Coupe from the mid-1990s. Its owner was not present, and the car was parked near an elementary school in Suffolk, Virginia. The pedestrian decided to call the police to help the child in what appeared to be a matter of life and death. Officers arrived at the scene in the unexpectedly hot day in the Hampton Roads area in Suffolk, and they managed to get the owner of the vehicle on the phone. Surprisingly, she reported that she did not have any children, and she did not understand what may have happened that brought a child in the back seat of her vehicle. Jasmine Turner, the owner of the vehicle, told the news reporters that she was shopping for supplies with her boss while she received the call regarding a child stuck in her car. As WAWY News noted in their report, the owner of the vehicle asked the responding officers to wait for her as she made her way from the Walmart to the parking lot where the car was left. Unfortunately for the driver, the responding officers did not wait at all, and she found her car with a broken window. Without any surprise to her, there was no child in the vehicle, as the unidentified pedestrian mistakenly identified a wig and a few towels tossed next to it as a child. The owner of the Honda Civic now claims that the fix will cost her “hundreds of dollars,” and she is visibly upset because local police representatives do not want to fit the bill. The police told her to contact the risk management department of the city to get her vehicle fixed. While we do not fix cars for a living, we know that getting a replacement window for a mid-1990s Honda Civic Coupe will not cost “hundreds of dollars,” so we would take that claim with a grain of salt.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Good morning. It’s Wednesday, October 26, 2016. Seventy-six ago today, an accomplished test pilot took a remarkable little airplane out for its maiden spin. The flier’s name was Vance Breese and the aircraft, developed and produced by North American Aviation, was the P-51 Mustang. Its creation was a joint effort of American technological skill and British grit, and the little fighter saved countless Allies lives and helped win a war. The plane’s genesis came in March 1940 when Henry Self, who was in charge of production and procurement of new aircraft for the Royal Air Force, asked American aviation executive James H. “Dutch” Kindelberger if he would build a fleet of Curtiss P-40 fighters for the RAF. Kindelberger, the president of North American Aviation, replied that NAA could actually build and produce a superior fighter plane, with the same engines, in less time than it would take to set up a mass production line (under a licensing agreement with Curtiss) for the P-40. All right, said Sir Henry, but you have 120 days. Before I explain what happened next, I’d point you to our front page, which aggregates columns and stories spanning the political spectrum. We also offer a complement of original material from our own reporters and contributors this morning, including the following: * * * Nev., N.C. Focus-Group Moms Expect Clinton Victory. Weariness and fatalism have set in with key swing state voters, according to the latest assessment from “Wal-Mart Moms.” Alexis Simendinger has the story. "Come Home" to Trump, Pence Will Tell Utahans. On Wednesday, the VP candidate is expected to reach out to Beehive State conservatives backing a third-party candidate, Rebecca Berg reports. Trump and Clinton: A Tale of Two Energy Futures. In the eighth part of our series, Bill Murray lays out differences in the candidates’ positions on climate change and energy jobs. Obama's Energy Legacy. Jay Hakes argues that a combination of aggressive policies and benign neglect by the president puts the U.S. in a stronger position regarding energy and climate than when he entered office in 2009. The Abuse of Administrative Power. In RealClearPolicy, Philip Hamburger argues that the administrative power of federal agencies is an unconstitutional assault on freedom and suggests how the next president could rein it in. The Checks & Balances of the Regulatory State. Also in RCPolicy, Paul R. Verkuil defends the regulatory state as a vital function of government. And the authors in this special series respond to each other here. Pharmacists Can Play Role in Addressing Health Care Crisis. In RealClearHealth, Edward Timmons and Connor Norris provide a simple solution to arbitrary barriers that limit the capabilities of pharmacists. Defense Budget Considerations for 2017. In RealClearDefense, Peter Huessy details the challenges that await the new president and Congress. How to Prove That You’re a Mind Reader. Ross Pomeroy explains in RealClearScience. * * * What a brash promise Dutch Kindelberger made to Henry Self. But North American Aviation delivered on it. Just 117 days later, the first P-51 rolled off the assembly line. On October 26, 1940, Vance Breese took it into the sky and reported back that it performed well. Guarding its turf, the U.S. Army kept two of the planes. The rest were delivered to Great Britain under the terms of Lend Lease and thrown into the war effort against Germany. The new fighter had a longer range than its predecessors, and better maneuverability. It flew at a higher altitude and was faster, too -- although not quite fast enough against the Luftwaffe fighters. That changed in 1942, when the old P-40 Allison engines being used in the Mustangs were replaced with the Rolls-Royce Merlin V-12 engine. The P-51 could now fly an astonishing 440 miles per hour. A new design wrinkle was added, too -- a bubble canopy; suddenly the Allies had a lethal weapon that could not only protect the long-range bombers being deployed over Germany, but also hunt enemy fighters in the air and shoot them out of the sky. B-17s had suffered frightful losses up to this point. In the U.S. Army Air Corps, “Black Thursday” was October 14, 1943, the day when 60 of the bombers were shot down by German fighters. And each B-17 had a crew of 10. To the rescue came the single-seat P-51 Mustang. The bomber pilots took to calling the fighter “my little friend,” and by the spring of 1945 it had destroyed 4,950 enemy planes and played an instrumental role in bringing the war in Europe to an end.

The Eddy Pub in Saxapahaw is not trying to rip you off by charging twelve dollars for a burger, says owner Claire Haslam. She explains that the restaurant she and her partner opened in the renovated mill at the center of Saxapahaw's development boom, the one they describe as a "central gathering place for the community," aims to build a model that's economically viable for everyone—including farmers and their staff. "We're here supporting the locals, and they come in and support us," she says. This refrain is familiar to anyone who buys locally grown food in the Triangle. But given that inequality has grown alongside the Triangle's food scene, invocations of community at hip restaurants and upscale markets can often seem grounded in questionable trickle-down thinking—less "let them eat cake" and more "if we eat enough cake, we'll eventually create a market for bread." To ensure an equitable local food economy, the farm-to-table model must include the Triangle's low-income residents. So far, attempts to accomplish this goal have fallen short. Eating out is an inherently exclusive activity. A national USDA survey found that households that earn above 185 percent of the poverty level spend almost three times as much at restaurants as those that receive SNAP, and almost twice as much as the working poor. That doesn't even account for which restaurants these families patronize; the difference would surely be even starker for high-end farm-to-table eateries. According to advocates, the true community impact of restaurants doesn't stem from serving customers directly. "Farm-to-table offers a model for infrastructure development," says Ann Meletzke, executive director of Healthy Alamance, a nonprofit focused on public health and food access. "While a restaurant is attracting customers from all over the place with varying perspectives on food, it opens the door to relationships between farms and consumers." Eliza MacLean, who is famed for her pasture-raised pork at Cane Creek Farm, says her connection to sourcing-conscious restaurants like Lantern helped provide direct sales revenue as well as a marketing boost from the farm's connection to the acclaimed restaurant. MacLean leveraged that success; she transitioned to selling whole animals to Saxapahaw's Left Bank Butchery and operating a mobile butcher shop at the Carrboro Farmers' Market—ensuring that consumers had access to her products without having to go to a restaurant. click to enlarge Photo by Alex Boerner Left Bank Butchery and The Eddy Pub hosted Oktoberfest with Cane Creek pork. Still, farmers markets aren't cheap, and most attract a rather homogenous demographic. One common method of bringing in lower-income patrons is a "double bucks" program, a version of which launched at the Carrboro Farmers' Market in 2010 and has since spread to farmers markets in Durham and Raleigh. It offers two dollars of farmers-market goods for every one dollar of SNAP benefits, up to ten dollars per market. A 2014 USDA report found that programs like this significantly increase SNAP recipients' shopping at farmers markets. Nevertheless, consumers spend most of their benefits at large grocery stores, both for cost-effective pricing and the ease of buying all their goods in one conveniently located place. The Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), based in Pittsboro, found that in 2013 a mere .006 percent of SNAP benefits statewide were redeemed at farmers markets. "The expansion of farmers markets is not doing anything for the poor," says Lance Barton, former eastern regional director of the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina. "I would question whether it's having much of an economic impact on Walmart or Food Lion, which is where your low-income family is going to shop." Farm-to-table advocates are looking beyond farmers markets for solutions. Food hubs, like Durham's Firsthand Foods, buy from local growers and distribute to retail outlets, creating efficiencies that allow locally grown food to be distributed more widely. The focus still isn't on getting goods into Walmart, but rather on specialty stores like the Durham Co-op, which do address some of the shortcomings of farmers markets. Along with selling non-food essentials like toilet paper, the co-op implements food-access programs that offer low-priced staple foods, benefits to SNAP recipients, and even weekly three-dollar dinners at the hot bar. "We work as hard as we can to make accessible pricing available to all of our customers," says Durham Co-op general manager Leila Woolfrum. Those efforts make co-op prices competitive on some goods, but large grocery stores still provide the most food for the least money. In August, the featured local milk, eggs, flour, and sweet potatoes at the co-op cost 25 to 100 percent more than at the nearby Harris Teeter and Food Lion. And Food Lion's sweet potatoes were even North Carolina grown. Farm-to-table projects like the NC 10% Campaign try to increase demand for local food by working to bring it into places like university cafeterias. But that approach does not address the underlying issue: the value proposition of locally grown food is that it is a boutique item. "I'm producing food for an upscale model. I'm selling to people who have money," says Saxapahaw farmer and Carolina Farm Stewardship Association board member Tony Gaddis. Gaddis, who sells exclusively to restaurants, may be more frank than most farmers, but he's not alone. There really are two distinct markets for food: a high-end one for locally grown (and often organic) goods, and a conventional, mass-produced one that provides the most food for most residents. "I don't know if I'd go so far as to say farm-to-table created that," says former RAFI organizer Kavita Koppa, "but it certainly pushed it forward." Gaddis says the programs only go so far to address this shortcoming, and that the current paradigm requires substantive change. He advocates for more medium-size farms, which could operate on a different pricing model, and a community farming model to supplement his own. Standing in the way of implementing such new models are obstacles far beyond the scope of farmers, restaurateurs, and nonprofits—things like food deserts, land prices, gentrification, cultural differences. Trying to ensure living wages for farmers and staff at grocery stores complicates the situation further. But the existence of these problems shouldn't be taken as an argument that current food access programs are sufficient.

(She usually has spotters.) Other than routine physical torture, being a mermaid for hire is “merrific” and “mermazing,” she says. She’s been one for more than a decade, working private events for celebrities such as Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, and Justin Timberlake. Her “merformances”—events at which she swims mostly in pools, though sometimes in the ocean or at aquariums—start at $1,000, and she says she earns “more, hourly, for some projects than many lawyers I know.” Her YouTube channel brings in four figures a month. Linden Wolbert Photographer: Molly Matalon for Bloomberg Businessweek Hiring mermaids has been popular for years, as has pretending to be one. Lady Gaga, Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and Katy Perry have all worn tails for costume balls, music videos, or publicity shoots. Their passion has helped inspire a “mertailing” industry to support aspiring sea maidens, and it’s thriving: In October, Walmart Stores ordered 58,000 of the Mermaid Linden kids’ monofins—flippers like the kind you use to snorkel but fused together—Wolbert makes with outfitters Body Glove International. Wolbert and Body Glove also teamed up to make a spandex children’s tail that’s patterned on a parrotfish. (The tail doesn’t come with any kind of flipper attached.) “We think it’s going to be incredibly successful,” says Body Glove President Russ Lesser. The larger mermaid economy is as diverse as sea life itself. Schools teach aspiring sea maidens in the Philippines, France, Spain, and the U.S. (In Omaha, a two-day class for adults costs $210; a two-day teacher-training class at New York’s Coney Island is $375.) The three photographers and “host” mermaid who run the Mermaid Portfolio Workshop charge as much as $3,000 to shoot would-be mermodels in the Bahamas and Isla Mujeres, Mexico. “The classes are internationally popular,” says Chris Crumley, one of the photographers. Wolbert’s spandex kids’ tail (right) resembles a parrotfish; it’s meant to be sold with her $29.99 monofin. Photographer: Molly Matalon for Bloomberg Businessweek Mermaid Melissa (her legal name), in Orlando, says she’s built custom tanks and hired a school of mermaids to meet party demand. “Clients want something specific,” she says. “Like, ‘We want an African American mermaid. We want her in a gold tail.’ ” And in Crystal River, Fla., Eric Ducharme, aka the Mertailor, says he sells thousands of tails annually, charging $120 for a stock version and as much as $5,000 for custom. (Thirty percent of his customers are male.) His tails appeared in this year’s The Nice Guys, with Ryan Gosling. “When movies come out, people get obsessed,” says Ducharme, 26. “It’s a sexual thing, but not in a perverted fetish way.” The obsession lives on: A live-action Little Mermaid and a Walt Disney remake of Splash with Channing Tatum as a merman are in the works. Wolbert, who’s in her 30s, has always been a strong swimmer. After majoring in film with a minor in environmental science at Emerson College in Boston, she traveled with the Professional Association of Diving Instructors as a scuba diving model. She learned to hold her breath for five minutes and to free dive, plunging to 115 feet without an oxygen tank. While filming a documentary in 2005, she found her calling. “I was watching divers swimming up and down wearing monofins, and they moved like mermaids,” she says. One day she borrowed one. “I jumped into the water and took off.” All she needed was a convincing tail. But back then, they weren’t available commercially. Luckily, her friend Allan Holt, who works in Hollywood in special effects, helped her make one out of silicone. Seven months and $20,000 later, her scuba diving and film friends began shooting videos, which she posted online. She started booking gigs. Photographer: Molly Matalon for Bloomberg Businessweek On a recent Friday, Wolbert sits poolside in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., preparing for a Body Glove photo shoot. She slathers her legs with hair conditioner to help ease into her blue tail. “Oils dissolve the silicone,” she says. Lesser’s 9-year-old granddaughter and two of her friends will arrive shortly to take part in the shoot, and Wolbert doesn’t want them to see her tailless. “It’s important not to break the illusion.” The collaboration with Body Glove began in 2013 after she met Lesser, a fellow board member for the Reef Check Foundation, a nonprofit focused on saving the ocean. He was impressed with her skills and passion. “She’s not just a mermaid, she’s a super athlete,” he says. “I met with Michael Phelps last year and challenged him to have a 100-yard swim [against Wolbert] from a standing start. He declined.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) — A bison’s physical makeup is a symbol. With its large head and stout horns, it takes on challenges head-on. It does not cower in the presence of danger. It is a brooding force on four solid legs, strong and steady, radiating power and grace. A bison is a product of a generational herd. It knows the meaning of survival and that its strength is in numbers. They are mighty, yet guarded, hidden among the great plains of North America, thundering through grasslands hundreds of years after a near extinction. On a clear and crisp day, John Flocchini stood on a hill overlooking his 2,800 bison as they grazed on the Durham Ranch. He swiveled his head slowly as the sun reflected off his black-tinted sunglasses, looking west over the rolling hills. He’s a long way from his hometown of San Francisco. California might be where he was born, but he was made in Wyoming, right here on the ranch. Along with his bison, he has thrived and survived, reported the Gillette News Record. The origins of the Durham Ranch In the late 1800s, Armando Flocchini Sr. immigrated from Italy to California when he was a young boy. Growing up in the Bay Area, he started working at a local business called Durham Meat Co. The owner at the time took a liking to Flocchini, enjoyed his work ethic and dedication to the company. Flocchini later became a partner in Durham and eventually bought out the company in the 1930s. In the 1960s, Flocchini and his thriving business wanted to expand. With common meats like the Durham shorthorn cattle coming in and out of the San Francisco company, the head of the business had an urge to move toward a more niche meat market. After months of searching for a plot of land, Durham Meat Co. found a 55,000-acre ranch near Wright, nestled among some of Wyoming’s best pastureland. In 1965, Durham Meat Co. named the plot of land the Durham Ranch and it has been raising and producing bison in Campbell County since. Armando “John” Flocchini III, the ranch’s owner and operator, recalls the day when he decided he wanted to work in the family business. He was on a third-generation hunting trip in Canada. He was 17 and playing hooky during the first week of his senior year of high school. An early graduation present, he called it. As they sat around a campfire, his father asked him what he was planning on doing with his life. “I fell in love with the ranch when I was a kid,” Flocchini said. “Back in California, I would sweep the floors and package steaks as a kid. When my family took trips out to the ranch during the summer, I would stay with my grandparents for months at a time. I never wanted to leave.” On those long summer days, John remembers working with his granddad, his mentor. “He taught me the whys and wherefores about ranching,” he said. “I was doing everything from fencing to picking up rocks in hayfields just because I just loved it.” After graduating with an agriculture degree from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California, John, the fifth of seven Flocchini children and the oldest boy, picked up and moved to Wyoming to take over the reins at the ranch. The bison market In the 1970s, there were about 30,000 bison roaming on American grasslands. About the same time, television mogul and bison rookie Ted Turner bought his first plots of farmland to raise cattle. The bison industry was small and had little growth for years. In the 1980s, a couple of things came together. Flocchini said one was Turner’s purchase and involvement in the industry and the second was a cooperative that was formed in North Dakota. Suddenly, there was a demand for bison that wasn’t there before. But the demand was primarily for the breeding stock. The prices of the breeding stock started to climb to ridiculous numbers. “The prices were out of this world,” Flocchini said. “But the problem was there was no real and true foundation for the meat market. There was demand, but it wasn’t strong nationally.” After a sudden issue with the cooperative and some poor weather, the industry all but crashed in 2000. Bison meat began to pile up in storage freezers and the whole market got backed up. Flocchini said Durham didn’t have reason to worry as much because it operated both the production and marketing side of the process. “Most producers do not have that advantage,” he said. “We controlled the marketing part of it, which is a nice place to be in.” Around the country, prices dropped significantly, which was hard on a lot of people, but it also was an opportunity for a new foundation and a fresh start. A new foundation In 2002, Turner opened up his first Ted’s Montana Grill in Columbus, Georgia, with George McKerrow Jr., the same man who founded the LongHorn Steakhouse. About that same time, supermarket giants such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods started buying up bison by the truckloads. The new foundation started to catch on. The bison industry and the major marketers went into a full promotion mode. They got the word out on how great bison meat is, how nutritionally valuable it is compared to beef and how healthy and flavorful the taste is. “While it was relatively low-priced in the marketplace, consumers were being re-introduced to bison and it took off,” Flocchini said. “It gained a super floor to where now, it’s a popular product coast to coast.” In fact, Turner’s interest and success in the industry started to grow so much that Flocchini and Durham sold Turner his first 1,000 head to start one of his larger ranches in Montana. While bison is considerably pricey today, the demand is staying strong for it. At Whole Foods, ground bison sells for $10.99 a pound and strip steaks sell for $25.99 a pound. Sam’s Club offers bison in the form of steaks, hot dogs and even ground chuck. “We, as an industry, are pretty confident that we’re not going to have the same issue we had in 2000,” Flocchini said. “We have the market now, which wasn’t established back then.” Since the crash, bison demand has only gone up. Dave Carter, director of the National Bison Association, said the carcass price for bison in 2004 was $1.60 a pound. Over the course of seven years, the price skyrocketed to $4 a pound and two months ago, the per-pound price was as high as $4.65. With the price of bison nearly doubling from January 2009 through June this year, Carter said that the industry needs commercial-scale ranches like Durham to keep up with demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the increase in bison prices outpaces a 42 percent increase for similar beef grades, a 41 percent rise in pork and an 18 percent rise for chicken. “When John says that the industry has had a good four, five years since 2011, I think he’s being too modest,” Carter said. “We’ve seen slow growth since at least 2004 and we see both the demand and the fair market price lasting a very long time.” Carter said the average American eats about 55 pounds of beef a year. Of that beef, bison contributes a mere 0.08 pounds. “So even if Americans tripled their bison intake, it’d only be enough for a Quarter Pounder for each person at the dinner table a year,” Carter said. There are about 90 million cattle in the United States and only 500,000 bison. Durham Ranch contributes about 3,000 of the 60,000 bison that are processed a year. To compare, cattle are processed at a rate of 125,000 a day. “We’re in a growth mode,” Flocchini said. “We’re marketing somewhere close to 3,000 animals a year, close to 50 or 60 a week.” Since Durham and its parent company have taken off, they have been partnering with other companies around the country because they can’t grow enough of their own for the demand. “It’s a great problem to have,” Flocchini said. Bison can bring in twice as much money as beef, and Carter said they can’t keep up with demand. “We’re still a very small business,” Carter said. “But the demand is growing and we’re constantly looking for ranchers and producers to help us raise and harvest buffalo.” The bison craze Producers, innovators and cooks around the country are finding new ways to get bison on plates in a number of ways. Chefs in Austin, Texas, are selling bison and bacon bars, Elon Musk’s brother is serving grass-fed bison tartar in Colorado and Patagonia, the global adventure outfitter, recently launched its own grass-fed buffalo jerky, made from buffalo that roam the wide-open prairie on Dan and Jill O’Brien’s Cheyenne River Ranch. “We’re in a niche market,” Flocchini said. “Right now, these specialty products are really popular. It’s fitting really well with the CrossFit folks, the paleo diet folks and people who want that leaner, more tasty meat.” Like all meat, bison is rich in protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and other nutrients. The National Bison Association promotes it as having only 2.4 grams of fat and 143 calories in 3.5 ounces cooked, compared to 8 grams of fat and 200 calories in a piece of “select” beef. Bison meat is also promoted as a great source of omega-3 fats. With the new school of thought emerging in the bison industry and the lure of a more holistic and organic meal, there seems to be two trains of thought: the grass-raised, grain finished or pure grass-fed. Durham Ranch finishes its bison on grain for two reasons. One is so that when someone buys bison meat with the Durham Ranch label, the taste will be consistent. The second reason is so that Flocchini is allowed to market fresh product year-round. “Most grass programs are seasonal,” he said. “They have to put stuff in the freezer because they’re not in the kind of condition to be a year-round producer. That’s what this grain finishing helps us do. It’s a numbers thing and a product quality thing.” Bison grow to market size much more slowly than cattle. Putting them on a diet of grain for the last three to six months of their lives helps speed up the process. The drawback is that grain-finishing causes a rapid decline in omega-3 levels. “We harvest our animals in the field with a mobile harvester. That way, we can pull right into the field where the animals are comfortable,” O’Brien said. “We don’t get those high cortisone or stress hormone levels in our meat like you do in industrial harvesters. We harvest humanely unlike anywhere else.” The Durham Ranch harvests its animals in Colorado under USDA inspection. While both philosophies have their pros and cons, Carter said it is vital for the bison industry that the two co-exist. “It is extremely important that both the 100 percent grass-fed way and the grain-finished way thrive while the demand is high,” he said. “We don’t see it as if they are competing against each other. All we ask is that there is honesty across the board when it comes to telling our customers where the meat comes from.” Whether consumers are eating their bison off toothpicks at a farmers market or by the pound at their local supermarket, Carter believes the two methods are important to the industry. “We encourage consumers to simply tell us what is important to them when they buy,” he said. “The diversification of the market is key to our success.” The future In 1986, Durham Meat Co. bought Sierra Meat Co. in Reno, Nevada, and the company’s headquarters has been stationed there ever since. Reno is where Chris Flocchini, the company’s president and chief operating officer, handles the top of the ever-expanding umbrella that includes wild boar caught in Texas and elk raised in New Zealand. “Looking at it from an industry perspective, it’s been profitable for the producer and the marketer,” John Flocchini said. “It’s kind of a sweet spot. Everyone is making good money and the product is moving.” Business is good, life is good, the beasts are happy. But is it almost time for John to pass the bison baton? “We’ve started to look around,” he said. “We might have to dip into the nieces and nephews and see if there are any takers.” The five daughters John and his wife, Gaylynn, share haven’t shown any early signs of interest. But why give it up, why retire now? When reflecting on the opportunities and experiences the family business has given him, he immediately talked about a hunting trip with Bruce Bochy, manager of the San Francisco Giants. One mutual friend lead to another and over a four-month period, Flocchini hunted with Bochy, sat in his office at AT&T Park and met Giants legend Willie Mays. “We’ve been blessed, all of us,” he said. “The community in Wright and Campbell County has been good to us and we’ve been good for them. I’m approaching 60, but I don’t plan on leaving soon. I love it.” ——— Information from: The Gillette (Wyo.)

How ‘Green Giants’ Use Sustainability To Grow Sales by Bill Roth on Wednesday, Oct 26th, 2016 Corporate Responsibility Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) “Green Giants” author Freya Williams with Earth 2017 Founder Bill Roth. The business case for sustainability is already made. Author Freya Williams’ book, “The Green Giants,” documents the growing trend of companies achieving at least a billion dollars per year in green product sales. These companies include Costco, which sells over $4 billion in organic food annually, and Walmart, which annually sells $1 billion in products that achieve high scores on its internal Sustainability Index. The question every business leader should ask is: How can I reshape my company to realize this revenue growth opportunity? The six factors that drive green sales success In “Green Giants,” Williams identifies six factors common to companies with at least a billion dollars in annual green product sales. They are: Leadership. Commitment by a senior leader, especially the CEO, is the foundational step common among Green Giants. In these companies, sustainability is not just a staff function. Sustainability is central to the CEO’s vision. And it’s integrated into the entire business strategy. Disruptive innovation. Green Giants use sustainability to drive innovation. Sustainability drives their use of lean manufacturing tools to achieve goals like zero-waste manufacturing that reduce both costs and environmental impacts. Sustainability drives these firms’ use of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, solar or the Internet of Things to win customers while also addressing problems like global warming. A poster child for this trend is Tesla and its disruptive solutions in solar, batteries and AI technology that enable zero-emissions autonomous driving. Purpose beyond profit. Purpose sells, especially among millennials. Williams calls this the Purpose Paradox: “The purpose paradox is that companies with a purpose beyond making money end up making more money!” Patagonia is a prime example: The outdoor gear giant built intense loyalty with millennials by focusing on what’s best for the environment rather than what is best for selling more product. Built in, not bolted on. Sustainability is not a staff function for Green Giants. It is integrated into every function within the organization. Increasingly, it is being integrated into every job. Incentives. Sustainability performance and work associate compensation are tied together for Green Giants, especially for the CEO. This moves sustainability from a nice-to-have to a business imperative. It makes sustainability a core motivation for work associate performance. Mainstream appeal. Green Giants are pioneering marketing innovations. These companies reshaped their marketing messaging to communicate how their products taste better, make consumers feel cool or save money. The mainstream appeal message focuses on what sustainability can do for the consumer in terms of his or her goals and aspirations. New behavioral contract. Green Giants are pursuing a business culture based on transparency, responsibility and collaboration. The revenue growing mantra is “behaving your way to billions.” I call this social media authenticity: Today’s consumers are deciding what to buy based on what fellow their friends, work associates, and companies and NGOs post on social media. This is the new form of advertising in the 21st century. Today’s business brands are defined by authenticity earned through what Williams calls the “new behavioral contract.” Exclusive interview with “Green Giants” author Freya Williams If your company is searching for revenue growth — and what company isn’t — then this exclusive interview with Freya Williams taken at Sustainable Brands 2016 is a must-watch. In this video, Williams outlines best practices that will grow sales by making a difference.

By Vicki Terwilliger / Published: October 26, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     NICK MEYER/STAFF PHOTO Renee Warner, owner of Petals, Pine Grove, puts together flower arrangements at her shop on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016. NICK MEYER/STAFF PHOTO Renee Warner, owner of Petals, puts together a flower arrangement Monday at her shop at 146 S. Tulpehocken St., Pine Grove. PINE GROVE — Renee Warner’s late mother, Marilyn Murray, thought her daughter’s favorite flowers were yellow lilies. When Renee, and her Pine Grove native husband, Clint Warner, were preparing to wed in Las Vegas, her mother sent a dozen yellow lilies to her for the special occasion. As it turns out, the Texan was hoping for calla lilies instead. A southern drawl during the translation somehow turned “calla” into “yella,” Renee Warner recalled Monday in her Pine Grove floral shop, Petals. The Warners, two Air Force veterans lured by Pine Grove’s small-town charm, returned to Clint’s Schuylkill County roots to launch their new business venture and incorporate Renee’s southern flair. They began operating the floral shop in rented space at 146 S. Tulpehocken St. in January and expect to move to a new borough location they purchased before the end of the year. “I have a different style. It’s a little bit big and over the top. I’m from the South,” Renee said, as she designed bouquets with pink stargazer lilies and David Austin cabbage roses, which hail from Texas. Most flowers are bought through a wholesaler and come from Ecuador or Colombia this time of year, with a few coming from Texas or California, she said. Renee’s sister, Julie Simmons, Texas, also moved here to assist with the business. Clint, a retired F-15 pilot, now works at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center. They have two children, Sarah, 12, and Jacob, 10. Petals is currently the only florist in the borough. Carol Donati, former operator of Carol’s Flowers, located up the street, had previously retired, according to Renee. “It’s such a nice, small town,” Renee said. “He’s from here. He and I were both in the Air Force, and we met in Okinawa, Japan. When we were in Japan, we talked about our retirement and what we wanted to do.” Renee served as an air battle manager in the Air Force before pursuing her interest in event planning and floral design. She said her grandmother, the late Doris Vines, had operated a nursery and her late mother had worked there doing landscaping. Her father, Jerry Wyatt, still resides in Texas. His parents are Frank and Linda Warner, Pine Grove, and Robin Schwalm, who now resides in Colorado. In late December, the Warners hope to move to the shop’s new location, across the street at 165 S. Tulpehocken St. They purchased the building that was previously a hair salon and used to be Pine Grove’s penny candy store, she said. Another salon remains next door. The Warners were expected to close on the building Nov. 22. Petals will remain open at its current location during the transition. “I’m really excited about it. Next year, I think I may be doing root beer floats for Halloween,” she said, noting each year the Pine Grove downtown businesses usually provide something special for trick-or-treaters. This Monday, Warner will transform her current front store window into an “Under the Sea” theme and will pass out Goldfish crackers to trick-or-treaters from 6 to 8 p.m. The 146 S. Tulpehocken St. business formerly housed H.L. Long Hardware. Renee said Carron Morrow, an event planner from Montgomery, Alabama, is her mentor. She’s planning to assist Morrow with a wedding on Nov. 5, where Lionel Richie will serve as the entertainment. Renee taught Floral Design 101 during continuing education classes at the University of Alabama in Montgomery, she said. The couple resided in Alabama and Virginia before moving their family back to Pennsylvania. Col. Peter Doak, who formerly operated Pine Grove Area’s JROTC program when Clint attended high school there, made the trip to Virginia during her husband’s retirement ceremony, Renee said. She hopes to offer workshops on wreath-making after the new shop opens and offer a line of Tyler, Texas, candles. (Many of them have a floral scent.) Petals has been busy this fall, providing floral arrangements and bouquets for weddings every weekend this October, she said, including one recently at Sweet Arrow Lake County Park. The floral shop provides altar arrangements for churches and bouquets for formals, proms, funerals and all occasions. Deliveries, with a $35 minimum purchase, are made to the Pine Grove, Williams Valley and Tri-Valley areas. Petals is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday; from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday; and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. It is closed Wednesdays and Sundays.

Vicki Terwilliger / Published: October 26, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ELIZABETHVILLE — A new owner has assumed possession of an Elizabethville shopping plaza for $1.25 million, according to the Dauphin County Recorder of Deeds office. RJB Jr. LLC, 3600 Old Gettysburg Road, Camp Hill, purchased the Lykens Valley Shopping Center from Kocher Enterprises Inc., 510 Union St., Millersburg, on Aug. 31. The deed information was recorded at the courthouse Sept. 26 and signed by James M. Zugay, recorder. The plaza, at 4868 Route 209, has CVS Pharmacy at one end; state Department of Transportation Driver’s License Center at the other; and Consignments Unlimited, the Chinese Wok restaurant and the former Happy Saver Surplus Grocery in the center. It’s situated on 8.658 acres in Washington Township, Dauphin County. The Wal-Mart Supercenter, 200 Kocher Lane, is a neighboring business. “The sale of the shopping plaza does not affect the Elizabethville Driver’s License Center. It will remain in its current location,” Alexis Campbell, community relations coordinator for PennDOT’s Driver and Vehicle Services, said Tuesday. Details about plans for the plaza, as well as current and future tenants have been difficult to obtain. According to the Pennsylvania Department of State Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations, Robert Beaudry is listed as the registered “organizer” of RJB Jr. LLC. A woman answering the phone at RJB Jr. LLC referred calls and emails to Dusan Bratic, who she said was representing Beaudry. A call last week and Tuesday, as well as an email Tuesday to Bratic went unanswered. Efforts to reach Beaudry via Realtor Derrick Dougherty, of Marcus & Millichap, Conshohocken, were also unsuccessful. Dougherty said he would pass along an email inquiry from The Republican-Herald, but it was up to the client, whom he did not identify, if that client wished to respond. Upper Dauphin Area School District Business Manager Mary Bateman, as well as Washington Township officials, also had no further information about the new owner, just the listing as RJB Jr. LLC. According to the deed’s certified end page, as a result of the sale, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was expected to receive $12,500; with the Upper Dauphin Area School District and Washington Township receiving $6,250 each for the real estate transfer tax. Frederick W. Kocher, president of Kocher Enterprises Inc., signed the deed. Ben Kocher, listed as Secretary/Treasurer of Kocher Enterprises at www.companiespa.com, had no comment when reached by phone Tuesday. The tracts of land in the sale are designated as 66-008-032; 66-008-034; 66-012-074; and 66-012-132. “It is intended that the premises above described be consolidated into one tract for taxation purposes with the designation of Dauphin County UPI 66-008-034-00-0000,” the record states.

This day and age, to perform the most rudimentary civic act — voting — is as painless as walking to and from your mailbox. That's it. Little forethought or physical exertion necessary. But three Colorado College alumni are kicking it up several notches by biking across the country to psych up swing-state voters during the election season home stretch. Midway on their westward journey, Benjamin Feldman, Jamie Daudon and Meredith Bird (disclosure: they're friends of the author) rolled into the Springs last weekend to spend some days volunteering for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which locally and around the country, is digging deep for the final push. The trio, whittled down from the original crew of five who set out from Maine, spent a day registering voters outside the Walmart off Academy Boulevard and another canvassing in the southeast part of town. After a restful day of regrouping and planning, they set off again toward Las Vegas. That's been the standard itinerary, more or less: Bike through swing states, stop for a day or two in certain critical cities, bust butts volunteering for the local Clinton campaign, maybe get a beer and/or burger, then hit the road again. So far, they've averaged about 80 miles a day with about 30 pounds of food, clothes and spares in their panniers. And if all keeps going according to plan, they'll make it to northern California before election day, having committed hundreds of voters to show up in what some anticipate will be one of the lowest turnout cycles in recent history. Among the least stoked about this election are young voters who, according to the Pew Research Center, make up just under a third of the electorate but suffer, this cycle especially, from pervasive "mehh." Even Bird, who dreamt up and organized the ride, admits she wasn't always this enthused. A self-described "Bernie Bro" during the primary, she had her qualms about the eventual Democratic nominee's relatively tepid progressivism. "Every day of the trip, though, I become more supportive and more confident in her ability," Bird says, adding "I'm definitely more pro-Hillary now than just anti-Trump." Daudon was in the Clinton camp from the get-go, which he acknowledges wasn't exactly popular amongst his peers. "She's not the most exciting candidate for people our age, I get that," he said. "But it's cool to show up at these local offices where most of the volunteers are older folks, mostly women, and we're pumped about volunteering. They get so excited." And for good reason: Millennials were a driving force in the movement that put Barack Obama in the White House. Then in 2012, when the President asked Americans to keep him there, the younger generation once again obliged. According to exit polls, 60 percent of voters under 30 cast their ballots for Obama in his re-election compared to the 48 percent of voters that age who expressed support for Clinton in a mid-September poll done by CBS and The New York Times. To up that number, the Clinton campaign has deployed a formidable array of Millennial-friendly surrogates like the timelessly poised Michelle Obama, populist firebrand Elizabeth Warren and man-of-many-memes Bernie Sanders. It helps too that the Democratic candidate has adopted some of her former opponent's policy proposals and even the language he once used to describe them. Her stump speech is chock full of references to "making the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top" — a blatant Sandersism designed for progressive appeal. click to enlarge Riding Hills for Hillary Was that a friendly or aggressive honk? Certainly, these young bikers name priorities like addressing student debt, corporate power and climate change, which, since primary season wrapped, get some play from their candidate and absolutely none from her opponent. They're reasonably confident that if elected, Clinton could move the needle on those issues, but, like her predecessor, the greater unknown is whether and to what degree she actually will. "It's different with Hillary than Obama because with him I feel like there was this expectation for radical change and with her it's not really there," Bird says. "So while it's clear to me that she's the right choice, we're definitely going to have to hold her feet to the fire to make sure things actually get done." As far as efficacy goes, the bikers readily admit their sweat-powered, cross-country approach is hardly the most impactful. After all, they could have worked more directly for the campaign, recruited and organized an army of volunteers and hustled them through long days of canvassing and phone-banking all summer. Friends of theirs who took that approach may have more influence over the outcome and a neater line on their resumé to boot. But the "Riding Hills for Hillary" trip has a mission that's as much social as it is political — to bring people from distant points on the political spectrum together for roadside conversations that, hopefully, refresh their understanding of the "other" side. "The exposure to different viewpoints has been the most valuable part of the trip, for sure," says Feldman, who cites a particularly memorable canvassing stop in Milwaukee that had him going door-to-door in a massive affordable-housing complex. "I was talking to all these poor black folks who initially were Trump supporters because of his stance on gun control," he says. "I feel like I got a way more nuanced understanding of their need to protect themselves while also being able to share a lot about why his 'tough on crime' stance, history of housing discrimination and getting endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard makes him not a great candidate for what they're concerned about." Daudon, too, remembers a conversation with a McDonald's employee that veered into tearful territory. "She had an 'Ohio Women for Trump' hat on, so I asked her about it and she started talking about how she didn't want to be working there but her husband's health care had gone up so much since Obamacare," he recalls. "And I could see how frustrated she was and how she couldn't imagine continuing on this trajectory for another four years, then there's this strong man saying he can fix everything and she believes him." The trio can't say whether they've actually swayed anyone's beliefs along the way, but they have surely come to respect other perspectives better, and that's what they're hoping to broadcast to their followers. "A huge part of this whole shebang is making it accessible to other people," says Bird, citing their blog, ridinghillsforhillary.wordpress.com, and Instagram, @RidingHillsforHillary. "A lot of people following us are our family and friends in liberal circles that always reinforce their own opinions," she says, "so we're putting up reports of the conversations we're having and what we're finding on the ground to get them in touch with different viewpoints." The ride has had its share of low points — like 19 stitches in Nebraska and all those flat tires — but the slog will undoubtedly be worth it, the trio says, no matter the election outcome. And though none has intentions of working in professional politics, they all see a lot of on-the-ground work to be done during the four-year stretch between elections that this race, at least in theory, is all about. After all, the finish line ahead is just another starting gate. More Local News » Tweet "The exposure to different viewpoints has been the most valuable part of the trip, for sure." Speaking of...

Durham Ranch helps elevate niche market for bison meat Associated Press | GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) — A bison's physical makeup is a symbol. With its large head and stout horns, it takes on challenges head-on. It does not cower in the presence of danger. It is a brooding force on four solid legs, strong and steady, radiating power and grace. A bison is a product of a generational herd. It knows the meaning of survival and that its strength is in numbers. They are mighty, yet guarded, hidden among the great plains of North America, thundering through grasslands hundreds of years after a near extinction. On a clear and crisp day, John Flocchini stood on a hill overlooking his 2,800 bison as they grazed on the Durham Ranch. He swiveled his head slowly as the sun reflected off his black-tinted sunglasses, looking west over the rolling hills. He's a long way from his hometown of San Francisco. California might be where he was born, but he was made in Wyoming, right here on the ranch. Along with his bison, he has thrived and survived, reported the Gillette News Record (http://bit.ly/2e55GES). The origins of the Durham Ranch In the late 1800s, Armando Flocchini Sr. immigrated from Italy to California when he was a young boy. Growing up in the Bay Area, he started working at a local business called Durham Meat Co. The owner at the time took a liking to Flocchini, enjoyed his work ethic and dedication to the company. Flocchini later became a partner in Durham and eventually bought out the company in the 1930s. In the 1960s, Flocchini and his thriving business wanted to expand. With common meats like the Durham shorthorn cattle coming in and out of the San Francisco company, the head of the business had an urge to move toward a more niche meat market. After months of searching for a plot of land, Durham Meat Co. found a 55,000-acre ranch near Wright, nestled among some of Wyoming's best pastureland. In 1965, Durham Meat Co. named the plot of land the Durham Ranch and it has been raising and producing bison in Campbell County since. Armando "John" Flocchini III, the ranch's owner and operator, recalls the day when he decided he wanted to work in the family business. He was on a third-generation hunting trip in Canada. He was 17 and playing hooky during the first week of his senior year of high school. An early graduation present, he called it. As they sat around a campfire, his father asked him what he was planning on doing with his life. "I fell in love with the ranch when I was a kid," Flocchini said. "Back in California, I would sweep the floors and package steaks as a kid. When my family took trips out to the ranch during the summer, I would stay with my grandparents for months at a time. I never wanted to leave." On those long summer days, John remembers working with his granddad, his mentor. "He taught me the whys and wherefores about ranching," he said. "I was doing everything from fencing to picking up rocks in hayfields just because I just loved it." After graduating with an agriculture degree from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California, John, the fifth of seven Flocchini children and the oldest boy, picked up and moved to Wyoming to take over the reins at the ranch. The bison market In the 1970s, there were about 30,000 bison roaming on American grasslands. About the same time, television mogul and bison rookie Ted Turner bought his first plots of farmland to raise cattle. The bison industry was small and had little growth for years. In the 1980s, a couple of things came together. Flocchini said one was Turner's purchase and involvement in the industry and the second was a cooperative that was formed in North Dakota. Suddenly, there was a demand for bison that wasn't there before. But the demand was primarily for the breeding stock. The prices of the breeding stock started to climb to ridiculous numbers. "The prices were out of this world," Flocchini said. "But the problem was there was no real and true foundation for the meat market. There was demand, but it wasn't strong nationally." After a sudden issue with the cooperative and some poor weather, the industry all but crashed in 2000. Bison meat began to pile up in storage freezers and the whole market got backed up. Flocchini said Durham didn't have reason to worry as much because it operated both the production and marketing side of the process. "Most producers do not have that advantage," he said. "We controlled the marketing part of it, which is a nice place to be in." Around the country, prices dropped significantly, which was hard on a lot of people, but it also was an opportunity for a new foundation and a fresh start. A new foundation In 2002, Turner opened up his first Ted's Montana Grill in Columbus, Georgia, with George McKerrow Jr., the same man who founded the LongHorn Steakhouse. About that same time, supermarket giants such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods started buying up bison by the truckloads. The new foundation started to catch on. The bison industry and the major marketers went into a full promotion mode. They got the word out on how great bison meat is, how nutritionally valuable it is compared to beef and how healthy and flavorful the taste is. "While it was relatively low-priced in the marketplace, consumers were being re-introduced to bison and it took off," Flocchini said. "It gained a super floor to where now, it's a popular product coast to coast." In fact, Turner's interest and success in the industry started to grow so much that Flocchini and Durham sold Turner his first 1,000 head to start one of his larger ranches in Montana. While bison is considerably pricey today, the demand is staying strong for it. At Whole Foods, ground bison sells for $10.99 a pound and strip steaks sell for $25.99 a pound. Sam's Club offers bison in the form of steaks, hot dogs and even ground chuck. "We, as an industry, are pretty confident that we're not going to have the same issue we had in 2000," Flocchini said. "We have the market now, which wasn't established back then." Since the crash, bison demand has only gone up. Dave Carter, director of the National Bison Association, said the carcass price for bison in 2004 was $1.60 a pound. Over the course of seven years, the price skyrocketed to $4 a pound and two months ago, the per-pound price was as high as $4.65. With the price of bison nearly doubling from January 2009 through June this year, Carter said that the industry needs commercial-scale ranches like Durham to keep up with demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the increase in bison prices outpaces a 42 percent increase for similar beef grades, a 41 percent rise in pork and an 18 percent rise for chicken. "When John says that the industry has had a good four, five years since 2011, I think he's being too modest," Carter said. "We've seen slow growth since at least 2004 and we see both the demand and the fair market price lasting a very long time." Carter said the average American eats about 55 pounds of beef a year. Of that beef, bison contributes a mere 0.08 pounds. "So even if Americans tripled their bison intake, it'd only be enough for a Quarter Pounder for each person at the dinner table a year," Carter said. There are about 90 million cattle in the United States and only 500,000 bison. Durham Ranch contributes about 3,000 of the 60,000 bison that are processed a year. To compare, cattle are processed at a rate of 125,000 a day. "We're in a growth mode," Flocchini said. "We're marketing somewhere close to 3,000 animals a year, close to 50 or 60 a week." Since Durham and its parent company have taken off, they have been partnering with other companies around the country because they can't grow enough of their own for the demand. "It's a great problem to have," Flocchini said. Bison can bring in twice as much money as beef, and Carter said they can't keep up with demand. "We're still a very small business," Carter said. "But the demand is growing and we're constantly looking for ranchers and producers to help us raise and harvest buffalo." The bison craze Producers, innovators and cooks around the country are finding new ways to get bison on plates in a number of ways. Chefs in Austin, Texas, are selling bison and bacon bars, Elon Musk's brother is serving grass-fed bison tartar in Colorado and Patagonia, the global adventure outfitter, recently launched its own grass-fed buffalo jerky, made from buffalo that roam the wide-open prairie on Dan and Jill O'Brien's Cheyenne River Ranch. "We're in a niche market," Flocchini said. "Right now, these specialty products are really popular. It's fitting really well with the CrossFit folks, the paleo diet folks and people who want that leaner, more tasty meat." Like all meat, bison is rich in protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and other nutrients. The National Bison Association promotes it as having only 2.4 grams of fat and 143 calories in 3.5 ounces cooked, compared to 8 grams of fat and 200 calories in a piece of "select" beef. Bison meat is also promoted as a great source of omega-3 fats. With the new school of thought emerging in the bison industry and the lure of a more holistic and organic meal, there seems to be two trains of thought: the grass-raised, grain finished or pure grass-fed. Durham Ranch finishes its bison on grain for two reasons. One is so that when someone buys bison meat with the Durham Ranch label, the taste will be consistent. The second reason is so that Flocchini is allowed to market fresh product year-round. "Most grass programs are seasonal," he said. "They have to put stuff in the freezer because they're not in the kind of condition to be a year-round producer. That's what this grain finishing helps us do. It's a numbers thing and a product quality thing." Bison grow to market size much more slowly than cattle. Putting them on a diet of grain for the last three to six months of their lives helps speed up the process. The drawback is that grain-finishing causes a rapid decline in omega-3 levels. "We harvest our animals in the field with a mobile harvester. That way, we can pull right into the field where the animals are comfortable," O'Brien said. "We don't get those high cortisone or stress hormone levels in our meat like you do in industrial harvesters. We harvest humanely unlike anywhere else." The Durham Ranch harvests its animals in Colorado under USDA inspection. While both philosophies have their pros and cons, Carter said it is vital for the bison industry that the two co-exist. "It is extremely important that both the 100 percent grass-fed way and the grain-finished way thrive while the demand is high," he said. "We don't see it as if they are competing against each other. All we ask is that there is honesty across the board when it comes to telling our customers where the meat comes from." Whether consumers are eating their bison off toothpicks at a farmers market or by the pound at their local supermarket, Carter believes the two methods are important to the industry. "We encourage consumers to simply tell us what is important to them when they buy," he said. "The diversification of the market is key to our success." The future In 1986, Durham Meat Co. bought Sierra Meat Co. in Reno, Nevada, and the company's headquarters has been stationed there ever since. Reno is where Chris Flocchini, the company's president and chief operating officer, handles the top of the ever-expanding umbrella that includes wild boar caught in Texas and elk raised in New Zealand. "Looking at it from an industry perspective, it's been profitable for the producer and the marketer," John Flocchini said. "It's kind of a sweet spot. Everyone is making good money and the product is moving." Business is good, life is good, the beasts are happy. But is it almost time for John to pass the bison baton? "We've started to look around," he said. "We might have to dip into the nieces and nephews and see if there are any takers." The five daughters John and his wife, Gaylynn, share haven't shown any early signs of interest. But why give it up, why retire now? When reflecting on the opportunities and experiences the family business has given him, he immediately talked about a hunting trip with Bruce Bochy, manager of the San Francisco Giants. One mutual friend lead to another and over a four-month period, Flocchini hunted with Bochy, sat in his office at AT&T Park and met Giants legend Willie Mays. "We've been blessed, all of us," he said. "The community in Wright and Campbell County has been good to us and we've been good for them. I'm approaching 60, but I don't plan on leaving soon. I love it." ___ Information from: The Gillette (Wyo.) News Record, http://www.gillettenewsrecord.com © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

My Money Blog Early Retirement Investing Guide Money Saving Tips Credit Card Rewards Advertising Disclosure List of Free Movie Streaming Sites Online October 25, 2016 By Jonathan Ping 6 Comments If you are a cord-cutter but are still looking for some free movie content to stream, here is a collection of (legal) links. Shortly after I had kids, I dropped Netflix as I had no time to “binge” on anything. However, I still like to watch bits of movies now and then to relax and take my mind off of things. Vudu Movies on Us. This Wal-Mart-owned service just announced that they will allow “thousands” of movies to stream freely online with ads. The catalog isn’t great, but sample titles include Margin Call, Mad Max, True Grit, Abduction, and School Of Rock. Streams at 1080p with Dolby Digital sound. Yahoo View (formerly Hulu Free). This is where a lot of the free content that used to be on Hulu now resides. TV shows include Blindspot, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Chicago Med, and Empire. Limited movie selection as well. Crackle.com. This one has been around for a while, and they even have a few original series of their own. Some Seinfeld. I always watch the newest episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. Popcornflix. An interesting collection of movies that you might not see elsewhere from independent distributor Screen Media Ventures, LLC. Lots of big stars in their movie flops. Several cheap Disney knock-offs. Also… Inspector Gadget! Free Documentaries (various). Unfortunately, many of these free documentary sites have lots of sneaky pop-up ads while mostly just embedding YouTube and Vimeo videos. The least annoying ones for me were Documentary Heaven and WatchDocumentary.org. PBS.org. PBS shows many independent films and documentaries in their Indie Film section. You can also find the classics here like PBS Newshour, Frontline, Masterpiece Theater, This Old House, and Antiques Roadshow. Most of these are also available via their own smartphone apps (iOS, Android) and streaming box apps (Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Xbox 360). Please let me know if I missed anything good.

Mine gives me access to Hoopla Digital. Limited content but commercial free. They also have a good selection of DVDs. Reply Jonathan Ping says: October 26, 2016 at 11:39 am Thanks for the tip. I hadn’t heard of Hoopla Digital before, it looks interesting. I double-checked with my local library but unfortunately they don’t offer it at this time. Reply TJ says: October 26, 2016 at 12:56 pm Don’t most of the broadcast networks stream for free online? I watch free shows on CWTV.COM and CBS.com all the time. Reply JLH says: October 26, 2016 at 1:07 pm I cut my cable a couple years ago. I am on Netflix only. I’ve found that free services listed above don’t provide anything i want to watch. It’s also gotten to the point on Netflix where unless you like their “original” series they produce it’s getting harder to find things i want to watch on even Netflix. If my local cable company (mediacom) would allow me to choose what I want to watch and not have to pay for “regional sports package fees and taxes” I might go back to cable. If I’m watching sports I am usually at a local bar watching. Reply Trevor says: October 27, 2016 at 3:54 am Thanks for compiling this list – just had a look on Popcornflix.com and was surprised to see how many decent movies they have. That’s my evening sorted! Reply Scott W says: October 27, 2016 at 8:42 pm Thanks for these ideas. Now if I could get some free time to watch them. . .

Illuminators are pearlescent highlighters that when applied to your cheekbones, the inner corner of your eyes, under brows and center of the lips can make your face look brighter and more glowy. Who doesn’t want that? I tried two, one from organic cosmetics line Ilia and one from Hard Candy. With a face fill of makeup, I applied Hard Candy’s Illuminate & Strobing Mix-In Drops to the right side of my face and Ilia’s Polka Dots & Moonbeams to the left to better compare them. Ilia’s illuminator comes in a small, chubby stick. I had to apply a few light coats to my cheekbones with my fingers to notice a difference. I also applied some to the inner eye corner, on my brown bone and just above the temples. Hard Candy’s illuminator is a liquid with a drop applicator. I applied it to the same places as the Ilia. Hard Candy’s version was definitely brighter, but as it’s a liquid, it actually removed the makeup I had just applied. You can mix in some drops into your makeup or moisturizer, and that may be a better choice if you use foundation or concealer. Of course, if you apply makeup over it, I don’t know how much of the brightening effect would still come through. Ilia’s was comparatively subtle, but I liked that. My makeup stayed put, and I my face looked just a bit brighter, but in a natural way. And with 72 percent organic ingredients, I felt better about putting that on my face. Verdict: Ilia all the way. Illuminators and highlighting effects really can make you look brighter and more awake and refreshed. Try just a dab of light, shimmery eyeshadow in the inner corner of your eye next time and see what a difference just that one small change will make. For reals, y’all. Especially handy at work on mornings when you’ve been up too late the night before, um ... working. Smiley face. Details: Hard Candy’s Illuminate & Strobing Mix-In Drops, $8 at Walmart. Ilia Polka Dots & Moonbeams illuminator, $34 at iliabeauty.com. A bright face doesn’t really matter if the hair framing it is a total mess. Pai-Shau is a Canadian company that infuses its hair care products with a blend of various teas that’s supposed to help “strengthen, nourish and protect the hair.” Hair is dead tissue, so nothing applied topically will actually nourish it, but I’m all for whatever makes my hair look and feel better. I tried the Biphasic Infusion, Sublime Hold Hairspray, Royal Abundance Mousse and Style Soufflé (yep, some pretty high-falutin’ names.) First, all smelled great, with a sweet, musky sandalwood kind of scent. The fragrance does fade after an hour or so, but perfume purists may not like that first hour. The mousse, which I applied to wet hair, didn’t go on sticky and kept my hair in nice loose curls for two days. The hairspray, which went on actually pretty dry in a really fine mist, I’m sure helped. My hair felt styled, but not stiff. After a couple of days, I tried reviving my still-dry and unwashed hair with the Biphasic Infusion styling primer, which claims to “reawaken” hair’s natural bounce, soften texture and improve manageability. It went on pretty light, without leaving my hair greasy. My hair looked shinier, but as is the case with all leave-in conditioners and frizz controllers, my hair lost some body and curl. Enter the Style Soufflé, which I applied right after. The styling cream brought back a nice, piecey texture and some of my lazy, always-in-need-of-encouragement curl. A spritz of hairspray, and that lasted all day. Verdict: This line really delivers on its promises. It’s just a bit too pricey for me, but this stuff works. Details: Pai-Shau Biphasic Infusion, $45; Sublime Hold Hairspray, $29.50; Royal Abundance Mousse, $26; and Style Soufflé, $32, all at pai-shau.com. After all this, you need a great pout to finish off the look. I love traditional, creamy lipstick that doesn’t dry out my lips, but it fades so fast. Lip liner certainly helps with longevity, but I hate how drying it can be. I guess Glo Minerals developers had the same issues as they came up with a great, best-of-both-worlds lip crayon, both in matte and cream glaze and both packing some serious color punch. The Suede Matte Crayon (in Bombshell) left a really cool, modern finish. The crayon went on easily and lasted much longer than my normal lipstick. The Cream Glaze Crayon (in Bloom) had a richer, creamier texture, but it also lasted longer than my lipstick. Both come with a built-in sharpener — genius — and neither left my lips feeling dry. Verdict: I adore these, the matte especially. These will be gracing my lips for sure.

Wade John Paulisick Jr., 19, has been charged with felony criminal trespassing, terroristic threats, disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, and underage drinking following Friday’s incident. According to Warren police, officers were dispatched to 608 Prospect Street in Warren for an intoxicated male who had smashed out the victim’s vehicle tail lights, and then took off running. Police said the victim of the crimes was Paulisick’s father. Paulisick allegedly showed up the victim’s house uninvited early Friday morning with two friends. The victim told police that Paulisick was highly intoxicated and started a domestic situation before he was asked to leave. Paulisick then allegedly left the residence, and the victim drove Paulisick’s two friends home to Jamestown, N.Y. The victim was then at the Warren WalMart when, according to police, he received a call from his neighbor advising that his son had returned to the residence and was attempting to gain entry into the home by kicking the front door of the residence and was destroying property on the porch and lawn of the home. Prior to leaving, Paulisick allegedly punched the victim’s side tail lamp, smashing the lens cover, injuring his hand, before taking off running down Center St. Paulisick was then located at 113 Jefferson St., apartment B, after his father told police that was the location he had gone earlier when asked to leave. According to police, Paulisick was upstairs and could be heard from outside yelling inside the residence. Prior to police entering the apartment, Paulisick began coming down the stairs while yelling that he was not afraid to go to jail. Paulisick then postured to fight before falling down the stairs before. According to police, Paulisick was given orders to prone out on the ground, to which he complied. Police said Paulisick had a large amount of blood on his clothing, and had a very strong odor of alcohol emitting from his breath as he spoke with officers. Officers observed the laceration on his hand and contacted emergency medical services. A female who had taken Paulisick to the residence advised police that Paulisick was high (on drugs) as well, and she believed that he was “on meth” because he had asked her for some. Paulisick then allegedly stated to the victim, while he was being handcuffed, “When I get out of here, I’m going to smack the (expletive) out of you, you stupid (expletive).” The female then told police that she was scared that Paulisick would actually do this, and she was alarmed by the comment. Paulisick was transported by ambulance to Warren General Hospital, where he admitted to consuming alcohol and snorting cocaine all night before the incident, according to medical staff.

I am going to remember this next Election Day. — 50311 My wife and I recently traveled to visit my brother’s family in Naperville, Illinois.

I would be happier too. — Time for an exodus I quit paying union dues when I asked the ISEA representative if I could designate which candidate I wanted to support. Her reply: “We will determine whom to support.” So I kept my $800 for that year. Best dollars I ever saved. — Informed in 50473 I am so angry at the House and Senate members that I refuse to vote for any of the incumbents. They did nothing other than suck down their paychecks and did nothing to help this country. They looked out for themselves and their parties’ interest and not the American people. — Incumbents will not get my vote You know if someone feels the need to tell everyone that he’s a “real man,” he most likely isn’t. — No need to compensate in central Iowa A big thank you to the vendor (Muffin’s Dog Treat) at the Beaverdale Farmers’ Market. Her credit card reader was not working after a few attempts and she graciously gave me the product for free, even after many refusals to take. That’s Iowa nice for you.

Joe Heck is among the candidates in Senate races that "Wal-Mart moms" know little about. But they revealed, in a focus group on Tuesday, that they know a lot about the presidential race. (Bill Clark/Roll Call file photo) Alex Roarty @Alex Roarty Posted Oct 25, 2016 9:55 PM Save for later The Senate race in Nevada between Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Rep. Joe Heck is one of the marquee battlegrounds of 2016 — a contest that could determine which party controls the legislative body next year. And yet, with just two weeks before Election Day, a key bloc of voters doesn’t know much about the race, its candidates, or even whom they’ll vote for. “To be completely honest, I haven’t done enough research on either of them to feel like I have a final decision,” said China, a self-employed 29-year-old mother. “I’ve been so focused on the presidential debate that I haven’t done much research on the Senate.” China was participating in a focus group of so-called “Wal-Mart moms,” mostly middle-class, middle-aged women who describe themselves as undecided over the presidential race. It was held in Las Vegas and simulcast for reporters in Washington on Tuesday night. (Only first names were given for the 10 participants.) Down-ballot races across the country have been heavily overshadowed this year by the presidential race, which has consumed news coverage and attention spans nationally and in individual battleground states. Many party operatives working on Senate races, from both parties, complain about the inability to persuade the media to cover any congressional-race story not intertwined with the White House contest. What little the participants did know about the race was rooted directly in TV ads that have been run about the race. For Heck, several of the women cited his opposition to funding Planned Parenthood, a common line of attack from Democrats. For Cortez Masto, meanwhile, the group labeled her “corrupt” — Republicans have focused much of their efforts on raising questions about her eight-year tenure as the state attorney general. “It was not much else,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who talked with reporters after the session ended. “And we’re two weeks out.” Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster, said the participants knew “zilch” about the race. (Newhouse and Omero work for Public Opinion Strategies and Penn Schoen Berland, respectively, the two polling firms that conducted the Las Vegas focus group and another one in Charlotte, North Carolina, later in the night.) At the Charlotte focus group (which featured five married couples), the participants knew almost nothing about the North Carolina Senate race between Republican incumbent Richard M. Burr and Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. When the focus group leader pressed them about the contest, many started talking about House Bill 2, the state legislation that prevents transgender people from using bathrooms of their chosen gender identity. HB2 is a major issue in the state’s hotly contested gubernatorial race but has had relatively little impact on the Senate contest. When the moderator asked if Burr’s support of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump affected their vote, the group demurred. “It’s hard to say if you don’t know too much about them,” one man said.   Like Nevada, the North Carolina Senate race is one of the election’s top down-ballot battlegrounds. A win for Democrats would likely signal that the party will hold a majority in the Senate in 2017. The lack of knowledge about the Nevada Senate race contrasted sharply with what the participants know about the presidential race between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, which the ten women spoke about in detail for nearly 90 minutes. Newhouse and Omero each said the depth of knowledge of this year’s presidential contest was impressive, even compared to other presidential races in the recent past. Voters in Las Vegas expressed a deep frustration with both candidates. One woman called Clinton a “psychopath” and Trump an “idiot.” “Either way I’m going to walk out of that voting booth wanting to cut myself,” said Phelicia, 40, who added that she was undecided about the race. Asked how they would feel if Trump were elected president, the mothers didn’t hold back, using words like “ridiculous,” “OMG,” “shocked,” “laughing stock of the world,” “war,” and “embarrassed.” One woman named Codie, a homemaker, cited her religion as a reason she wouldn’t vote for Clinton. “I don’t believe a woman should run the country,” she said.  Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

The woman broke away and called police with a description. Officers searched the area and found Treshawn Jahmal Robinson, who matched the description.  Robinson also matched the description of the person seen in surveillance video from the Wal-Mart, which is not far from where the second incident occurred.  He was arrested on an assault offensive contact charge and taken to The Colony jail, KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported.  Anyone who believes they may have had an encounter with Robinson is asked to call police at 972-625-1887.

Hispanic woman: Co-workers used Trump images to harass Ryan J. Foley, Associated Press 5:39 p.m. CDT October 25, 2016 Alexandra Avila of Columbus Junction is seen in this undated photo provided by attorney Paige Fiedler. Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. (Photo: Associated Press) A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at a Coralville claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. Alexandra Avila’s co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an “illegal immigrant” even though she’s a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila’s computer’s screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: “How’s Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.” The Republican presidential candidate’s promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, 32, worked at Sedgwick for three years. She claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville from the beginning of Trump’s campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. “It’s been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,” said Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler. “His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn’t violate social norms anymore.” Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tenn.-based Sedgwick, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump’s 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: “Found Jesus — he stabbed me twice.” When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an “illegal immigrant,” drawing laughter from Avila’s boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying time cards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her “La Trumpa” and added: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” “Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience,” Fiedler says. After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned. 567 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2eOyph6 TOP VIDEOS Watch: Anti-Trump marchers say they protest to support victims of hate 0:40 Centennial downs Valley at state 0:51 Iowa Election Day #instastory 4:40 Rural Iowa voters boosted Trump, Republicans in election 4:49 East High students stage walkout of Trump win 1:02 Iowan born before woman could vote hopes for history 1:07 How Clinton used Iowa as a stepping stone for campaign 0:38 How Trump wooed Iowa votes with nontraditional campaign stops 0:43 Justin Martin’s funeral procession travels through Rockwell City 0:23 Final Call for Des Moines police Sgt.

(Trevor Aikman/CBC) Related Stories Regina daycare centres fight property tax change City of Regina approves tax exemption for Highland, Tartan curling clubs Tax holiday for Frontenac apartments going before city council The Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare and Normanview Daycare are appealing a decision which upheld their city tax increase in Regina. The Saskatchewan Municipal Board will hear the appeal on Tuesday. Five non-profit daycare centres operating in former houses had their tax class changed by the city from residential to commercial earlier this year. Regina daycare centres fight property tax change This resulted in taxes being doubled and, in one case, tripled. For example, the Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare went from paying $3,500 to $8,000. "They (daycare centres) pay the same kind of taxes that any other business like Wal-Mart or Tim Hortons would pay. It's very difficult for these little daycares because they are small, non-profit daycares," said Colleen Schmidt board member for the Cathedral Area Co-operative Daycare. "This is a very, very devastating tax increase." Colleen Schmidt, board president of Cathedral Area Cooperative Daycare, said daycare spaces are in danger due to a property tax increase to $8,000. (Trevor Aikman (CBC)) First appeal denied In March, the centres appealed the increase at the Regina Board of Revision and were denied. The Cathedral and Normanview daycare centres are now appealing that decision in front of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. Their argument is the city failed to treat all daycare centres the same during its assessment. For example, 20 daycare centres operating inside schools did not have their tax status reviewed. These daycare centres do not pay property tax because of their locations in the schools. The centres appealing the decision say that is against the Cities Act and the City of Regina should not be taxing some daycare centres and not others. "No daycare ever wants to think about the idea of cutting spaces but financially, if it's necessary, it might be something the daycare might at some point have to consider," said Schmidt. Schmidt said with Saskatchewan trailing other provinces in the amount of licensed spaces, making the timing of this increase even more problematic. "It's extremely important the daycare community stand up and express the difficulties they are having staying in business or we will lose spaces," said Schmidt. Curling rinks or daycare centres Tax exempt status is not part of the appeal but Schmidt said her group will be going to the city hoping to get in front of council to try and get daycare centres on the exempt list. The city provides tax exemptions to a number of different organizations and buildings. This year two Regina curling clubs received property tax relief for 2017 and 2018. Regina's Highland, Tartan curling clubs receive tax exemption "Curling is great it serves what purpose it does but daycare is in an entirely different league. It is essential. Without daycare people don't go to work," said Schmidt. Comment from the city The City of Regina provided a statement to CBC.  "We're aware of today's appeal, and await those results — we want to be sure everyone is treated fairly, paying their fair share and not more or less than that," the statement said.  "We're pleased that the provincial government is reviewing the legislation on this issue. When that review is complete, we'll know more about what options municipalities will have available." Decision expected in two months or less The Saskatchewan Municipal Board is hearing the appeal of the appeal to the Regina Board of Revision. If the municipal board disagrees with the initial decision, it has the power to make reverse the city's decision. A spokesperson for the board says a written decision is typically submitted in 60 days or less from the appeal hearing.

According to ABC7 News The “inappropriateness” of the kit went viral on social media with several posts: “Hi Walmart, I would like to know which part of this is a suitable costume for anyone. Self harm isn’t a ‘scary costume’ for all to wear.” “This is disgusting that Walmart would attempt to sell this; trying to push SUICIDE AS A COSTUME. Mental illness is no joke.” Self harm scars aren’t something fun to add to a costume. Self harm is the result of an abundance of self hatred and mental health issues.” In response, Walmart issued this statement: “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” The third-party seller listed for the suicide scar was BlockBuster Costumes, LLC. Walmart.com continues to list other costumes from that company.       Filed in: National/World News, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Print Your Favorite Patio The weather will be beautiful soon, and you may want to enjoy dinner and drinks outside.

Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville, Iowa office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. (Alexandra Avila/Paige Fiedler via AP) IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at an Iowa claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. Alexandra Avila’s co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services — where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees — began calling her an “illegal immigrant” even though she’s a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila’s computer’s screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: “How’s Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.” The Republican presidential candidate’s promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump’s campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. “It’s been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,” said Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler. “His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn’t violate social norms anymore.” Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit. Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump’s 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: “Found Jesus — he stabbed me twice.” When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an “illegal immigrant,” drawing laughter from Avila’s boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying timecards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her “La Trumpa” and added: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” “Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience,” Fiedler says. After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned.   Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

We tend to think that some of the outrage gets a trifle overdone. Other people irked by some of the dress-up clothes mass manufactured for Oct. 31 have a point. Sometimes things that were once considered OK by the masses aren’t any longer. We imagine that many a child of yesteryear dressed up as an “Indian” for example — something that has since fallen clearly (and justifiably) under the heading of cultural insensitivity. Then there was the ill-considered “Tranny Granny” costume that’s been pulled this year already from Amazon and Wal Mart, for obvious reasons. Having seen pictures, we can’t imagine this would have been a great seller anyway, quite aside from its perpetuation of outdated gender stereotypes. And speaking of outdated gender stereotypes, past years have, also justifiably, seen parents of little girls upset by a couple of legitimate issues. These are, one, a lack of superhero costumes for girls, and two, a plethora of really inappropriately suggestive get-ups. On the first, why shouldn’t a girl get to be a superhero if she wants to? She shouldn’t have to be relegated to the sidekick role. There’s plenty of little girls who will want to be princesses for Halloween, but for those who want to be Spiderman, or Superman or Batman, it should at least be an option. On the second, who wants to send their seven-year-old out in fishnets, or a naughty maid costume? And yet, these are actually sold for young girls. It’s not cute, it’s just really uncomfortable. Let’s stick with age-appropriate. But by far the worst thing we’ve seen so far this month is the press release from Children of the Street Society, begging parents not to send their children out trick-or-treating as a pimp or a ho. It’s horrifying that there are enough parents encouraging or allowing this that such an organization felt the need to send out a media release. What parent thinks it would be fun to send their kid out dressed as someone in the sex trade? It’s not funny or clever or edgy. It’s just sad. And beyond bad taste.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Patterson said she was fired from her job there after attempting to stop a shoplifter from hurting a fellow employee. Patterson had worked at CVS in Redding for nearly 20 years. Posted: Oct. 24, 2016 43 Comments SHARE By David Benda of the Redding Record Searchlight Posted: Oct. 24, 2016 43 Vikki Patterson believed she was protecting a co-worker when she confronted an alleged shoplifter inside the CVS in west Redding earlier this month. The company feels otherwise. Patterson, a CVS employee for nearly 20 years, said she was fired for violating company policy. "I found out Friday but not through anybody from work. I found out when I tried to sign on to try and see my benefits online and noticed some stuff was missing," the 47-year-old Patterson said Monday. Patterson called human resources and was told she no longer had a job. A CVS spokesman said the safety of the store's customers and employees comes first during a shoplifting or robbery. "We do not comment on specific security policies because we do not want to undermine them. However, the actions of Ms. Patterson endangered everyone who was present during the incident at our Redding store, including customers, her co-worker and herself," Mike DeAngelis, CVS's senior director of corporate communication, wrote in a prepared statement emailed to the Record Searchlight. Patterson has received a ton of support on Facebook after posting her story Friday afternoon. As of Monday afternoon, the post had been shared 237 times, had 649 likes and 427 comments. What's more, a "CVS Pharmacy: Reinstate Vikki Patterson" campaign has been posted on Facebook along with other supportive posts. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 12. Patterson, a manager in training, said she was preparing to close when she noticed two women stuffing merchandise into a purse. She went over to ask the pair whether they needed help then called out, "security to the camera room," a tactic Patterson said is used to scare off shoplifters. The women indeed exited the store, leaving the merchandise. Patterson thought the crisis was averted. "One stayed outside cussing and yelling the whole time," Patterson recalled. But her partner came back inside and confronted Patterson about calling for security before going back to the aisle and filling her purse with what Patterson said was about $300 worth of merchandise. "My cashier told me she's loading her purse up," Patterson said. "So I go towards her and said, 'you need to leave that stuff there' and she starts running." The woman ran toward the door where the cashier was standing. "I'm trying to get to the door before she slams into my employee," Patterson said, "and that's when the struggle happened. I mean, the video is bad because I was trying to protect myself — she was hitting me." The scuffle spilled outside the store before the woman was able to drive off with her partner. Patterson and her co-worker called police, who finally caught up with the pair. Amber Walworth, 31, was arrested, according to police and remains in the Shasta County jail on $150,000 bail. She was also wanted on a previous charge of robbery out of Anderson, Shasta County Superior Court records show. Patterson believes she did not violate CVS' "shoplifter apprehension guidelines," which she says lists five things to do before confronting and apprehending a shoplifter. The policy also states "CVS/pharmacy has a 'hands off' policy relative to shoplifting apprehensions." "I looked up apprehend in the dictionary. How are you supposed to apprehend without touching her?" Patterson said. Redding police Sgt. Les James said law enforcement won't tell businesses how to deal with would-be shoplifters. They leave it up to the store. "Each company has its own policy regarding interacting with shoplifters," James said. Patterson has applied for unemployment benefits and is waiting to hear if she qualifies. She is a sole provider. Her husband, Robert, is on disability. "I don't know. I have had such a great outpouring from everybody concerned," Patterson said about her future plans. "I am not quite sure. I haven't been unemployed in 18 years. Things are different from when I was younger." About David Benda Business reporter David Benda has been a journalist for nearly 30 years, including stints as a sports editor and copy editor.

Photo by Paul Mobley By Mary Ann Bourbeau RED BANK – After a devastating highway accident that nearly took his life, comedian Tracy Morgan is back, and he never takes one day for granted. “It feels great to be alive,” he said. “I’m glad I’m still funny.” His current national tour is called “Picking Up the Pieces,” which is exactly what he has done since the June 2014 crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, when a Walmart truck crashed into the limo van he was riding in. The accident left Morgan with multiple broken bones and a traumatic brain injury, and took the life of his close friend, comic James McNair. “It’s called ‘Picking Up the Pieces’ because my life was shattered after the accident,” he said. “My family was really shattered too. But I’m not crying about it. The accident was only one piece of my life. I have a wife and kids and a life outside of show business.” Morgan will talk about his experiences and his life when he performs two shows at the Count Basie Theatre on Friday, Oct. 28 at 7 and 9:30 p.m. “God gave me the gift of a sense of humor,” he said. “I love to see people smiling and laughing. On stage, when I’m making people laugh, that’s when I feel close to Him. I hope when He welcomes me into his Kingdom, he says, ‘You did a good job, Tracy.’ ” Morgan’s recovery was a long road, but the Saturday Night Live alum, who later starred for seven seasons on the NBC show “30 Rock,” now has several projects in the works. He recently finished production on “Fist Fight,” in which he stars alongside Ice Cube and Charlie Day. He will also take on the role of comedian Redd Foxx in the Richard Pryor biopic “Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?” opposite Mike Epps. “I’m truly honored to be asked to be a part of it,” Morgan said. “I pray that Mr. Foxx will give me the strength to do him justice because he’s such an icon.” It was announced this week that Morgan will return to television with a still-untitled TBS comedy series in which he will star along with Key and Peele’s Jordan Peele. Morgan plays an ex-con, released after 15 years in prison, who is shocked to see how much the world changed while he was gone. He is also slated to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this year. “That’s what I always wanted, to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and I achieved it,” he said. “When I’m long dead, my great-great-grandchildren will see my name there. That means more to me than anything in show business.” While Morgan will likely discuss the accident and his long road to recovery during his stand-up routine, he declined to give any specifics about the material. “I’m not tipping my jokes,” he said. “Just come see me be funny.” Tickets are $29 to $49.

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 25, 2016 at 2:30PM Image source: Getty Images. In its third-quarter 2016 report issued on Oct. 20, electronic payments provider Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT) posted revenue growth slightly below the pace set in the first two quarters of the year. Yet in comparison, the company achieved a considerably higher operating margin. Let's examine both the revenue moderation and the drivers behind Euronet's margin expansion, beginning with a review of key highlights from the company's filing: Euronet: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2016 Actual Q3 2015 Actual Growth (YOY) Revenue $524 million $481 million 8.9% Net income attributable to Euronet Worldwide $61 million $31 million 97% Diluted earnings per share $1.11 $0.57 95% Data source: Euronet Worldwide, Inc. 8K-filing, Oct. 20, 2016. YOY = year over year. What happened with Euronet this quarter? Euronet's EFT processing segment recorded brisk revenue growth of 28%, to $152.6 million. EFT processing benefited from a larger ATM network, which has expanded by more than 8,000 ATMs in Europe and India versus the end of Q3 2015. EFT processing will net further top-line gains in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, on Oct.10, Euronet completed the acquisition of U.K. ATM network operator YourCash Europe LTD. With this purchase, Euronet will add 5,000 ATMs across the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands to its arsenal. Surprisingly, the YourCash ATMs generate less than half the operating margin of Euronet's existing European network. These ATMs will appear on Euronet's financials beginning in the fourth quarter, and management has signaled that it will move quickly to add value to the YourCash transaction stream. Following a trend in recent quarters, Euronet's epay segment experienced a marginal revenue decline of 4%, to $167.2 million. Revenue from epay may remain lackluster for a few quarters as management works to effect a shift from declining mobile airtime top-up services to more lucrative digital services, which include the sale of content and gaming products via retail locations. The company's third segment, money transfer, achieved revenue improvement of 9%, a considerable deceleration from the revenue growth seen in both Q1 2016 (25% increase over the prior year) and Q2 2016 (22% increase over the prior year). While Euronet's RIA subsidiary is still posting double-digit growth through its remittance partnership with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the segment's foreign exchange subsidiary, HiFx, was held to single-digit growth during the quarter, as forex trading volumes of the British pound have been subdued following the U.K.'s Brexit vote.  Also in money transfer, executives noted that currency subsidiary XE will migrate its processing from a competitor to HiFx's platform in November, which should improve operating margins in the segment. Overall, though Euronet's revenue improvement slowed relative to the first half of the year, operating income margin increased handsomely, by roughly 270 basis points, to 17.3%. This is partly attributable to an annual effect: In the third quarter, peak European tourism brings higher margin traffic and transactions to the company's continental ATM network, pushing EFT processing profits higher. In addition, management cited a focus within epay on transactions with more lucrative margins, if lower volume, during the third quarter, thus benefiting total operating income. What management had to say For those following Euronet from quarter to quarter, it's clear that epay remains the segment with the most long-term revenue uncertainty. During Euronet's post-earnings conference call, executives discussed in detail various initiatives to replace mobile airtime top-up transactions with newer services. The following is a description of the current efforts, provided by CEO Mike Brown: "Our epay team continues to focus on expanding its non-mobile content presence. As we told you last quarter, our gaming partners are focused on rolling out more gaming content across our retail partner base. During the quarter, we experienced a 65% year-over-year growth in gross profit in the gaming category and we have excellent momentum as we enter the fourth quarter where we will see seasonally stronger sales of the non-mobile products. We have also maintained our focus on expanding our digital content distribution. In the US we launched Apple music sales through PayPal and eBay. The new Apple music codes are sold as a subscription base gift cards similar to that of the Netflix digital codes that we launched last year. We also signed agreements to distribute digital gift codes for Blizzard, the publisher of games such as World of Warcraft and StarCraft across Europe. And we expanded our relationship with Netflix for digital code distribution across the US and more of Europe. In India, we signed an agreement with Google to digitally distribute Google Play codes, this is Google's first digital distribution agreement in India and we are pleased to add this to product portfolio." Data source: Seeking Alpha transcript, Oct. 21, 2016. Moving forward Euronet's fourth quarter will be characterized by operational execution. The company will both absorb its YourCash acquisition and complete the XE processing migration to HiFx. In this workhorse context, executives have targeted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share at $1.07, which would translate to a decent 16% leap over Q4 2015. While shareholders shouldn't expect a huge variation from this earnings target, it's conceivable that revenue could resume the faster growth trend seen in the front half of the year, boding well for the coming quarters as we head into 2017.   Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo: Jim Alcorn) 641 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Toys “R” Us is counting on Kendall, Emerson, Camille and other new dolls from the American Girl toy line to draw shoppers to its stores during the holiday season and throughout the year. The Wayne-based retailer announced its partnership with Mattel Inc., which owns the American Girl brand, at the end of August, but kept details under wraps until this week, when it rolled out American Girl boutiques in about 100 of its stores nationwide, including the Toys “R” Us in Deptford. Toys “R” Us’ current strategy for revitalizing its stores involves giving shoppers products and experiences they won’t find at other places that sell toys, in particular at the company’s top rivals, Walmart and Target. Toy industry analysts, when the American Girl deal was announced, said the premium brand could also give Toys “R” Us a “classier” image. Mattel is hoping its partnership with Toys “R” Us, as well as a distribution deal with Kohl’s stores nationwide, will boost American Girl sales, which have slipped in recent years. The store in Totowa, in Passaic County, opened its boutique Monday for a media preview. The remaining New Jersey stores — Deptford,  Paramus, Secaucus, Freehold and Eatontown — will hold grand opening events Saturday for the American Girl boutiques, featuring giveaways and the chance to win a doll. Some shoppers at the Totowa Toys “R” Us did a double-take upon seeing display of American Girl dolls, which previously were sold only online and in American Girl flagship stores. “American Girl! What are they doing in Toys “R” Us?” was the reaction of shopper Stella Quigley of Clifton, who has bought the dolls in the past for her 10-year-old granddaughter. “I was very surprised to see that,” said Quigley, who was at the Totowa store Monday. Quigley’s granddaughter has 10 American Girl dolls, and Quigley was looking to see if Toys “R” Us had the new Girl of the Year doll to add to the collection. Toys “R” Us won’t be selling the Girl of the Year dolls, but Quigley said she might visit the store again to look for accessories for her granddaughter’s dolls.

They are the Truly Me line, which are dolls that come in about 100 different combinations of hair color and style, and skin color, so a child can pick the doll that most resembles her; and the Wellie Wishers line, which are smaller, 14.5-inch dolls intended to appeal to younger girls, and are about half the price of the traditional 18-inch American Girl dolls. The Wellie Wishers dolls are priced at $59, while the Truly Me and other American Girl dolls cost about $120. Mayra Moncayo-Baez, a mommy blogger from North Bergen, brought her two daughters — Hailey, 7, and Alyssa, 5 — to the unveiling of the Totowa boutique, and the girls each picked out a Wellie Wishers doll to buy. Moncayo-Baez said she likes the smaller dolls because they are easier for girls to carry around. She also likes the lower price tag. “I love the American Girl brand, but it is kind of pricey,” she said. The American Girl brand also began selling Wellie Wishers dolls, and its 2016 “Doll of the Year” in 1,100 Kohl’s stores nationwide this year. American Girl dolls were a hot property for little girls growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the company has struggled in recent years to reach new generations of little girls. In 2015, Mattel reported that sales of the brand had declined by 7 percent from the previous year. The company said several of its girl brands had suffered from a lack of creativity and it has brought in a new management team to turn the brands around. It also attributed the sales decline to the introduction of the Truly Me line. The Wellie Wishers line was created in response to complaints by parents that a lower-priced option was needed, and that line is credited with boosting American Girl sales in the most recent quarter. The company reported last week that sales of the brand were up 14 percent for the third quarter to $125.5 million. A Toys “R” Us spokeswoman said that while Kohl’s also sells the Wellie Wishers and other American Girl dolls, Toys “R” Us will be the only retailer authorized to sell the Truly Me dolls and to have American Girl boutiques within its stores. The boutiques will have Toys “R” Us employees who have been trained to sell American Girl dolls and to answer questions about the brand. American Girl dolls were a favorite gift of doting grandmothers willing to spend $100 or more on a doll and clothes and furniture. The first dolls depicted girls growing up during various periods in American history, such as colonial times, or the Depression, and included themed accessories and story books about their lives. The brand was so popular at one point that Target sold a line of lower-priced knock-off doll furniture sized to fit the American Girl dolls. The American Girl brand was launched by a catalog and mail-order company called The Pleasant Company in 1986. Mattel acquired the brand in 1998. According to Mattel, close to 30 million American Girl dolls have been sold since 1986.

Interestingly, industries are calling their concept “smart manufacturing.” Many of the daily applications that we use come from industrial uses, and they are also inspiring industries. Monitor machines with sound Bosch, a German-based car parts producer, has teamed up with seven other German giants on a project that monitors the routine of machines or “corrects” the logistics hiccupss. The micro sensor is pivot here as it senses whether the machines is operating correctly simply by listening to the mechanical sounds. If the machine is not working as planned, it begins to vibrate and sounds different than usual. The sensor compares the signals with stored profiles and notifies corrections which are implemented by other parts of the system. Bosch claims once the project is completed and becomes operational by the end of 2018, it can save 30 percent of the operating costs. A powerful tool for individual tasks, but some of the parts on our phones perform similar tasks. They are called MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) sensors — small gadgets conveying physical motions into electric reactions. We can hardly imagine life without them — the micro gyroscopes in our smartphones can sense we are turning them and then rotate the screen to fit our reading. The capacitive sensors in the screens can also feel whether our fingers are touching them and command the right apps to work. Bosch is making use of these MEMS sensors for sound and vibration feeling, which can not only diagnose operations but also correct by themselves as the vibration sensor would convey the redundant motions into electric energy. As the project was still under development, Bosch was not willing to elaborate except that the sensors will be integrated into conventional factories and that the project was sponsored by the German government, which has invested 3.84 million euros (US$4.17 million). But what was clear was that industries were adapting commonly used sensors into machines to boost efficiency and profit. Store information in colors Last month, Guangdong Broadcast & TV Network Group set up set-top boxes at its warehouse. The boxes are attached with colorful quick response codes, batches of which are recorded by a scanner. Previously, they had to be done manually, which would take up a lot of time. The color codes, substituting the barcodes which were previously used to identify the boxes, can now be decoded by a software that has boosted the logistics speed. How does one read the massive codes? Lou Jian, technology director of Colorcodes, said the software is similar to Apply Pay and WeChat that scans quick response codes for information about goods or to make payments. But while they read one code at a time, Lou’s team added a “loop” command that “repeatedly searches codes filmed on the screen and decodes until all of them are recorded.” The colors, on the other hand, enhance accuracy as the scanning software sorts out information about how they are grouped on the code patterns, rather than what barcode readers do, to decipher numbers based on the widths of the bars. While barcodes don’t work when tweaked or stained, the color codes can still read as long as the arrays of colors aren’t disorganized. Massive code reading earlier was dominated, or almost monopolized by RFID, the radio-frequency identification technology, which has helped Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by profit, for a decade on streamlining its supply chain. By sorting out radio frequencies of chips installed in the goods, hundreds of them can be recorded at a time within 100 meters by the scanner. But its cost was hindering industries for long — prices of the RFID scanning devices range from US$500 to US$2,000 each, while the chips cost up to 15 cents each. Even Walmart hasn’t finished the overall upgrading of its supply chain system, as a host of retail store workers are reluctant to pay for and put those chips into all their products. The barcode we use every day in supermarkets costs only a slice of paper for printing. Why not change it for industrial uses? By changing the way to read codes and adding an algorithm command of “loop,” Colorcode has come out with a middle solution between the properties of barcode and RFID technology. The colorful codes will be presented by LED lights, each of which costs less than 0.1 yuan if one buys at wholesale rates. But its software reads codes only within 50 meters, capturing 500 codes at a time. It can decode even when the objects are moving — at 150 meters per minute — equivalent to our walking speed. Apart from the set-box business, it is also working with a Zhejiang-based police institute to upgrade its transport system, which would allow the traffic cameras capture all the information about the vehicles passing by a block. People then won’t have to wait at police stations for hours or days to find the car in which they lost their baggage by reviewing the monitoring videos. Simply inputting some properties related to that vehicle it can be traced in seconds from the database. The company research leader, also a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, has been conferred funds from the National Natural Science Foundation to develop the “Internet of Things” in the country. “Speed and amount are the key issues for industrial operations. Once hundreds of parts are commanded by the deft use of smart apps, the result can be huge,” Lou said. “That was our idea to start the project.” Simatics system Siemens, the German-based industrial giant, is also enhancing sensors to streamline its industrial operations. Its Simatic control system — the name combines “Siemens” and “Automatic” — aims to integrate the mechanical parts to lower costs and upgrade the machines for self-maintenance. At its Amberg-based and Sichuan-based digital device centers, thousands of sensors work real time at the plants, enabling 100 kinds of products to be produced in each of the lines. The qualification rate is more than 99.99 percent. Normally among 1 million products, fewer than 10 is defective. “That’s not all,” said Chen Jiangning, director of Industry 4.0 project at Siemens. “In fact when the lean operations start, it never stops upgrading. In many cases they are figured out by workers there from their daily experience. You might hear that a welding command is modified based on a worker’s suggestion, or an assembling tactic is added to a sensor with the help of workers.” However gigantic industrial systems are, the details are enormous. Sensors ensure the smooth passage of operations. The industrial upgrades mirror how we improve our daily life. The sensors function similarly, but extended into machines, they will become the driver of the productivity of this era.

By Josh Kolm October 25, 2016 Metro is testing the online grocery shopping waters at three stores in Quebec before rolling out the service elsewhere. First announced early this year, the service will be available at two locations in Montreal and one in Laval. After a customer makes purchases online, employees dedicated to online shopping in the store will choose the freshest available version of the product. The purchases are kept in a dedicated, climate-controlled area of the store to ensure freshness until they are given to the customer, who can either pick them up in-store or have them delivered to their home. Described as “Phase I,” delivery will initially be available to customers in a selected area east of Highway 15 on the Island of Montreal. The results of Phase I will dictate how Metro deploys online shopping elsewhere in Quebec and in Ontario. The addition of online shopping is part of an ongoing digital strategy at Metro, which has included a revamped website and new apps on mobile devices and wearables. Some form of online grocery shopping has become an increasingly popular initiative for retailers. Loblaw’s and Walmart, as well as niche retailers like M&M Food Market, have “click-and-collect” options for fresh food at select locations. Sobey’s began rolling out a delivery option to complement its own pick-up service earlier this year, while Longo’s Grocery Gateway delivery service has operated since the late 1990s. Other retailers have partnered with third-party delivery services like Urbery or Instabuggy, while Amazon has been long rumoured to be planning a launch of its U.S. fresh food delivery service in Canada, and has been testing a pick-up option this year by partnering with local convenience stores. According to this year’s BrandSpark Canadian Shopper Survey, only 8% of Canadians have tried online shopping for groceries. While that may be due to the fact that most options are new or have limited availability, 25% said they would be “somewhat likely” to try an online shopping and delivery option from their regular store, 10% said they would be “very likely” and 9% said they definitely would. That’s compared to 56% of respondents whose responses ranged from “somewhat unlikely” to “definitely would not.” One of the main deterrents to online grocery shopping, according to the survey, was concerns about the quality and freshness of the food, with 45% of those surveyed saying they would buy most groceries online, but not fresh products. Among those who said they wouldn’t shop online for groceries, 72% said they wanted to see the food they buy, with 54% saying they are concerned about the quality of fresh food. “We have made every effort to ensure that customers make no compromise with respect to the freshness of the products selected, that they find all the products they are looking for online as they would in-store and that they receive their order at the most convenient moment for them,” said Marc Giroux, SVP at Metro, in a press release.

Baweja joined Flipkart in September 2014. A Flipkart spokesman said Dec. 31 would be Baweja's last day at the company and the search for a replacement had begun. Flipkart, launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, sells a wide range of products from mobile phones to suitcases and cosmetics.

From a federal funding crisis to the resignation of a chairman and a general manager to the reinstatement of Saturday bus service, there was a lot for local leaders to catch up on during City Council meeting this week. Glenn Steffens, who has served as site manager since July, summed up many of the changes at Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) during Monday's meeting. "As I'm sure you're all aware, STARS has had a lot of challenges in the last year," Steffens said. Saginaw bus system in jeopardy due to federal funding dispute He referred to flaws in a Federal Transportation Authority triennial review that resulted in $1.8 million in federal funding for the authority being temporarily withheld. "STARS was very close to being shut down," Steffens said. "Fortunately, many here in Saginaw rallied together." 'Putting the pieces back together' Federal funding to STARS was later restored, although both General Manager Sylvester Payne and Board Chairman Daniel LaPan resigned in the wake of the crisis. Through collaborative efforts by Saginaw officials, state lawmakers and federal officials, and with help from Flint's Mass Transportation Authority (MTA), the new site manager said STARS has been "putting the pieces back together." "But we still have a lot of challenges ahead," Steffens said. He thanked the Saginaw voters who, in August 2015, approved a millage renewal request to continue local funding support for the transit system. Steffens acknowledged how many must have felt when STARS approved dramatic cuts to bus service less than three months after that election. "I understand that there were some harsh feelings after much of our routes were cut, from 11 to 7, after the millage renewal," he said. "I'm here to also offer STARS' current commitment to not cutting services, but rather maintaining and looking at expanding services, and doing so responsibly, taking one step at a time." 'Saturdays are here to stay' One recent change aimed at improving the damaged relationship the authority has with the community was the restoration of Saturday bus service, which began alongside a 25-cent fare increase on Oct. 1. Saginaw bus system bringing back Saturday services, routes to Walmart The new $1.50 fares help support the restored Saturday bus service, which runs from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. each Saturday, and the on-demand LIFT ride services, offered from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. Steffens assured city leaders that the decision to bring back Saturday service took into account the authority's financial realities and was a long-term decision. "Saturdays are here to stay," he said. Another small "thank you" from STARS to Saginaw citizens, Steffens said, is a commitment to provide free bus rides on Tuesday, Nov. 8, the day of the upcoming general election. "Election Day is free ride day here at STARS," he said. "Whether you need to go shopping or get out to vote, which I would highly encourage everyone to do so." Saginaw bus system offers all riders fare-free service on Election Day Buses will run later than usual — until 8 p.m. — and the authority has also committed to provide all voters rides home from the polls, even if long lines mean they are there later than 8 p.m. Money 'left on the table' With limited funding options provided to STARS through federal and state sources, the citywide 3-mill property tax levy and fares, Steffens said the authority is looking elsewhere for revenue. "STARS is currently looking into maximizing our funding options," he said. After he took the reins in July, Steffens said he has identified federal and state dollars "that have been left on the table" in the past. He said the authority is working with Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and FTA officials to "recoup some of that money," preferably in a lump sum that can be used to replace at least a portion of the system's aging bus fleet. "What that means is we might be able to get a good shot in the arm and get some buses on the road that are brand new," Steffens said. "That's a big goal of mine." With several buses that are up to 20 years old, he estimated about 25 vehicles need to be replaced as soon as possible. But the authority is also addressing issues on the expenditure side of its budget. "We've eliminated some tiers of management," Steffens said.  He said staffing changes are expected to result in "a couple thousand dollars in savings" in the STARS budget. Steffens credited the authority's current staff for doing more with less and taking all the recent changes in stride. "The staff over at STARS is doing a fantastic job," he said. "We've been cut down to the bone and the people that are left are the people who really care. And they're working very hard to service this city." New route planning Another change coming down the road for STARS, Steffens said, is the result of a reestablished planning department, which has set its sights on reexamining the system's bus routes. "The routes that we have currently, they're based on what the city was 30 years ago," he said. "This city is not what it was 30 years ago. People have moved, business locations have changed, the needs have changed and STARS needs to address that." Steffens said planners hope to create a "train-proof" route system that will only rarely need to cross the city's railroad tracks, which often contribute to delays. "Those are one of our biggest hold-ups," he said. Bus riders saw delays of 15 minutes or more earlier this fall, when students returning to school overwhelmed the system. Steffens said staff has worked through that issue and assured city leaders that buses are now, on average, running less than five minutes behind. 'Getting creative' with partnerships The next big issue to tackle for STARS, he said, would be identifying "new revenue sources" to help extend services the system offers while still living within its means. "We're getting creative," Steffens said. "We're looking at new partnerships; partnerships with businesses, with universities." He said a recent pilot project funded by Saginaw Valley State University to ferry students between the school's campus, local retailers and their apartments, was "very successful." Steffens said STARS is also reaching out to the state's Community Ventures job program to see if the authority could provide a self-sustaining "ride to work program." "These are the bridges to providing new service, to opening up routes," he said. "But we need to be very careful to temper our expectations, given the limited resources and the limited buses that we have." Steffens was thanked for his efforts by several members of City Council Monday. "I'm excited about the changes," Councilwoman Brenda Moore said. 'Starting to move forward' Mayor Pro Tem Floyd Kloc praised Steffens and others involved in the recent changes for "taking charge." "It sounds very encouraging," Kloc said. Mayor Dennis Browning, who was appointed to the STARS Board of Directors earlier this year, congratulated Steffens and the rest of the authority's staff for creating what he called "a new beginning" for the community's public transit system. "It has just been so exciting to see what's happening with STARS in the last several months," Browning said. "We are no longer treading water. We are starting to move forward." Though a lot has changed in a very short time, Steffens assured city officials that he and other leaders at STARS are carefully considering possibilities before making any decisions. "I'm here to reassure you that, although some people might say STARS is moving pretty fast, it's very deliberate," he said. "We're being very careful that we're not going to overextend ourselves."

Ashers refused to create a cake (pictured above) with a "Support Gay Marriage" slogan, and an image of Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. The request was made by a homosexual rights activist identified by BBC News as Gareth Lee. The bakery has served Lee in the past, Arthur told the court, but he turned Lee down because of the cake's message. That business decision mirrors other ethical situations, such as a Kentucky print shop that refused to print t-shirts for a homosexual pride event. A judge ruled last year that Blaine Adamson and Hands on Originals had turned down other orders that conflicted with his religious beliefs and therefore ruled in his favor. The Human Rights Commission in Lexington sought to punish Adamson, and the Ashers' case was similarly prosecuted by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission.  More recently, bakery employees at a Wal-Mart in Georgia refused to bake a "Blue Lives Matter" cake because they considered the theme racist. A second Wal-Mart store in Louisiana refused a Confederate flag-themed cake requested by a customer. The next decision for McArthur is to drop cakes from his business or make a final plea to the Supreme Court, says Dr. Sharon James of the Coalition for Marriage. "This Christian business would not do anything to compromise their beliefs," she says of McArthur and the family-owned bakery. "They've stood firm all the way through this." Meanwhile, says James, the McArthur family has won the respect and admiration of others during the two-year legal battle. "Who disagree with their religion and disagree with their beliefs," she says, "but say that they should have the right to follow their conscience." The decision of the appeals court, meanwhile, is that there is no such right. "The fact that a baker provides a cake for a particular team, or portrays witches on a Halloween cake, does not indicate any support for either," the Appeals Court claimed in its ruling, the BBC reported.   Praising the Appeals Court decision, a spokesman for a homosexual rights group said ironically that "faith is important but faith cannot set aside equality legislation that has been long sought." The senior judge accepted that Ashers didn't know Lee was homosexual and therefore didn't discriminate against him due to his sexual orientation. But the court insisted the bakery should have approved the cake's message anyway. "Which is even more alarming," says James, "because the law is being used to force people to endorse a message with which they disagree."

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Ari Levy Oct 25th 2016 11:50AM Mark Lopreiato was thrilled when he was invited to promote his Forearm Forklift on ABC's "Good Morning America" last month. The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach 4.5 million viewers for free doesn't come around often. Lopreiato appeared on "Buy it and Try It," a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience. The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan, which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butter.

After viewing a commercial for the product, ABC's Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavy-duty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with it. "I was pretty impressed," Spencer said to the crowd. You'd think such a shout-out from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiato's 18-year-old family business.

Jewelry Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – But this is Amazon.com's world, and Forearm Forklift, like so many brands, is uncomfortably inhabiting it. Once a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen big-box retailers including Wal-Mart, Target and AutoZone, Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price. When "Good Morning America" viewers go online to buy a set, which retails between $20 and $25, odds are they'll be purchasing someone else's product. "It just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs," said Lopreiato, 48, whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York. "It's almost like winning the lottery if they choose our item." Forearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread. The company is down to 21 full-time employees from 52 at its peak and recorded less than $500 in profit last year. Annual revenue in 2008 topped $4 million and has since plunged 30 percent. Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaper. Photo: Jeniece Pettitt, CNBC Lopreiato has diversified his product line, adding a harness for the shoulders, a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes. But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm Forklift. Meanwhile, Lopreiato bears the costs of workers' compensation, product quality control, commercial insurance, mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloaders. "We're competing with people who are stealing our brand, stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property," Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his 20,000-square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Amazon's growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage. The counterfeit problem, in particular, goes largely undiscussed by CEO Jeff Bezos and ignored by investors and analysts. The stock has climbed 37 percent over the last 12 months making Amazon the world's fourth-most valuable company, and 89 percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy more. SEE ALSO: The 10 best places to retire with only a Social Security check Heading into the Seattle-based company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday, investor focus is on Amazon Web Services, Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities, in their earnings preview, called Amazon "one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today." Conversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction. Since CNBC.com began reporting on Amazon's budding counterfeit issue in May, we've spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiato's, but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from Amazon. Lopreiato, an Army veteran and father of two middle-school daughters, said he felt compelled to tell his story. "If Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us, he'd do the right thing," he said. "It's not that he's a bad guy. It's that there is, in my opinion, a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales, increase sales, increase sales. That's wonderful. That's the American way. But do it right." EXPLORE MORE: The 21 largest US cities ranked by ease of building wealth Amazon's obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift. In trying to provide the lowest-cost option for virtually every product on the planet, the company opened the doors to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property, despite an anti-counterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic items. That's enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon market. Some big brands have voiced their concerns. Birkenstock said in July that it's no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in 2017. Last week Apple sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site, claiming the products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety." Amazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike, Hasbro and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee. Third-party sellers are getting suspended in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers, sparking outrage from merchants who say they're being punished for Amazon's inability to control counterfeiting. "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this space." The company didn't offer a comment on Forearm Forklift's situation. Until now, Forearm Forklift has been forced to self-police the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed. See an infringer? Send a cease-and-desist letter. Suspicious of a counterfeit? Buy it, and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken down. Repeat, repeat, repeat. And pray it works. On the second floor of Forearm Forklift's warehouse, Lopreiato opens a closet filled floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases. Inside each, supposedly, is a version of his product. There's no subtlety. The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and co-workers moving washing machines, armoires and exercise equipment. Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin, too short, have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker material. Lopreiato said he's submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to third-party sellers and takedown notices to Amazon. But go to Amazon today, and infringers are easy to spot. One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts. Among the attached photos is one of Mark's wife moving a mattress. In a July 2015 e-mail to Amazon's patent team, Marty Proops, an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account, said he and Lopreiato had identified 53 separate sellers offering infringing products over the past year. Buyers who assume they're getting the real thing are dismayed when the product can't possibly help them move a 300-pound refrigerator. Thus, Forearm Forklift has one-star reviews from customers calling it a "cheap knockoff (don't purchase)" and "very obvious counterfeit." "That posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think we're offering fakes," Lopreiato said. He never expected this to be easy. He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didn't want dollies rolling across new wooden floors. Carrying items by hand meant bending down with 200-pound appliances to get through doorways. Lopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in 1998 and had so little money that he lived in the office. He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekends. For 12 years, Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers. He forged deals with companies ranging from U-Haul and Home Depot to Ross Stores andCanadian Tire. He was on QVC every two months or so starting in 2003, selling more than 20,000 Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak. He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year, but it was never a big part of his business, representing under 2 percent of revenue in 2008. Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition, knowing that patent protection only goes so far. But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaught. The slide started in 2010. He got a call from an Amazon employee, saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the business. Lopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes. He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldn't compete with those prices and still make money. Amazon was unhappy with that response, and within weeks there were more than 100 knockoffs on the site, Lopreiato said. "Since that date, it's just been absolutely downhill," he said. Over the past six years, Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that they're leaving. He forwarded a number of e-mails from the past two years, where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help. In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklift's business, Proops wrote in June 2015, "Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffs!" Responses ranged from terse to deflecting. Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic e-mail addresses copyright@amazon.com and patents@amazon.com. Other e-mails suggested that the company was looking into the matter, but then the account would move to another representative. In July 2015, an Amazon lawyer told Proops by e-mail that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the third-party sellers. "At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action," he wrote. C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers, said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustration. "Amazon's responses are very erratic," said Rosenbaum, who recently published the "Amazon Law Library," a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform. "You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing, and submit the same exact thing again and just fail." For Lopreiato, legal action presents an expensive option with little upside. Individually going after infringers, who he'd first have to track down, would require more time and money than he's got in the bank. He filed one case in 2013 against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trial. Taking on Amazon directly has been a nonstarter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contacted. More than anything, he needs Amazon's help. With traditional retailers sinking fast and more retail and wholesale activity shifting to Amazon, Forearm Forklift now counts on the site for about 12 percent of revenue, a number that's growing despite the flood of counterfeits. A tiny number of additional orders rolled in after the "Good Morning America" appearance, even though Lopreiato is certain that far more went to the knockoffs. Similarly, a Facebook page called Impressive Things posted Forearm Forklift's commercial earlier this month, generating 909,000 views and counting. Again, more revenue for the fakes. On Friday morning, Lopreiato received a particularly discouraging call. Aafes, a retailer targeting military communities, had been planning to buy Forearm Forklift for 120 of its stores. The representative handling the deal was calling Lopreiato because an Aafes executive had discovered lookalikes on Amazon for a much lower price. He e-mailed a screenshot showing two different sellers using Forearm Forklift's photos (including the one below) to promote their products, one for $8.09 and the other for $11.24. Lopreiato is all too familiar with this routine. He replied with a lengthy apology and offered assurance that the cheaper products are fakes. He gave his standard "buyer beware" pitch, explaining that the knockoffs are low quality, unsafe and uninsured. He's not at all confident that it will be enough. In a text message on Friday afternoon, Lopreiato wrote, "Another prospect will probably be lost."

 Amazon is about to become the biggest clothing retailer in the US Hayley Peterson Oct. 25, 2016, 12:14 PM 15,292 facebook linkedin twitter email print An ad for Amazon Fashion. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's to become the biggest apparel seller in the US next year, according to a new 58-page report from Cowen & Co. The shift would represent a huge shake-up for the apparel industry, which has long been dominated by department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and JCPenney, as well as big-box retailers including Walmart and Target. Amazon is a relative newcomer to the fashion world, and it has made a swift rise to the top. The company's clothing and accessory sales are expected to grow nearly 30% next year, to $28 billion, according to the Cowen analysts. Macy's apparel sales, by comparison, are expected to drop 4%, to $22 billion, in the period. As Amazon's sales grow, so will its share of the apparel market in the US. Amazon currently claims about 6.6% of the market. That share is expected to increase to 8.2% by next year and further expand to 16.2% within five years, according to Cowen analysts. By 2021, Cowen expects Amazon to generate $62 billion in annual apparel sales. TJ Maxx is expected to be the No. 2 clothing seller, with $26 billion in sales, and Macy's is expected to claim the No. 3 spot, with $23 billion in sales. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York men's fashion week. Macy's is losing market share to Amazon. David Ramos/Getty Images The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and Vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well merchandised and highly curated — not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. Amazon's weaknesses with curation were highlighted in a shopper survey conducted in July by Cowen & Co. "Amazon Fashion got a very lukewarm review for site personalization and ease of use," Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a conference call on Tuesday. Shoppers said it "wasn't particularly easy to browse." Amazon also has the disadvantage of having no brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers can try on items or return purchases, he said. So why do people choose to shop on Amazon for clothes? Amazon Prime is the biggest lure for customers, according to Cowen & Co. Shoppers cited the convenience and free two-day shipping as the biggest advantage of shopping for clothes on Amazon. They also praised Amazon's customer service and breadth of product reviews.

Terre Haute Assistant Chief of Police Shawn Keen says they arrested 28-year-old Benjamin Selig of Rockville on a felony count of assisting a criminal. They also arrested 25-year-old Kathleen Featherstone on charges of felony murder, robbery, and burglary charges. Police say additional arrests could be made as the investigation continues. Just after 11 p.m. Monday the body of Matt Luecking was discovered in a bedroom on Jackboot Court. That's inside the Village Quarter apartment complex at State Road 46 and Poplar Drive on Terre Haute's eastside. Terre Haute Police say initial observations of Luecking's body indicated that of a homicide. After a brief search of the area couldn't turn up the victim's car. Police then issued an advisory to surrounding agencies; they say within an hour Vermillion County Police informed them that two men tried to use Luecking's credit card and identity at the Walmart in Clinton. Walmart loss prevention became suspicious of the two males when one of the individual started looking for the identification in order to sign for the purchase. When the pair left the store they inadvertently left behind the ID belonging to Luecking. Walmart provided the license plate number of the pairs get-a-way vehicle along with security video to Terre Haute Police; with that information the agency went to the home where the vehicle was registered. Once on the scene police noticed the duo loading item's into Luecking's Chevy Cobalt. Police arrested 24-year-old John Collins, of Terre Haute. Collins faces a murder charge. The investigation continues. Matt Luecking worked at Terre Haute Savings Bank. He was also a known Disc Jockey on Terre Haute's WFNB 92.7 and he operated a entertainment and DJ Business. Luecking was well-known in the Wabash Valley. He often appeared at public events, including many ribbon cutting ceremonies for the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce, where he served as an ambassador.

A positive reaction to the latest batch of earnings news may contribute to early strength on Wall Street. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Monday amid news on the merge-and-acquisition front. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session, ending moderately to notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 77.32 points or 0.43 percent before ending at over a 2-week high of 18,223 and the S&P 500 Index closed 10.17 points or 0.47 percent higher at 2,151, also a 2-week high. The Nasdaq Composite Index ended at 5,310, up 52.43 points or 1 percent. Among the sectors, retail and semiconductor stocks gained ground, but gold and oil service stocks moved notably to the downside. Twenty-one of the thirty Dow components closed the session higher, while nine stocks retreated. Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were among the biggest gainers of the session. On the economic front, the flash estimate released by Markit showed that its manufacturing PMI rose to 53.2 in October from 51.4 in September, while economists expected a reading of 51.4. The Chicago Federal Reserve's national activity index improved yet remained depressed in September. The index rose to -0.14 from -0.55. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are slipping $0.09 to $50.43 a barrel after ending Monday's session down $0.33 at $50.52 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,270.40, up $6.70 from the previous session's close of $1,263.70. On Monday, gold fell $4. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 104.78 yen compared to the 104.18 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0860 compared to yesterday's $1.0882. Asia The Asian markets moved about in a lackluster manner before ending mixed. Even amid concerns about a Fed rate hike, a weaker yen and better-than-expected GDP data from South Korea helped to cap overall losses to some extent. The Japanese market ended at a six-month high as the yen remained subdued. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session, ending up 30.83 points or 0.76 percent to 17,365, the highest level since April 25. Among the prominent gainers, J Front Retailing, Nippon Sheet Glass, Dainippon Screen Manufacturing, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, TDK, Mitsui Mining & Smelting and Mitsubishi Motors jumped 3-7 percent. Hitachi, Nissan Motor, Toyota, Honda Motor, Suzuki Motor and Mazda rallied 1-3 percent. Kyushu Railway shares soared 15 percent on their first day of trading. Australia stocks also rose, as higher metal prices boosted miners and banks gained ground ahead of earnings results from three of the big four banks. Healthcare stocks also rebounded from a recent string of losses. The All Ordinaries index closed 34.20 points or 0.62 percent higher at 5,523. Chinese shares ended on a flat note as the yuan continued to weaken to hit a fresh six-year low. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index inched up 3.69 points or 0.12 percent to 3,132, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed 38.97 points or 0.17 percent lower at 23,565. In economic news, data released by the Bank of Korea showed that South Korea's third-quarter GDP grew by 0.7 sequentially, beating forecasts for 0.6 percent growth. On an annual basis, the economy expanded 2.7 percent, marking the slowest growth in more than a year amid a massive recall of Samsung smartphones and strikes at Hyundai Motor. Europe European stocks opened higher and have been witnessing buoyancy amid the release of some domestic earnings news and German business confidence data. In major corporate news, French telecom giant Orange reported higher third quarter earnings, while it maintained its 2016 forecast. Novartis (NVS) reported an increase in third quarter profit. Core earnings per share were ahead of estimates, while sales were impacted by generic competition and pricing. Syngenta's third quarter sales fell 3 percent, while excluding the impact of the change in sales terms in Brazil, sales rose 2 percent. On the economic front, confidence among German businesses improved in October, the results of a survey by the Ifo institute showed. The Ifo business confidence index rose to 110.5 in October from 109.5 in the prior month. Economists had expected a reading of 109.6. The current conditions index climbed to 115.0 from 114.7 a month ago. The index was forecast to rise marginally to 114.9. At the same time, the expectations index came in at 106.1 versus 104.5 in the prior month. U.S. Economic Reports The Conference Board is scheduled to release its consumer confidence index for October at 10 am ET. The consensus estimate calls for a reading of 101, down from 104.1 in September. The consumer confidence index for September unexpectedly rose to a post-recession high of 104.1 in September from a revised 101.8 in August. Economists had expected the index to drop to 98.8. The assessment of the labor market was upbeat. The present situation index climbed 3.2 points to 128.5, and the expectations index rose to 87.8 from 86.1. Also at 10 am ET, the Richmond Federal Reserve is due to release its regional manufacturing index for October. In September, the index was at -8.

By Graham Lanktree October 25, 2016 15:22 BST Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump hugs a US flag as he comes onstage at a rally in Tampa, FloridaJonathan Ernst/ Reuters Two economists are voicing their support for Donald Trump's plan to "rip up" trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP if he becomes president. However, other experts, including the head of America's biggest bank, say it will make Americans poorer. After ripping them up "we're going to make really good ones," Trump said early this year during a campaign stop in Portland, Maine. At the end of September the Republican candidate released a seven-point plan that includes renegotiating NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — a pending international trade deal — and labelling China a currency manipulator, among others. "Ironically that would actually hurt Trump supporters most," said Michael Plouffe, an International Political Economy expert at UCL, of Trump's idea to renegotiate NAFTA. "Things like textiles and apparel would become more expensive," he added, because they would not be made with cheap Mexican labour anymore. "H&M, Walmart, Target — the things that people would look for something that provides good value — would no longer be good value," he said. Trump's trade plan "would be very, very harmful," Plouffe continued, because even though it would protect small enterprises it would decrease trade and investment in the economy and in large enterprises "which are associated with overall gains." The TPP, an even larger trade deal than NAFTA that is waiting to be signed, "would be positive for GDP," said James Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest of the four biggest American banks, at a talk in September in Washington D.C. "It would be positive for wages. It would be positive for the average American," he said. "It has negatives, which have to be recognized," Dimon added, saying the deal's impact on smaller business needs to be acknowledged and combined with government "income assistance, redevelopment, relocation, retraining, so that those hurt by it can be made better". In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal today (25 October), economists Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro defend Trump's economic plan, as well as his tax cuts for some of the very wealthiest Americans. They say his policies will "double" the country's economic growth rate and "generate trillions of additional tax revenues." To get there "muscular trade negotiations" will "increase exports, reduce imports and eliminate cheating," they said. Hillary Clinton's tax hikes on businesses and wealthy Americans would discourage people from working hard and investing, they said. However, "one of the things that you see with any trade deal is that larger, more productive firms really benefit," said Plouffe, and "small mom and pop shops lose out." Of Trump's plan, he said, "there's a lot of fluffy language against the usual antagonists."
