It happened at a store in McDonough, Georgia just south of Atlanta. A family requested the police-themed cake for an officer's retirement party. The Walmart workers apparently thought the request was racist and refused to make it. A friend of the officer's family posted the story online and it caused quite a stir; even the city's police chief had something to say about it. Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro Police Department Franklin Allen explains, "Officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin.  It doesn't matter to us."   Walmart has since issued this statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We've reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies." The manager of the store reached out to the officer's family and offered to make the cake, but another store had already taken care of it. Walmart then donated some things for the retirement party along with a gift card.

More National Headlines High school student shot while walking in Pontiac Parents killed in crash during first-ever vacation, daughters injured Put preschool bedtime problems to rest Racist fliers removed from University of Michigan campus A community is in uproar after one man claims a Georgia Walmart refused to make a cake with the words "Blue Lives Matter" written across the top. According to Taylor Wilkes of Locust-Grove, the family of a police officer wanted to have a cake made for his retirement party. She specifically requested the cake have a "thin blue line" across the top in icing, as an homage to his work in law enforcement. "Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being 'racist.' Three separate people in management denied her request," Wilkes wrote. "There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the 'thin blue line,' yet people choose to make everything about race." She instead took her order to another supermarket, but strangers were up in arms after reading the recollection on Facebook, and even voicing their complaints on the McDonough Walmart's Yelp page. After increased pressure, Wilkes posted on Facebook that Walmart has since reached out, and sent gift cards and a cake with the words "Blue Lives Matter" to the party. "We've addressed any issues to everyone involved, and taken steps to ensure that no other customers will have any obstacles," Walmart's McDonough location told InsideEdition.com. "We were able to connect with the family and make it right. She picked up the cake she wanted, and they had their event [Sunday]." The store even sent gift cards, decorations and the original cake with the words, "Blue Lives Matter," to the party. "[The cake] looked terrible," the woman who originally ordered the cake told Todd Starnes. "It doesn't look professional." Copyright (c) 2016 CBS Studios Inc. All Rights Reserved.

A bakery employee at the Walmart on Willow Lane in McDonough refused the woman's request. "One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake," the woman told Fox News' Todd Starnes, who broke the story. She then asked for a black cake with a blue line through it. A bakery employee again refused. "I asked her, 'Is there something wrong with cops?'" the woman said. The manager of the Walmart, after hearing of her story, offered the woman a free cake and a $50 gift card. When bakery employees refused to comply with his orders, the store manager decorated the cake himself. The woman said the results were "unprofessional" and she had no time to get another cake. While Rare and Starnes did not identify the woman, Walmart spokeswoman Leslee Wright acknowledged the "misstep" in a statement to The AJC. "We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores," Wright said. "We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right."

The supermarket in McDonough, Georgia was accused of turning away a young woman after she asked them to decorate a cake in black and blue police colours, with the motto ‘Blue Lives Matter’. This Morning viewers outraged over David Beckham wannabe’s £20k benefits spend on surgery Furious by Walmart’s alleged refusal, a police officer and friend of the woman’s father, shared the incident on Facebook, calling it ‘appalling’. He wrote: ‘Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ‘racist’. To me, this is appalling. ‘People CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I’m so tired of it. It’s literally exhausting for me to think about now.’ Fox News host, Todd Starnes, picked up the story and interviewed the daughter. Wishing to remain anonymous, she said: ‘I was so shocked… One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake. Why did it take Alton Towers so long to dial 999 after Smiler crash? ‘I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.’ Starnes claimed that after further complaints to Walmart, staff continued to refuse to make the cake, so the manager offered to take on the task. But the Fox News host said the result was ‘absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable’, demanding the staff redo the cake or be fired. Walmart manger of communications, Leslee Wright, told Henry Daily Herald that it has since apologised to the family. Toddler shoots 12-year-old boy after finding loaded gun in aunt’s car ‘Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. ‘We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.’ It is not clear if staff redecorated the cake.

As the Macon Telegraph reports, late last week, an unnamed Georgia woman went to a Walmart location in McDonough, Georgia, to order a cake for a party for her father’s retirement from the police force. The woman has asked for a cake with an American flag with black and white stripes and with a blue line through it. A Walmart customer wanted a cake with this symbol for her dad’s retirement party. [Image by pashabo/Shutterstock] The symbol, says the Telegraph, is a “common police emblem,” the thin blue line representing the brotherhood of the men & women in blue; that is, police. The baker on duty that day refused to bake the cake, saying that he or she considered it racist. The woman anonymously went on the Todd Starnes Radio Show to explain what happened. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.” The woman was outraged. “I was so shocked. I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” Family friend Taylor Wilkes, who is herself a Georgia police officer, took to Facebook to encourage others to boycott Walmart. Once the story hit social media, it quickly went viral, generating over 4,000 shares and eventually being picked up by news agencies, including the Inquisitr. Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro, Arkansas Police Department told WTVM (Columbus, Georgia), that the baker’s decision was “heartbreaking.” “It’s really heartbreaking, because officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us.” The police officer’s daughter, meanwhile, took her business to a nearby Kroger and got her cake made. Now that the story has gone viral, Walmart has tried to make things right. Wilkes said that store manager approached her friend and apologized, offered her a gift card, offered some items for the party on the house, and offered to make the cake that the baker originally refused. Not one to turn down a free cake, the police officer’s daughter accepted the offer; the results were less than spectacular. WALMART refuses to make cop’s ‘racist’ retirement cake… https://t.co/1yS1srUb7I — DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) September 26, 2016 Taylor says that she believes that Walmart only tried to make things right because of public pressure, not because it was the right thing to do. “I think he just did that because, t hanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn’t want it to go farther than it did. The way the meeting was described to me was that it was very scripted and not very sincere. So, although the mistake was ‘made right,’ I will still not be shopping at Walmart due to the ‘quality’ of employees they hire.” Walmart’s corporate headquarters, meanwhile, has also entered the fray. In a statement, the Arkansas-based company said that they have “reached out” to the family to try to make things right. “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” WTVM also contacted Walmart to see if any employees connected to the situation have been fired or otherwise disciplined; Walmart has not yet responded. Do you think the Walmart bakers were in the wrong to refuse to bake a cake with a police symbol?

(Courtesy/Todd Starnes) Three Walmart workers in McDonough, Georgia refused to decorate a "thin blue line" cake for a police officer's retirement party because they said it was racist. A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer's daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I've agreed to honor her request. "I was so shocked," she told me. "I didn't know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene." For the record, Walmart has confessed that most of her allegations are true. I'll have more on that a bit later in this column. The police officer's daughter went to the Walmart on Willow Drive on Sept. 22 to order a flag for her father's retirement party. He was leaving the force after 25-years on the job.  She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer's flag—the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line.  "One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake," the police officer's daughter told me.  As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line.  But that design was also rejected by Walmart's cake decorator. "She said, 'I don't feel comfortable doing this,'" the cop's daughter told me. "I asked her, 'Is there something wrong with cops?'" After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, "I'll find another bakery, thank you." She was much more polite than I would've been, folks. "I was disappointed," she told me. "I go to Walmart all the time—at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him." A friend of the family posted an item about the incident on Facebook and it wasn't long before the Walmart store manager called the police officer's wife and daughter—and apologized.  "He said he was so sorry," the daughter told me. "He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card." <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=269169953" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=269169953" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement A Walmart corporate spokesperson confirmed most of the story. "Our goal is to always take care of customers," the spokesperson told me. "But, sometimes we misstep. We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right." Walmart did not say if one of their associates called the cake racist. "I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer," the spokesperson told me. So how did Walmart right their wrong? The answer to that question is going to curdle your Fruit Loops, folks. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem—the cake decorators refused to comply. "So the manager told me that he would decorate it—but it looked terrible," the police officer's daughter said. "It doesn't look professional." I've attached photographs of Walmart's handiwork—it's absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. "I work in retail," the officer's daughter told me. "If I didn't want to deal with a customer—and said 'No'—I would get fired." Unfortunately, her father's retirement party is Sunday night, so there's no time to go elsewhere.  "It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them," she said. "And you can't make a cake for the people who are protecting you?" Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer's family. The three cake decorators need to be told: Either decorate the cake or be fired.  Just because Walmart is the home of low prices, doesn't mean they have to hire a bunch of low-class, anti-cop bigots.

(Pexels) The SpiritLed Woman podcast is empowering women weekly to follow their purpose in Christ and boldly walk in faith. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. I feel incredibly worn out...already. I'm exhausted. The thought of getting the kids going on school work is overwhelming and daunting. And the school year hasn't even started for us yet! Isn't that nuts? And I am the professional teacher—yeah, the one with the university degree. And...I've been doing this for 11 years already! Then I was hit with a revelation as I was flipping through the recent Wal-Mart flyer. Although I may be feeling wilted and weary, I am still so thankful that my kids are home with me. This is the truth I need to hold on to—the truth I want to share with you and encourage you with. 3 Important Truths to Remember When You Are Ready to Quit Thanks, Wal-Mart Yeah, so I was looking through the Wal-Mart flyer while enjoying my morning cup of coffee. My husband was sitting beside me—we both work from home, which is such a wonderful blessing. A huge box of Play-Doh caught my eye and I told my husband that I wanted to get it for our youngest daughter. His first response was "Really?" I had to explain to him that our daughter loves to play with Play-Doh and this massive box of various colors would make her day. What a wonderful 'Back-To-Homeschool' gift, right? This explanation caused a good discussion between my husband and me. And I realized that the fact that I am tired and weary doesn't even matter compared to the truth we comprehended in that moment. Remaining Child-like You see, our youngest daughter is 10-years old. And she still loves to create with Play-Doh. Most kids her age have very little interest in something like Play-Doh. It would be 'too babyish' in their eyes. And, yet, our daughter either doesn't know this or she just doesn't care if she does. My husband and I discussed how she has been able to keep so much of her childhood innocence. And in this day and age, that is quite a feat! Seriously, the worst bad word she knows at 10-years old is 'stupid'. If you asked a public-schooled kid what the worst bad word that they knew was, I am sure we'd be embarrassed at hearing it. The Truth: At home, she can just be a kid and enjoy her childhood. She doesn't know any different, even with older siblings. She is having a delightful childhood – the way it should be. This truth brings me confidence and joy in our family's decision to home educate. Displaying Christ My oldest daughter, Sarah, went to teen camp this summer. Her friend had not been able to make it this year, so she was going 'on her own.' She would not know anyone in her cabin. At first, she was somewhat unsure about this arrangement. However, a week before she was scheduled to leave, she came to me with the most amazing idea. She told me how she remembered a girl at camp last year who had scars on her arms from cutting. The thought that this girl was in so much emotional pain bothered Sarah so much that she hasn't forgotten her. This prompted Sarah to begin asking God to show her the opportunities to show His love to the hurting girls at camp while she was there. When Sarah told me about her prayer, I was in awe of her heart and her request. She was not going to camp for herself. It wasn't about her. She was going so that she could minister to someone else. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=58cba0f8c5&cb=1669703459" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873538&cs=58cba0f8c5&cb=1669703459" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The Truth: When I am drained and worn-out just by the idea of starting school again, I think about this occasion and I know that my chief purpose in home educating my kids is so they can share the love of Christ with those who desperately need it. And the fruit is abundant. Caring for the Heart ... and Body I was done with seeing my son wear jeans that were a couple of inches above his ankles. I forced him to head to the mall with me to find new jeans that didn't make him look like he was waiting for a flood. This kid is 5 feet 11 inches tall at 12 years old! We found a couple of pairs at one store and were heading off to another when I started chatting with an acquaintance I ran into. About 10 minutes passed by and I heard my son stumbling around behind me and people gasping and asking if he was OK. I turned around to see him on the floor. He had passed out. I helped him up and when he felt better, we went home. I booked a doctor appointment right away. We had blood work done and were called back in only to get more blood work done. I really don't think it is anything serious. My son has grown so much in the last few months and I think it is just taking time for his entire body to adjust. He is tired and needs a lot of sleep right now. The Truth: In the moments I am pondering my own fatigue and exhaustion, I can reflect on the needs of my son and know that I can give him the rest and care he needs right now and not worry about missing assignments or skipped lessons. We have the opportunity to go at our own pace and pick up where we left off if necessary. This not only cares for my son's physical and health needs, but also for his heart. Reflection I hope these three truths encourage your weary heart. I pray that you will be able to find your own truths to hold on to and remember during those moments when you are ready to quit. Write those truths down and place them where you will see them. They will serve as a good reminder for those tough days. Share your own moments of truth below.

HHW Facebook HHW Twitter HHW YouTube HHW Instagram     Features Video News Wired Tracks Politics Bangin Candy Certified Fresh Maurice Garland Music Sports Politics ALL Walmart Workers Face Termination After Refusing To Make “Blue Lives Matter” Cake News   » by Maurice Garland Sep 26 2016, 12:11pm Share This Tweet This Email This “Ain’t no cake, bih.” Three Walmart employees are in trouble after refusing to make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a woman celebrating her father’s retirement from the police force. The three individuals work at a Walmart in McDonough, Ga. which sits about 30 miles south of Atlanta. Fox News reports that a woman came to the store to get the obviously offensive “Blue Lives Matter” cake made for a retirement party for her cop dad. The three employees reportedly refused to make the cake and called the gesture “racist.” According to the woman ordering the cake, she says the employees said that they did not feel comfortable making the cake and asked her to go to another bakery. A manager then got involved and offered to not only make the cake for her anyway, but also gave her a $50 gift certificate.  This was the result and woman and her ugly cake left the store. “I was so shocked,” the unidentified woman tells Fox News columnist Todd Starnes. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” The woman, who called the cake design “unprofessional” also left with an apology from the store to her and her family. Walmart issued a statement saying: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep.

White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Walmart Apologizes After Refusing ‘Racist’ Order for a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ Cake by Ken Meyer | 12:14 pm, September 26th, 2016   A Walmart store in Georgia is walking things back after employees denied a request for a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a police officer’s retirement party. Taylor Wilkes‘s Facebook page has drawn significant attention recently, ever since he described what happened last week when the family of his friend went to place an order for the cake. “She asked Walmart to make a ‘thin blue line’ cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer,” Wilkes said. “Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ‘racist.’ Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason.” CBS46 News The cop’s daughter, who has not been named publicly, told her story to Fox host Todd Starnes, who ripped the commotion in a column and said the cake decorators should be ordered to “either decorate the cake or be fired.” Local police chief Franklin Allen was also asked for his thoughts, and he said that Walmart’s decision demonstrated increasing feeling of hostility towards law enforcement across America. As the story gained online traction, Walmart released an apologetic statement regarding the incident. “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep,” Walmart said. “We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” Watch above, via CBS 46.

Doing business here is a privilege and not a right. Walmart wants to expand by building a superstore in Pittsfield. That is because the company knows that it can make more money for their company. And that is good. Of course, such a project would have both positive and negative effects on the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses. I attended a presentation last Tuesday night by the builder and Walmart supporting their proposal and trying to create good-will. There were many questions and comments showing that Walmart has a negative image and that this is well-deserved. There were a few comments about the benefit of having Walmart. The gentlemen who made the presentation seemed sincerely over-optimistic, but the presenters did convince me that a new store on the proposed location would do more good than harm. Allowing Walmart to build a new store has the benefit that it will clean up 16 acres of contaminated land in the business park. It will provide new jobs and convenience for some shoppers. It will pay about $500,000 per year in property taxes. The project does have value and should not be killed. Crane & Company is an example of a good local business that gives back to the community. On top of paying property taxes, it has developed and devoted land for the public benefit. Pittsfield citizens also work for the community by volunteering, keeping our neighborhoods beautiful with plants and flowers, and showing up at Third Thursday and other events. Walmart's history here shows no interest in doing anything extra for the community. There is room for Walmart to do more. The proposed site has abundant possibilities for development. Walmart would use only 16 of the more than 50 available acres. A small park, a playground and an area for dogs are within Walmart's ability to build, and would be an investment in the community. The Berkshire Mall supplied, and maintains, a police car for Lanesborough because the police patrol there and are called out for shoplifting incidents and emergencies. We know from hard experience that nothing lasts forever. Now is the time for the public and our elected representatives to require that Walmart do something more for the community. Walmart has the privilege, not the right, to make profits. We have the right to demand that it contribute to Pittsfield. It is naïve to think that the Walmart corporation cannot afford such an investment in our community.

Jessica Trufant The Patriot Ledger @JTrufant_Ledger WEYMOUTH - Police plan to charge an 83-year-old Norwood woman with operating to endanger after the car she was driving plowed into several parked vehicles before ending up underneath one in the Walmart parking lot on Middle Street. Police have issued a citation to Barbara A. Lavita for operating to endanger, according to Capt. Richard Fuller. Officers responded to the Walmart at 740 Middle St. at 3:43 p.m. Saturday for reports of a crash involving several vehicles. In one of the parking spots, police found a car on top of a Ford Taurus with a driver, later identified as Lavita, and a female passenger inside. The car on top was not occupied at the time. Weymouth Fire Department secured the top car and Fallon Ambulance paramedics evaluated Lavita and her passenger, who both declined any further medical treatment, according to police. A witness told police the Ford Taurus “backed out of a parking spot at a high rate of speed and turned itself 180 degrees before backing into a vehicle in the same row and three spaces away,” according to the police report. Lavita then put her car in drive and again accelerated at a high rate of speed through the parking lot, barreling into vehicles along the way, police said. Police said she also struck shopping carts and a cart holder, which hit other vehicles in the parking lot. Walmart provided surveillance video, which backed up the witness accounts. Police said at least two pedestrians jumped out of the way to avoid being hit in the crash. “At the time of the event there were numerous people walking around the parking lot and going in and out of the store. There are also numerous vehicles being operated in the parking lot,” the police report reads. Seven vehicles were damaged during the crash, police said. Lavita told police “she was attempting to back out of the parking space, but the vehicle didn't move when she hit the gas,” according to the police report. She said she stepped on the accelerator a second time, which caused the vehicle to quickly accelerate backwards, according to the report. Lavita allegedly told police that the same thing happened when she put the car in drive. Police asked the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles to revoke Lavita’s license.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 26, 2016 at 10:16AM Image source: The Motley Fool. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader in online retail, one of the strongest segments in the consumer sector. This competitive strength in a booming industry has allowed Amazon to deliver impressive revenue growth and market-beating returns for shareholders over time: The stock was trading at less than $40 per share 10 years ago, and it's now making new historical highs in the neighborhood of $805 per share. Market leadership in online retail is a crucial return driver for investors in Amazon, so let's look at how the company is leaving the competition in the dust in its main industry. Crushing the competition The following chart compares Amazon versus competitors such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in terms of stock price performance and revenue growth over the past decade. The image is quite clear: Amazon has obliterated both eBay and Wal-Mart over this period. AMZN data by YCharts Online commerce is a dynamic industry, and underperforming players are trying to close the gap. eBay is investing in new technologies to provide better information to both buyers and sellers on the platform, as well as optimizing product search capabilities, among other initiatives. As for Wal-Mart, the discount retailer has increased its investments in e-commerce over the past couple of years, having recently acquired online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion.  Still, both eBay and Wal-Mart have a long way to go if they want to recover some ground versus Amazon, since the most recent financial reports from the three companies confirm that eBay and Wal-Mart are no match for Amazon at this stage. According to reports for the second quarter of 2016, Amazon produced $30.4 billion in sales during the period, a 31% increase versus the second quarter in 2015. As comparison, revenue at eBay was $2.23 billion during the quarter, increasing 6% year over year. Wal-Mart generated $120.9 billion in total sales during the second quarter, a modest 0.5% year-over-year increase. In the e-commerce segment, Wal-Mart's gross merchandise value grew 11.8% versus the same quarter one year ago.  It's all about the customer Amazon's secret for success is deceivingly simple: The company is deeply focused on the customer, always looking for ways to provide a growing variety of products for aggressively low prices, while improving the service in key areas such as delivery time. Unlike the way most other companies operate, management is willing to forego current profits to deliver the best possible customer experience, and most customers consider Amazon far superior to competitors such as eBay or Wal-Mart in online retail. According to a survey from RBC Capital among 2,024 people, Amazon is downright crushing eBay and Wal-Mart in terms of popularity and customer satisfaction in online retail. Based on this data, 90% of the respondents consider Amazon one of the most commonly used platforms when buying online, while eBay comes in a distant second position with 38%, and only 30% of customers consider Wal-Mart a top destination for online shopping. Considering three of the most important decision drivers in the industry -- price, selection, and convenience -- Amazon comes well ahead of eBay and Wal-Mart. In terms of pricing, 62% of customers choose Amazon, versus 12% for eBay and 11% for Wal-Mart. Regarding the best selection in the industry, 79% choose Amazon, while eBay is the preferred choice for 9% of respondents, and Wal-Mart gets 4%. Amazon also leads the survey in terms of convenience, with 75% of customers choosing the online retail juggernaut, versus 6% for eBay and another 6% for Wal-Mart. Other sources confirm that Amazon is the undisputed industry king when it comes to customer satisfaction. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Amazon has been the top-rated company in the sector in every year since 2000. For 2015, Amazon has a customer satisfaction score of 83, while the average company in the sector has a score of 80, and eBay gets a 75. Customers over profits Back in 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in an interview with 60 Minutes, explained that the company regularly does price elasticity studies, which consistently indicate that Amazon could make more money by raising prices. That means the positive impact from higher prices would more than compensate the decline in sales volume from price increases.  However, Amazon chooses not to implement such strategy, even if doing so means leaving some money on the table in the short term. The main reason to do so is that the company prefers to keep customers as happy as possible, earning and consolidating their trust and loyalty for the long term. By taking care of customers, Amazon is also taking care of shareholders. The company's commitment to providing the best possible service for a conveniently low cost has produced booming revenue growth over the years, and Amazon investors have been generously rewarded in the process.

The retailer is challenging the TABC law that bans publicly traded corporations from selling hard liquor. Sec. 22.16 of the Texas state law restricts public companies from selling anything stronger than bee or wine. In their lawsuit filed last year, Walmart says the law is anti-competitive and unfair to consumers. Read the full judge order Local businesses told KXAN after the lawsuit was filed, they are worried Walmart selling liquor would put them out of business. Others argue it would be more convenient if Walmart was allowed to sell spirits. Currently, Walmart sells liquor in other states and would like to expand sales to Texas. It became illegal for public corporations to sell liquor in Texas in 1995. A new trial date has not been set yet.

His daughter, who has declined to be publicly identified to protect her family’s privacy, says that she went to the McDonough, Georgia Walmart to order her dad’s retirement cop cake on September 22. That’s when what she thought would be a smooth, easy, and everyday transaction turned into something political, divisive, and even (allegedly) racist. [Image by Ken Wolter/Shutterstock] As Todd Starnes reports, the woman in question claims that she took her Walmart cop cake order directly to the bakery, where she intended to specify the details she wanted incorporated into the cake’s decorations. She planned to come pick up the cop cake within the next few days. Reportedly, nothing about the Walmart cop cake order went according to plan. The woman originally left the Walmart irate and cake-less. According to the retiring officer’s daughter, the cop cake she had envisioned for her dad’s hard-earned retirement was a “thin blue line” cake. She reportedly told conservative activist Todd Starnes that she went to the Walmart with a photograph of the design she wanted to be recreated on her father’s cop cake. The photo was reportedly that of “the police officer’s flag,” which is the traditional American flag in black and white, featuring one thin blue line to represent police work. [Image by Shutterstock] It was then that the Walmart employee working in the store’s bakery reportedly refused to honor her wishes. “The baker told me the blue line cake was racist.” According to the Walmart customer, she was angry and shocked at the baker’s reaction to her cop cake request. Even so, given the current divisive and politically explosive nature of law enforcement in America, she tried to reach a compromise with the Walmart bakery staff over the cop cake she wanted for her dad’s retirement. “I was so shocked. I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” As an alternative to the police officer’s flag design she’d originally requested for the cop cake, the officer’s daughter said that she suggested that the bakery create a more simple, somehow “less offensive” cop cake. For her second choice, the customer says she asked the baker to simply frost a cake with chocolate icing and add a line of blue icing to represent the “thin blue line” created by police. Once again, however, her request was turned down by the Walmart employee. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake. She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,'” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?'” @Hdngttrn @Acoatain that cop dodged a bullet again. No one should be subjected to eating Walmart cake. — mrmcdaniel (@mrmcdaniel) September 25, 2016 @FoxNews @toddstarnes Ah, so where is the ACLU on this one? They go after Christians on cakes? — Marsha Marsha (@MarshaMarshaKy) September 25, 2016 @RealJamesWoods @tayfan2 @FoxNews but I would never eat the cake made by someone who hates me. Like those @Walmart employees apparently do — Karen D (캐렌 디) (@KaeKaed) September 25, 2016 @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews take ur business someone else then ya big babies — ooh mama (@Realtop24) September 25, 2016 After the Walmart bakery employees repeatedly rejected her requests for a cop cake as being “racist,” the police officer’s daughter decided to take her business elsewhere. To her credit, she reportedly didn’t make a scene at the Walmart, nor did she even publicly complain about the bakery’s refusal to fulfill her order. Her friends and family members, however, were reportedly less discreet. One or more of the woman’s relations/friends reportedly began telling the story of the failed Walmart cop cake on social media. When the news of the situation began to spread, the management of the Georgia Walmart got in touch with their disgruntled customer, a customer that has claimed to regularly drop hundreds of dollars at the store on a weekly basis. According to the woman, she and her mom (the wife of the retiring police officer), soon got a phone call and an apology from the Walmart manager. The manager even tried to make reparations for the incident, an incident that the customer believes was disrespectful to law enforcement and insulting, by offering to make the cop cake for free. He even reportedly offered the police officer’s disgruntled daughter a $50 gift card for her trouble. Reportedly, the Walmart management team refused to confirm or deny whether their bakery employees called the cop cake “racist.” “I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer.” In the end, the officer’s daughter opted to take the Walmart manager up on his offer to make the cop cake she’d requested; not the police officer’s flag version, but the thin blue line on chocolate icing version. However, that wasn’t the end of the woman’s unbelievable cop cake Walmart drama. That’s because all three of the three professional cake decorators working at the Walmart bakery absolutely refused to make and/or decorate the cop cake. Ultimately, the store manager reportedly undertook the project himself. The results were subpar, as evidenced in a photo supplied by the customer in question. Cop's Daughter Asks Walmart To Make "Thin Blue Line" Cake… Their Response Is SICK https://t.co/GcE765tAnU pic.twitter.com/1Kve8RVTuy — King Robbo ???? (@realkingrobbo) September 25, 2016 As you can see, the Walmart manager’s cake decorating skills were less than stellar, leaving the cop’s daughter with a final product she was not happy with at all. Insult to injury, if you will. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible. It doesn’t look professional.” Reportedly, the police officer’s retirement party was scheduled for Sunday, therefore his daughter didn’t have the time to seek out an alternative or replacement cop cake. What do you think? Did Walmart handle the situation appropriately? Is the phrase “Blue Lives Matter” racist? Should employees have the right to refuse to make a cake that they deem personally or politically offensive? What are your thoughts regarding the Walmart cop cake situation?

The store in McDonough, Georgia, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, allegedly refused to make the Blue Lives Matter cake on Friday for a retirement party. 'My buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party,' Taylor Wilkies, a police officer from Georgia, wrote on Facebook. 'She asked Walmart to make a "thin blue line" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer.  A Walmart store has been accused of refusing to bake a cake decorated with the 'police officer's flag' because workers said it was 'racist', and then offered this cake (pictured) as a replacement 'Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being "racist". To me, this is appalling. 'People CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now.  The claim was then picked up by conservative Fox News host Todd Starnes who wrote about the alleged incident. Starnes says he spoke to the daughter of the police officer on Saturday night, however he does not include any details of the family or the woman.

One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.'  Starnes claims the woman told him she was 'disappointed'. 'I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him,' the unidentified woman said, according to Starnes. The Fox News host then goes on to say the workers were told to make the cake after complaints were made to the store's manager, but they still allegedly refused. A Georgia police officer shared the story of her 'buddy's sister' being denied the cake and it quickly went viral on Facebook The Walmart store in McDonough, Georgia, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, allegedly refused to make the cake on Friday for a retirement party on Sunday 'The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply,' he claims. 'I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. 'Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer’s family. 'The three cake decorators need to be told: either decorate the cake or be fired.' Since Starnes tweeted the story, the Walmart alleged of refusing to make the cake has been flooded with criticism.  'Why do you not hold your employees to the job requirements they agreed to, decorate cakes? Fire them or as a Patron I'd worry you would poison the cake or other food I might purchase there because your employees hate cops,' Lisa Victoria angrily wrote. Other people refuted the story, claiming the store told them the accusations were made up 'Shame on you walmart!!!!! Hopefully you will take action upon your bakery department,' Erik Fowler said. However another person claims the store's manager told them the allegations were false.  'She was very polite, was familiar with the story, and denied that any of this was true,' David Sauls said. 'I asked her if I wanted to have the bakery decorate a cake depicting the thin blue line would they do it, and she said that they would be more than glad to, that it's ridiculous for anyone to make this claim, and that she doesn't understand why someone would make it.  'I'll give them the benefit of the doubt at this point.'

Jordan Harkins said she requested the cake have the words "Blue Lives Matter" pasted on it, and was met with resistance and finally refusal from three Walmart workers. According to Harkins, the employees told her the cake's message could be taken as racist. The company has since apologized for the incident, issuing a statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We've reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies." Harkins said she was in disbelief when she was first turned away. "I didn't know how to react, because I didn't think that was the response I would have gotten," said Harkins. "Just insulted, for the most part, because that's my family." "(Police) protect us, and they're serving, and giving their lives everyday for us. So, I think the support needs to come from everyone, including WalMart, where everyone shops all the time." Harkins ultimately turned away the "Blue Lives Matter" cake because she said she wasn't happy with how it looked, instead accepting a cake with a blue stripe across a black background. A Walmart spokeswoman would not comment on whether or not the employees involved in the incident were disciplined. Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

The officer's daughter told radio host Todd Starnes that she wanted the cake to feature a black and white American flag with a blue stripe added in to symbolize the police force, and that when an employee said no one felt comfortable decorating the cake that way because it "could be perceived as racist," the daughter suggested a simple blue line on a background of chocolate frosting—which the employee said she also didn't "feel comfortable" with. (However, a photo provided to Starnes of the cake that was ultimately completed shows the blue line on black frosting surrounded by the words, "Blue Lives Matter.") A family friend and fellow police officer posted about the incident on Facebook Thursday, and then on Saturday posted that the manager of the Walmart had reached out, apologized, and offered to make the cake himself, free of charge, after the post went viral, the Macon Telegraph reports. That's the cake pictured in a photo provided to Starnes; the cop's daughter notes that since no employees would agree to decorate it, the manager decorated it himself and it looks "terrible. It doesn’t look professional." A Walmart spokesperson confirmed a "misstep" to Starnes, though he wouldn't say whether an employee had called the cake racist: "I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer," he said. The family friend says the daughter eventually had a cake made at Kroger for the party.

Posted: Monday, September 26, 2016 California couple overcomes homeless situation in Michigan By Meghan Nelson • Last Updated 9:15 am on Monday, September 26, 2016 Tweet Amy and Joe Hanson (pseudonyms used for the couple’s protection) wanted their photograph to be taken next to a cross to “thank the man above” for helping them get out of homelessness. The couple was homeless for years before finding stable housing in Greenville through Montcalm and Ionia county services. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin GREENVILLE —  When Joe and Amy Hanson (not their real names) moved from California to Michigan, they didn’t have jobs lined up or a place to live. In fact, they were homeless. Amy had applied for a transfer to Walmart in Ionia, which she accepted, and they made the move to Michigan. “I made a promise to his mom before she died and I told him I would get him over here,” Amy said. “But we were late coming in, and they ended up giving my job away. That’s how we ended up in our situation.” While the situation was frustrating, it wasn’t new to the Hansons. Joe had been dealing with off and on homelessness since he was about 13 years old. Joe and Amy moved to Michigan in 2014. They brought a moving truck with them, but they had to return it and were left outside in the middle of a snowstorm. “It was just us and our luggage sitting at a Pilot gas station in the snow,” Amy said. “We got into Midway Hotel because the night before spent it on the back of an abandoned restaurant.” Joe walked from the hotel to his sister’s house, an eight-mile trek, only to get the door shut in his face. On the way back to his family, a Michigan State Police trooper pulled him over for walking on the wrong side of the road. “The state trooper said he would let me go because I was new,” Joe said. “Then, I told him where my wife was, and he told me to keep walking. Three hours later, I get to the truck stop and (Amy) is sitting there. She gives me a look, and I turn around and see the state trooper behind me.” Joe and Amy ended up calling 911 and were transferred to 211 (the information service was still available). They were eventually put in contact with Have Mercy and its Executive Director Kim Cain. Have Mercy in Greenville is an organization that seeks to meet temporary needs of homeless people while working toward a permanent solution, and it played a big part in Joe and Amy’s life in Michigan. The Hansons are thankful for all the work the agency have done for them. While agencies were there to help with adjustments, Joe and Amy still dealt with many differences. “Out there in California, it is a gold mine to a homeless person,” Joe said. “There are umpteen spots I can go to. I can go to one dumpster and pull out $300 to $400 worth of stuff. I’d pull out dresses to give my wife, or what we would do was take those dresses in to a consignment shop and make money.” Joe also was able to find radios, televisions and food in those dumpsters. One day, he even found a bike, which helped him get around more. “It was an old man’s bike. But hey, I’m not going to complain if it can get me from point A to point B to point Z, I’m going to ride it,” Joe said. During his years of living in homelessness, Joe has learned how to survive as a homeless person. For four years before Joe met Amy, he built a shack out of palettes and nails and lived in it. He had electricity and water. He also started wearing dark clothing to camouflage himself at night when he would go out to bring home food, clothes and other things he could find. “The safest time for me is at night because I can get around without being harassed,” Joe said Joe is adamant about his wife staying safe especially when they were homeless. He noted life as a homeless woman is different and more dangerous than life as a homeless man. “I ended up working with our son and was making close to $500 a week,” Joe said. “My wife and I decided to buy an RV, but we ended up being scammed of $1,000. So we faced jail time. Instead of letting my wife do time, I did.” Joe admits he struggled with drug use and abuse in the past, truing everything except heroin. Since coming to Michigan, he says he has been clean. “I was sick of dealing with homelessness and wanted to be in my own little world,” Joe said. “I went and smoked some crystal away from my wife. When I came back, I had blood in my eyes and would cough up blood.” Amy asked if he needed to go to the hospital, but he resisted. She ended up putting him through multiple baths with epsom salt to detoxify his body. Joe decided that was the last time he would do drugs. Not much longer, the couple moved to Michigan. “I left out the drug scene. I don’t need that,” Joe said. “I have a whole lot better. I have better friends.” Another difference between Joe’s and Amy’s lives in California and Michigan is that, with the help of Have Mercy and other agencies in Montcalm and Ionia counties, after nine months they are now successfully housed. “Since he was 13 or 14, he has been dealing with off and on homelessness,” Cain said of Joe. “And to have that person be stably housed, to have that household have stable income, to have them have a happy life, that’s victory. And it doesn’t happen very often.” Cain credited agencies in Montcalm and Ionia counties for writing that success story. But she emphasized that Joe and Amy played an important role in getting themselves out of homelessness. “The reason they came out of homelessness is because they wanted,” Cain said. “We are so limited in what we can do. I have people who are still homeless and it’s because they aren’t willing to do what they have to do.” “You have to want it,” Joe added. “When Kim first met me and (Amy) we wanted it, we wanted help.” Despite stable housing, Joe and Amy are still facing struggles. Right now, Joe is dealing with a stolen identity problem, which prevents him from working. “Since Homeland Security stepped in, they check you,” Amy said. “You can’t bring a relative in to vouch for you. It’s a hard situation for a regular person to go in and get their ID. You have to go through the census. It’s a frustrating process.” Joe warned no one can guarantee he or she won’t end up homeless one day because it can happen to everyone. “I didn’t make that choice. It was forced on me (when he lost his job in his 20s) because my job was taken from me, everything I had; when you run out of money that puts you on the streets even though you can be the best worker in the world. I was making $1,200 to $1,300 every two weeks in California,” Joe said. “People don’t think how people become homeless. If you don’t have money, you’re going to be homeless. I didn’t have a choice, and my wife didn’t have a choice. We don’t want to be homeless.” Joe also talked extensively about the difference between homelessness and “street life.” “Homeless is when you don’t have a choice. When things happen, you lose your job, you lose everything,” he said. “But, street life is when you make that choice. Some people who live on the street think it’s cool. That’s street life, not homelessness.” Another difference Joe pointed out is homeless people are typically focused on survival. “Street people want to do drugs, have sex and don’t care about the world,” he said. Joe and Amy are thankful to all the agencies and to each other for overcoming homelessness, but Joe admitted the fear hasn’t quite gone away. Amy said they are permanently housed, but it is dependent on their rental rates and her hours. “It’s an everyday thing,” Joe said. “It’s a prayer if we’re going to keep strong and keep things together. If she comes home and says she has bad news, I start praying. When her hours get cut, I get scared. I don’t want to be out there anymore than I have to. “I thank God everyday that I’m not homeless anymore,” he said. Local Homeless statistics According to statistics from the Ionia-Montcalm Continuum of Care, the homeless population in the two counties was 570 people last year, including: • 397 in Montcalm County, 332 of whom were literally homeless (didn’t have a place to sleep at night). • 229 in Ionia County, 164 of whom were literally homeless (didn’t have a place to sleep at night). • 158 children in Montcalm County. • 107 children in Ionia County. • 41.81 percent of the homeless population are younger than 18 years old. • 328 of them are females. • 244 of them are males. • 1 is transgender (male to female). • 543 of them are white. • 21 are black or African American. • 5 are American Indian or Alaska Native. • 2 are Asian. • 1 is Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.  • 1 is unknown. • 33.33 percent of them have a high school diploma. • 20 percent of them have some college education. • 13 percent of them have a GED.

(Mark Tower | MLive.com) Print Email Mark Tower | mtower@mlive.com By Mark Tower | mtower@mlive.com The Saginaw News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 26, 2016 at 4:04 PM, updated September 26, 2016 at 4:14 PM comments SAGINAW, MI — Starting this weekend, residents hopping onto buses in Saginaw will need to dig a little deeper into their pockets for bus fare. The Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) Board of Directors has resolved to increase the fare schedule — with single ride fares now at $1.50 instead of $1.25 — as part of an earlier decision to bring back Saturday service. Site Manager Glenn Steffens explained that both decisions are important to help built a sustainable future for the public transit system in Saginaw. Tying the increase to a high-profile increase to bus service will hopefully communicate that message clearly to riders and the community in general, Steffens said. "It's not just a matter of asking for another quarter," he said. "It's a matter of giving them something for that quarter." Saginaw bus system bringing back Saturday services, routes to Walmart There was no opposition to the fare increase among members of the STARS Board of Directors, which approved Steffens' recommendation in a 7-0 vote at its Monday, Sept. 26, meeting. Steffens called it a "harsh truth" that a fare increase is necessary to help move the bus system forward. "You can't cut your way out of a hole," he said. The increase itself, expected to generate an additional $75,000 annually, does not make it possible to bring back Saturday service, Steffens said. "We're not just looking to our riders for additional revenue," he said. "We're looking to businesses, we're looking to schools." Steffens on Monday discussed various other potential agreements to provide transportation services, all of which he said might someday become part of the funding puzzle for STARS. A public hearing was held on the proposed fare increases on Aug. 31. That hearing came a month after STARS restored its Route 1 service to Walmart at State and Brockway in Saginaw Township and its Route 69 service in afternoons to Big Lots and surrounding businesses and hotels in the Bay and Tittabawassee corridor. All in all, Stephens said, the public response to the fare increase has been largely positive, particularly because it will coincide with the reinstatement of Saturday service. "The public has been clamoring for this," he said. "Spread the word; Saturday buses are running again." In addition to the fare increase, Oct. 1 is also the date that buses will begin running on Saturdays. It will be the first Saturday with STARS service since 2012. Starting Saturday, Oct. 1, standard buses will run along STARS routes from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. each Saturday. In addition, the system's LIFT services will be offered from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each Saturday. Steffens admits that it won't meet the needs of everyone in the community, but called it a good first step toward expanding the authority's offerings. "It's a start," he said. "And I think that this is the best compromise given what we have here and what we have to work with." But the site manager, who has been functioning in the role since July, does not plan to stop there. Steffens said a rider and community survey will ask residents "what they want next" now that some Saturday service has been restored. Potentially, he said, that could mean an extension of weekday hours or full-day service on Saturdays, all within the context of the authority's limited financial resources. "This is just the beginning," Steffens said. "Hopefully, this starts a little bit of a health process and restores some faith in STARS." Here are all the changes to the STARS fare schedule, in greater detail: Fixed Route Fares   Current fare New fare Adults $1.25 $1.50 Seniors (Age 62) 0.60 0.75 Person with Disabilities 0.60 0.75 Children:     42", or taller than Farebox 1.25 1.50 Under 42", or shorter than Farebox 0.60 0.75 Transfer Free Free Lift Service   Current fare New fare Adults $5.00 $5.25 Seniors (Age 62) 2.50 2.75 Person with Disabilities 2.50 2.75 Children:     42", or taller than Farebox 5.00 5.25 Under 42", or shorter than Farebox 2.50 2.75 STARS  Card Fixed Route System (Monthly)    Current fare New fare All Passengers $50.00 $60.00 Seniors/Person with Disabilities 25.00 30.00  Round Trip Pass 2.50  3.00  Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

Roku today announced the Roku Express, Roku Premiere, Roku Premiere+, and Roku Ultra. All models are available for pre-order starting today, September 26, at Roku.com, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, and other retailers. Devices are expected to be in stores starting October 9. The Roku Express is the cheapest of the bunch with a price of $29.99. The tiny stick offers 1080p HD streaming, 802.11b/g/n wireless, and a simple IR remote for controlling the device. Roku is also including an adhesive strip so that you can stick the Express to your TV if you’d like. There will also be a Roku Express+ model that’ll cost $39.99 and will be exclusive to Walmart. This model comes with a composite jack and composite A/V cable (red/white/yellow) for use with older TVs. The next step up is the Roku Premiere for $79.99. The Premiere offers features like 4K Ultra HD video playback, support for upscaling 720p to 1080p or up to 4K on TVs that support it, 802.11ac MIMO dual-band wireless, a quad-core processor, and a listening mode that’ll adjust audio to maintain volume consistency. The Premiere is $79.99. Stepping up to the $99.99 Roku Premiere+ will get you HDR support, a better “point anywhere remote” with a headphone jack so that you can listen to your audio without disturbing others, a microSD card slot, and an ethernet port for a wired internet connection. The Roku Ultra is the most premium of this bunch. It includes all the features of the Premiere+ as well as Dolby Digital/Dolby Digital Plus decoding; optical digital audio out for hooking up to a receiver or sound bar, a USB port for local media playback; a “point anywhere remote” with voice search, gaming buttons, and a headphone jack; and a lost remote finder feature. As you might expect, the Roku Ultra is also the priciest of the bunch, carrying a price tag of $129.99.

Hopefully we're all around. Hired as a race for the play the pro is it time and at what trying to trying to scare rather at least a couple of a sudden want to play. Mentally dropped the ball with the wind blew in. Christian look at its banks I don't care who plays or vaginal radiate as I don't care who plays quarterback Steve grove of clay court if Belichick's fine quarterback were coming after. They have promised that. Now on Sports Radio WEEI. Shop you have an actor again. When she odd. Hello Reggie and I at week when I suspect he wins one game and suddenly he's back to be Wal-Mart I that you're hiding. Yes yes dropped his head right calls for the rest on the job in this late game. I have to bring him back to back Espionage Act gaps to set over the last couple weeks old they're gonna fire rubber roared got to get rid of the offensive coordinator at the rent is about leading the league and and win we each got one. Did any got once Zoellick said he has so much help and they tried giving away believing they just watch it. They bought because there's so much all Rex he's talking a lot of big giant peacock right now pop but it just felt like he'd like he did something. Coughlin Carson Palmer target Carson Palmer Rex Ryan and they and the bubble will try to get back. Took that as a big right to. You remember. Tonight they'll fewer than even. Agnico throw him out if you got a huge win them. And it just not to believe in them what does that do to your perception of new England and errors on huge winning. Do anything to. This well I think it's a good team so at first road game. Tuesday. Second quarter like crap out of quarterback and apparently it's suddenly. Carson and strippers aren't there is Carson now first arsenal at. Can we just throw this out at a for the top news. At Connecticut the soft like two. People this week. And in you can hear and feel. Brady suddenly dropped about re not. In the in the eyes of a fancy way it's done anything wrong. It's at these games and probably you know. And I saw that he ate pasta you know she ate salad and ego. And a lot of special it really. Given out ticket event. Well the best thing happened and easily get rest relax have some fun. You know you'll see how the other half lives like that money far equipment tomatoes and they get paid or tomatoes in his diet strawberries were not know that tomatoes may ask us to which has like India all its laboratory and laboratory opposite view let's say tomatoes and all of wood I could not eliminating just almost all of its power no water to be a sauce tomatoes to write this all of are everywhere the plates every used in a month that would do for you are simply let's talk respect doctor about it. But it got him. Am sorry that's. Actually yeah I like to. Follow you. Sure though bill wrapped up around eight gimme now you can zealot like a voting Europe I its own British nobles. I heard them and I heard a. These guys had portable. With these guys this won't get an I'm missing something here's a on this side might it could possibly be that I don't have the my understanding. And have a double check this this morning and I think it's correct. That of the New England Patriots were to trade away Tom Brady at the end of this. Football season which some people in because the delegate to first round tropics which by the way it'll. They would after taking the happy it. 27 million dollars is hit. Fortuitous to take 827. Million dollar kept him in a year in which you need to sign Jamie Collins. Donta hightower. To wait lesser degree because he's restricted. Malcolm Butler does this make any sense to anybody out. There's other guys on the team that need to be paid off so. Yeah doll now. Event of uprising I think there's there's some confusion and even you know called up this morning it to. Sacramento but it does after like everybody feels that to me grapples contract is up at the end of this year. And things need to be done at the end of this year and it's not the case right he has he has one more this year the rest of this year and then one more. So I I think there's a large audience a habit still believes that Jimmy grapples with free in a year I agree because of that they starts at all. Now what could keep both the army opted to Fred check what's their right. But the discussion we're having is the one about 2018 that young doesn't OK so let's stick with the guys at this point because I think they understand that I talked to a few people this weekend. Who were very willing to say good bye to operate I'd out. You know people have short memories. Have long and we Garros on Thursday they all I used in Italy I think people got about we're gonna forget about it. I have one guy really great patriots fan who really understands and watches to game and he's really into it. He's like oh you know whatever for the wall. Right inaudible whatever you do we go all talked and it's a Walter tonight organ intimately but he says they're going. At all. Brady outlook aren't that. Different tossed a credit. But the but they they throughout this the this morning. And it talking about. Even though they realize. The drop low was sheer and they realize some of them realize she's here for cheap dollar one point one million U. Jimmy. To be seen with pre every single week and I get up to like the east and we depend scrambled. That's what you're saying you can't force. Jimmy. Apple too slick as the first guy. Pulls ever speak now. What you're church and that's part of the game. I don't know opens different of the mentality of football or in the locker room. But there is like in his few exceptions that might be with in the two years so but it's always believed the you have arrives in county in arbitration. Meaning three years of Major League service though for your feel expected European and what you feel like you deserve. Have a good year by the league makes adjustment. Joseph you can make the adjustment and instant continue to be good high level an idiot three proved that you are you think you'll. It's not about 56 quarters for Jimmy drop in he's going to be offended pursuit behind Tom Grady. I don't I. And I don't Felix and that's when he left suddenly there's this feeling partisan mood out event six ethics rigged it but it do you what you're it would it would be accomplished. And it's not and I loved hole I'd love major leagues arbitration rules they should or should apply it to whomever hackable what are fun. Ethiopia he'll turn its forests okay who else is out there a particular team looking for quarterbacking you look at the landscape look who's coming out right now. The quarterbacks that are coming out. Tia Goff who hasn't played at all yeah of course of Wentz who looks like. The second coming which pretty cute. Amazing but it did a really nice last year quarterbacks I've played well through the first three occupant but you got out of Dallas pretty good looks like one right. Looks exactly like you got that stands straight up row of livery. On can't do it this guy is a young warm and it didn't go to Canada simian in Denver another guy winning what are they are what we're never gonna do with excellence which Sidney goes up post four cents. Media is great defense and the cornerback who played northwestern. Was good it was great but now I UN draft is upon. My thing is like. So you have all these young core coming house and we we talked orderly Lamar Jackson Lewis we actually watched quantum of watchable always unbelievable to watch out he's a flooding college quarterback. Think she could be Michael that's what he'll he'll bail in the NFL miserable. You'll do terrible and a two run first Eric that's in that topic is. Is very sensitive touchdowns this weekend and did not sized car Washington and it was again it was republic the first corner and like enough. But if you're able to see what these guys given Michael as a lead three games. OK after entire summer I wanna see that your which are made up of sorts he could figure out not received that we've all seen that it's completely different ways you handle. But he's solid you can drop ball deep view and in a two and a half games. You'll prize you know I'll take him over Mark Jackson I'll take him more to Shawn Watson Altec Kimmel cornerback anyone. Off. Okay when it's night if it was ball of salt if it does that they're TL lot and you actually see these I don't think it was a seven of these young guys. It was the second first round draft pick coming for if you clean the Yuri of these teams you have your choice. LaBarge action report that bullish there. Of guys coming out of college for one. First round draft pick which you already have on the board which you are secure version sucks open. Or getting to rubble for 20 typical from more Jackson am I don't think Google wish the second. Well first round draft pick coming from I think commencement tucked but this morning Erica mailed to cents I still think that would sum up the pay the price it. Do you look at some of the young quarterbacks in the league that have been built successful so far has brought costs Weiler. Kurt Jimmie Europe. You know I mean it's like a back up quarterback who shined in a few games to take a shot out of and he's been pathetic and he's awful it is a bad year it's a disabled on now. We wanna do the same thing. Forgot Jimmy grapple won in New England with coach Belichick and maybe that's the reason why it looks really good we wanna pull a couple of Houston Texan and get a guy I didn't hear that may be his. Isn't as good as we think we're lied in his defense and yet the Carolina's coach. We take a shot at somebody like at that press got you know to be ignored another rookie come out of calls that we watch and receipt but this guy can help us out let's not make the same mistake used it. He enters figures so think about this so did you start talking about the system and what's more important to coach cornerback. That's a depiction of that so when he backup quarterbacks they drafted that the development never got a shot to play in this system. The play with bill as a coach. With the supporting cast of the deepens with the skill position players who were called in to this system. Is that as a system with Joshua Jana to start by Charlie Weis it's still there. It's changed a little bit over the years but it's the mentality still legitimate NFL starting quarterback today. So if Ryan Mel's able to play three games he popped but it would heat what would he have the success would they would they tailor make a system for him just like that it percent. Well Brian Hoyer we see we see we did what he did it in in Chicago playing OK guy but he ended up but they spoke publicly look he wrote on Davey. Are you go down the line and look at all if they had an opportunity Matt Cassel he was that was it. Hasselbeck brought that point up as well. And that was he said it journal the team marching to look at it and say that's what he's like with the patriots and Cassel may be a great example of that. Scott Pioli was in Kansas City he knew more about castle than any other GM out here he elected to take him with some of that knowledge. Well guess what Cassel turned out to be just some of the guys. Just another. Our thoughts are mean and it costs while NC will he want NFL level is what acorda. We chaos and then you know maybe record setting defense like it that's Reese might want. That there's a chance that could actually. Her Jimmy drop public us whether this is a performance in Houston Davis it is the exact same scenario is that the defense. But it's the coach don't just McGinest yup it's it's just a Petri culture the gonna win that Denise need looks a lot better than that he's gonna let us. People keep bringing up kibo the team not only made two playoff but one play after it first of all it's a total brain fart by the secondary expert for winning it but more importantly. To get. A big part of that was that defense was starting to become really good. And they kept him in games so they made it better that what he really wants. Just a lot of people out that most is that who thought was legitimate NFL quarterback you'll get the siege by a lot of stuff. And can't tell if bill really believe stick Iraq. Can be the replacement for Britain as we've been saying here now for weeks that you week this thing out until you get through 2017. Season. Worst case scenario if you wanna deal apple you can franchise. And maybe get a top of the second and bottom of the first round pick formal knows what. What's wrong with. What we keep this thing out you look at the actual reinsurance starts and you say yes now Brady might have another year maybe he doesn't. Give yourself some kind of feel out. Why is it would have to make any move right now from Jamaica foolish hope we get 27 million to get money each rate Brady it's. It's not gonna happen as it is too early is a little premature to sit there and look at this situation. Socks which would ease our wished it was a wish. This was percent amber set weeded by about how good so it was until his third year. And then atomic below and then Brady would be 843. Instead of forty it would be easy for us because you could wait out I think he's got three more years. I think he's got he has three years of top five quarterback in him. So is this the season how they handle this and other manipulated to matured I think that this decision how they have to drop below decision. It makes is going to prove whether they have a good ten years in the future yes but it all debate bit but is it open it. As you saw you saw the divorce with her set which. I can't limited amount of plays very careful everything worked out a believable at the entire game if you get those special teams plays if you don't get those. Those turnovers. It it'll get those extra possessions. Then maybe it's a little bit different maybe like birth set plays OK only one of the world and it's maybe they sniff out the little quarterback keeper and it went for ten cent a touchdown. They just everything was her thing. These two years are behind that drop below as well usually the way a look at. Because you're right. Dear teams out here in the National Football League and you've seen them you saw in them this week. Dying to find that franchise quarterback OK Buffalo's been trying to for decades NM and able find it. So it's the most important thing to putting together a winning football. So if you happen. And tell what you actually believed to grapple is that guy going full. But I don't care for his feelings are hurt yes this that there with a freaking put what all next season all the rest of this year and all lick season you keep them around could you don't want. No checks also learned you can lose first round graphics they can take first round draft picks away from you if you can still exist you take away franchise quarterback. Good luck try to win seven games in the national football. A block. Are you know exactly did you feel actually looks. That's all I'm hearing. It from. About oh what about Jimmy. Killings. Killings. Artery then they've never shown they've had that chip in them it's all about. The business of winning and so you can get ahead of it and get ahead of it ultimately I think at what it's gonna happen. I think Brady will end up playing for another team not because of any other he's just not gonna wanna be done playing football. So his skills will diminish him maybe won't be Jimmy Jean David look leverage MG vehicles to play many won't Bieber sect. Merely some other kid who's coming out another three years who knows but it's not gonna stop just because I I figured Don we wanted to crumble now he's a wanna keep plane. I'll think about Peyton Manny he won a suitable with another team. You what to another team I know I was injury related but it puts instead of simply can't happen with Brady well we don't like it probably will he'll get some injury. Able appealed to recover from. Like like years not 22 year old available like it'll be recovered from an injury like a 42 year old. Do you think that they went you know when Bill Belichick talked well drafting crop alone start but a quarterback's agent contract situation. Of an extended Tom Brady. When you actually what you look at the structure of his contract that that was done for reason yeah you think that it's manageable salary cap. And that money and everything else and all of a sudden in 2018. This the cap pickles wake up again. All of a sudden you can trade or release him to save some money in the cap wrecked the whole contract changes. That 2018 season. Just a coincidence that that's when Jimmy go up blows up just in K state felt like drop below the got to move on with fewer remember they read I don't think that was a coincidence I think it did that for that reason. In the region that need to keep in three million relative to take away. The clause and there are of Alan energetic yet I basically say go get three years in a concert at renegotiate but you know it just so happens he's a senior at this kid. Is available or is a free agent. So you know what will leave the door open that we wanna make a change in mobile on we will. I can worry about the sort of coincidental that worry about feelings are we all Michael Jacoby. Played so well listen to get an opportunity so we're dumb and you know what will happen. This year we're gonna hearing during games have to get a nice lead comfortable lead. All Lipsky of Jimmy G and opportunity but Jacoby. Sean John is just sit there and I want. Yeah up already the guys he's so sad. Open up public guys all may go to the man. No. Known though it's no. It has nothing to do it there is not gonna happen but I do think he'll and a player with another team. It's crazy as it sounds he's not gonna go there he's not as a parent. And go that Troy Brown row which is not a problem that the guy played a long time to lock for the team. Did you want them leaving the one his presence there was OK with it. Tedy Bruschi not gonna happen battle situations gonna happen. Actually it's funny and I know Tom Brady is Tom Brady and any as the organization he's a franchise threes way to pick replacing your name. But we all know and we always talk about Belichick. Who gets rid of the guy a year early season rather a year too late. This has been going on now since the minute he walked in the war. We all know that when you stop and you're not worth it anymore you move on now and his name isn't deal for Ebola or or we will four or mail or. He's obviously it's Tom Brady but what makes you think it's gonna be any different with him. Well but but that's what people are saying though they think. That is what's going to Ghana was at the end of this year on an illness itself I have mixed for the people let's say in this year I think are aware of Acropolis in a year deal. But he was as that's over what I'll and that it will shift to the point seven years that money on exhibited that. You can't you can't but but you know what they can easily do. They could franchise. Grapple with the end of 2007 team and they deal more you think there would be team and a National Football League that would do you brought this up lest we can you probably correct. Could get more for him. If he had one year left at one point one million sure you come on the other hand. He's still probably going to get quite a bit. If you for which some and teams such desperate for corporate guys watched the play this weekend watching quarterbacks that are. That was Eli Manning doing in that game against it. Eli that the catcher Mike Fitzpatrick threw the cell line. Not like Obafemi about LeBron James not one. Not two not three not or not or land though not five yeah. Now things. I. Costello. I don't know that it isn't just seemed that you got just a magic geno Smith and a silent known of this is the guy. Ha ha everybody was text and and texted him back in which he's got to be a savior for us and and and if this is the guy. But this the guided it has to play because on that I'm worse than that every time you pay them this is what the march that knows I don't Marshall politic for this dude yeah deputy U want it this note how bad it might. Edgar Sosa still that it's practical it's it's a bad game we've seen it before. No interest he brought up a conference call nobody looked worse and patriots dude throughout the Kansas correct so our inequity Arizona comic that wanted to right now. And I still think that. It is not talent attesting to make the post season the keys. I think that's Patrick can do enough to get in there I also felt like at the Kiki is the reason by the problems once again there right alas that was like Beckham again. Six brick and X six Carson Palmer for. Hope that it's okay you're right Lou we've learned absolutely nothing we're three weeks into the season you're not gonna really know what these teams are you get two week in week nine week ten. Even more so I think now because of the luster. Lesson schedule that you have with with practices and stuff like some of these young quarterback to meet. And their success they're having a little bit startling you know have the same practice sessions and I'd go around the league that was doing the same thing. That you guys were the Panthers are one and two. Lost at all yesterday to the vikings widow last laughed at the same breath for trade that we not why L now. In order right now. And the Panthers are one and two this the team that went to the Super Bowl. A year ago it's the stuff you watching or around the lake apparently can't Newton 58%. Yet. Five picked and sacked twelve times. Rick brings that you share but it does James which that you football. Fifth eight times. If they created demand decreased need.

The Bank of Guam donation along with a recent $30,000 grant award from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA will be used for the development and implementation of sustainable food bank. The Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps VISTA as also granted Karidat a “Volunteer In Service To America” or VISTA Volunteer to assist with the development, implementation and evaluation of a food bank that addresses food security and climate change mitigation. Karidat has maintained a food pantry since it opened in May 1980, which has been supplying people in need with donated food from local businesses and canned food drives from schools and civic organizations. Typhoon Soudelor, which hit Saipan on August 2, 2015, exposed the need for a more robust food security program with the ability for remote community outreach. Many months after our initial recovery from Soudelor, Karidat is still being inundated with requests for food assistance and realizes just how difficult it is for some to get around the island to ask for help. Therefore, a viable food security program is important especially with the risk of more frequent extreme weather events in the future likely due to climate change. With our grant from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA, Karidat was able to purchase a pick-up truck that will assist us with the pick-up and delivery of food to the more remote villages on Saipan. With the help of our VISTA Volunteer we are working to develop a sustainable food bank which that will include satellite food storage facilities in select villages on Saipan, as well as Rota, and Tinian. Karidat is grateful for the recent donation from the Bank of Guam. We will utilize Bank of Guam’s donation to purchase the equipment we need to achieve our goal of a sustainable food bank that will not only address food security in the CNMI but be disaster ready too.

The young woman who ordered the cake for her police officer father’s retirement party, who asked to remain anonymous, initially asked for a cake with the “thin blue line symbol,” which is a black and white American flag with a thin blue stripe added in. The workers at the Walmart refused to decorate the cake, telling the woman that “the design could be perceived as racist” and that “nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” according to FoxNews host Todd Starnes. The woman then asked instead for a cake that simply had a blue line across the middle and the words “Blue Lives Matter,” which was again rejected by the workers. Eventually, a manager stepped in to call the woman and apologize. The manager then made the cake for the woman, but she said that it “looked terrible,” telling Starnes, “It doesn’t look professional.” “I was disappointed,” she admitted. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him.” Related Posts Trump offers controversial Jeff Sessions attorney general job White man to black Starbucks employee: ‘You’re garbage…I voted for Trump!’ Detroit reporter resigns after allegedly using N-word Grandma texts wrong teen about Thanksgiving, invites him anyway White teacher calls students ‘broke a** ni**ers who’ll get shot’ ​Trump’s proposed Muslim registry likened to internment camps Post navigation Previous Previous post: Hollywood finally embraces what it means to be black and awkward Next Next post: Google makes major tech move with National Museum of African American History Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America The best and worst NBA number 1 draft picks of all time The 30 greatest black movie soundtracks of all time Michelle Obama's birthday!: 52 memorable moments to celebrate the first lady's 52nd year 15 gifts we don't want for Christmas Recent Health Stories Breast cancer kills more black women than white women Fentanyl pills found at Prince's estate are 50 times stronger than heroin Woman goes to emergency room after trying new lipstick Study: Some medical students think black people feel less pain than whites Kanye West represents the victimhood, paranoia plaguing black men Gov.

Palm oil continues to leave behind a long record of environmental destruction and human rights abuses. The list includes widely-documented deforestation practices, along with the endemic air pollution across Southeast Asia that led to accusations of companies in Indonesia hiring mercenaries to take smog inspectors hostage. To that end, a recent WWF scorecard that evaluates companies’ performance offers some hope and surprise to consumers. But the report also shows the industry has much work to do in proving it can be more sustainable and responsible. The study evaluates 137 of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies. Scores are based on several factors, including membership in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the level of transparency in operations and supply chains, and commitment to sourcing what WWF defines as sustainable palm oil. WWF researchers also looked at whether companies actually purchased palm oil from reliable and sustainable sources, or if they relied on purchasing sustainable palm oil certificates from organizations such as GreenPalm. For consumers here in the U.S., the results are encouraging. Companies that received high marks from WWF include Walmart, McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Estée Lauder. Walmart, for example, has come far in the eyes of WWF since the first such survey in 2009. But while the world’s largest retailer is “leading the way,” there is still some room for improvement. The company largely relies on certificates and says it will not commit to buying only physical certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) until 2025. Other food producers and retailers, however, have a long way to go. And WWF asked customers and stakeholders to push these firms into action. The list includes Campbell Soup and Dunkin’ Brands, as well as the chain stores Kroger, Target, Costco and Safeway. Then there are the companies that earned a huge thumb’s down for not bothering to report at all, as in Hillshire Brands, Yum! Brands and one silent grocer that will surprise many: Whole Foods. And worldwide, if words are met by deeds, then only three companies can really say they are change-makers within the global palm oil supply chain. The Australian snack manufacturer Arnott’s, the French multinational Danone and Italy’s confectionery Ferrero are lauded by WWF for using 100 percent segregated palm oil supplies for their portfolio of products. Yet across Europe, which activists often blame for deforestation due to the region’s aggressive biofuels mandate, there are still too many companies, including large retailers, that either have tepid palm oil sourcing policies or did not respond to WWF’s survey at all. The WWF report is a sobering reminder that despite the growing outcry against the global palm oil sector, the chances are high that abuses will increase rather than decline. Last week media reports revealed that the price of palm oil on commodities markets are at a five-month high as supplies cannot meet global demand. Hence palm oil producers are looking beyond the world’s two largest producers of this ingredient, Indonesia and Malaysia, to new markets in Africa and Latin America. With half of the world’s processed food and personal care products containing palm oil, expect its impact on people and the planet to only become worse unless companies, civil society and governments can agree on a path to mitigate its widespread damage.

Aargh! From our Readers I visited Sam’s Club recently. As I walked in the front door, the first thing I saw was a fully lighted, decorated Christmas tree. To Sam’s Club, Walmart, Macy’s and other retailers, I submit the following: ’Tis not the season to be jolly, ’tis much too early for bells and holly. Let us have Thanksgiving first, then feel free to do your worst. Tempt us with your festive displays, empty our wallets with your winning ways. Bombard our senses with music and lights, until we pray for silent nights. But please, please wait until December, not October and not November — and never, never in September. Carole D. Martin Las Vegas Too much mud After watching all the political hate ads, I’ve reached the conclusion that none of these candidates is fit to hold office. How sad. Carolyn Boyle Las Vegas Silly scare In his Sept. 21 letter to the Review-Journal, Pat Sharp criticized the handling of the mercury contamination at Johnson Middle School. As someone who has had a lot of experience handling elemental mercury — and who was in charge of environmental safety programs, first at Caltech and later at UCLA — I would like to expand on Mr. Sharp’s points. It is appalling how this incident was handled — it must have been under the control of a governmental agency. I wonder if any non-governmental industrial hygienist was ever consulted. I doubt it. The people at the Environmental Protection Agency frequently blow up environmental contaminations to make themselves look important and essential. Holding school kids under quarantine until 5 a.m. was absolutely unnecessary. Elemental mercury is basically non-toxic unless large quantities are ingested or spread over large areas of skin for an extended period. Note, the toxicity of mercury in fish is because it is methyl mercury, which is a very toxic, organic form of mercury. Inhalation of mercury vapor does represent a serious long term hazard, but the vapor pressure of mercury at room temperature is very low. That means that very little mercury vapor is in the air above a spill of elemental mercury. The careful monitoring of everybody’s clothing was unnecessary, as any mercury contamination on clothing is easily removed by washing the clothing. Considering the amount of spilled mercury ultimately found (a quarter cup), ripping up a large amount of the gym flooring was totally unnecessary and I suspect was done mostly for show. An industrial vacuum cleaner equipped with a HEPA filter could have been used to clean up any spills, even those too small to be readily observed. In my professional opinion, this entire incident is a perfect example of governmental overkill and incompetence, and unnecessarily frightened many parents and kids. Walter F. Wegst Las Vegas Large fan base With regard to the recent letter to the Review-Journal from John Dillon of San Bruno, Calif., lamenting the Oakland Raiders’ proposed move to Las Vegas: Mr. Dillon must not have an economics degree.

The affluent Bel Air neighborhood, where Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Aniston are just two of the major celebrities in its zip code, is also home to four of California's top five largest residential water customers.  The affluent Bel Air neighborhood, where Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Aniston are just two of the major celebrities in its zip code, is also home to four of California's top five largest residential water customers Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has named seven of the affluent neighborhood's biggest water wasters, six of whose homes are pinpointed in this aerial photograph that shows just how lush and green their lawns continue to be more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

The investigative reporting organization used satellite images, algorithms and calculations to pinpoint the homes that had exceptionally lush and green landscapes, especially healthy plant life and relatively wet soil that indicated heavy irrigation.  These homes have fountains, swimming pools, waterfalls, thousands of flowers and, among some of them, more bathrooms then bedrooms.   1. Former CEO of Univision Jerrold Perenchio There are 12 bathrooms at the home of former Univision CEO Jerrold Perenchio. The billionaire's 21,500 sq foot chateau on Nimes Road also has a tree-lined driveway, pool and tennis court  Reveal estimates that Perenchio's estate uses between 6.1 and 12.3 million of gallons of water per year There are 12 bathrooms at billionaire Perenchio's 21,500 sq foot chateau on Nimes Road, not to mention a tree-lined driveway, pool, tennis court, 'extensive formal gardens' and one lawn that covers a quarter of an acre.  Half of an acre is planted in vineyards at the home, whose garden and facade were once used in the Beverly Hillbillies 1970s television show.  Reveal estimates that the estate uses between 6.1 and 12.3 million of gallons of water per year.  Asked to comment, Perenchio's assistant replied: 'We don't comment on anything'.  But the site found that some of the former CEO's lawns have turned brown since the spring, which could suggest a decrease in water usage.  2. Investment banker Garry Winnick At Casa Encantada on Bellagio Road one will find the home of investment banker Garry Winnick, who in 1999 was identified as the richest person in Los Angeles Casa Encantada has 64 rooms, including 20 bathrooms, and was estimated to be worth $225million in 2013. Reveal estimates that the estate uses somewhere between 4.6 to 9.3 million gallons of water per year At Casa Encantada on Bellagio Road one will find the home of Garry Winnick, who in 1999 was named the richest person in Los Angeles. Of the 64 rooms inside Casa Encantada are seven bedrooms and a whopping 20 bathrooms.  The home, which was listed for $225million in 2013 but was not sold, also has a pool house and a grand terrace with a fountain.  There were once 40,000 flowers blooming on the 8-acre grounds, according to the Los Angeles Times, and there is also a pool, tennis and basketball courts and a personal putting green.  Reveal estimates that the estate uses somewhere between 4.6 to 9.3 million gallons of water per year. Winnick did not respond to requests for a comment.  3. Movie producer, co-owner of Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Dodgers Peter Guber This Lausanne Rosd compound belongs to movie producer Peter Guber and was once owned by Mary Tyler Moore There are nine wooded acres on the grounds, including a pool and tennis court. Reveal estimate that the estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year At Guber's Lausanne Road compound, which once belonged to Mary Tyler Moor, there is a 14,000 sq ft of interior space and an additional 2.700 sq ft property that acts as his wife's studio. Guber, who is a co-owner of both the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Dodgers, has nine wooded acres on his grounds, including a pool and tennis court.  The property is estimated to use between 2.8 million and 5.5 million gallons of water per year. A spokesman for Gruber did not return a request for comment.  At the Strada Vecchia home, owned by billionaire Laurie, there are six bedrooms and four bathrooms.  The estate has fives acres of grounds, which include a pool, tennis court and a half-acre lawn full of trees. Reveal estimate that the estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year.   4. Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie At the Strada Vecchia home, owned by billionaire heiress Nancy Walton Laurie, there are six bedrooms and four bathrooms  The estate has fives acres of grounds, which include a pool, tennis court and a half-acre lawn full of trees. Reveal estimates that Laurie's  estate, which was sold for $20million in 2001, uses between 2.3 million and 4.6 million gallons of water per year On Bellagio Road one will find the mansion Daly shares with his wife, Grammy and Academy Award-winner Carole Bayer Sager.  The 11-bedroom estate has eight bathrooms and 11,600 sq ft of interior space, with a 500-foot-long driveway and a pool shaped like a half-moon.   It's central lawn is the size of half an acre and the estate is believed to consume 2.1 million to 4.2 million gallons of water per year.  Daly told Reveal has been 'responsible' about his water usage, which he estimated to be around 4 million gallons per year, telling the organization: 'I can't help the fact that I own a lot of property'.  The former Warner Bros chairman said he has since replaced lawns with artificial turf and pebbles as the state's drought intensified and said his water usage dropped by 35 percent since 2014.  5. Beverly Hilton hotel owner Beny Alagem This Bel Air Road mega mansion, which belongs to Beverly Hilton hotel owner Beny Alagem, is the 49th largest home in the entire country and has three acres of grounds  The estate includes three fountains, a swimming pool and formal gardens, as well as a lawn the size of half an acre. Reveal estimates water usage to be between 2 million and 4 million gallons per year The Bel Air Road mega mansion, which belongs to Alagem, is the 49th largest home in the entire country.  There are three acres of grounds, including three fountains and a swimming pool.  Formal gardens are also on the estate, as well as a lawn the size of half an acre.   Reveal estimates water usage to be between 2 million and 4 million gallons per year, but Alagem's spokeswoman said he is increasing his conservation efforts and takes the report 'very seriously'.   6. Soap opera producer Bradley Bell and wife Colleen, the US Ambassador to Hungary  On North Carolwood Drive is this 10-bedroom mansion that belongs to soap opera producer Bradley Bell and his wife Colleen The estate has five acres that includes a tree-lined lawn and formal gardens that include a large artificial waterfall. The organization estimates that just the home's landscaping would require 2 million to 3.9 million gallons of water per year On North Carolwood Drive is the Bell's 10-bedroom mansion, which once belonged to Rod Stewart.  The estate has five acres that includes a tree-lined lawn and plenty of palm trees.  Its formal gardens, which includes a large artificial waterfall that cascades down a hillside, were featured in Architectural Digest and called the estate's 'pièce de résistance', according to Reveal.  The organization estimates that just the home's landscaping would require 2 million to 3.9 million gallons of water per year, a figure that does not include the garden's waterfall. A spokeswoman declined to comment.  Although the biggest water waster will remain unnamed for now, they will not be so lucky the next time a drought emergency is declared.  Last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that requires local water agencies to set limits on how much water customers can use during an emergency, even if they can pay for it.  The law will also requires that violators' names be released to the public.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 212 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

By Jon C. Ogg September 25, 2016 10:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has enjoyed a serious gain in 2016, but that was after the wheels fell of the Wal-Mart truck in 2015. Now the Dow Jones Industrial Average component and retail giant is up 20% year to date, and the stock is up almost 17% from a year ago. That will mask at least some of the notion that the shares were down 0.7% in the past week and are up a mere 0.2% in the past month. 24/7 Wall St. has noticed that some analysts have increased their ratings and targets on Wal-Mart in recent days in weeks. It is quite possible that these analyst calls will be viewed as being late to the Wal-Mart recovery party. Still, they needed to be looked at. Wal-Mart was raised to Overweight from Equal Weight with an $87 price target at Barclays on Friday, September 23. The prior closing price was $72.19. Wal-Mart shares also closed up eight cents, or 0.11%, at $72.35 on Friday. On September 16, Credit Suisse raised its rating to Outperform from Neutral. The firm also raised its price target to $80 from $62. The report said: Walmart’s in-store investments and a better low-end consumer have yielded the return of traffic growth against a deteriorating staples retail landscape. While there is more work to do, early progress has been encouraging. We see a continuation of top-line momentum as management invests further, and although earnings growth is limited, risk to consensus looks low. This set-up should yield outperformance in an uninspiring coverage universe. Back on September 14, 24/7 Wall St. featured Wal-Mart as one of four stealth stocks for a volatile market according to Jefferies. The report said at the time: Our August pricing work showed that Walmart continued to invest in price, particularly in the dollar store and grocery baskets, which contain high visibility food and consumable SKUs. Based on our recent conversations with WMT, we believe they remain pleased with the results and expect expansion of this initiative. We expect the price investments to continue and cost out initiatives should fund this, so we reiterate our Buy rating. On September 12, Cowen raised its rating to Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst also raised the price target to $83 from $76. Cowen’s view was that a good trend is your friend and they think it is still early enough to buy shares to see positive returns. Cowen said: A combination of price investments, creative integration of physical + digital & the Jet acquisition position Walmart to regain retail dominance. WMT drivers & a healthy consumer should drive stable comps of 1-2% with upside potential. Importantly, we do not expect a negative surprise at Oct. analyst day & would be comfortable owning into event. Also on September 12, Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and its $86 upside price target. The firm said in that call: Our August pricing work showed that Walmart continued to invest in price, particularly in the dollar store and grocery baskets, which contain high visibility food and consumable SKUs. Based on our recent conversations with Walmart, we believe they remain pleased with the results and expect expansion of this initiative. We expect the price investments to continue and cost out initiatives should fund this, so we reiterate our Buy rating. JPMorgan has a mere Neutral rating, and on September 19 it lowered its price target to $74 from $75. This call was based on lowered estimates after factoring in the purchase price against earnings that it paid for Jet.com to better compete against Amazon. That price was $3 billion in cash, a portion of which is payable over time, and $300 million in Walmart stock. JPMorgan’s thesis and valuation said: Walmart is in a period of wage, IT, and price investments for improving relevance in a rapidly changing, omni-channel retail world at the expense of medium-term profits. WMT’s large market share (20%+) and mix (55%) in the lower-growth grocery category make the transition more difficult from a financial perspective given the challenges growing traffic/comps. This plus the investment cycle suggest that earnings growth will continue to be challenged for the intermediate future. Our December-2016 price target of $74 reflects our updated 2017 forecast and is based on ~16x P/E, which is one turn above its historical FY1 P/E valuation and slightly below its current valuation on FY16 estimate. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Wal-Mart shares closed at $72.35 on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $56.30 to $75.19. The retail giant has a consensus analyst price target of $74.99. What investors might want to look at is the consensus price target history from Thomson Reuters: $72.94 a month ago, $69.07 just two months ago and $69.11 three months ago. By Jon C.

Let's fix them. By  Kelly Heyboer | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 25, 2016 at 10:10 AM, updated September 25, 2016 at 11:38 AM Print Email If you buy a product online from Amazon or pick up a product off a shelf at Walmart, chances are good that item was handled by a temporary worker at some point. Nationwide, the temp industry is booming, according to federal statistics. Workers hired on a temporary basis for short-term or long-term assignments have become a cornerstone of the warehouse and shipping business. Blue-collar temps — who are usually paid between the minimum wage of $8.38 and $11 an hour in New Jersey — often unload trucks, sort packages, pack boxes and work at manufacturing plants. 'I am illegal': One temp worker's story Last week, NJ Advance Media published "The invisible workforce," a series of stories chronicling the alleged racial discrimination, low wages, unsafe working conditions and mistreatment some New Jersey temp workers say they face on a daily basis. Part of the problem is many temps fear filing complaints about mistreatment because they are new immigrants or workers living in the U.S. illegally, advocates say. Carmen Martino, a professor in Rutgers University's labor relations department (Carmen Martino)  Carmen Martino has been following the temp industry in New Brunswick for three decades, first as a union official and later as one of the founders of New Labor, a worker advocacy group. He is now a professor of professional practice in the labor relations department at Rutgers University. Martino spoke to NJ Advance Media about the state of the temp industry and ways to improve conditions for workers. Here is an edited transcript: How did you first come across the growing blue-collar temp industry? In the late 1990s, I was working for the New Jersey Industrial Union Council in downtown New Brunswick. I would come to work very early in the morning. Along that route, I started to see lines of workers at 5 o'clock in the morning waiting to go into these office spaces or what looked like homes. They were basically make-shift temp agencies. We started to do some investigating. It turned out the vast majority of the temps, at least in the late 1990s, were immigrants from the same place — Oaxaca, Mexico. It was sort of like a pipeline that had been created. Why were so many temps needed? The late 90s was a time when retailers began to import more and more items from abroad. There was a huge explosion of goods being brought into the Port of Newark. The goods had to be put somewhere, so all of these warehouses were being built off of Exit 8A on the Turnpike. So, the demand was there for low-paid workers. The immigrants came because employers were waving flags that they would give them jobs. Are conditions getting better or worse for temp workers? The dynamics of the temp industry continually force labor costs and wages down. We used to say that this model of work was a race to the bottom. It probably has hit the bottom. If you're a temp worker now and you've been employed by the same temp agency and were sent to the same warehouse for five years, there's a high probability that you're still making less than $9 an hour. Pay isn't improving. And warehouse jobs are very dangerous. There's a high rate of injury — repetitive stress, back injuries. The conditions have only gotten worse over the years. Invisible workforce: How temporary labor works in N.J. Some advocates have compared temp work to a modern-day sweatshops. Is that accurate? Yes. A hundred years ago they called it the "sweating system." New Labor calls it the "cheating system." The consumer taking an item off the shelf at Walmart has no idea of the conditions temp workers face. The multi-national companies contract to the manufacturers. Then, the logistics companies that move the goods and operate the warehouses hire the temp agencies. Then, the temp agencies hire the low-wage workers. All it does, every step of the way, is worsen the working conditions and hold down or reduce worker's wages. Is the government doing enough to monitor the temporary employment industry? The state is working to the best of its ability to enforce labor laws. The federal government, through OSHA and the Department of Labor, is doing the best that it can. But none of those agencies are equipped with the resources and manpower to really be able to enforce the law and make employers do their job. The industry is under-regulated and, not surprisingly, very resistant to efforts to pass new regulations. In some states, such as Illinois and Massachusetts, stronger laws were passed to protect temp worker rights. A few attempts to pass legislation in New Jersey have been stopped by the industry's lobbying efforts.  Would raising minimum wage help? The proposed $15 minimum wage is a good thing. But, in low-wage temping, agencies live off a very slim margin to be profitable. I don't know how a $15 minimum wage would work in temp agencies in New Brunswick. It would create some very tumultuous times in the industry. I could envision situations where agencies might have to close or consolidate. That consolidation might not be a bad thing for the temp workers. There's no way of knowing. Why aren't temp workers in unions? The National Labor Relations Board's Browning vs. Ferris decision last year was a very significant step forward. It means, at least in principle, temp employees are able to get union recognition. In the past, it was nearly impossible for that to happen. The NLRB decision encourages unions to think seriously about organizing workers who are temporary. New Labor has been trying to figure out ways to work with unions. There certainly has been more coordination between worker centers, like New Labor, and unions nationally. Are you hopeful about the future for these workers? Yes. Temporary work is with us and it's not going to go away. If both temporary and permanent workers are represented by unions on a job site, then I think we have a model that might work better than the one that we have now. None of that is going to happen without a real fight and a real concerted effort by worker centers like New Labor and the unions they partner with. How do you solve the problem that many temps are immigrants living in the U.S. illegally? The only place a temp worker who is undocumented has rights is in the workplace. Wage and hour laws, workplace safety laws, discriminations laws still count even if a worker is undocumented. It's a matter of people wanting to stand up for themselves. And undocumented workers are going to have to take chances. The only way they are going to take a step forward is if they try to exercise those rights. There's a larger problem to be fixed on immigration on a national level with comprehensive immigration reform. I'm not hopeful that there will be much movement on immigration reform. But I am hopeful that workers will enforce their rights in the workplace, regardless of their immigration status. That's the place where they can focus their time and energy and experience immediate improvements. Kelly Heyboer may be reached at kheyboer@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @KellyHeyboer.

Awake and talking some, the Palatine boy remains in the intensive care unit at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez   Burt Constable Follow @BurtConstable     A popular waitress at Jelly Cafe in Mount Prospect, Rosie Rodriguez was handling the Friday lunch rush on Sept. 9 when she got a phone call that merely hinted at the life-altering disaster coming. Her 11-year-old son, Dary, had a headache and was in the nurse's office at Stuart R. Paddock School in Palatine, where he is a sixth-grader. They had no idea this could surpass other challenges they've faced. related advertisement   "When he was a baby, we'd sleep in the Wal-Mart (parking lot) because my son and me, we were homeless in Texas," says the 38-year-old. She moved there by herself 13 years ago from her hometown in Mexico, and Dary was born two years later. With no contact or support from the father, Rodriguez and Dary moved to Palatine when the boy was 2 and forged a happy life. Thumbing through photos on her phone to show her son dancing and having fun in selfies he sends daily to his aunts in Mexico, Rodriguez stumbles across pictures of a smiling Dary sitting next to backpacks and coolers on a cold park bench last winter in Chicago. "We made sandwiches and Mexican hot chocolate for homeless people. We take the train and every homeless person we see, we give it to them," Rodriguez says. The kindness they sow is coming back tenfold, mostly through a youcaring.com fundraising website set up by Kaitlin Kretsch, who owns the Jelly Cafe with her husband, Billy. "I can't believe it that people love me," Rodriguez says, wiping tears from her eyes. "I really appreciate it."    Rosie Rodriguez got a phone call from her son's school in Palatine saying Dary had a headache. But it turned out to be much more than that. The boy, 11, was flown to Lurie Children's Hospital that same day, where a neurocritical care team saved his life. Nurse Meredith Williams tends to him in the pediatric intensive care unit. - Gilbert R. Boucher II | Staff Photographer Even before anyone knew Dary's headache was the result of a near-fatal hemorrhage in his brain, Billy Kretsch was trying to help. While Rodriguez was waiting tables, he drove to the boy's school and told the nurse he was delivering chewable pain relievers. "By the time I was done with that conversation the nurse said, 'I think we should call an ambulance,'" Billy Kretsch says. The school called Rodriguez again. "They told me he's bad, bad, bad. He's crying," Rodriguez says. After Dary arrived at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, doctors quickly decided to transfer the boy to Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. "He didn't know who I was," Rodriguez says, explaining how her son stared off into space. "I cried bad. I didn't want to think, just cry." As a fellow waitress drove a frantic Rodriguez, a helicopter rushed the now-unconscious boy to Lurie Children's Hospital, where Dr. Craig M. Smith, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit, says he "rallied the troops" in the neurocritical care team to deal with "an evolving brain catastrophe." "Time is brain," Smith says, meaning the more time that passes, the more a brain can be damaged. Pressure was building in Dary's brain because of bleeding caused by an arteriovenous malformation, a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins in the brain. The defect can go undetected for a lifetime, or it can start bleeding and cause problems at any age. If Dary had taken an ambulance fighting with traffic instead of the helicopter to Lurie, the outcome would have been different. "Ultimately, death. There's no other way around this," Smith says. "He was under such pressure and so sick when he came in." A team of Lurie specialists headed by neurosurgeons Tadanori Tomita and Robin Bowman and neuro-interventional radiologist Ali Shaibani stabilized Dary, drilled a hole in the boy's head that night and inserted a drain to relieve the pressure. Forty-eight hours later, they inserted a second drain for the other side of his brain. They kept Dary in a coma and took "meticulous control" of his temperature, electrolytes, glucose levels and anything else that could have taxed the boy's brain, Smith says. His mom slept by his side that first night and since then has been given a room in the nearby Ronald McDonald House. A week after the bleeding started, Dary was stable enough to undergo surgery to clip out the clump of problem blood-vessel tissue. Now, everyone is waiting to see how quickly and how well he recovers.    A waitress who goes out of her way to make others feel good, Rosie Rodriguez of Palatine says she is grateful for the outpouring of help after her son, Dary, 11, suffered life-threatening bleeding in his brain. - Gilbert R. Boucher II | Staff Photographer "They told me two weeks, two months, a year. They don't know," says his mom, who adds that she doesn't know what is covered under her Illinois All Kids insurance. "I pray so much and I say to my family, 'Pray for my kid.' I tell my Lord, 'Don't take my son.' He has to stay calmed down, so that's why I stopped crying." There are no guarantees, but Smith says he hopes doctors can get the boy starting rehabilitation soon and maybe even back in school before the year ends in the spring. "We find that kids can make remarkable recoveries," Smith says, telling stories of kids who go home in wheelchairs unable to speak, only to walk in for appointments six months later as if nothing had happened. "That's one of the most satisfying things I can be part of." In the meantime, Smith is impressed by the outpouring of support for Dary and his mother that has grown because of the Jelly Cafe owners, staff and customers. "It's pretty inspiring when people stand up for each other like that," Smith says. "I appreciate it so much," Rodriguez says. The waitress who drove her to the hospital stayed by her side for hours that first night. Another waitress drove to her apartment the next day and did the dishes. A neighbor took in two of Dary's three guinea pigs, and the Kretsches, parents of daughters Paige, 2½, and Hayden, 1, are looking after Tyson, the biggest guinea pig. Jelly Cafe is collecting donations for Dary and his mom at the restaurant and through the youcaring.com site, which is touted on posters and the cafe's menu. "One side has our specials, and the other side tells what's going on with Rosie," says Kaitlin Kretsch, who canceled Rodriguez's cable TV and Dary's after-school program and is looking for others ways to save money until the waitress can return to work. She says Rodriguez goes out of her way to help others. "I like to share whatever I have. My son is the same," Rodriguez says. "Sometimes, I have homeless people sleep in my house. He brings the pillows and blankets and asks, 'Are you OK? Do you need anything?'" She's a hit with diners. "I get more requests to sit in her section than I do for any other waitress. I've had people wait 45 minutes to sit in her section," Billy Kretsch says of Rodriguez. "She collects our recyclables to donate to her church. She collects clothing to donate to her church." Rodriguez is especially good with children and older people. "Rosie's always kissing kids on the head or trying to teach them Spanish," Kaitlin Kretsch says.   Shown during a winter outing to hand out sandwiches to the homeless in Chicago, Rosie Rodriguez and her son, Dary, 11, now are receiving help from others. - Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez "I love it. It's my pleasure," Rodriguez says, explaining that she is driven to make people happy. "We don't know what happened in their homes, what happened in their lives." Now those customers know about the tough times she and Dary are facing. "Rosie, you may not have local family, but know that you have a tight-knit community who loves you and will be thinking of and praying for you and Dary," reads one youcaring post. "He's a great kid," says Rachel Bland, Dary's school principal, who is spreading the word. "As a community, we're going to do this." The donations should keep Rodriguez afloat until she can return to work, Kaitlin Kretsch says. "Her job would never be in jeopardy. She's got all the time she needs, however long it takes," Billy Kretsch says.   Shown during a winter outing to hand out sandwiches to the homeless in Chicago, Rosie Rodriguez and her son, Dary, 11, now are receiving help from others. - Courtesy of Rosie Rodriguez Rehab could be lengthy and difficult. But everyone has hope. Dary sat up Thursday, and even asked his mom to go back to work. "I want this kid to go back to being who he was," says Smith of Lurie Children's Hospital. "I want him to be a good boy," Dary's mom says, "and he is."

John Bean, who is the principal at Highcrest Elementary School in Wethersfield, was arrested at a Walmart on Saturday in Hartford. He was charged with interfering with an officer and second-degree breach of peace. "As always, our most important priority is the continuity of high quality instruction for our students, and we are taking steps to ensure that the high level of instruction at Highcrest School will continue during Mr. Bean’s leave," said Wethersfield School Superintendent Michael Emmett. When students and parents talk about Bean, many of them sung him praises. "Mr. Bean has always been so professional," said Samantha Griffin, a parent. "So nice, so gentle with the kids." They said they were astonished to learn of the charges. "When I heard he was arrested, I was shocked," Griffin said. Police have not released the details of what happened. "To hear anything about him being arrested is completely out of character and unexpected," Griffin said. Bean was placed on leave while the legal process plays out. "I think they're definitely making all the right choices," said Michael Gowdy, a parent. "Take him out of the school for right now figure out what's going on and then see if it's right to put him back." Griffin agreed that placing Bean on leave was the correct call. However, she said she's a little concerned about how the situation will impact her children, who are in kindergarten and first grade. She said her children will miss him at school. "If he's gone for an extended period of time the kids are gonna notice because he's so involved in the community," she said. In the end, parents told Eyewitness News that they hope Bean is exonerated so they can go back to praising him. "Hopefully this is just a big misunderstanding or something," Gowdy said. "They gotta have the legal system figure out what's going on and hopefully everything's ok and he can come back and continue being the principal here." Bean is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. To read the letter sent to parents, click here. Copyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

A Union County grand jury also indicted Blake Clay, 33, of Rahway, on a charge of theft by deception, acting Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park said Monday. She said all the charges are third degree crimes. Clay went to Walmart and Target stores in Clark, Edison, Linden, and Woodbridge multiple times from early February through late April and used counterfeit barcodes to significantly lower the prices of various items, the prosecutor said. On more than 10 occasions, Clay allegedly picked up items ranging in price from $15.99 to $39.99, authorities said. When he switched the bar codes, the items rang up at the register from $1.50 to $4.50, authorities said. Clay was served with a summons in May and was suspended from the police department without pay, authorities said. He was earning an annual salary of $83,308, according to state records. The charges resulted from an investigation of the Special Prosecutions Unit in the prosecutor's office, Park said. Third-degree charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison upon conviction. Attempts to reach Clay for a comment were unsuccessful. Tom Haydon may be reached at thaydon@njadvancemedia.com.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Todd Leva: Shootings detract from real problems of Black America Monday Sep 26, 2016 at 5:06 PM The fact is, if by the grace of God there was never another police shooting of an innocent black man, America’s black community will still be steeped with real multi-generational, community fracturing, deadly problems that have to get addressed if real change is desired. By Todd LevaCommunity Columnist I’ve watched the latest chaos in Charlotte closely. I lived there for three years studying for my undergrad at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Our youngest daughter was born there and, as a young couple, my wife and I really grew together there. We loved our time there and to see that mayhem is heartbreaking. On the flip side of that, if I am honest with you, it also makes me angry. The problems with this greater issue of police shootings, race, riots, our nation's inner cities, the moral decay of those inner cities, and the economic backdrop is almost endless in scope. Woven throughout this ongoing sad American tale is the erraticism of raw human emotions that are highly charged, perception-driven and, at times, irrational. On one side, these emotions are a driving force of the mob mentality we have seen on countless streets in so many cities of late. On the other, these emotions drive fear, biases and stereotyping. Regardless of side, these raw emotions help feed the inability for America to have a grownup discussion about these issues and their real effects — and God forbid some semblance of solutions. Many may label me a racist when I write that this rioting we have seen time and time again seems so senseless to me. It is literally like watching a pack of raging animals that smell a fresh kill. There is simply no justification for it. None. Looting a Wal-Mart, burning down businesses, hurting innocent people, will never advance a position, nor should it. It only fuels furthers division. I also believe that within the black community (never mentioned), there are these underpinnings of feelings that include despair, guilt, shame and a sense of hopelessness. All it takes is a spark and these emotions are vented and expressed in harmful, illogical ways that ultimately hurt the cause of all black people; especially if this spark comes from outside the black community — enter your local police departments. It's human nature to rally together toward a greater enemy, and our local police departments are sadly filling this role. As well, it’s equally human for it to be difficult for deep introspection, to have thoughts and ideas that go against the mass drum of anger. It is one reason why we see such rage and denial when topics like black-on-black crime or Black Lives Matter are discussed. The hypocrisy is hard for many to see and even harder to talk about. The fact is, if by the grace of God there was never another police shooting of an innocent black man, America’s black community will still be steeped with real multi-generational, community fracturing, deadly problems that have to get addressed if real change is desired. There is no doubt we have seen far too many instances where a police officer has shot someone without justifiable cause. Each time it is tragic and very well may be criminal. However, our nation is quick to second-guess a job that has become all but impossible to do. Our nation's police force is asked to do something no other job demands, and that is perfection every second or face prison time. They are also asked to be America’s protector, social worker, psychologist and parent. The good cops far outweigh the handful of the bad but now today every cop is in more danger than at any time I can remember. While police shootings take the headlines, in cities like Chicago the evidence is overwhelming that black lives matter very little. Right now some little black boy in an unnamed inner city is already a statistic, he just doesn’t know it yet. When he dies we won't know it; we’ll never hear about it because right now, unless he is shot by a police officer, it doesn’t seem his life really matters — and nothing could be sadder. — Todd Leva is a resident of Zeeland.

The Brookhaven Courier Student News Since 1978 Skip to content Campus News Arts & Entertainment Local News Opinion Sports Send Us News ← Coach mentors students on, off court IPS speaker talks Mexico, cartels → Instant film convention develops in North Texas Posted on September 26, 2016 | Leave a comment Brookhaven College professors, photographers and celebrities to be featured at world’s first convention centered on instant film photography. By Amber Gipson Arts & Culture Editor Photo Courtesy of Instant Film Society   Lately there has been a resurgence of nostalgic artifacts, and instant film cameras are no exception. “There is something special about shooting instant film [that] makes you really consider each exposure and slow down and get it right,” according to Guy Reynolds, Dallas Morning News photo editor. This shift is evident as sales of digital cameras have started to drop, according to an article from The Wall Street Journal. Representatives from Fujifilm Holdings Corp. said they expect the company to sell a record 5 million units of their various models of instant film cameras, compared to a predicted 1.4 million digital cameras. The company sees this sales increase as a continuing trend, and on Sept. 6, announced a new line of black-and-white instant film. A group of local photographers, educators and hobbyists are hoping to capitalize on this resurgence. “Now, every mall in North America with an Urban Outfitters sells instant film, and even many big box retailers like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Jo-Ann Fabrics have started to stock some instant films and cameras,” Daniel Rodrigue, Brookhaven College photojournalism professor and Instant Film Society co-founder, said. PolaCon: An Instant Film Convention, will be the world’s first 3-day instant film photography convention, Rodrigue said. The convention will take place Sept. 30-Oct. 2 in Dallas and Denton, Texas. Steve and Erin Reeves, of MakeShift Photography, former Brookhaven students and current continuing education instructors, will also lead discussions on the basics of packfilm and a lesson on digitally scanning instant film photographs. PolaCon2016 will coincide with the IFS’s fifth annual #PolaWalk at the State Fair of Texas, and feature actor and photographer Jason Lee as a special guest speaker, as well as Patrick Tobin from Impossible Project. The IFS was founded in 2012 by a group of film photographers and educators to increase awareness, accessibility and understanding of instant film photography, according to the DMN. Rodrigue said that IFS members from North Texas and Los Angeles first started discussing a centrally located event with workshops as early as 2014. The planning slowly took shape and PolaCon2016 was announced on social media in September 2015. According to IFS’s website, the group has partnered with Film Photographic and Denton Camera Exchange to host PolaCon2016. It will feature special guest speakers and photographers, panel discussions, a camera swap meet area, an instant film pop-up exhibition, 8″x10″ demos and an 8″x10″ instant photo booth. There will also be film- and camera-specific walks, meet-ups, special pop-up events, Polaroid-friendly photo-ops and backdrops. PolaCon2016 will begin with a 4 p.m. meet-up Sept. 3o in Deep Ellum followed by a mini PolaWalk to Fair Park for the 5th annual rain-or-shine #PolaWalk at the State Fair of Texas. At 7:30 p.m., attendees will meet at Big Tex for a group portrait, camera swaps and scavenger hunt. The event will end with a “Neon at Night” walk through Deep Ellum. Saturday and Sunday of PolaCon are free to attend. However, some workshops, how-to demos, and guest speakers will have limited seating and be restricted to guests who sent RSVPs. All Saturday and Sunday attendees must register through Eventbrite at bit.ly/PolaCon2016. The Second Annual PolaCon will take place Oct. 13-15, 2017.   Share This entry was posted in Local News.

 sweet potato pound cake loafs in more than 500 stores." />     Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            Brown Betty Dessert Boutique Closing Its Store, Going Wholesale by Michael Klein, Philadelphia Inquirer Posted: Monday, September 26, 2016 at 3:22PM EDT Oct. 1 will be the last day to walk into Brown Betty Dessert Boutique in Northern Liberties to snag cupcakes. After 12 years, Norrinda Brown Hayat and her mother, Linda Hinton Brown, say they plan to close their shop to focus on wholesale opportunities. Chief among them is a partnership with Patti LaBelle and Walmart that has Brown Betty's sweet potato pound cake loafs in more than 500 stores. Hayat, a Washington-based lawyer, and Brown, a retired teacher, opened their first location in 2004 in Liberties Walk, near the current location at 722 N. Second St. Among the bakery's distinctions was coverage in the Oprah Magazine, appearances on the Katie Couric Show and the Food Network with Duff Goldman. Both Food & Wine and National Geographic named theirs among the best cupcakes in America. The Brown Betty Cookbook, published in 2012, provided stories behind some of the shop's hits, including a sweet potato cheesecake and an obscenely delicious bundle of calories in the form of a chocolate ganache layer cake called Hattie Don't Play.

(Photo: Chris McKee/flickr/cc) Citing the environmental and public health risks of factory farming, a $1.25 trillion coalition of multinational investors has called on 16 global food corporations—including Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, and Walmart—to cut their reliance on meat and diversify into plant-based sources of protein.  The campaign launched Monday is backed by a new briefing from the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return) Initiative and responsible investment organization ShareAction, entitled, The Future of Food: The Investment Case for a Protein Shake-Up (pdf). Our current food system is unsustainable, the report states, listing greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and growing antibiotic resistance as among the negative consequences of "the factory farming model and the increasing overconsumption of animal products." In fact, the briefing warns, if livestock production and consumption are not swiftly reduced, it will be impossible to reach the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement. An Oxford University study released in March projected that by 2050, food-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for fully half the emissions the world can afford if global warming is to be limited to less than 2°C. According to the FAIRR/ShareAction report: [T]he livestock sector currently accounts for 14.5 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions: more than the global transport sector. While there are certainly improvements to be made in production and distribution efficiencies, research indicates that these have only a small part to play; with, for instance, a reduction in food waste likely to lower food-related emissions by just 1 to 3 percent. In contrast, adopting global dietary guidelines with lower meat consumption would cut food-related emissions by 29 percent, vegetarian diets by 63 percent, and vegan diets by 70 percent. "The world's over-reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social, and environmental crisis," said FAIRR founder Jeremy Coller, who also serves as chief investment officer for Coller Capital, one of 40 firms participating in the campaign. "Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low. It simply can't cope with the projected increase in global protein demand." But while the current meat model is unsustainable, prospects are bright in the plant-based protein market, which Coller said is "set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years." In turn, the investors want to know what companies are doing to avoid what Coller dubs the "protein bubble." The FAIRR/ShareAction report points to strategies ranging from the further development of plant-based protein alternatives to more creative marketing around "less-meat" options—for example, "inspiring a modified dietary approach through appealing on-packet recipe suggestions that do not default to meat." As ShareAction campaigns manager Clare Richards declared in a press statement: "Evidence suggests that plant-based protein sources are better for your health, your wallet, and the planet. Consumers increasingly recognize these benefits; and now this coalition of forward-thinking investors are doing the same."

Ginger, a nearly three-year-old German Shepherd mix, was left at the shelter mid-September after her owner became homeless. Story continues below “He was absolutely heartbroken. He just couldn’t keep her and live in a car,” said Apple Valley Animal Shelter’s Gina Whiteside in an interview with the San Bernardino Sun. READ MORE: Dogs crash car into Walmart after owner leaves vehicle running That same day, Ginger managed to jump over her six-foot-tall kennel fence and wandered through the shelter to make her escape. Surveillance footage shows the canine opening three separate doors and even overriding the locked front doors using the emergency exit system. “She was persistent,” said Whiteside. “That door sometimes sticks, but she kept at it until she put her mouth on it and she was out.” Staff found Ginger a few days later, around five kilometres from where she used to live. “When we found her, we think she was on her way to her old home,” said Whiteside. The shelter is hoping the tale of Ginger’s great escape will help attract a caring new owner for her. It appears it has worked. The shelter’s latest Facebook update reads: “Due to a significant influx of inquiries over the weekend we wish to inform the public that response time may be delayed.” “She’s a sweet dog and a great companion,” said Whiteside. “She just needs someone who knows the breed. They are very smart.” Follow @jennynotjen © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Residents of the proposed Windmill Manor project must be 55 years and older, while their rents essentially would be subsidized by the Illinois Housing Development Authority. An Iowa-based firm, doing business as JNB Batavia, wants to build an 80-unit, three-story apartment building on a 4.5-acre site at 2400 Hawks Drive. It sits to the west of the Batavia Wal-Mart store on a curving section of Hawks Drive near the Dreyer Medical Clinic. JNB owner Chris Tritsis said there will be 60 one-bedroom apartments, and 20 two-bedroom apartments, plus a basement apartment for an on-site manager. Of the 80 apartments, eight would be rented out at the market rate. The other 72 would be rent-restricted, with the developer receiving a tax credit from the IHDA. The one-bedroom units would rent for $800 a month, Tritsis said, while the two-bedroom units would be $940 a month. The income limit for residents of the rent-restricted apartments would be $37,000, Tritsis said. The Batavia Plan Commission approved the project at its Sept. 21 meeting, allowing variances on the building height and the parking requirement. The masonry building would stand no more than 47 feet tall, two feet higher than allowed under city code, depending on the final grading of the sloping topography. The parking lot would have 115 vehicle spaces, rather than the 137 specified for a development of that size. Each apartment in the L-shaped building would have an exterior balcony and be cable-ready, Tritsis said, and come with a completely equipped kitchen and wireless internet. The building would include a main lobby, as well as community, exercise, craft, computer and multimedia rooms, along with sitting areas, library and beauty salon, Tritsis said. The apartments would have vinyl or laminate floors in the kitchen and bathroom, Tritsis said, and wall-to-wall carpeting in the living room and bedrooms. The proposal now moves to the Batavia City Council’s Committee of the Whole for review.

Published Sep 26th, 2016 11:38 am tusktotailgate@gmail.com / @tbarkansas story by Jeff Laman Editor’s note: Welcome to the fifth season of Tusk to Tail – the sport of tailgating as organized, performed and perfected by a group of Hog fans who have been tailgating together sober and otherwise for more than a decade. Members of the Tusk to Tail Team are Sean Casey, Jack Clark, Dale Cullins, Greg Houser, Craig May, David Rice and Mark Wagner. Tusk to Tail is managed by Talk Business & Politics against the advice of attorneys and family. The diehards may also be followed on their Facebook page. Or follow the crew on Twitter — @TuskToTail –––––––––––––– The Saturday setup started at 8:30 a.m., which by Dale Cullins’ standards is late. He had already bought supplies from the Walmart across the street before grabbing a space in line for the parking at Jerry World (nee AT&T Stadium). Despite this “late start,” a perfect spot for the Tusk to Tailgate was secured with a beautiful view of the stadium. Craig and Lawson May, Sam Atkinson, Mark Wagner, David and Jackson Rice, among others helped set everything up for the rest of us. My wife, Hope, and I picked up Chris May from the airport around noon and proceeded to join the guys. As Dale mentioned last week, we had primarily snack foods and beverages, though someone picked up a pizza or two for munching. We could see that there had been a bit of rain. A few minutes after our arrival, there was a torrential downpour for nearly half an hour. Pools of water accumulated on the nylon roof of the tents, requiring us to push them off, lest the tents collapse. When the sun came out along with a nice breeze, it was clearly going to be a perfect afternoon. Another thunderstorm passed through before the hot Texas sun created a swampy atmosphere for the thousands of tailgaters around Jerry World. “Somehow I got a sunburn tailgating for an indoor game in the rain,” said David Rice. When you’re the only tailgate on the block with a TV, you end up being very popular. Unexpected visitors happened by to catch a moment or two of Ole Miss’s routing of Georgia or the Gators and Vols tilt. George Knight and Susan Craig Ramey, his girlfriend and a Razorback fan originally from Little Rock, were such a pair. Susan had a Hog hat and face stickers, but she was wearing a Texas A&M t-shirt, which brought about curiosity. “I pull for the Hogs, but I want Trevor to play well,” she said. George is the father of Trevor Knight, the Aggies’ graduate transfer quarterback. Later when they departed, we told them they needed to visit Fayetteville for a game and drop by the tailgate. He said Susan would make sure that happened. Steve Sullivan and Tony Ranchino from KATV in Little Rock stopped by to interview Chris and Craig May. Video of the interview streamed on Facebook live, along with all of us calling the Hogs a couple of times. Tony left to edit while “Sully” stayed around talking to a couple of us about the team and the game. With a couple of hours before kickoff, TTT’s Lone Wolf, Jack Clark, showed up after watching his son play ball in Little Rock that morning.  Kara and Spencer Cullins and Rebecca Rice made a rare appearance at a road tailgate after some shopping in North Dallas. Since the Aggies joined the SEC in 2012, it seems we’re in a Bizarro world every time we play them. For those of us who grew up with the Southwest Conference, we expect to beat the team from College Station every year. And yet, just the opposite has taken place. It is a nightmare I want to end. Unfortunately, the scion of our tailgate guest helped make it even worse. Hog QB Austin Allen had a heck of a game. His passing (28 for 42, 342 yards, 2TDs) and great catches by about everyone except Dominique Reed helped sustain drives or score touchdowns. Unfortunately, #3’s mishandling of the ball resulted in our first turnover. That led to Trevor Knight’s 42 yard unabated run up the middle of the field, tying the game to start the 2nd quarter. Knight is quick, but clearly Noel Mazzone, A&M’s new offensive coordinator, saw something in Robb Smith’s defense to exploit as he zipped for 48 yards and another touchdown to end the quarter (and half) the same way he began. While our offensive line provided some protection to Austin during most passing downs, they did not supply the push we’ve come to expect the last few years on rushing downs, especially on the goal line. Once Rawleigh Williams III gashed A&M’s defense for 55 yards to set up the ball on the Aggie 2-yard line, Arkansas had an astounding series of six or seven unsuccessful goal line runs. The play calling seemed to lack creativity. As it became evident that this part of the gameplan was not working, I heard questioning by the fans for the first time since last season’s Toledo debacle. Fans struggled to understand the selections of plays called by Dan Enos then and at the end of the 3rd quarter. Then, the 4th down run by Keon Hatcher resulted in a 5-yard loss. Why not throw to the corner or back of the end zone a couple of plays earlier? The A&M secondary was getting burned, resorting to pushing or grabbing at the Razorback receivers all night. It did appear Austin made it across the goal line earlier, but the video replay wasn’t conclusive enough to overturn the call on the field. After the turnover on downs, the Aggies wasted little time throwing a 92-yard touchdown to Josh Reynolds. That was the real start of the nightmare, as the Hogs’ solid play for the majority of the 3 quarters all went up in flames. The Hogs managed to score one touchdown in the game with 6:21 left, but A&M responded with another of their own in 1:24. Trevor Knight almost had another TD after a 62 yard run with 1:30 to go. We left to finish tearing down the tailgate and packing away the gear to find it had rained again after we had entered the stadium. As one final parting shot, the automated sprinklers came on promptly at midnight. Sam got soaked folding up tables and chairs, but I didn’t ask if it washed off the feeling that game left in us. As we departed for various hotels around the Metroplex, sports media was beginning to question if A&M could be the team to finally challenge Alabama for SEC supremacy. We shouldn’t have been surprised, as David Rice picked A&M as one of his four playoff teams just days ago. But there are two things we know about Bret Bielema’s Arkansas teams thus far. First, the players don’t quit on him, and more importantly, the team continuously improves as the season progresses. Tusk to Tail is looking forward to next week’s game in Little Rock and the rest of the season.

Uber Now Selling Physical Gift Cards In Stores Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Uber Now Selling Physical Gift Cards In Stores September 26, 2016 2:12 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk car cards gift cards lyft uber transportation Following in the footsteps (or the wheel tracks, as it were) of Lyft, Uber will now also sell physical gift cards in stores. Starting today, Uber customers can buy gift cards at Walmart stores nationwide, the company announced (as well as online at uber.com/gift-cards). The plan is to sell the cards at CVS and Target locations eventually. “Whether it’s exploring a new city, a night out with friends, or simply a safe ride home, Uber is ready to help get the special people in your life where they want to go. And treating them to these experiences has never been easier with the introduction of the Uber gift card,” Uber product manager Drew Quinn wrote in a blog post. The cards can be redeemed directly in the Uber app, and never expire. In August, Lyft announced that it would sell $20 gift cards at Starbucks locations in a partnership with the coffee chain.

Ride-hailing service Uber will begin selling gift cards in stores starting immediately, it announced Monday. The company says it plans to roll out the gift cards to 35,000 retail locations over the coming weeks. They’ll be available at chains like Walmart, Target, and CVS. The gift cards will also soon be available for purchase through Uber’s website, too. To redeem a gift card, recipients will need to enter the code shown on the card into the Uber app before requesting a ride. They will be valid in any U.S. city where Uber is available. The company says they never expire. It’s worth noting, though, that these cards are only valid for Uber rides. They will not work with the company’s other services, like Uber Eats and Uber Rush. While the option to purchase physical gift cards is new, Uber already allows users to request rides for other friends or family members by entering their pickup location and destination. Uber has also offers the option for event hosts to purchase rides for guests in advance. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Brian Hill | Staff Photographer   Amy E. Williams     Just in time to wash all of the impending salt and slush off your vehicle, a new car wash is set to open along the Randall Road corridor this fall. Fuller's Car Wash should be open just south of the intersection of Randall Road and Bowes Road by mid- to late-November, owner Colin Fuller said. Construction on the new business is underway at the Randall Road location, which is in front of the Elgin Wal-Mart Supercenter and Sam's Club, and just to the south of the Elgin Portillo's Hot Dogs. Fuller said he found the location through the folks at Portillo's and thought it was a great place to open another one of his family's carwashes. There are many Fuller's carwashes throughout the Chicago area, including one in Geneva on State Street. There are different kinds of Fuller's carwashes -- some are self-service and some are full service with complete detail services. This new Elgin Fuller's Car Wash location will be a $3 car wash center, Fuller said. There will be free vacuum usage with a car wash purchase, he added. Fuller said the equipment at the center will be state-of-the-art to ensure vehicles get the best and most efficient car wash for the money. Missing the fries: The popular Chicago Grill along Randall Road in Lake in the Hills is now closed. The business at 335 N. Randall Road, which drew in customers for its hand-cut fries and other Chicago favorites such as hot dogs, brats, burgers and beef, closed late last month. Originally the plan was to have a new owner buy and reopen the Chicago Grill, which is on the east side of Randall near Starbucks. However, that deal is on hold, leaving many craving those fries and other goods, which are hard to find elsewhere in the area. Owner Dominick Pulli has said he was selling the business to focus on his other eatery, Bubs Subs, which is located just to the south on Randall Road in Algonquin. Running the two businesses and putting all of the time into both to ensure they were successful and offered the highest of quality of foods was difficult. The spot for now remains vacant, though many customers have been emailing saying they are hoping a new business serving hand-cut fries will open in the location. Save the date: The Algonquin Commons mall has set the date for its annual Halloween event for families. This year, the Boo Party will take place from noon to 3 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 30. At the event, there will be trick-or-treating at businesses throughout the mall. There also will be more fun for kids on the 30th, including magicians, jugglers, pumpkin decorating, balloon shapes and more. Stay tuned for more information on the Boo Party, which draws in children from up and down the Randall Road corridor each October at the mall. • Amy Williams' column covers all the news of business along the Randall Road corridor from Batavia to Crystal Lake.

Well, one of the city’s largest producers of gyros has new owners and is looking to expand. Downtown Lawrence’s Pita Pit restaurant has been bought by longtime commercial real estate executive Pat Peery and his son Sam. The duo has begun a small scale remodeling of the location at 1011 Massachusetts St., including a new rear entry, new signs, a new large screen television and the installation of free Wi-Fi for guests. Plans also call for a new sidewalk dining area to be built along Massachusetts Street. The menu also has expanded some. The restaurant has begun serving fruit smoothies, with a variety of mango, berry and banana flavors. But the bigger changes to the restaurant may be yet to come. Pat Peery used to direct the real estate activities of Wal-Mart Stores and Kohl’s Department Stores before coming back to Lawrence in 2012. Peery said he and Sam bought the Lawrence Pita Pit with the idea of expanding the chain’s presence in the region. 1011 Massachusetts St, Lawrence, KS 66044 “We intend to grow the business,” Pat said. “We aren’t doing this to just own one Pita Pit. A west Lawrence location at some point would make a lot of sense for us.” The Lawrence store also has launched a catering division and has bought a delivery van. Sam Peery, who runs the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, said the Lawrence store had seen a bit of a downturn under previous ownership, but he thinks the idea of pita can still be a hit with Lawrence diners. I guess I shouldn’t assume you are all familiar with a pita. It is a type of unleavened bread with a pocket that can hold a variety of meats, cheeses and veggies. “I was a customer of a Pita Pit back when I was in college,” Sam said. “I like that it is a healthier alternative. It is less bread than a sub sandwich.” In other news and notes from around town: • I’ve learned the hard way, don’t get your gyro and your Yugos confused, although a used Yugo will cost you less than most gyros. Either way, skip the Yugo, one of the worst cars of all-time, and get a good bike. All this is to say that Lawrence has one of the top-rated bike shops in the country, according to a new ranking. Downtown Lawrence’s Sunflower Outdoor & Bike has been named to the America’s Best Bike Shops list by the National Bicycle Dealer’s Association. The association looks at about 4,000 bike shops across the country, and fewer than 300 bike shops were included on the list. The program involves an application process and mystery shoppers visiting the store to evaluate a host of product and customer service issues. This is the fourth straight year Sunflower has been named to the list. • Here’s the name of a restaurant chain to keep an eye on: Buffalo Wings & Rings. The restaurant recently announced that it has signed a deal to build three restaurants in Wichita, with construction set to begin this year. But the chain also took the unusual step of announcing that Lawrence is the next city in the state where it plans to locate, although the timeline might still be another three years. The chain is a sports bar concept that serves chicken wings and onion rings but also has a large menu of hamburgers, quesadillas, tacos and other items.

Musicians view the years they spend in the honky-tonks as paying their dues for the music business. As it turns out, all that very specific training sets them up to succeed in other industries, too. Toby Keith owns dozens of racehorses, developed his own brand of wild mezcal and licensed his name for a restaurant chain, Toby Keith’s I Love This Bar & Grill. Kix Brooks established Arrington Vineyards in Middle Tennessee and launched a film production company that led to a TV series on the Cooking Channel and a new cookbook. Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan are investors in their own TV series, Buck Commander. And on Sept. 16, Trisha Yearwood — who has already developed her own home furnishings brand — announced the launch of a fragrance line at Walmart. It’s natural for an artist to extend their vocational knowledge by investing inside the music business — Brad Paisley and Tim McGraw own publishing companies, for example; Keith Urban created a line of guitars; and the late Buck Owens established a radio chain. But music is hardly the only line of interest for many artists. Carrie Underwood (sports clothing), Dolly Parton (the Dollywood theme park), Willie Nelson (biodiesel fuel and marijuana), Eric Church (furniture), Zac Brown (leather goods, food enterprises), Kenny Chesney (rum), John Rich (a fashion line) and Miranda Lambert (retail store) are just some of the acts who have put their name and/or their money to work outside of music. Keith “has got the guts to take the risk, and he’s got the money to do it, too,” says his manager, TKO Artist Management president TK Kimbrell. Billboard's 2016 Nashville Power Players List Revealed: Who Rules Music City? Keith, along with Brown, is likely country’s most avid investor beyond the music business. He was the lone writer on many of his hits — including “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” “Who’s That Man” and “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)” — and as the mailbox money rolled in, he surpassed what he felt he needed to guarantee his family’s future. That made it possible for Keith to invest in a wide range of companies: Starbucks, a golf course and some strip malls are probably safer bets than some of his other activities. Among the higher risks are the thoroughbreds (Kimbrell estimates that he owns around 200 through Dream Walkin’ Farms) and the I Love This Bar chain, which licenses the rights to his name but is operated by a separate company. “Restaurants and bars are really hit-or-miss,” says Kimbrell. “When you put it on the line and you attach yourself to something, it can always come back on you in some way.” For an investment to work for an artist, it typically requires a connection to his or her lifestyle and interests. Which Artists Were 2015's Biggest Earners on the Road? “I would never go out and do a hairspray product,” says Aldean. “I don’t feel like that’s my brand, and it’s not really believable.” An avid hunter, Aldean has found the Buck Commander TV show and associated products a better fit. It works with his image, fits his schedule and has some built-in promotional value. “The fact that you’ve got [Duck Dynasty’s] Willie Robertson and me and Luke, and especially with all of our social media following, we can post about things and get it out there probably a lot quicker than most could with a startup company,” says Aldean. That ability to run a startup is key. To navigate their way in the music business, successful artists are required to identify and cultivate an audience, build a solid team and continue to believe in their product and tell their story, even when marketplace statistics suggest that failure is the most likely outcome. Berklee Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship’s managing director Panos Panay and CD Baby founder Derek Sivers both see those factors as significant advantages for musicians who choose to pursue other businesses. Thanks to their public position, successful artists are approached with more opportunities than lower-profile business people to get in on the ground floor of other enterprises. But that doesn’t mean that every product or investment is a good idea. Even if it is, it still may not be an ideal fit for the act. Brooks recalls learning that lesson right out of college. A successful Louisiana bar was up for sale, and he tried to persuade his father to loan him the money to buy it. His sales pitch was unsuccessful. “First of all, he told me I needed to go to Nashville or New York or Los Angeles if I was going to play music, to see if I was worth a damn,” recalls Brooks. “Second, [he said] I didn’t know a thing about the bar business.” Familiarity with an industry — or, at the very least, the product — is a major consideration for artists, since their primary business is already one that requires a huge amount of time. The product needs to fit instinctively into their life so that it doesn’t really feel like work. Such was the case for Florida Georgia Line when it developed Old Camp Peach Pecan Whiskey, which went on sale in August. “Whiskey, for us, it just comes natural,” says FGL’s Brian Kelley. “That’s our drink of choice. We say that we took all last year to sample it, but that’s really a lie because we’ve been sampling probably the past 10 years or so. Trying to get the mix right, having a little whiskey drink here and there and enjoying friends and family, that’s something that’s organic to us.” Even Brooks’ new role in food has been a natural evolution. An acting major in college, he put together a film production company after Brooks & Dunn split in 2010. Building on his affinity for exploring steakhouses on tour, the company landed a series, Steak Out With Kix Brooks, on the Cooking Channel in 2015. That led to his new cookbook, Cookin’ It With Kix, published by Thomas Nelson. After several decades of physically exhausting tours, finding the time for his new ventures — in addition to his continuing his role as the host of American Country Countdown — has been as easy as finding time to check out a movie on vacation. “That is not lip service,” he says. “The stuff I’m doing now, it’s just fun.” One significant key to keeping it fun — and profitable — is a basic rule of thumb that most executives follow: hire the right people. Keith has a hands-off attitude about his ventures, says Kimbrell. Whether it’s turning over the keys to his BelMar Country Club in Norman, Okla., or assigning oversight of his label Show Dog Nashville, Keith’s philosophy is to hire an expert and stay out of the way. “Toby has been great at constantly refocusing on what he does best, and that’s writing songs and singing,” says Kimbrell. “If it’s going to take away from his songwriting and singing, he ropes it back in.” That’s yet another lesson artists learn while paying their dues on the way up. The business part is easiest when they follow their passion. No matter how big the other ventures may become, it still starts with the music.

For just this week, if you buy any existing Xbox One S bundle, you’ll score yourself an Xbox One game of your choice for free. Participating retailers include Amazon, Target, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart and Microsoft’s own store. It’s not completely clear if there’s any restrictions on which title you choose as your free one, but the post over on Xbox Wire explicitly mentions the likes of NBA 2K17, Destiny’s Rise of Iron add-on, Forza Horizon 3 and FIFA 17 as popular contenders. Unsurprisingly, the fine print confirms that the offer can’t be applied to pre-orders, so you’ll have to limit your choice to titles that have already been released. Likewise, the maximum value can’t exceed $59.99. If you ask us, this sounds like a bargain, but it’s all moot if you’ve no interest in upgrading or entering the Xbox family for the first time. The real question is if the Xbox One S does enough to warrant the price. Boasting 4K Blu-ray, video and Ultra HD support, Microsoft’s pushing the console as the quintessential media device for gamers, noting the presence of High Dynamic Range (HDR) as the icing on the cake. Until Microsoft comes out with more details for Project Scorpio, the Xbox One S is, for all intents and purposes, your best bet in regards to enjoying first-party software at its best. For our own review of the slimmed-down box, see here.

The coalition is urging companies to identify their plans to respond to this risk, in particular by encouraging them to set strategies to diversify into plant-based sources of protein. Backed by a new briefing entitled ‘The future of food - the investment case for a protein shake up’, the investors warn of the risks associated with the growing global demand for protein and an overreliance on the unsustainable factory farming of livestock for its supply. The briefing highlights the environmental, social and public health risks inherent in this model, which financial markets are not currently valuing appropriately. The companies being engaged include Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, Walmart and General Mills, which holds its AGM in Minneapolis tomorrow. The coalition has been brought together by the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return) Initiative, in partnership with responsible investment organisation ShareAction. US food giant General Mills - makers of Häagen Dazs and Yoplait - is highlighted as an example of good practice f`or supporting start-up companies such as Beyond Meat, which is developing foods to substitute meat products with more sustainable plant-based alternatives. Jeremy Coller, Founder of the FAIRR Initiative and CIO of Coller Capital, said: “The world’s overreliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis. Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low. It simply can’t cope with the projected increase in global protein demand. Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4% annually over the next five years.” `The analysis report also points to regulatory trends as a driver for corporate action – such as Denmark’s consultation on the introduction of red meat tax and the Chinese government’s plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50%. Clare Richards, Campaigns Manager at ShareAction said: “The trend for ‘less but better meat’ is creating new opportunities on plates and in portfolios. Evidence suggests that plant-based protein sources are better for your health, your wallet, and the planet. Consumers increasingly recognise these benefits; and now this coalition of forward-thinking investors are doing the same. As a result of this engagement we hope more companies will embrace the opportunities presented by this growing consumer trend.” Peter van der Werf, Engagement Specialist at Robeco said: "The growing demand for meat will put large pressure on natural resources in the coming decades. Robeco identified this as a financial material topic and engages to improve sustainability in the meat supply chain. Protein diversification is an important instrument to that end. Companies at the end of the meat supply chain have an important role to play towards customers and we will encourage them to make protein diversification an integral part of their strategy."

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Beth Braverman Sep 26th 2016 10:23AM The first debate between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump is Monday, Sept. 26. Since she began her run for presidency, Clinton has spoken on the shrinking middle class and the financial difficulties low-income earners face. As she prepares for her face-off against Trump, learn about how her policies will affect you, your wallet and the U.S. economy. Cut Taxes for the Middle Class Clinton promises to cut taxes for middle-class families, according to her website, and she'll pay for new tax breaks by increasing taxes on high-earners. A March 2016 analysis of her tax proposals by Tax Policy Center found all tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent. Clinton also advocates closing tax loopholes and enacting the Buffett Rule, which would require millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes. The New York Times reported her tax proposals would place a 4 percent tax surcharge for high-earners making over $5 million, while a new rule would ensure individuals making over $1 million pay a minimum of 30 percent. See: 15 Things You Should Know About Donald Trump's Tax Plan Clinton also wants to reform the capital gains tax system. She wants to discourage short-term trading and reward longer-term investments that help create jobs. Under her plan, investors would be taxed a 39.6 percent statutory rate on gains from holdings held for one to two years, with that rate dropping to 20 percent after the six-year mark, reported Tax Foundation. "For most Americans, an increase in the capital gains tax won't affect them at all," said Tom Wheelwright, certified public accountant and author of "Tax-Free Wealth." "For the average investor who has their money in an IRA or a 401k, there is no impact by all of this."

The middle class is shrinking and the lower class is growing, according to data from Pew Research Center. "Corporate profits are at near record highs, and Americans are working as hard as ever, but paychecks have barely budged in real terms," Clinton said in a July 2015 speech. "Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets." Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour, and she supports cities and states aiming even higher. Despite minimum wage hikes by many state and local governments, and by high-profile employers like Walmart and Target, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 per hour, the same rate it has been since 2009. Even moving the minimum wage to $12 would raise wages for one in four U.S. workers, according to Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst with public policy organization Demos. "That's a big segment of the workforce, and it would make a big difference for a lot of people," she said. "It would be really good for consumers' wallets." Clinton also backed President Obama when he expanded overtime rules. Starting in 2016, that plan extended overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers, covering salaried workers who make up to $50,400. Provide Options to Avoid and Refinance Student Debt Student loan borrowers carry a mean balance of $26,700, and nearly 17 percent of all borrowers are late or in default on their loans, according to a 2015 report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Furthermore, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston shows that student loan borrowers appear to be less likely to own a home and have more difficulty accumulating wealth. Clinton addresses student debt in her New College Compact. Advocating for debt-free college, her proposal would allow students to go to in-state colleges and universities without borrowing money for education. She also supports efforts to assist middle- and lower-income students with non-tuition expenses, such as the cost of books and even child care. For graduates straddled with debt, Clinton wants to help Americans with existing student loans refinance at more favorable rates. Expand Paid Family Leave and Affordable Child Care Policies It's been more than 20 years since Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows families to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child and deal with their own or a family member's health needs. That provision puts America behind most other developed countries that offer paid leave for women — and often men. As part of her goal of getting more women in the workforce at higher wages, Clinton supports family-friendly policies such as paid family leave and affordable childcare policies. See: 8 Ways Your Money Habits Are Ruining Your Relationship "I believe that what's good for women is good for America," she wrote in a 2015 op-ed for women's lifestyle media platform SheKnows. "Take child care. It's a women's issue. It's also an economic issue. You can't go to work every day if you can't afford a safe place to leave your kids." This issue gained more visibility in 2015 when several Silicon Valley companies announced changes to parental leave policies that extend more generous benefits to both men and women. Currently, only California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family and medical leave, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Protect and Expand Social Security The 2016 Trustees Report from the Social Security Administration projected that retirement and disability trust funds would be depleted by 2034 and would "pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through the end of the projection period in 2090." The future of Social Security, however, has long been a big point of contention between the two majority parties. Clinton wants to expand and preserve Social Security, saying at a New Hampshire campaign event, "We do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury — because it is not a luxury. It is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security." Clinton's website outlines her plan for Social Security. Notably, she would oppose efforts to raise the retirement age or reduce cost-of-living adjustments.

Tax Cuts for the Middle Class Hillary Clinton has promised to cut taxes for the middle class so people can increase their take-home pay. She also advocates closing tax loopholes and enacting the “Buffett Rule,” which would require millionaires and billionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Additionally, she wants to incentivize businesses to share their profits with workers by providing a 15 percent tax credit to companies that do so. See: Are Millennials Better With Their Money Than You? Where she has gotten specific is her plan to raise the capital gains tax, which is paid on the profits made by individuals when they sell property, stocks, businesses or other assets after holding them for a short period of time. Under Clinton’s plan, investors would be taxed 39.6 percent on their gain on assets held for less than two years, with that rate phasing out to the current 20 percent after the six-year mark, according to CNBC. This change, which is meant to encourage longer-term investing and economic growth, would apply to those in the highest tax bracket, which is nearly $465,000 for married joint filers and $411,500 for single filers. “For most Americans, an increase in the capital gains tax won’t affect them at all,” said Tom Wheelwright, certified public accountant and author of “Tax-Free Wealth.” “For the average investor who has their money in an IRA or a 401k, there is no impact by all of this.” Photo credit: Getty 2. Protection for the CFPB Hillary Clinton publicly urged Democrats in Congress to fight a Republican proposal that sought to limit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis to supervise financial institutions’ dealings with the public. The agency is responsible for supervising and enforcing the laws that cover consumer financial products and services, and it aims to provide better transparency for the consumers who use them. “The [CFPB] has only one mission: protecting Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices — and it’s succeeding,” she wrote in an open letter to Congress. Photo credit: Getty 3. Increased Wages for the 99 Percent Reducing income inequality is one of the central tenets of the Clinton campaign. The gap between the richest and poorest Americans is wider than the gap in any other democracy in the developed world, according to U.S. News & World Report. “Corporate profits are at near record highs, and Americans are working as hard as ever, but paychecks have barely budged in real terms,” Clinton said in a July 2015 speech. “Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets.” Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour. Despite minimum wage hikes by many state and local governments, and by high-profile employers like Walmart and Target, the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 per hour, the same rate it has been at since 2009. Many advocates of a higher minimum wage, including Clinton competitor Bernie Sanders, want a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour nationwide. See: How Hillary Clinton Will Close the Gender Wage Gap Even moving the minimum wage to $12 would raise wages for one in four U.S. workers, according to Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst with public policy organization Demos. “That’s a big segment of the workforce, and it would make a big difference for a lot of people,” she said. “It would be really good for consumers’ wallets.” Clinton also backed President Obama’s expansion of overtime rules to more workers. Starting in 2016, that plan extended overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers, covering salaried workers who make up to $50,400.

No Cuts to Social Security The 2015 annual report on Social Security projected that retirement and disability trust funds would be depleted in 2034 and then would “pay about three-fourths of scheduled benefits for 50 years,” according to The New York Times. The future of Social Security, however, has long been a big point of contention between the parties. Republicans, in particular, have been calling for cuts and privatization to address the situation. In April 2015, Clinton called Republicans who want to cut back Social Security “just wrong” and said she’d preserve the retirement benefit. “We do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury — because it is not a luxury,” she said at a New Hampshire campaign event. “It is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.” Clinton also has stated that she believes women especially need better access to Social Security and has promised to work to “enhance” the program.

Currently, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and the District of Columbia offer paid family leave. Photo credit: Getty 7. Pursuit of a New Foreign Trade Agreement Clinton broke with President Obama and with previous statements recently in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which would put in place one of the largest free trade areas in the world. “I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state,” Clinton said in a statement in October. “I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they have made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don’t believe this agreement has met it.” Photo credit: Getty 8. Help for Small Businesses Clinton wants to “jump-start small businesses” by reducing the time it takes to start a business, expanding access to capital, simplifying and cutting the taxes paid by small businesses, and using technology to allow small businesses to access new markets both domestically and globally. “Despite generations of progress on so many other fronts, it’s still too hard to get a business started today,” Clinton wrote on LinkedIn in May. “Credit is too tough to come by. Too many regulatory and licensing requirements are uneven and uncertain.” Photo credit: Getty 9. Repeal of the Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax' While she has supported the Affordable Care Act and its goal of reducing the number of uninsured Americans, Clinton announced in September that she is opposed to the so-called “Cadillac tax,” which imposes a tax on employers with the most expensive health plans. The goal of the tax is to reduce overall health care costs, but critics say it’s encouraging employers to simply reduce the quality of their insurance and push costs onto consumers. If she were to succeed in repealing the tax, the Congressional Budget Office has said that, without such a tax, the Affordable Care Act might not actually reduce health care costs.

Clinton also wants to increase manufacturing jobs, notably by supporting small manufacturers and start-ups, while making it easier for small businesses to get the answers they need about federal regulations and access to capital programs. Expand the Affordable Care Act Clinton aims to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act. According to her website, Clinton aims to lower the cost of prescription medicines and lower out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles. Her campaign also looks to protect consumers from drug price increases, an issue that came to the limelight when Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of the drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015. The topic arose once more in the summer of 2016 after it was shown EpiPen, used for severe allergic reactions, had seen a 600 percent price increase since 2009. Clinton also opposes the Cadillac Tax, which imposes a tax on employers with the most expensive health plans.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 26, 2016 at 10:11AM Image source: Costco. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) will post earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, Sept. 29. Investors aren't expecting great things out of the world's second-largest retailer. It has missed earnings estimates lately while reporting slowing sales growth in each of the last three quarters. On the other hand, the warehouse giant enjoys some of the strongest customer traffic trends in the industry, and its subscription model produces higher profits even during soft selling environments. This week's quarterly report should show evidence of the strength of that selling approach, despite the fact that consensus estimates are targeting just 3% higher sales and flat earnings for Costco. Here are a few key points for investors to watch in addition to those big-picture figures. How big of a problem is deflation? Deflation has been a huge drag for grocery retailers over the last few months. Kroger in early September saw its comparable-store sales growth nearly cut in half as it lowered its comps outlook for the first time in years. Falling prices for products like meats, dairy products, and eggs combined to push overall food prices down by about 1.5% as the industry suffers through its first bout of deflation since 2009. Grocery price change against the year-ago period. Image source: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Costco gets about half of its revenue from food sales and in that way is more comparable to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT). The retailing titan in August said that deflation cleaved a full percentage point from its grocery business in the second quarter, but that didn't get in the way of posting solid overall growth. It will be interesting to hear where Costco falls relative to these two retailers on the subject, given that sales growth at its U.S. warehouses has ticked lower in each of the past three quarters. Was the credit card switch worth it? Management will likely spend some time talking about Costco's loyalty card switchover in this week's conference call. After all, moving from an American Express-branded card to a Visa one was a major operating shift that affected over 10 million existing members. Investors have so far only seen the negatives from this move. It has cost the retailer over $40 million in lost signup revenue and confusion over the switch might have caused the slight decline in renewal rates last quarter (to 94.4% from 94.5%). It's also possible that the change has gone over smoothly with Costco's members. If that's true, then the upgraded rewards bonuses should contribute to a more engaged subscriber base -- and might even help the retailer improve on its already stellar renewal rate that for the past two fiscal years has been 91%. Annual renewal rates by fiscal year. Data source: Costco financial filings. Is a membership fee hike on the way? Given that the majority of Costco's profits comes from membership fees rather than product sales, investors are keenly interested in the company's plans for boosting that annual charge. They haven't had much to celebrate on that front since the last increase came in early 2012, or nearly five years ago. Still, a steadily rising membership base has helped push net income higher over that time, even though the subscription price hasn't budged. Costco hasn't said when it plans to implement its next boost, but Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti pointed out to investors in its last conference call that the company has increased prices at an average of once every 5.5 years. If it sticks to that pace, then a hike should be coming at some point during its 2017 fiscal year. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale.

William L. Hundley, a Northampton Community College student from Sharon, Pennsylvania, is charged in a robbery Sept. 25, 2016, in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart in Bethlehem Township. (Courtesy photo | For lehighvalleylive.com)  William L. Hundley, a Northampton Community College student from Sharon, Pennsylvania, met Stephen Harrington about 8:30 p.m. at 3926 Nazareth Pike to buy a white iPhone 6 for $240, police said. Harrington gave Hundley the phone to look at and Hundley asked to take the sim card out, police said. Hundley then spun the tires and began to drive off, according to police. Harrington grabbed the car door, tried to retrieve his phone and hung on for 20 to 30 feet before falling to the ground, police said. The 1999 Acura TL struck a concrete column. Hundley got out, chased down Harrington and punched him in the face, police said. Harrington ran to his vehicle and drove off. Police, arriving for a report of the crash, arrested Hundley. He was charged with robbery, simple assault and disorderly conduct. He was arraigned Monday morning before District Judge John Capobianco and sent to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $10,000 bail, according to court records.

The investors, which include the fund arm of insurer Aviva and several Swedish state pension funds, wrote to the food companies on Sept. 23 urging them to respond to the 'material' risks of industrial farming and to diversify into plant-based sources of protein, reported Reuters. Among the companies targeted were Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart, a statement by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return Initiative (FAIRR), which organized the investor group, said. "The world's over reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis," said Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR initiative and chief investment officer at private equity company Coller Capital. Pollution from intensive livestock production is already at too high a level, while safety and welfare standards are too low and the industry cannot cope with the projected increase in global protein demand, Coller said. "Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years," Coller said. The campaign follows an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat in their diet. The study also pointed to growing political pressure on companies to change, citing a consultation in Denmark on the introduction of a red meat tax and a Chinese government plan to reduce its citizens' meat consumption by 50 percent, FAIRR said. Ella McKinley, ethics analyst at Australian Ethical Investment, which is taking part in the campaign, said the need to change food production models was essential to help to limit climate change. "Forward-looking companies can move now to encourage more sustainable diets by reducing reliance on meat and growing the market for plant-based protein alternatives. In the process, companies make their own protein supply chains more resilient to future shocks," she said. The other companies written to by FAIRR were General Mills, Mondelez International, Ahold-Delhaize, The Cooperative Group, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Kroger Company, Marks and Spencer, Wm Morrison Supermarkets, Ocado, Sainsbury's and Whole Foods Market. A Nestle spokeswoman said the company did not use much meat, "so our main strategy is not to focus on replacing the meat that we do use as its impact would be minimal. Our main opportunities lie in innovating new products using alternate proteins". "In terms of timetables and targets, this is still a relatively new area, where in many countries the consumers are not fully prepared to replace or reduce meat in their diets. Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet." Kraft Heinz declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Co-Op said it had yet to receive the letter. Mondelez also declined to comment because it had not yet seen the letter, while a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: "We're aware of the issue and are looking forward to receiving a copy of the letter." A Walmart spokesman said the company was not familiar with the campaign and so could not provide comment, while a Kroger spokesman said the firm had not received the letter but was happy to talk with the investor group. The remaining companies were not immediately available to comment. Among the other investors to join the campaign were Nordea Asset Management, the fund arm of Norwegian lender Nordea, Boston Common Asset Management, and Impax Asset Management, as well as a number of charities and other ethical investors.     KeyWords Food companies shift plants   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Tremor shakes western Iran Norway’s DNO to study key Iranian oil field Saudi-proposed anti-Syria resolution rewarding terror sponsors: Iran Iran rejects 'baseless' claims by Arab states Iran warns against Israel’s bid to erase al-Quds Islamic identity Senior Iranian official warns US against failing to comply with nuclear deal Germany will try to ensure Iran nuclear deal survives with Trump Iran pours cold water on Hong Kong Rouhani: Government, system seeking constructive interaction with world Leader: Iran unimpressed by US election results Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1223 sec

W said Store Wars, not Star Wars. But there is a pitched battle for market share in the food retail sector. J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) shares have the capacity to rise by over a quarter, according to the number crunchers at Credit Suisse this morning, which looked at the wider sector as part of its research. The market itself is still in structural decline, CS analyst Stewart McGuire and his team reckon, with the discounters continuing to nab market share from the big domestic operators. However, much of the pain is being borne by Wal-Mart Stores-owned (NYSE:WMT) ASDA, rather than the three quoted grocers – Sainsbury, Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) and Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO). Sainsbury, CS reckons, is worth 315p a share (up from 290p) with the current 250p share price valuing the business at just 12 times 2017 earnings. It reckons the takeover of Argos could add 20% to earnings three years down the road. Credit Suisse has also taken a more benign view of Tesco (the price target is notched up 15p to 130p) and Morrisons, where the valuation goes up 20p to 200p. The Swiss bank keeps its ‘underperform’ rating on the former and its ‘neutral’ on the latter. “Our premise remains that there is a structural decline happening in the traditional supermarket sector, largely driven by oversized stores, a move towards discounters, a shift to online and growth in ‘mass-market specialty’ grocers such as Waitrose and M&S,” said McGuire and his team in a note. “However, as in virtually all shifts, the trend is never in a straight line. The incumbents have fought back, and with some success – Morrisons recently posted a quarterly its best result in years. “The market has taken their results as a sign that a turnaround is underway – both at Morrisons and elsewhere in the sector.” Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Ian Lyall Register here to be notified of future SBRY Company articles View full SBRY profile J Sainsbury plc Timeline Video November 10 2016 Sainsbury’s share price fall may not be finished just yet Article November 09 2016 Sainsbury shares off 5% as Tesco bites back Article November 09 2016 Sainsbury warns on inflation and price competition threat; hikes Argos cost-savings Article October 02 2016 Is it time to sell Sainsbury shares?

That's more than the combined online sales of Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Gap, and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.© Provided by Business Insider Apparel market in the US The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million.

Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival.

The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Barneys New York fashion director Julie Gilhartogue — whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant — and vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Also in the last few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things that Amazon is necessarily known for.  < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE > Amazon Fashion © Provided by Business Insider But Amazon's strategy appears to be working. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. Department store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the last 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley.© Provided by Business Insider Apparel Market in the US But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. "We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion," the analysts wrote in a recent note In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason for why Amazon was investing in fashion: "Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item," than with cheaper products, he said.

The coalition is urging companies to identify their plans to respond to this risk, in particular by encouraging them to set strategies to diversify into plant-based sources of protein. Backed by a new briefing entitled 'The future of food the investment case for a protein shake up, the investors warn of the risks associated with the growing global demand for protein and an overreliance on the unsustainable factory farming of livestock for its supply. The briefing highlights the environmental, social and public health risks inherent in this model, which financial markets are not currently valuing appropriately. The companies being engaged include Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever,Tesco, Walmart and General Mills, which holds its AGM in Minneapolis tomorrow. The coalition has been brought together by the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk Return Initiative, in partnership with responsible investment organisation ShareAction. US food giant General Mills makers of Häagen Dazs and Yoplait is highlighted as an example of good practice f'or supporting start-up companies such as Beyond Meat, which is developing foods to substitute meat products with more sustainable plant-based alternatives. Jeremy Coller, Founder of the FAIRR Initiative and CIO of Coller Capital, said: "The world's overreliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis. Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low. It simply can't cope with the projected increase in global protein demand. Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4% annually over the next five years 'The analysis report also points to regulatory trends as a driver for corporate action such as Denmark's consultation on the introduction of red meat tax and the Chinese government's plan to reduce its citizens' meat consumption by 50%. Clare Richards, Campaigns Manager at ShareAction said: "The trend for 'less but better meat' is creating new opportunities on plates and in portfolios. Evidence suggests that plant-based protein sources are better for your health, your wallet, and the planet. Consumers increasingly recognise these benefits; and now this coalition of forward-thinking investors are doing the same. As a result of this engagement we hope more companies will embrace the opportunities presented by this growing consumer trend." Peter van der Werf, Engagement Specialist at Robeco said: "The growing demand for meat will put large pressure on natural resources in the coming decades.

Police say the back-up caused as many as six accidents. One of the accidents involved a Mega Bus that ran into the back of a Walmart semi-trailer near the 161 mile marker, which is just inside the Tippecanoe County line. Several ambulances were sent to the scene. Authorities say there was only one injury, which is not believed to be serious. Other passengers were evaluated by medical personnel on-scene. The bus was later off-loaded and at last word passengers were waiting on another bus to get them back on the road.

 An unlikely company is crushing America's biggest clothing stores Hayley Peterson Sep. 25, 2016, 7:44 PM 73,578 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Amazon Fashion ad. Facebook/Amazon Fashion An unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: Amazon. Amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the US, with its apparel sales totaling $16.3 billion last year, Bloomberg reports. That's more than the combined online sales of Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Gap, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Morgan Stanley The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of the clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought the online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million. An Amazon Fashion ad. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York Men's Fashion Week. The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor Caroline Palmer. An Amazon Fashion ad. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. An Amazon Fashion ad. Facebook/Amazon Fashion But Amazon's strategy appears to be working. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. An Amazon Fashion ad. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. "We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion," the analysts wrote in a recent note. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason that Amazon was investing in fashion: "Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item," than with cheaper products, he said. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

The school is resolute that my remarks focus not just on the history of those days, but rather speak to ways young people today can actively honor the legacy of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. It’s one thing to merely remember the courageous sacrifices made by those charging the cockpit with a drink cart on United Flight 93, or by those Marines pushing the flag into place atop Mount Suribachi in the South Pacific. But it’s another to actively honor those heroes. I recently challenged students at my school: “Stop the veteran walking through Walmart and say thank you. At church, greet those who serve and tell them you are praying for them. Remember they are all around you at ball games, so shut your mouths, take off your hats and stand respectfully during the national anthem. Follow their example and choose humility, putting the needs of others ahead of your own selfish desires and comforts. When we say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, remember that flag on the wall is more than a piece of cloth. Remember it is a visual representation of that soldier and their sacrifice. You may not be able to go back in time and say a verbal thank you to those who died storming the beaches of Normandy or storming up stairwells of the World Trade Center. But by the respect you give to the flag they served under, the flag that draped their caskets, the flag that was folded and presented to their hurting families, it’s your way of giving them the gratitude they earned and the dignity they deserve.” So let me take this time to offer a hearty thank you to the Indiana Fever players and organization for undermining everything I try to do in the classroom. Spare me the mindless drivel about how the Fever were “embodying the spirit of that flag” in their protest. Don’t lecture about how the First Amendment protects their right to be disrespectful. No one is arguing that point. We are arguing that by choosing this particular form of protest it is solving no problem, but adding to one; it is resolving no conflict, but fueling one; it is relieving no divide, but deepening one. Leftist sports writers will puff up to defend them by saying silly things like how courageous these players are for using their platform to “create conversation.” Indianapolis sportswriter Bob Kravitz dramatically gushed, “United they stand. Or sit. Or kneel. You don’t have to like it. But you have to talk about it. Which is, in the end, the entire point.” Wait, what? The entire point of them kneeling during the anthem is to get us all talking about them kneeling during the anthem? What good is that? What does it accomplish? Nothing, of course, other than creating or furthering a racial divide, and sadly lending undeserved legitimacy to the lawlessness and social anarchy so closely tied to the Black Lives Matter movement. To the degree Kravitz is right, he accidentally exposes the annoying truth about these spectacles. Ultimately they are self-serving attempts by people desperate to be known for something more meaningful than putting balls into baskets or end zones. I can’t and won’t bemoan any athlete’s desire to use their platform to do good. But I can and will criticize their efforts when it does the exact opposite. If the Indiana Fever players are truly interested in racial reconciliation then they should understand their conduct is as unproductive as those on the opposite side of the divide shouting “All Lives Matter.” Offending people is not typically an effective strategy for engaging a problem, whether it is your right to do so or not. Instead of taking a knee, how about taking the time to thoughtfully lay out your solutions? I may not agree with your call for reparations, racial quotas for police forces, more gun control, or the expansion of hate crimes laws. And you may not agree with my call for school choice scholarships in the inner cities, censure for grievance mongering, the end of no fault divorce, or teaching the Biblical view of race in schools. But at least we’ll be talking about something meaningful. Kneeling for the anthem promotes rebellion, disrespect, resentment and division. If you’re doing it or applauding it, you’re part of the problem you pretend to protest. Peter Heck is a speaker, author and teacher.

Jonesboro police were called to Walmart, 1911 West Parker Road, in regards to someone shoplifting shortly after 4 p.m. Saturday.  According to the police report, William Keasler, 42, peeled tags off of less expensive items then placed them on several items he wanted to purchase. Keasler reportedly placed a $1 price tag on a $16 belt, a $.97 tag on a $19.96 shirt while doing the same with several other pieces of merchandise.  An employee confronted Keasler about the tags when he was checking out. When police arrived, Keasler told them he was short on money and admitted to switching the price tags so he could pay less for his items. The price differences ended up being $56.30, according to the report.  Police arrested Keasler and took him to the Craighead County Detention Center where he was cited for theft of property.  Copyright 2016 KAIT.

Several WV employers excel in disability equality - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Several WV employers excel in disability equality Posted: Thursday, September 22, 2016 11:56 AM EDT Updated: Saturday, October 22, 2016 11:56 AM EDT By Jim Ross Several companies, each with a large presence in West Virginia, scored 80 percent or better on this year’s Disability Equality Index. Scoring 80 percent or better allows companies to describe themselves as a member of the “2016 DEI Best Places to Work” list. DEI tracks indicators of corporate disability inclusion, such as access, employment practices, culture and leadership and community engagement and support services. The survey gives companies an opportunity to evaluate policies and practices as well as to determine where a company stands in regard to being a best in class organization for disability inclusion practices. Companies scoring 100 percent included DuPont and Walmart. Those scoring 90 percent or more included CSX, CVS Healthcare and Walgreens. On the list of those scoring at least 80 percent were American Electric Power, Dow and UPS. A score of 100 does not mean to convey perfection. Rather it means a company adheres to many of the numerous leading disability inclusion practices featured in the DEI. “We’re proud to have achieved this recognition because it reflects the open dialogue with employees,” said Diana Sorfleet, vice president, chief human resources and chief diversity officer for CSX. “CSX continues to foster an environment where people from different backgrounds and experiences can contribute a variety of perspectives and solutions.” The DEI is a joint initiative between the US Business Leadership Network (USBLN) and the American Association of People with Disabilities. The 2016 DEI was completed by 83 companies. “By receiving a top score on the DEI, companies demonstrate significant business leadership, going far beyond compliance activities, driving their business success through leading disability inclusion policies and practices,” said Jill Houghton, executive director of USBLN.

But despite the decline in consumption that began in the mid-’70s, a particular type of beef is rapidly rising in popularity. According to Nielsen, sales of grass-fed beef rose by 40 percent in 2015 over 2014 numbers, compared with a 6.5 percent increase for conventional beef. Today, you can get grass-fed beef franks at Major League Baseball parks, grass-fed beef burgers at the drive-through, and packets of grass-fed ground beef at mega-grocers such as Walmart. For an alternative meat product to achieve such mainstream status in a relatively short period of time is, on some level, a success story. After all, grass-fed production systems are celebrated for raising animals outside of confinement and can have a reduced environmental footprint compared with grain-fed beef. Defining what grass-fed beef is can be a challenge, and what lies behind the rising sales is equally murky. Despite sales being up significantly in the past year, grass-fed beef accounted for less than 2 percent of the overall beef market, according to the USDA. Furthermore, the acceptance of grass-fed beef by American diners doesn’t mean that more American ranchers are moving away from conventional beef production. Overall beef imports to the U.S. have been trending downward for about a decade, but two of the largest foreign suppliers of U.S. beef are New Zealand and Australia—and meat cattle operations in both countries are based in large part on pasture, not feedlots. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, “Most imported beef is lower-valued, grass-fed beef destined for processing, primarily as ground beef.” That’s been the case for a while, but as the market changes, all it takes is some new branding, and the same ground beef that was sold as “ground beef” a few years ago can suddenly become a hip new product with a not-insignificant green halo. The hormone- and antibiotic-free grass-fed burger that Carl’s Jr. debuted in 2014—to much fanfare—is made with 100 percent Australian beef. “When consumers see grass-fed on a label, they have this vision in mind that the meat came from not-too-far away, from animals out on a pasture and not given antibiotics and hormones and in many cases, that’s not the truth,” Marilyn Noble, a spokeswoman for the American Grassfed Association, told the Wall Street Journal. Domestic producers have seen their sales rise too, according to research from the Wallace Center, a nonprofit working to reform the food system, which found that U.S. grass-fed beef sales hit $400 million in 2013, compared with just $5 million in 1998. If you’re buying beef raised on pasture because you want to take part in the local ag economy, then shopping will require a bit more work than grabbing the first thing you see at the store with “grass-fed” printed on the label. There was a USDA process-verified label for grass-fed beef, which required that animals be raised only on grass or forage, but it was rescinded this year (much to the chagrin of organizations that support small farms). The American Grassfed Association has established its own standards, which also require a diet consisting solely of grass and forage, in addition to restricting the use of antibiotics, hormones, and confinement. All AMA-labeled beef comes from animals that were born and raised in the United States.

Students who finish the programme, dubbed the “MicroMasters”, and pass the final exams can get certificates of completion for about $1 000. If they want to go still further, they'll have a leg up in applying for regular admission to complete a full-fledged degree. In short: Learn now, apply later. The MicroMasters, which MIT offers for supply chain management, covers about a quarter of the material in a typical master's degree programme and involves subjects in critically short supply in the workplace. The certificates are likely to carry weight with employers because of the quality of the universities standing behind them. Among them, Columbia University is offering artificial intelligence; the Rochester Institute of Technology, project management; and the University of Michigan, user-experience research and design. Wal-Mart Stores gave MIT's certificate a strong endorsement in a statement on the launch, calling it “a powerful way for people to learn the important skills required to be successful.” The universities can keep costs low because the courses are online. The offerings help fulfill their educational mission while attracting students who could end up going for full degrees and paying tuition. The programme comes as schools, including top universities, are increasingly experimenting with online education, offering “micro-credentials” and expanding their outreach - and their brands. The MicroMasters is being offered through edX, the online education platform co-founded by MIT and Harvard University. Harvard “looks forward to offering a MicroMasters programme in the future,” edX statement said in a statement on Tuesday announcing the programs. MIT, the originator of the MicroMasters, launched its pilot programme in supply chain management earlier this year. It involves five courses lasting 10 weeks each, requiring eight to 10 hours of work per week per course. The school says 27 000 students enrolled, of whom 3 500 are working toward a certificate. By contrast, only 40 students are admitted each year to MIT's traditional, 10-month master's degree in supply chain management. MIT President Rafael Reif said in an interview that the MicroMasters programme is close to his heart because he was raised and educated in Venezuela and understands how hard it is for most people to get an education at a world-class school. After teaching in Caracas, he earned a doctorate in electrical engineering at Stanford, taught there for a year, and then got hired by MIT. “I hit the lottery,” he said. Reif called MicroMasters “an experiment in what I call inverted admissions. Anybody anywhere can try to take those courses online.” If the concept works well, he said, it may be expanded to other parts of MIT. “It is an important project for me,” he said. “I believe in the model of empowering people.” Other schools offering MicroMasters include Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management, Australian National University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Indian Institute of Management/Bangalore, and Catholic University of Louvain (or Leuven), in Belgium.

Bolus’ Trump trucks on a recent afternoon. Anti-social media spasmed Thursday with reports of “scary clowns” appearing across Northeast Pennsylvania, but I swear Bob Bolus and I were only on the road for a couple of hours. Times-Tribune Web Editor Ted Baird came along for the ride, an afternoon jaunt on the Donald Trump Express. A Northeast Pennsylvania trucking magnate and diehard supporter of the Republican presidential nominee, Bob challenged me — a diehard Trump detractor — to tour the valley in his “Trump Truck,” which pulls a trailer tattooed with Trump slogans. Bob has more than one of these trailers, but wouldn’t say how many. I brought along a “Share Size” bag of Skittles and offered some to Bob. He declined, and didn’t seem to get the reference. He was laser-focused on showing me the light at the end of the Trump tunnel. “You can bet your ass you’re gonna be greeted with ‘deplorables’ who have something to say,” Bob said, riffing on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s recent description of half of Trump supporters fitting into a “basket of deplorables.” The media and many Trumpeters seized upon the phrase as a rallying cry, but I’d wager that the word that most stuck in their craw was “irredeemable.” “You could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the ‘basket of deplorables’ … some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” the former first lady, senator and secretary of state said. Ugh. Apology not accepted It is always a mistake to insult voters. It is a sin to judge anyone ineligible for redemption. Hillary has since apologized for damning a sizeable portion of the electorate, but no one I spoke with Thursday was interested in listening. Vein of frustration Steve Rakauskas laughed when I asked why he didn’t like Hillary. He listed “Benghazi” and her private email server among other affronts as we baked in the late-summer heat of the Wal-Mart parking lot in Taylor. I pointed out that eight (!) Republican investigations turned up zero evidence that anyone did anything illegal. It didn’t matter. Hillary Clinton has been a fixture in American politics for the better part of 40 years. Donald Trump is a novice, which is attractive to Steve. A machine operator who earns $12 an hour at Scranton Products in Moosic, Steve is a registered Republican and a volunteer firefighter in Ransom Twp. He said Trump has tapped into a genuine vein of frustration among those who want America to “be the way it used to be.” “I went up to that (Outlaw Music Festival) at Montage,” he said. “My buddy wore a Trump T-shirt and when we got up there, he said, ‘Maybe this wasn’t a good idea.’ I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. You’re entitled to your opinion, just like anybody else.’ You wouldn’t believe how many people came up just to shake his hand.” Steve also likes Trump’s preposterous promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico —and have Mexico pay for it. Bob insists it can be done. As he steered us toward the Viewmont Mall, I reminded Bob that back in 2007, I visited Yuma, Arizona, with Pennsylvania Army and Air National Guard troops sent to give the appearance of securing the border. I saw firsthand how futile it is to try and police nearly 2,000 miles of mostly wild terrain, let alone wall it off. Bob was unmoved. He said if I traveled the interstates, I would see that American contractors are “building walls all over the place,” mostly to block traffic noise in residential areas. After asking if he really thought the two types of structures were even remotely comparable (he did), I told Bob I could buy a $50 ladder at Lowe’s and scale Trump’s Wall. “I’d rather shoot you off a ladder than try to find you crawling under the wire,” he said. He was grinning, but not kidding. Talk about false equivalency.     Some for, some against We parked in the Viewmont lot and quickly attracted interest. The first to walk up was Holly Lane, a registered Democrat from New York who was in the area visiting friends. A 66-year-old IT professional, Holly is also an amateur photographer who couldn’t pass on the chance to snap a shot of the Trump Truck. I asked Holly if she was a fan of The Donald. “Not really,” she said, but she still wasn’t sure who to vote for. “We’ll have to wait and see,” she said. Edie Walters, 57, and her son, Leonard Kakareka, 28, of Dalton, made up their minds long ago. Republicans and self-described conservatives, they are voting Trump. “I really want that wall,” said Leonard, a former carpenter on disability. He said the wall would cut the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants from Mexico — and keep Mexico from stealing American fish. This charge against our southern neighbors was new to me, but obviously important to Leonard. Edie also stood up for Trump, saying, “He is gonna make America great again.” “What does that mean?” I asked. She said that building the wall, for instance, would put a lot of people to work. So would increasing the number of border guards. “So it’s like a jobs program?” I asked. “Yes!” Edie replied, adding that Trump “tells it like it is,” a mantra repeated many times by the Trumpeters we met. “But he’s been shown to have been not a man of his words many, many times,” I said. “He forgets,” Edie said. “He’s old... He’s not a speaker.” Trump is 70. Hillary is 68. Monday night, they will face off for the first of three debates. The people I met Thursday all said they were looking forward to the event. None of them were deplorable. They were fellow Americans who see this race differently than I do, but discussed it with me calmly and respectfully. No one is irredeemable — even Donald Trump. Scathing indictment But he is deplorable and dangerous. That he is a candidate for the presidency is a scathing indictment of both major parties. As Vice President Joe Biden admitted back in July, the political class — particularly Democrats — have lost touch with the working class. The disconnect has become so vast and visceral that millions of Americans have turned to a wealthy, foolhardy fabulist who lies just about every time he opens his mouth. That’s a shame, and there are truckloads of blame to go around. Contact the writer: kellysworld@timesshamrock.com; @cjkink on Twitter.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express' "anti-steering" rules violated federal antitrust law. Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices. The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express' merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition. But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige. "Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction," Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel. "So long as AmEx's market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry," he added. Shares of American Express, whose largest shareholder is billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, closed down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $63.42. The shares had been down about 1.4 percent when the decision was issued. FREEDOM TO CHOOSE The decision may help American Express compete for space in customer wallets with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, whose cards are more plentiful but whose customers spend less. It may also help American Express boost revenue as it cuts costs to help offset the loss of lucrative co-branding relationships such as with Costco Wholesale Corp. Monday's decision is also a defeat for the U.S. government and 17 states, led by Ohio, that challenged American Express' anti-steering rules. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Mark Abueg, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Kate Hanson, a spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said they were reviewing the decision. "American Express earned a major victory today," Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault told employees in a memo reviewed by Reuters. "It is unfair to allow merchants who have agreed to honor our cards to then discriminate against American Express and our card members, and it is fundamentally unfair to interfere with consumers' rights to choose how they want to pay," he said. Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, had argued that voiding American Express' anti-steering rules would encourage competition, and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. INJUNCTION In his ruling, Garaufis had said the non-discrimination provisions enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted it, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal. Monday's decision means it can continue doing so. Visa and MasterCard together have about 1.2 billion cards in the United States. American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMore By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for American Express Co <AXP.N> to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers toward lower-cost cards from other issuers. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express' "anti-steering" rules violated federal antitrust law. Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices. The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express' merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition. But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige. "Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction," Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel. "So long as AmEx's market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry," he added. Shares of American Express, whose largest shareholder is billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N>, closed down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $63.42. The shares had been down about 1.4 percent when the decision was issued. FREEDOM TO CHOOSE The decision may help American Express compete for space in customer wallets with Visa Inc <V.N> and MasterCard Inc <MA.N>, whose cards are more plentiful but whose customers spend less. It may also help American Express boost revenue as it cuts costs to help offset the loss of lucrative co-branding relationships such as with Costco Wholesale Corp <COST.O>. Monday's decision is also a defeat for the U.S. government and 17 states, led by Ohio, that challenged American Express' anti-steering rules. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Mark Abueg, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Kate Hanson, a spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said that they are reviewing the decision. American Express welcomed the decision. "Consumers will be able to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale," spokeswoman Marina Norville said. Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp <TGT.N> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, had argued that voiding American Express' anti-steering rules would encourage competition and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. INJUNCTION In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal. Monday's decision means it can continue doing so. Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States. American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

Posted Tuesday, September 27, 2016 3:36 am By Dick Lindsay rlindsay@berkshireeagle.com @BE_DLindsay on Twitter PITTSFIELD — The Morningside neighborhood's future could hinge on health care, increased home ownership, food, entertainment and retail. That's the not-cast-in-stone conclusion from planners with the Tyler Street Transformative Development Initiative, or TDI, created late last summer to help boost the area's economy and improve the residents quality of life. During an all-day open house at Morningside Baptist Church, the TDI's leading planner, Amewusika "Sika" Sedzro and Lisa Nagle of Elan Planning, Design and Landscape Architecture of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., outlined the vision for revitalizing the mixed residential/commercial area that stretches from just beyond Berkshire Medical Center to Woodlawn Avenue. The proposal breaks up the TDI in six areas of interest: • Health and specialized housing and midtown residential, both on the far western side of the district; • Food/agriculture/education on the southerly side; • Commercial/retail and Food/entertainment along Tyler Street; • Residential on eastern half and just north and south of Tyler Street. TDI planners said the vision grew out of public input from earlier in the year and the current makeup of the area. They want more feedback for any proposal is finalized in the coming months. "These are just ideas," Nagle said. "We want people to give us a thumbs up or thumbs down." "If you have a strong opinion about these things tell us now," said Diane Marcella, president of the Tyler Street Business Group. The poster boards that were on display detailing the possible master plan for Tyler Street will be placed within the TDI at yet to be determined locations, city officials said. MassDevelopment, the state's finance and development agency, designated Pittsfield a TDI community in August 2016 to help stimulate growth in the Tyler Street area. In April the agency hired Sedzro to lead the TDI over the next three years in planning and implementing ways to bring in new business, increasing housing opportunities and allow for some creativity. Other goals include finding ways to better link the neighborhood to the downtown, BMC, Springside Park and the William Stanley Business Park. The city and state hope to build on recent individual redevelopment in the Morningside area, such as the opening four years ago of the Silk Mill Apartments, the conversion of a century-old factory into affordable housing and the ongoing search for tenants to the William Stanley Business Park that could include a Walmart Supercenter. TDI planners said the goal is to let the private sector dictate how the area grows economically as there are no property-takings involved. They noted any zoning changes would have to come from the city to meet the desired economic development for the TDI district. As for Morningside residents, the final TDI plan looks to increase home ownership. "The goal is 65 percent home ownership and we are way below that [in the TDI]," Nagle said. Residents are also concerned about living in a safer, more accessible neighborhood, according to Ward 2 Councilor Kevin Morandi. "They want better sidewalks and lighting. Lighting was a top priority," he said. "People are really excited about what can be done here." Short-term, TDI planners look to experiment in the coming months by taking advantage of empty commercial space. "We're trying to activate some vacant storefronts with holiday pop-up markets ... to see what will work here," Sedzro said. Contact Dick Lindsay at 413-496-6233. On the web ...

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Luciano: Reader constipation, racy tacos and bad romance Monday Sep 26, 2016 at 3:46 PM Sep 26, 2016 at 3:46 PM Phil Luciano Journal Star columnist @lucianophil Autumn brings a dip in temperatures everywhere except in reader mail, as we see in a fiery edition of Random Ax of Snideness. Another satisfied customer: When I try to digest your columns, I become constipated. — Ed Maybe there’s a bug going around, Ed, because when I read your letters I feel like puking. The right side: Your story about the Trewyn School student with autism who chewed on two used condoms: this is pretty low journalism. This is a terrible situation but to throw the only District 150 autism school under the bus over something that sounds unpredictable and unmanageable is beneath you. This story seems very one sided. — Alan Yes, it was one-sided, from the side that thinks students shouldn’t be eating used condoms on school playgrounds. Proud doesn't always mean smart: As a proud parent of two Peoria Public School students and PTO president and vice president of their school, I feel this is simply a news story attempting to further sour the public image of Peoria Public Schools. … I personally didn't need to know this story. I can't imagine any other parent wanted to know this, either. — Emily If you really can’t imagine that other parents don’t care about the welfare of students or the timely notification of parents, then I imagine you should not be a PTO president any longer. Taco no-no? Regarding the Eat Dawn’s Taco truck, banned from an event for being too racy: if it said "Eat Juan's Tacos," this wouldn't even be a story. — Jim Maybe. But if the logo said, “Eat Don’s Taco” and featured a shirtless cowboy atop a frankfurter, parents might not be so gleeful about taking photos of their kids posing next to the truck. Nice visual: According to the taco-truck owner, the logo is a deliberately intended "edgy" sex/food double entendre. But it’s defended by folks who think that it wouldn't offend children, and, I assume, further endorsed for inclusion at a family event because wives would get it but not be offended, while they stand in line for a soft-shell in their size-18 daisy-dukes and 5-inch cork-heeled pumps. — G.G. If that kind of outfit isn’t family-friendly, we’ll have to cancel every county fair in central Illinois. Peakin’ in Pekin: I enjoyed your article about Gene Wilder. My favorite movie was “Stir Crazy.” Me and my brother somehow got into this movie at the Pekin Mall movie theater. I was 13 and he was 9. We didn’t know it was rated R. We were watching it and this girl on-screen took off her top in a strip club. I said to my brother, “I don’t think I ever seen anything like that.” He said, “Neither have I.” — Jon That’s entertainment. Got the Willies: For heaven’s sake! Is there really so little that's newsworthy at the Journal Star? You're probably the ONLY one in the area fascinated with Willie York. Why is that? It's way past time that you move on. Most of us neither know nor care about his escapades or whereabouts. Yet, in your mind this vagabond is a celebrity. — Christopher. In almost 30 years in this space, I’ve written a whopping eight columns on Willie. Sorry to overwhelm your sensibilities. Willie might not be a celebrity, but at least he’s not a whiner. Special delivery: I saw the column about the Walmart patron soliciting workers there for sex. When I worked at the Peoria Post Office in the ‘70s, there was an employee who went around quietly asking women for the same thing. Some took him up on it. It was rumored he paid well. — Linda Nice to see where our taxpayer money goes. Animal story: You wrote about the love affair gone wrong like a country song. Many years ago, I had a date for a Thursday evening. I was driving a VW Rabbit in those days. I was at a livestock market that afternoon and unexpectedly bought 4 feeder pigs. Not driving a truck that day, I trussed them up with twine and tossed them in the back and headed off to the farm. What could go wrong? So, I go to pick up my date. She gets in the car and says, “What's that smell?" I replied, “Oh, that’s from pigs. I haul pigs in my car all the time.” Someday some country artist will write a song about my failed romance. — Dan You’re telling me the VW Rabbit didn’t win her heart? Maybe that stuck-up princess was waiting for a slick Romeo to pull up in a shiny Ford Pinto. Bro, you were better off with your Rabbit and pigs. PHIL LUCIANO is a Journal Star columnist.

By Matt Asay | September 26, 2016, 12:48 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Pinkypills There's a lot of money to be made in data science, as a new O'Reilly report indicates. How much money? Over the last three years, "About half of [those surveyed] reported a 20% change [in salary], and the salary of 12% of the sample doubled." With a median salary of $106,000 for US data professionals, those are significant jumps. Yet, there's also a lot of unemployment. At least, for those people who data science helps to put out of a job. What Patrick McKenzie wrote of engineers is equally true of data scientists: "You're in the business of unemploying people." Data, done right, makes systems more efficient and, inevitably, "efficiency gains" generally translate into "somebody will lose their job to a machine." But not all jobs. Gartner's Svetlana Sicular described the importance of people and machines collaborating on data, something that the industry is only just now settling into accepting. Your data science mileage may vary In the early, hype-prone days of big data, breathless reports abounded of machines replacing humans as data analytics uncovered "actionable insights" that humans would then execute. Reality, however, has been very different. SEE: Why data science is just grade school math and writing It turns out that machines aren't very good at interpreting data. As biased as we people are (and we are, both in the data we choose to collect and the questions we ask of it), and as flawed as our analysis can be, people remain essential to understanding data. The key is to figure out the right balance between human and machine, as Sicular highlighted: I call the symbiosis of a man and a machine Centaur Intelligence, in which the head is always human: People do at what they excel—curiosity, creativity and compassion. And machines do their best too: Learn at scale, crunch data and answer questions lightning fast. Machine answers require a human interpretation to turn correlations into causation. People curate data and select the right questions. Both parties augment each other, and the centaur is riding the wave of intelligence, human and artificial. This smacks of common sense, because it is. But, again, common sense has been lacking in the frothy excitement around big data's possibilities. That excitement is warranted but only, as Sicular posited, as a companion to human interpretation. You need both machine and human intelligence to get the most from data. You also need human ingenuity to architect and build complex, distributed systems. As Jesse Anderson argued, this proves to be very difficult in practice. It will keep many an engineer employed for years to come. Data-driven unemployment Others, however, are not so fortunate. While I think it's an inescapable fact that machines will replace many human jobs, it's not necessarily a cheerful one. Sicular noted, "We should remember that each machine is good at a particular aspect (for which it has data and algorithms). Humans are a universal machine that is good at many things at once." But for those people that aren't particularly "good at many things at once," single-purpose machines may prove a ready, superior replacement. SEE: Why 2016 might be the year of citizen data scientists It has ever been thus with technology, but perhaps never more so than now. As a recent report in The Economist showcased: In the old days companies with large revenues and global footprints almost always had lots of assets and employees. Some superstar companies, such as Walmart and Exxon, still do. But digital companies with huge market valuations and market shares typically have few assets. In 1990 the top three carmakers in Detroit between them had nominal revenues of $250 billion, a market capitalisation of $36 billion and 1.2m employees. In 2014 the top three companies in Silicon Valley had revenues of $247 billion and a market capitalisation of over $1 trillion but just 137,000 employees. Perhaps even more tellingly, as companies like Uber dismantle old industries, they're using data to turn people into functional cogs with minimal, if any, benefits (e.g., health insurance, disability, etc.). None of which is a reason to try to turn back the clock on technological progress, Luddite-style. No, it's just a reminder that when we code, particularly in our increasingly data-driven world, we need to be sensitive to the lives we impact for both good and ill.

Fighting this type of fraud is like playing Whac-A-Mole. Just as authorities hammer one con scheme down, a new one pops up. When the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) began tracking such scams in 2013, the office was getting between 9,000 and 12,000 calls a week. Now it’s up to 25,000 to 30,000, according to Timothy Camus, TIGTA’s deputy inspector general for investigations. It used to be that the charlatans manually dialed for victims. They now have advanced autodial technology allowing them to speed through hundreds of telephone numbers. And they manipulate caller ID to make it appear as if they are calling from the IRS. TIGTA has been studying how many calls it takes before the con artists trick someone into sending money. At the beginning of this year, they found it took 400 calls before they got a victim. And now it only takes about 215 calls, Camus told me. The scammers can snare 115 to 125 victims a week. In a recent week, out of 120 people who reported paying scammers, 100 did so using iTunes gift cards. The IRS won’t call you demanding payment, and the agency would never ask you to pay your tax debt using a gift card. “We got a dreadful call from scammers with all kinds of demands and threats, ” a reader, Gloria, wrote following my recent column about getting one of these calls. “It was a scary half an hour that they held us on the phone until we realized it was a fraud.” Some concerned citizens try to take on the scammers in an effort to protect other potential victims. These people, fully aware they are targets of a fraud scheme, tie up conmen on the telephone, hoping to engage them long enough to reduce — even by one — the number of additional people they can call. It’s a laudable mission but also dangerous. “Rather than hang up, I keep leading the caller on for as long as I can, ” wrote a reader from Massachusetts. “My goal is just to waste their time and frustrate them. My record is about 20 minutes before they caught on. I figure the more I can cost them the better.” Richard from California, a certified public accountant, said he fights back because he’s tired of hearing from many of his elderly clients who are panicked when they get these calls. He decided to play along when he was dialed up by an IRS impersonator. “When I balked at going to Wal-Mart and getting a debit card to pay them, [the scammer] got a little nasty, so I decided to teach him a lesson, ” he said. “I have a really high-quality referee whistle. I gave him the biggest blast of the whistle that I could muster up and then hung up. Hopefully I busted his eardrum.” Some readers wondered what the harm is in messing with the scammers as retaliation. “I am well aware of these scams and will not respond, ” one person wrote. “I am curious as to why I shouldn’t engage them. Is there a risk?” Yes, there is. The best way to frustrate them is to hang up immediately. I know many of you are shrewd enough to suspect a scam. But some folks, the longer they listen, may be persuaded to part with some money. Camus said there have been at least three reported cases where scammers got mad and made prank calls to local law enforcement officials claiming there was an armed dispute happening at the person’s home. This strategy of payback actually has a name, “SWATting” because a S.W.A.T. team is sent to investigate the call. If the scammers get your personal information, they could also target you through identity theft, Camus said. “If they get angry, who knows what else they could do behind the scenes?” he said. “They are clearly criminals and they have the time.” It is tempting to toy with these scoundrels. But don’t put yourself at risk. Please, just hang up. Readers can write to Michelle Singletary c/o The Washington Post, 1301 K St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20071.

Step inside, though, and you’re transported back to simpler times, when barbers weren’t too rushed to chat up customers while offering leisurely haircuts, shaves, and beard trims. Here, the shaves are done the old-fashioned way, with a hot towel, lather, and a straight razor.   Musical Instruments Readers’ choice: Zoo Music, 3409 Indale Rd, 817-377-4411 Critics’ choice: Competition Music, 3136 E Lancaster Av, 817-535-2040 With more battle-worn axes than the set of Game of Thrones, Competition Music has become the go-to destination for novice musicians and professionals alike. The store overflows with used amps, basses, drums, gear, and P.A. systems. The venerable business may run afoul of corporate chain trends, but what the space lacks in storefront veneer it makes up for with top notch customer service.   Used CDs/Records Readers’ choice: Doc’s Records and Vintage, 8522 Camp Bowie West, 817-732-5455 Critic’s choice: Dreamy Life Records & Music, 1310 W Allen Av, 817-733-5463 Tucked away in one of the back rooms of the Fairmount Community Library, Dreamy Life is a little (literally, the room is small) slice of heaven for record hounds no matter if they are searching for new local releases or used records, CDs, or tapes. Manned by the musos who run the Dreamy Life record label, the store is one of the hippest places to hang out in all of Fort Worth. Stop by on a Friday evening for happy hour, featuring live music, free beer, and discounts galore.   Toys Readers’ choice: Game Over Videogames, 5258 S Hulen St, 817-263-4263 Critic’s choice: Toy Works, 6333 Camp Bowie Blvd, 817-737-8697 Few retail establishments can fill children of all ages with such whimsy and joy as a toy store. For 33 years, Toy Works has been doing just that. You won’t find aisle after aisle packed with Star Wars action figures. Instead, the place is packed with gadgets aimed at educating youngsters. Don’t worry, though. Among the train sets, books, and puzzles, you’ll also come across a handheld video game or five.   Courier Service Readers’ choice: Favor, Favordelivery.com Critic’s choice: Fort Worth Couriers, 209 W 2nd St, 817-500-4173 Let’s face it, “ain’t nobody got the time” –– much less the motivation –– to deliver goods or documents across town him- or herself. If you need a courier service that is seemingly magical, Fort Worth Couriers is your best bet. These folks don’t deliver babies, but they will deliver just about anything else, ensuring that it arrives at its intended destination promptly and fully intact. It’s easy. Order a pickup online, hand over the goods, and just sit back and relax.     Need a Trump tramp-stamp? A Clinton carving? Woody Woodpecker? Whatever. You can get it at Tattoo Ranch. Photo by Kayla Stigall. Tattoo Parlor/Artist Readers’ choice: Fade to Black Tattoo Company, 209 S Jennings Av, 817-878-4349 Critic’s choice: Tattoo Ranch, 108 W Exchange Av, 817-626-7400 Smack-dab in the Stockyards and surrounded by neon, Tattoo Ranch’s experienced artists can do anything. From a portrait of Donald Trump (not recommended) to an intricate tribal piece, these folks have the kind of skill that goes beyond dealing with drunken cowboys at 1 in the morning on a Saturday night. Bold ,full-color illustrations? Photorealism? Tattoo Ranch can do it all.   Books Readers’ choice: Half Price Books, 5417 S Hulen St (with other locations in Tarrant County), 817-294-1166 Critic’s choice: The Last Word Bookstore, 615 S Jennings Av, 817-862-9859 Thank God. An independent bookstore. And on the Near Southside! Explore this funky 2,700-square-foot space of books, locally made art, t-shirts, and handmade greeting cards that say things like, “F*ck off, you f*#cking f*^ck.” Owner Paul Combs is quite the character and tour guide. Ask him to see the bathroom — yes, bathroom — before your arms get too full of words. Then check out the store’s event calendar and put poetry nights on your to-do list. There’s plenty of parking here, too, and witty remarks on all things literature and life.   Adult Toys Readers’ choice: The Velvet Box, 2917 Morton St (with other locations in Tarrant County), 817-744-7841 Critic’s choice: The Velvet Box This perennial winner seems like an easy pick. Sure, the locally owned Velvet Box has the requisite his’n’hers sex toys (google “Fifi” when you get a minute, guys), lubes, lingerie in all sizes and shapes, and other paraphernalia. But the Box offers more, including a board-certified sexuality educator who provides a spectrum of educational classes in which questions from the philosophical to the prurient are given equal consideration. From “Booty Basics” and classes on oral sex to “Illness and Intimacy,”  “Sex Over 50,” and couples classes, there’s something for almost everyone. The store is exceptionally female-friendly, non-threatening, and tidy –– and that’s why we keep going back.   Head Shop Readers’ choice: Fusion, 2205 Berry St, 817-921-5500 Critic’s choice: Smokin’ Dragon, 10621 S Fwy, 817-551-5578 Smokin’ Dragon is kind of overwhelming based solely on the sheer amount of stuff they have. There is the crazy huge selection of smoking and vaping accessories –– just when you think you’ve seen it all, you see a piece shaped like a lounging Garfield. There’s also a dizzying array of decorative items.   Cigars Readers’ choice: Pop’s Safari Cigars and Fine Wines, 2929 Morton St, 817-334-0559 Critic’s choice: Silver Leaf Cigar Lounge, 426 Commerce St, 817-887-9535 A relatively recent addition, the Silver Leaf folks are watching their popularity grow along with their humidor selections. As the only cigar-specific lounge in the city of Fort Worth with a full bar, the Leaf is a pleasure for sipping a single-malt scotch while perusing the walk-in, cedar-lined humidor. Expected brands like Davidoff, Padrón, Oliva, and Arturo Fuente are available, along with other handmade premium options from major labels. The staff is attentive without being intrusive, and a licensed tobacconist is always on hand to answer even your most esoteric questions.   Cheap Threads Readers’ choice: Plato’s Closet, 4625 Donnelly Av, 817-731-9449 Critic’s choice: We’re All About the Dress, 6242 Rufe Snow Dr, NRH, 817-412-0727 We’re all about the love for this nonprofit that has been providing free prom dresses to low-income teenagers since 2008. Shop founder Janie Tillery-Wood began offering free wedding dresses to military personnel of all branches after her retired U.S. Navy SEAL brother died in 2013. This year, Tillery-Wood added police officers, firefighters, and EMT workers to her clientele.   Guns Readers’ choice: Lead Heads, 1029 N Saginaw Blvd, 682-224-5531 Critic’s choice: Original Fort Worth Gun Show, 3401 Burnett Tandy Dr, 817-732-1194 Will Rogers Memorial Center keeps drawing hundreds of firearm vendors to the Original Fort Worth Gun Show, which has been offering a staggering selection of handguns and rifles to gun enthusiasts since 1972. Held about every six weeks, the Original is where new and used firearms can be bought, sold, or traded, along with ammunition, scopes, and reloading equipment. The prices aren’t super-low, but the selection is vast, making the trip worth the $9 admission and city parking fees. And if you don’t want Uncle Sam all up in your grill, you can buy a gun from vendors who aren’t licensed dealers, meaning you don’t have to endure a background check or waiting period. Remember: It’s not irresponsible unless you do something stupid.   Customer Service Readers’ choice: Perfect Touch Day Spa, 3023 Bledsoe St, Ste 103, 817-870-3610 Critic’s choice: Maureen Hucey at Angie’s Bikkles Caribbean Restaurant, 1704 Galveston Av, 817-433-5757 It’s always nice to feel welcome at a restaurant, but it’s especially great to feel appreciated and taken care of when you’re visiting a place whose cuisine might be intimidating. Walk into this Hospital District hole in the wall, and owner/chef/server Hucey will make you feel right at home. She simply oozes charisma and sincerity and will happily navigate the uninitiated through her authentic Caribbean menu.     Antiques Readers’ choice: Montgomery Street Antique Mall, 2601 Montgomery St, 817-735-9685 Critic’s choice: JunkerVal.com Antiques & Vintage, 3458 Bluebonnet Cir, 817-266-6403 Val Arnett’s cozy boutique nestled in Bluebonnet Circle is packed with cool vintage knick-knacks, collectibles, and clothes. It’s like being shot in the face with a confetti gun of conversation-starting figurines, light fixtures, and interesting works of art. Val and her trusty Australian kelpie, Beckett the Wonder Dog, both add to the charm and quirk of this TCU-area gem.   Bike Shop Readers’ choice: Bicycles, Inc, 5125 Granbury Rd, 817-292-2911 Critic’s choice: Bicycles, Inc. Flashy, new bike shops may try to compete, but Bicycles, Inc. keeps pedaling (and peddling) faster. The Fort Worth location brings cycling to the masses by offering new products, price-match guarantees, and high-quality maintenance. The best of the best cyclists willingly sit on waitlists for service because they trust their equipment only to Beth Bock, the store manager, and her team of mechanics and builders, who happen to be nice dudes, not mansplainers. In an ongoing effort to resist the increasing doucheyness of competitive cycling in these parts, Bicycles, Inc. sponsors a team of premier riders, volunteers as SAG support on group rides, and supports local clubs, like the Bicycle Betties and MBBC Racing.   Gift Shop Readers’ choice: Lawrence’s, 4601 W Freeway #224, 817-731-2772 Critic’s choice: Lil’ Shop on the Vine, 603 S Main St, Grapevine, 682-518-0296 Customers are greeted by Lily, a green brontosaurus sporting a saddle for free rides. Children and child-like customers usually oblige. Past Lily, shoppers can find an assortment of artisan goods and foods that are uniquely Texan in taste and thought. Habanera Pralines from Lamme’s Candy and Pecan Pie-In-A-Jar from San Saba River Pecan Co. are often in stock, along with a glorious number of glazes, sauces, and spreads from Fredericksburg Farms. Non-food gifts abound, such as artisan soaps, jewelry, and Texas-proud tank tops.   You wouldn’t bring a Ferrari to Rick’s Automotive Service, but our critic’s choice for best mechanic knows everything about just every domestic car, truck, or SUV. Photo by Cheyenne Hammons. Mechanic Readers’ choice: Levi Mahon, Christian Brothers, 7333 Oakmont Blvd, 817-489-9110 Critic’s choice: Rick’s Automotive Service, 241 NE Wilshire Blvd, Burleson, 817-295-0680 Rick’s is the first building on the right when you’re traveling south on I-35 and get off at Wilshire, just at the Tarrant-Johnson County line. He’s a bit ornery, a bit blustery, not the cheapest mechanic in town, and a bit slow now that he got rid of his assistant mechanics and does all the work himself. Oh, but what work he does. He’s got at least two old Ford Rangers up to 300,000 and 248,000 miles and still running well. Wouldn’t bring a Ferrari there, but he knows the hell out of most any domestic car and won’t find extra stuff that needs doing just to pad on the bucks.      Liquor Store Readers’ choice: Spec’s, 4720 Bryant Irvin Rd, 817-423-8400 Critic’s choice: Two Bucks, 4702 S Fwy (Felix St), 817-924-3202 When the liquor store giant Spec’s bought Vern’s Two Bucks a few years ago, we were afraid the change in ownership would result in a drop in service quality. And while there was a bit of turmoil for several months as most of the old workers left and the new ones were learning how Two Bucks’ clients liked to be treated, things finally settled down. Two Bucks, while no longer in the hands of the son of a bootlegger, remains an outstanding place for booze. And more: great selection, informed employees, party equipment rental, and staffers at the registers who always have a minute for a pleasant bit of conversation.   Vape Shop Readers’ choice: Vixen Vapors, 4608 Bryant Irvin Rd (with other locations in Tarrant County), 817-740-3130 Critic’s choice: Ohmies, 928 Melbourne Rd, Hurst, 817-595-9421 Most people would not walk into Ohmies, a sparse store in a strip mall, and immediately think, “Wow! Best vape shop ever.” But that first impression begins to change once you check out Ohmies’ hardware and the countless flavors that are available in a bevy of blends (percentage of propylene glycol to vegetable glycerin) and a variety of nicotine levels. All that, plus tons of E-juice, always fresh. Staff knowledge is key here. They make this joint special whether you’re a newbie or old vape hand.   Nayfa’s Furniture Jim Nayfa. Photo by Kayla Stigall. Furniture Readers’ choice: There’s No Place Like Home, 855 Foch St,  817-244-3371 Critic’s choice: Nayfa’s Furniture, 7936 Camp Bowie West, 817-953-6155 There’s something cool about the smell of fresh wood, and you get that at Nayfa’s because not only is the furniture here made from solid wood, it’s unfinished. Since we love finishing furniture, that’s a plus. You can rub your stains in to get just the color you want or paint that bookcase to match the couch. If you don’t like finishing furniture, Nayfa’s will do it for you. And if you happen to need something in a different size than what they’re offering, they’ll build you a custom piece. Nothing shabby about having a couple of really nice things in your house.   Lawyer Readers’ choice only: Brian Wilson, The Texas Law Hawk, 916 W Belknap St, 817-454-5965   Kids’ Camp Readers’ choice only: Camp Fire Camp El Tesoro, 7710 Fall Creek Hwy, Granbury, 817-831-2111   Realtor Readers’ choice only: Stephanie Fox, Associate, Williams Trew, 2821 S Hulen St, 817-739-7678   Family Medicine Readers’ choice only: Jamie Inman, 4305 S Hulen St, 817-927-4600   Daycare Readers’ choice only: Camp Fire Child Development Center, 2700 Meacham Blvd, 817-831-5050   Spa Readers’ choice only: Perfect Touch Spa, 3023 Bledsoe St, Ste 103, 817-870-3610   Nursery/Garden Center Readers’ choice only: Archie’s Gardenland, 6700 Z Boaz Pl, 817-737-6614   Hardware Readers’ choice: 3H Hardware Inc., 2217 8th Av, 817-926-8443 Critic’s choice: Jabo’s Westcliff Ace Hardware, 3548 S Hills Av, 817-926-1789 Whether you’re a manly man or womanly woman, sooner or later you’re going to need a hardware store. Yeah, you can buy a hammer at Walmart, but you won’t find a selection of hammers with half a dozen head styles or a dozen sizes unless you go to Jabo’s. From tools for outdoor work and plumbing to specialty equipment, this family-owned and operated business has what you need.   Sovereign Jewelry Company’s Brandon Smith customizes your jewelry desires. Photo by Kayla Stigall. Jewelry Readers’ choice: Sovereign Jewelry Company, 207 S Jennings St, 817-885-7848 Critic’s choice: Sovereign Jewelry Company Want something for yourself or your beloved that you can’t find anywhere else? Sovereign’s Brandon Smith will craft you a custom engagement ring, repair your wedding band, or make you a ring with the Bones Brigade logo. If you want elegant, sophisticated, and eye-catching jewelry –– or the kind of rings that look cool on fingers that wrap around a chopper’s throttle –– Sovereign is your one-stop shop.   Skate Shop Readers’ choice: Index Skateboard Supply, 2956 Crockett St, 817-887-9779 Critic’s choice: Rhythm Skate Shop, Lone Star Pkwy, GP, 972-262-4479 Rhythm outgrew its original location in Watauga and moved to Grand Prairie’s Alliance Skate Park (as well as opening sister stores in Washington and California) because it’s the best place for gear, and being at the park makes awesome sense.   Gym or Health Club Readers’ choice: Inursha Fitness, 525 Bailey Av, 817-332-7554 Critic’s choice: MetroFlex Gym, 5501 Thelin St, Ste 125, 817-891-6261 MetroFlex may be as huge as Ahnold’s pecs, but the staffers at this 35,000-square-foot facility are so friendly (and knowledgeable), intimidation gets intimidated into scurrying away. Offering a little bit of everything, from boxing to every kind of martial art (Muay Thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, karate, shoot fighting), MetroFlex also has a ton (and tons) of free weights and powerlifting equipment, plus a cardio room outfitted with treadmills, step machines, and bikes. There are never any contracts or signup fees. Dues range from $21.65 (for 13-to-17-year-olds) to $75.78 for a family of four or more. In addition to always reaching deeper to finish that last rep, the good folks at MetroFlex also reach out, helping feed and clothe the homeless in and around East Lancaster Avenue and offering youth boxing and MMA to at-risk youth.   Hair Salon Readers’ choice: Michelle Chappell, ZeeBa Salon & Day Spa, 501 Carroll St, Ste 638, 817-870-9800 Critic’s choice: Goldwaves Salon, 5137 El Campo Av, 817-731-8888 Don’t let the name fool you. Goldwaves welcomes the opportunity to cut, color, and style all manner of tresses. Founder Judy Rice and her stylists at the down-to-earth Camp Bowie veteran salon (the first Goldwaves opened in 1988 just three blocks from the current spot) can handle any challenge — trust me, we’ve tested them. Want to try those feminine pink highlights all the starlets are wearing these days? Ready to finally take the plunge on that pixie cut? They’ll put your mind at ease with a glass of wine, plunk you down in a salon chair in their quaint renovated bungalow, and you will know your head is in good hands.

Unsexy Flexport scores $65 million as software eats shipping Posted Sep 26, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story AppLovin is selling a majority stake to Orient Hontai Capital for $1.4B Advertisement Freight forwarding is a multi-trillion industry, but most people don’t even know what those words mean. It’s the business of moving boats, trucks and planes full of stuff across the world that’s recently been neglected by technology. Historically, freight forwarding has been handled by a mess of paper manifests, emails and spreadsheets, with little transparency, insights or flexibility to change routes on-the-fly. But sometimes the dullest types of work hold the biggest opportunities for startups. Enter Flexport, which just raised a $65 million Series B at a valuation well over $300 million to make freight forwarding programmable. CEO Ryan Petersen calls it “the SeamlessWeb of commerce.” Flexport is both a traditional freight forwarding service that arranges your goods to be transported, and a data provider. You can learn more about its back story, business and kerfuffle with Steve Jobs in our profile of the company, “The unsexiest trillion-dollar startup.” Flexport’s software ingests verified manifest data about what’s being shipped, how much it’s worth and where it’s going. Manufacturers can then use this data to optimize the routes taken by their goods, and make sure they always have enough products in stores. You can’t shop your shipment around to multiple forwarders, but instead Flexport provides deeper visibility into what’s happening to your freight. The promise of using the data value-add to disrupt massive freight forwarding businesses like DHL and Expeditors convinced most of Flexport’s existing investors to double down and fill out this round. Founders Fund, Bloomberg Beta, Felicis Ventures, First Round Capital, Susa Ventures, Yuri Milner and others are all back for this Series B, with the addition of Joe Lonsdale of 8VC. Founders Fund’s Trae Stephens will join the board of Flexport, which has now raised $94 million total since being founded in 2013. “Flexport is where ‘software eats the world’ meets international shipping” says Y Combinator founder and Flexport investor Paul Graham. “Can you imagine what the world would be like if international trade was made easier, the way software has made our work and personal lives easier?” How Flexport works Unlike many of today’s fast-rising startups, Flexport isn’t bleeding cash. “We actually make money on the growth. I think that’s pretty unique here. We have the opportunity to be one of the first really profitable unicorn companies,” Petersen tells me. He has a right to be proud, but also might be kicking himself. The volume of goods shipped by Flexport is up 16X year over year, and the company just crossed $1 billion in merchandise moved this year. Those goods would be worth $2.5 billion at retail, while all of Amazon saw $107 billion in revenue in 2015. Petersen beams, saying “We’re 2% of their size just a few years into our business.” Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen But perhaps if he had waited a few more months to raise the Series B, Flexport would be flying at a much higher valuation. The round came together over the summer, but “we’ve grown revenue 80% in two months,” and racked up $500,000 in August, Petersen says, simultaneously shocked, excited and a bit wistful. Yet he knows this situation is much better than running out of money or not having enough to compete. “I was tired of being cash constrained. We want to go play offense.” Flexport will pour the funding into further international expansion, especially setting up offices to “grease the wheels” with China, from where many of its clients ship. “We really want to invest hard in China. We’re gonna make mistakes there, though they won’t be on the order of what Uber did,” laughs Petersen. Flexport’s Shenzhen office joins those located in Hong Kong, New York, Amsterdam and elsewhere, instead of the startup building one massive headquarters. “The small teams are much more fun to work on and in many ways are more productive. Instead of an office with 1,000 people in it, I’d rather have 10 offices with 100. Everybody knows each other’s names. It leads to less politics.” Petersen says he’s happy to shell out for top-notch video conferencing equipment. The cooperation of these teams has created Flexport’s next big differentiator: the ability to re-route shipments down to individual pallets while they’re en route. “Let’s say you’re a company that sells speakers, and you sell into three different retailers: Target, Best Buy, and Walmart. Right now you need all this inventory in the warehouse so when they buy a pallet, you can send it,” Petersen explains. Now with Flexport’s API, “You can buy a whole container of speakers from China, and from the container in the ocean you can re-route those pallets (to whichever store wants more). Businesses go crazy from this. They can have less inventory in the warehouses, and basically turn those containers into moving warehouses,” Petersen tells us. New board member Trae Stephens says “Flexport’s helping to tackle the problem of bringing the industry to the internet age. The value of full visibility into your supply chain won’t just lead to smarter decisions, it could completely change your business.” Flexport will have to duke it out with startups like Haven trying to pick it apart with specific services, and the wealthy freight forwarding giants eager to clone or out-spend it. Petersen says one of their competitors’ Chief Information Officers keeps calling Flexport’s customers to see what it should be doing better. Another offered a Flexport employee 5X their salary to jump ship, but they stayed loyal. “Why? Because he knew they were going to fail,” says Petersen. “Competitors either ridicule us or take us very seriously, but either way they don’t like us.” In startups as in video games, if the enemies are getting stronger, you’re moving in the right direction. 0 SHARES Featured Stories Nom Launches Redesigned App VIDEO | 3:17 | Apps Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 21 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 21 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From Startups Telemedicine company Syounika Online snags top prize at TechCrunch Tokyo 4 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps These are the TechCrunch Tokyo 2016 pitch competition winners 6 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps Handshake nabs another $20M to make the job hunt more fair 15 hours ago | John Mannes Zesty, facing stiff competition, replaces its CEO and restructures 17 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next AppLovin is selling a majority stake to Orient Hontai Capital for $1.4B Posted Sep 26, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Unsexy Flexport scores $65 million as software eats shipping Posted Sep 26, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story AppLovin is selling a majority stake to Orient Hontai Capital for $1.4B Advertisement Freight forwarding is a multi-trillion industry, but most people don’t even know what those words mean. It’s the business of moving boats, trucks and planes full of stuff across the world that’s recently been neglected by technology. Historically, freight forwarding has been handled by a mess of paper manifests, emails and spreadsheets, with little transparency, insights or flexibility to change routes on-the-fly. But sometimes the dullest types of work hold the biggest opportunities for startups. Enter Flexport, which just raised a $65 million Series B at a valuation well over $300 million to make freight forwarding programmable. CEO Ryan Petersen calls it “the SeamlessWeb of commerce.” Flexport is both a traditional freight forwarding service that arranges your goods to be transported, and a data provider. You can learn more about its back story, business and kerfuffle with Steve Jobs in our profile of the company, “The unsexiest trillion-dollar startup.” Flexport’s software ingests verified manifest data about what’s being shipped, how much it’s worth and where it’s going.

MARKETING The 5 Most Infuriating Emails You Get Every Day These email marketers may mean well, but you shouldn't have to put up with their crap. By Walter Chen Walter Chen is the founder and CEO of iDoneThis, the easiest way to share and celebrate what you get done at work, every day. He blogs about management, entrepreneurship, and happiness on the iDoneThis Blog. @smalter Founder and CEO, iDoneThis@smalter WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Imagine you start receiving a series of emails from a criminal. He asks you for help running from the police. You don't know him, but for some reason he's emailing you, sending you texts, and even calling your phone. A hotel owner also emails you. The hotel owner says that he knows you've been in contact with the criminal, and he wants you to pay for the damages done to his hotel. Apparently, Toyota thought that would make you run out to buy the Toyota Matrix. In 2009, Toyota launched a targeted email marketing campaign about a fictional outlaw, Sebastian Bowler. During the campaign, "Sebastian" harassed the customers over email, text, and phone calls. One customer, Amber Duick, believed that a real criminal named Sebastian was stalking her. When she found out it was merely Toyota's marketing campaign, she sued them for undue distress... and the courts ruled in her favor. We hate email marketers. While not everyone gets harassed by a fictional criminal, we get over 80 emails a day--and email marketers are known for doing ridiculous, irritating, and even disrespectful things to stand out in the crowd. Here are the 5 most aggravating mistakes email marketers make on a daily basis: 1. Shaming Last year, salad chain Sweetgreen sent an email that said, in all caps: YOU'VE BEEN BAD THIS PAST WEEK. Sweetgreen made a moral judgment about its customers' eating habits, and people took to Twitter to express their anger. They posted photos of the email using the hashtag, "#FatShame." Marketers think that subject lines like this will get them clicks, and it's true. But Linda Brennan and Wayne Binney's survey shows that these clicks don't mean conversions--in fact, shame-marketing usually backfires. Their research states that shame makes people feel defensive. Defensive people want to justify their actions, not to change them. For example, if an email mentions how bad bacon is for me, I might think, "It's okay, because I only eat bacon on weekends," and ignore the campaign. 2. False hope Amazon's July 15th sale, Prime Day, was advertised as "a bigger event than Black Friday." The marketing campaign, which included many emails, even had its own hashtag (#PrimeDay), which went very wrong when the deals were only so-so. One customer, @cherryyyyybomb, pointed out on Twitter that the Play Station 4 was only marked down ten cents. Another, @ChiefSakeef, wrote, "The best deal I've seen on Prime Day is 15% off a box of Pop Tarts." Prime Day's "lightning deals" were such a disappointment that Walmart and many other businesses experienced a surge in online sales, with users clicking away to get what they needed elsewhere. 3. Too much familiarity Nothing is more cringeworthy than when a company tries to act all buddy-buddy without ever having met you. Psychologically, we hate it because it's a form of blatant dishonesty. When someone is obviously trying to pander to you, it feels like they aren't authentic. In other words, it feels like they're hiding something. No example of this is better than Hillary Clinton's excessively friendly fundraising emails. "Have dinner with me, Walter?" Even though the product they're selling is a candidate, it's really unnatural. 4. URGENT!!! Glossier, a trendy skincare company, just sent me an email that said, "By EOD, please," in the subject line. Just looking at the subject, I didn't realize the email was from Glossier at first--I thought it was work-related. Then I opened it and saw it was just about a skincare product. This unwarranted self-importance seems like a frustrating by-product of the "narcissism epidemic"--the data that shows 30% more millennials than Generation X-ers are above average on the Narcissistic Personality Index. It feels ridiculous for Glossier to demand my immediate attention for a skincare product. 5. "To Whom It May Concern" We spend enough time typing our names, emails, and sometimes even credit card information into companies' "subscribe" box... only to get back a form letter? If a company cares about keeping a customer, they can spend the minimum amount of effort to use their name in marketing emails. Self-improvement writer Dale Carnegie once said, "Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language." And it's true--it's scientifically proven that people experience "unique brain activity" when they hear their own name. It validates our individuality. Plus, Econsultancy and Adobe report that personalization causes a 14% uptick in sales. The simple fixes Connecting with a customer is about personalization, whether that's addressing them by name or understanding the way they feel about certain marketing techniques. There are so many easy-to-use tools that can help marketers better understand their audience. Clearbit Connect is a useful tool that works inside your Gmail inbox to provide context about the people who email you. It's useful for businesses and individuals to target emails to their specific audience--when someone emails you, Clearbit Connect does the personalization research for you and pulls up their social media accounts, job title, company size, and other workplace information. Appcues tracks the way customers use their apps, so companies know what to market--whether it's information about new features or assistance with ones they're already using. It also sees the consumer relationship as an ongoing process, and uses customer feedback forms. ReadabilityScore.com and other websites help marketers keep their sentences clear, so that nothing is lost in translation. ReadabilityScore also has unique features that analyze the balance between clarity and intelligence in the text. Have a little empathy... Good marketers remember that there's a person behind every inbox.All of these tools help marketers empathize with their customers and cater to their needs. With these easy fixes, we wouldn't have to be irritated every time we opened our inboxes, and email marketers would actually increase the chances of us buying their product.

Historically, freight forwarding has been handled by a mess of paper manifests, emails and spreadsheets, with little transparency, insights or flexibility to change routes on-the-fly. But sometimes the dullest types of work hold the biggest opportunities for startups. Enter Flexport, which just raised a $65 million Series B at a valuation well over $300 million to make freight forwarding programmable. CEO Ryan Petersen calls it “the SeamlessWeb of commerce.” Flexport is both a traditional freight forwarding service that arranges your goods to be transported, and a data provider. You can learn more about its back story, business and kerfuffle with Steve Jobs in our profile of the company, “The unsexiest trillion-dollar startup.” Flexport’s software ingests verified manifest data about what’s being shipped, how much it’s worth and where it’s going. Manufacturers can then use this data to optimize the routes taken by their goods, and make sure they always have enough products in stores. You can’t shop your shipment around to multiple forwarders, but instead Flexport provides deeper visibility into what’s happening to your freight. The promise of using the data value-add to disrupt massive freight forwarding businesses like DHL and Expeditors convinced most of Flexport’s existing investors to double down and fill out this round. Founders Fund, Bloomberg Beta, Felicis Ventures, First Round Capital, Susa Ventures, Yuri Milner and others are all back for this Series B, with the addition of Joe Lonsdale of 8VC. Founders Fund’s Trae Stephens will join the board of Flexport, which has now raised $94 million total since being founded in 2013. “Flexport is where ‘software eats the world’ meets international shipping” says Y Combinator founder and Flexport investor Paul Graham. “Can you imagine what the world would be like if international trade was made easier, the way software has made our work and personal lives easier?” How Flexport works Unlike many of today’s fast-rising startups, Flexport isn’t bleeding cash. “We actually make money on the growth. I think that’s pretty unique here. We have the opportunity to be one of the first really profitable unicorn companies,” Petersen tells me. He has a right to be proud, but also might be kicking himself. The volume of goods shipped by Flexport is up 16X year over year, and the company just crossed $1 billion in merchandise moved this year. Those goods would be worth $2.5 billion at retail, while all of Amazon saw $107 billion in revenue in 2015. Petersen beams, saying “We’re 2% of their size just a few years into our business.” Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen But perhaps if he had waited a few more months to raise the Series B, Flexport would be flying at a much higher valuation. The round came together over the summer, but “we’ve grown revenue 80% in two months,” and racked up $500,000 in August, Petersen says, simultaneously shocked, excited and a bit wistful. Yet he knows this situation is much better than running out of money or not having enough to compete. “I was tired of being cash constrained. We want to go play offense.” Flexport will pour the funding into further international expansion, especially setting up offices to “grease the wheels” with China, from where many of its clients ship. “We really want to invest hard in China. We’re gonna make mistakes there, though they won’t be on the order of what Uber did,” laughs Petersen. Flexport’s Shenzhen office joins those located in Hong Kong, New York, Amsterdam and elsewhere, instead of the startup building one massive headquarters. “The small teams are much more fun to work on and in many ways are more productive. Instead of an office with 1,000 people in it, I’d rather have 10 offices with 100. Everybody knows each other’s names. It leads to less politics.” Petersen says he’s happy to shell out for top-notch video conferencing equipment. The cooperation of these teams has created Flexport’s next big differentiator: the ability to re-route shipments down to individual pallets while they’re en route. “Let’s say you’re a company that sells speakers, and you sell into three different retailers: Target, Best Buy, and Walmart. Right now you need all this inventory in the warehouse so when they buy a pallet, you can send it,” Petersen explains. Now with Flexport’s API, “You can buy a whole container of speakers from China, and from the container in the ocean you can re-route those pallets (to whichever store wants more). Businesses go crazy from this. They can have less inventory in the warehouses, and basically turn those containers into moving warehouses,” Petersen tells us. New board member Trae Stephens says “Flexport’s helping to tackle the problem of bringing the industry to the internet age. The value of full visibility into your supply chain won’t just lead to smarter decisions, it could completely change your business.” Flexport will have to duke it out with startups like Haven trying to pick it apart with specific services, and the wealthy freight forwarding giants eager to clone or out-spend it. Petersen says one of their competitors’ Chief Information Officers keeps calling Flexport’s customers to see what it should be doing better. Another offered a Flexport employee 5X their salary to jump ship, but they stayed loyal. “Why? Because he knew they were going to fail,” says Petersen. “Competitors either ridicule us or take us very seriously, but either way they don’t like us.” In startups as in video games, if the enemies are getting stronger, you’re moving in the right direction. 0 SHARES Featured Stories Nom Launches Redesigned App VIDEO | 3:17 | Apps Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 18 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 21 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 21 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From Startups Telemedicine company Syounika Online snags top prize at TechCrunch Tokyo 4 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps These are the TechCrunch Tokyo 2016 pitch competition winners 6 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps Handshake nabs another $20M to make the job hunt more fair 15 hours ago | John Mannes Zesty, facing stiff competition, replaces its CEO and restructures 17 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next AppLovin is selling a majority stake to Orient Hontai Capital for $1.4B Posted Sep 26, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

The first early in-person voting location in Madison is set open Monday at 7 a.m. The first two locations in Milwaukee are set to open three hours later. Early voting will continue in Madison through Nov. 4 and in Milwaukee through Nov. 5. The election is Nov. 8. Both cities are Democratic strongholds. Early voting in Wisconsin began Sept. 13 in Land O’Lakes in Vilas County. Republican lawmakers had passed laws in 2011 and 2014 limiting the window for early in-person voting to the 10 weekdays before the election. A federal judge in July struck down the limitations in July as part of a broader ruling invalidating a host of GOP-authored election laws.

The Queen is Dead unagidon September 26, 2016 - 8:36am 16 commentsPrint And by Queen, I mean one of the most enduring racist memes in American history, the Welfare Queen.  The Welfare Queen was popularized by Ronald Reagan in a radio broadcast. The Welfare Queen was a real woman who had defrauded hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American welfare system as it was then, when it consisted mostly of direct cash payments to the poor.  There really was a person characterized as "The Welfare Queen" originally in the Chicago Tribune.  But this person was a professional con-artist, kidnapper, bigamist, and possibly a murderer and was not typical of any kind of systematic welfare fraud by Black women or anyone else in the United States. While the term Welfare Queen still appears among the far Right, it is probably most often used against the Right, most recently against Trump and against corporations receiving government subsidies.  Still, the image of the poor either ripping off America or being victimized by the welfare system itself is still a powerful motivating force in conservative politics. The main question seems to be, does welfare help or hurt the poor and the country?  When the question is discussed, the data is often played with in order to skew the results.  It is the case that the United States still spends a huge amount of money on various programs that could be called "welfare".  It is also the case that the classic American welfare program of direct cash payments to the poor that Reagan referred to and that was mostly eliminated by Bill Clinton was probably a failure.  On the other hand, should the lessons of the failure of that program be used to inform current discussions?  Since the question of government aid being misused by either going to the wrong people or not being used in the right way is such a hot button in the current election, perhaps we should look at it a bit.   About five years ago I wrote an article for the blog about my own (inadvertant) experiences working in the context of Bill Clinton's elimination of the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) welfare program.  Had someone asked me at the time whether the elimination was a good idea, I would have said no.  But I found in running a job training program in a volunteer service that several generations of people who had grown up under the program (and who were about to lose it) lacked the most basic work skills needed to find a job in this country.  It wasn't, as I first thought, a matter of them not having any sort of resume or job experience.  I found that almost everyone who entered my program didn't know the basics of work discipline that everyone took for granted.  It was not at all that these people were lazy (and I found jobs for at least a hundred and more).  It was that they didn't know how to dress for a job, come in on time, deal with supervisors, and focus on a task.  While I thought that in my program they would just have to learn specific work skills, I found that I had to teach them "how to work" skills.  Once they learned those, in most cases, they were then able to fairly quickly enter the regular work force.  But the welfare system had created a culture that did not lend itself to people entering regular employment. Insofar as conservatives have pointed to that system leading to a culture of dependency, I think they were correct, at least based on my own experiences.  Whether welfare (or safety nets in general) always lead to a culture of dependency is another question.   Some conservatives like to argue (presumably for its shock value) that about half the population of the United States is receiving welfare in one form or another.  Others argue that while welfare costs are high, not enough of it is going to the right people or places.  When Clinton eliminated the AFDC program, he replaced it with Federal grants to the states, who then allocated welfare funds not so much as direct payments but as "programs" intended to promote employment and stable families.  These programs, along with Food Stamps and Medicaid, are the bulk of what is going on with welfare programs in the United States. In the end, there seems to be three especially controversial issues.  First, while welfare is associated in most people's minds with the unemployed, most people receiving welfare have a job (or are children or disabled people who can't work).  This being the case, the welfare problem may well be mostly a low wage problem.  Second, the highest poverty levels are found in single parent families headed by a mother.  This being the case, some argue that welfare is actually a problem of personal morality (and this is why, especially in the Red States, so much funding goes to programs promoting marriage and two parent families). Third, while there is a general perception that most people receiving welfare are (and always have been) Black, in fact the picture is mixed.  Most people on welfare are White.  But a higher percentage of Blacks relative to the Black population receive aid.  Some argue that this is a problem of racism, but the racism problem seems to be divided between people saying that Black participation in welfare programs is an expression of a general racism in the US that tends to lock them out of the regular job market, while others see welfare programs as themselves keeping Blacks as second hand citizens. My own feeling is that it is all of the above, including the contradictions.  Working poor receiving welfare support are not only paid too little, their wages are being subsidized by the state to the benefit of the corporations (like Walmart) who pay them too little.  And it makes sense that single parent families will be more likely to be in poverty.  But I don't think that this is clearly a moral issue about stable marriage, since most marriages end in divorce anyway and there are many single parent families who are not in poverty.  Two parent families would help create a stronger financial base, but this doesn't mean that the underlying basis for the poverty of many single parent households is the fact that they are run by single parents. Finally, the higher rates of Black poverty fall in line with other statistics that seem to show that there is institutional racism in the United States.  There can be institutional racism, even if with it we see moral issues of Black self-worth.  When I was running the job training program in the hospital, I was sometimes accused of wasting hospital resources trying to train people who were lazy and unemployable.  They were wrong, of course, but it was easy to see how some people might get that impression when first faced with some of the poor that were being introduced into the job training program for the first time and were not trained yet. The poor in the United States, in the richest country on earth, are a scandal to us all.  The reasons they are poor are complex.  We need to address the complexity of the reasons.  But to me it still seems like the reasons are being politicized in ways that make the poor the usual football of the upper classes. But one thing is for sure.  The Welfare Queen is dead.   Print About the Author unagidon is a contributing editor to Commonweal.

Log in or register to post comments Permalink unagidon Contributor September 26, 2016 - 4:15pm There are some people, and as the Boomers begin to get really old there may be more and more of them, who will require some sort of government assistance all of their lives. Other than that, any public aid system should aim to provide temporary help until the recipient can get a job, housing, healthcare and whatever else they need to provide a basic level of life for themselves.  When I ran the job training program, I found that it was the case that much depended upon the desire of the person to escape poverty. But not everything. Segregation created housing problems for people and there was the additional problem of an adult getting a decent place to live because they had either no credit history to begin with or they had been victimized by one of the high interest low quality (but entirely legal) scam artists that inhabit the world of the poor. The schools were terrible and unsafe.  No one was usually able to afford to buy a set of work clothes. Medicaid at the time that Clinton was taking apart the old welfare system and handing it entirely to the tender mercies of the states, was pushing almost everyone out except pregnant mothers, children, and the disabled. Most people had never had any dental care. In short, all of the things that the non-poor take for granted as a foundation from which to rise were mostly missing.  On what we might call the receiving end of the poor, the job market, wages were generally low. The poor were unskilled and lacked the resources to become skilled. Even if they got the skills, they didn't have the experience. They had no resumes. I believe as well that employers who might use these kinds of workers know that they can get them and keep them at low wages and that even if social norms develop that require the poor to have more food, medical care, and perhaps housing subsidies, the employers could count on the state (i.e. the rest of us) to pay for it. So in my experience, while the truly tough and motivated can (sometimes) crawl their way out, it is simply not the case that there is a world out there waiting to reward them for diligence and hard work.  Our cynical political system, and I refer to all political parties including the minor ones, know this. Trump has cut out the poor whites who want the world changed (back) so they have a chance, and he tells them a fairy tale about Chinese and Mexicans. Clinton cuts out everyone else and tells them the same crap that they have been hearing since before Reagan revved up the destruction of the labor movement. The Greens and Libertarians are living in outer space.  Log in or register to post comments Permalink unagidon Contributor September 26, 2016 - 4:23pm Well yes, Jim, THOSE welfare queens are thriving. But I think, except for the congenital racists, the Welfare Queen that meant for many privileged millions (who were proud of the fact that they were prudent and wise enough to choose the right parents, class, and race to be born into) the original picture of the Welfare Queen as the fat Black woman tossing spent lobster tails out of the window of her brand new Cadillac is dead.  Log in or register to post comments Permalink Tom Blackburn Subscriber September 26, 2016 - 4:52pm The welfare queen makes an interesting appearance in Matthew Desmond's very excellent and provocative book, Evicted, about people in moving in and getting kicked out of rental housing in Milwaukee (Crown, 2016). One of Desmond's folks, who has been in and out of rental properties with her kids -- and on the street part of the time when she was out -- gets an apartment and a disability check at the same time. She goes out and blows the check on lobster and crab claws for herself and her children, nowing it means short rations the rest of the month. She figures it's time for celebration.. I imagine that someone who saw her at the checkout counter would call Charlie Sykes, Milwaukee's resident conservative radio shouter. But readers who followed the woman's stories through the months with Desmond will understand. In her story, and so many others, the father of those children is not present. This is not a poverty problem only. Unless she has an abortion, the mother of the child of a deeply mourned athlete will soon be a single mother, too bad they weren't married. But if the father is voluntarily elsewhere or doing time in prison, the mother's ability to hold a job is dependent on the health and wellness of the children. Which is what gets single mothers fired or evicted so often.

Do you think the Right has ever talked about all those White people cheating on welfare?  The meme has been racist to the core since the Gipper rolled it out to the nation.   As for Walmart, corporations of all sorts pass on costs to the public whenever they possibly can. It's part of the system. And Walmart employees are vastly subsidized by the public purse. Now do you think that all of this welfare they are getting is some kind of extra frill they are taking on top of their ample Walmart salaries?  Or do you think that Walmart pays them less because they know they'll be subsidized? Regarding single mother families, are you telling me that all single mother families are below the poverty line? Log in or register to post comments Permalink unagidon Contributor September 26, 2016 - 5:59pm Mark P, I'm not going to argue with you about whether Welfare Queen has meant nothing more or less than Black Female Welfare Cheat for the last forty years. If you can't see it, you've led a very sheltered life.  Your remark about Walmart doesn't make any sense. That's why I tried to translate it. Try to write more plainly and stop trying to imitate William F Buckley. You can't carry it off.  You remark that THE basis for poverty in a single parent family is being a single parent. You can't support that it is THE basis; not if you bothered to read the links. Go back and try again.  Log in or register to post comments Permalink Jim Pauwels September 26, 2016 - 6:51pm When I taught in a program geared toward providing marketable skills to Chicago Public School graduates back in the 1980s, my experience was identical to unagidon's: we quickly learned that we needed to provide training, not only on the technical skills, but also job-application and basic workplace comportment skills. In my own extremely modest ministerial experience in working with people in need, I've found that out-and-out fraudsters do exist but they're pretty rare.  To the best of my knowledge, I haven't run across any who have succeeded to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars! (Although it's possible I'm among those getting bamboozled, I guess).  More common is that some, a few, are better than average liars and may succeed in getting (very) marginally more than their fellow pleader for a few dollars' worth of aid. But by and large, the folks I deal with just want to stay alive and figure out how to bring a little stability, peace and prosperity into their lives.  In most cases, they're dealing with the realities of mental illness, physical maladies, debt, bad choices, criminal backgrounds, and the like.  Very, very few people choose to be poor.   Log in or register to post comments Permalink unagidon Contributor September 26, 2016 - 7:27pm I will leave the meaning of the term Welfare Queen to the readers.  Walmart workers, making so little money, pay little or no taxes. So they themselves are not paying the taxes that pay for the assistance they get. Are you saying that they do? As for the basis of poverty in single parent households, you yourself use the word THE.  There are other words that you could use. But that's your point anyway.

"Welfare Queen" has always been a racist term. I remember knowing even as a kid, that when "they" were talking about "Welfare Queens", it was implicit that they meant unemployed black single women with multiple children by different fathers. I am too tired to follow your Walmart discussion. Finally, unfortunately, I'm a single mom. But I'm not impoverished. I make a good living as a physician. Obviously being a single mother is not the only thing that causes poverty. But it is hard being a single parent, even if you have an MD after your name. It sure helps to have two parents.

Log in or register to post comments Permalink Leo Sprietsma Subscriber September 27, 2016 - 7:30pm The "WELFARE QUEEN' seems to have metamorphsized into the "welfare King". Avoiding taxes is "smart". Taking advantage of bankruptcy laws is just "clever business". If I can make a payoff for fraud and not paying wages without admitting guilt, then there was no guilt. If the rich do it, then it must be admirable.

Log in or register to post comments Permalink Jean Hughes Raber October 2, 2016 - 2:15pm No one has yet suggested that it might be the chaos and day-to-day stress of poverty and its many causes, not welfare, that makes poor families on assistance, after a generation or two, unable to make a smooth transition to work. So let me offer that idea. In families in which there is substance abuse, there is more likely to be poverty, which creates such economic and psychological disruption and instability among children, that efforts to get them working or finishing school is even more difficult.  Moreover, even if you can "cure" addicts, they often continue to create and thrive on chaos and drama ("dry drunks"), which affect their ability to get along with others and hold a job. Throw in the mental health issues that often underpin addiction, and the picture is even more complicated. While I agree with ideas like promoting two-parent families and work readiness programs, the "cycle of poverty" is not just a lack of money, but includes many other, complicated factors.

By MariaLaMagna Reporter When banks make headlines for taking advantage of consumers, it can be tough to know who to trust. About a quarter of consumers said they have “very little” confidence in banks, or no confidence at all, according to a 2015 poll by the analytics company Gallup; roughly 45% said they have “some” confidence. “A lot of people don’t trust banks, and they don’t trust banks for good reasons,” said Keith Weigelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business who also teaches financial literacy to Philadelphia-area consumers at his program, Building Bridges to Wealth. “Banks don’t really look out for them as consumers.” So what if you decide not to use a bank or credit union at all? That may cost you money, too. About 9.6 million, or nearly 8%, of households in the U.S. don’t have any type of banking account at an insured institution, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Those most likely to be “unbanked” (the term for those who don’t use these accounts) were non-Asian minority families, lower-income households, younger households and unemployed households, according to the FDIC. About 58% of those who are unbanked said a reason was they didn’t have enough money to keep in an account, or meet a minimum balance; 34% said they dislike or distrust banks and about 31% said one reason was their concerns about high or unpredictable account fees. In particular, consumers seem to be worried about banks’ high overdraft fees. When Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit organization based in Philadelphia, interviewed almost 600 people in 2015, of those who are unbanked, 72% said they turned to an alternative, prepaid cards, instead of traditional banking services because they were trying to avoid overdraft fees. (Banks made about $11.2 billion in fees from consumers’ overdraft and non-sufficient fund penalties in 2015, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.) The electric workout: Can you be shocked into shape?(2:34) It’s a workout said to be 150 times more intense than an average session in the gym, and it's used by some of the world’s top athletes. The shocking secret? Electricity. In recent years, some banks have even removed branches from low-income areas, meaning low-income families would have to travel to visit a branch in person, found Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of Georgia who wrote the book “How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation, and the Threat to Democracy.” “There is sometimes a class barrier, where people don’t feel comfortable in banks, or a language barrier,” she said. And when banks leave a low-income area, they leave a void that businesses like check-cashing services fill, “There’s a sense that ‘Nobody wants my money,’ which is what a lot of poor people think, and why they end up saving money under their mattress,” she said. Plus, some consumers can no longer use banks, if they have been blacklisted from them, because of previously bouncing a check, or closing an account and owing the bank money, Weigelt said. Why not using a bank can cost more Sometimes, those who don’t use banking accounts turn to costly alternatives, according to a recent analysis by the personal-finance company NerdWallet. In his work, Weigelt said, even when consumers know banking alternatives charge fees, that can still seem preferable to banks, where some consumers feel fees are “disguised.” Those who don’t banks or credit unions may have to visit a check-cashing service to cash a check, and those businesses charge fees. (Wal-Mart offers check cashing, but charges $3 for checks up to $1,000 and $6 for larger checks). Another alternative is prepaid debit cards, which employers can use for direct deposit. But people who use those cards pay an average of $196.50 in annual fees, NerdWallet found. For prepaid cards that don’t use direct deposit, that number is even higher — $488.89 a year. Fees on prepaid cards vary, said Devan Goldstein, a banking expert at NerdWallet, but many prepaid cards charge for ATM withdrawals, monthly fees or per-transaction costs. It also costs money to purchase a card, and some cards charge a fee when consumers reload them. (Still, as research from Pew Charitable Trusts has shown, using a prepaid card can be better than getting into trouble with overdraft fees, which could amount to much more.) Beyond these types of fees on prepaid cards, not using a bank can hurt consumers in other ways, NerdWallet found. Many banks offer services that unbanked consumers are missing out on, including savings accounts, certificates of deposit and secured credit cards, elements of financial health that can help consumers build better credit. And because banks offer conveniences such as automatic bill pay and money-transfer services, not using them can also cost consumers in time. Alternatives to prepaid cards For consumers who may be turned down from opening bank accounts because of their past financial behavior, NerdWallet recommends second-chance checking accounts. They are available to people who are on the banks’ “blacklist,” listed in ChexSystems, a consumer reporting agency. It’s also possible to build credit by using a secured credit card, which are similar to debit cards, but they allow those who use them to build credit. They require the user to pay a security deposit up front; in return, the user will be allowed to spend up to that limit, while building up his or her credit score. Credit unions, which are not-for-profit and often devoted to community development can be another good option, Weigelt said; however, many credit unions don’t have a large network of branches, so it may be difficult to physically visit a branch in some communities. NerdWallet has a list of the country’s best credit unions, that consumers can use to compare their options. There are even some banks, Baradaran said, that are specifically trying to offer a better experience to people who are minorities; OneUnited Bank, for example, which has offices in Los Angeles, Boston and Miami and is also available online, is specifically devoted to supporting black consumers and businesses. NerdWallet also offers a list of low-cost checking accounts, for those who aren’t opposed to using banks. There are also online banks that have positioned themselves as alternatives to traditional banks; the financial firm Aspiration, in a partnership with Boston-based Radius Bank, offers checking accounts that require just a $10 opening deposit and doesn’t charge any ATM fees or monthly service fees. (However, it does charge an overdraft fee of $25, including a $5 daily overdraft fee for accounts that remain in the negative). Aspiration donates 10% of its revenues to charities. Aspiration doesn’t have its own ATMs; the company doesn’t charge if customers withdraw money from a select list of ATMs, and if they go to an ATM off that list, they are reimbursed in full. Because so many consumers now have mobile phones and internet access, they can be more selective about where they bank and include online-only banking options, Baradaran said. (Although as Weigelt pointed out, that may not be a tempting option to people with little internet access, or older people who are uncomfortable using apps and websites.) It’s important to shop around to find the best account to open, Weigelt said. That sometimes isn’t a process consumers go through first, but everyone should ideally “do a price comparison to get the best deal.” If consumers are able to find a low-cost banking option, that is likely a better choice than doing banking “a la carte,” Baradaran said.

Spurred by a Des Moines water agency’s lawsuit that blames upstream counties for polluted drinking water, there are several ideas for improving Iowa’s streams and lakes, however Gov. Terry Branstad has rejected two of the most prominent suggestions. Although the lack of action is frustrating, it reflects the complexity of the problem and possible solutions, said Diane Rosenberg, who heads Jefferson County Farmers & Neighbors, one of 20 groups that have joined a coalition seeking a statewide moratorium on new and expanded livestock confinement operations. “We need to look at who should be paying for our water cleanup,” she said. “There are a lot of people who argue where that responsibility falls.” The powerful Iowa Farm Bureau also has weighed in on the issue, passing a resolution earlier this month that supported using new and existing state revenue to pay for water quality improvements. Separately, Iowa’s Water and Land Legacy — a coalition of agriculture, business and conservation groups including the Iowa Soybean Association — called for raising the state’s sales tax by three-eighths of a penny for water quality and other natural resources programs. Their push follows failed efforts in the Legislature to add money to a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund created in 2010 but which still has no funding. Apart from the state efforts, last month, a national group called the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative announced its plans to add sustainable farming practices in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska and to reduce excessive nutrients from the waters that enter the Mississippi River. The group’s founding members include Monsanto, PepsiCo and Wal-Mart. Branstad’s spokesman, Ben Hammes, said in an email the governor continues to believe long-term funding for water quality initiatives can be found “without raising taxes on Iowa taxpayers.” Branstad also rejected calls for the confinement moratorium, proposed by the Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture, calling it an “extreme proposal that would harm agriculture and our economy in Iowa.” Kirk Leeds, CEO of the Iowa Soybean Association, noted his organization supported the governor’s failed proposal last session to redirect some education infrastructure money toward water improvements. Leeds said the association is open to such discussions, but he doubts lawmakers would agree to use existing state dollars instead of generating new funding. “You pit people against each other,” he said. “Are you going to reduce school funding? Are we going to reduce support for medical services? Where’s those dollars going to come from? And that’s where many of us have come to the conclusion that if we’re really serious about finding a long-term dedicated funding stream ... that’s why the three-eighths cent sales tax makes sense.” Rosenberg said members of the Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture weren’t surprised by Branstad’s reaction to the group’s proposed moratorium on confinements, which they blame for polluting waterways and creating health problems for nearby residents. By publicizing the proposal, however, the group hopes to ensure water quality becomes an issue in the 2018 gubernatorial election. “We don’t have any anticipation that Gov. Branstad will be supportive of this moratorium, but that doesn’t mean that others down the road won’t be open,” she said. Although Branstad’s plan last session to redirect some education infrastructure money toward water quality was rejected by lawmakers from both parties, he has begun promoting a revamped version. Branstad also still supports legislation passed in the Republican-controlled House that would use existing state dollars for water quality. It did not advance in the Democratic-majority Senate over objections to using money from the state general fund. Neither House Republicans nor Senate Democrats, who control those chambers, have endorsed a specific water quality plan for the next session. A key motivation to the water quality debate has been a pending lawsuit by Des Moines Water Works, which supplies drinking water to 500,000 central Iowa residents. The utility, which has joined the Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture, has challenged whether agriculture drainage districts have immunity from lawsuits and whether monetary damages can be sought. The Iowa Supreme Court is now reviewing the case. Des Moines Water Works CEO Bill Stowe called the lawsuit a catalyst for broader discussions on water quality in the Legislature. He is still considering what legislation to back during the session but expressed confidence the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit “will continue to keep the discussion going at the General Assembly level.” Previous Page|1|2|Next Page More News Is it a cold or the flu?Nov. 17, 2016 - 10:50 am No one injured when freight train derailsNov. 17, 2016 - 10:47 am Worker rescued from 230 feet up inside industrial chimneyNov. 17, 2016 - 10:47 am Republicans choose same top leaders to run Iowa HouseNov. 17, 2016 - 10:46 am West Des Moines to settle discrimination lawsuit for $1.9MNov. 17, 2016 - 10:46 am Man pleads guilty to role in Iowa slayingNov. 17, 2016 - 10:47 am Comments Local Business Guide Featured Businesses Loading...

I’m not totally sure how I can describe my mom’s hair without offending anyone, namely her, but it’s not exactly the object of envy: It’s naturally frizzy and unmanageable, but because it’s thick, she can douse her hair in leave-in-conditioner and walk out the door with perfect hair, and her coworkers are none the wiser. I followed suit, spritzing Pantene’s original leave-in formula all over my head just like she does, and I ended up looking like a wet dog. If only the slicked-back look was in then.

How the once-traditional theatre chain is diversifying its business. By Jennifer Horn September 26, 2016 It’s that time again. We’re rolling out our 2016 Brands of the Year, so make sure to check back during this week as we take a look at the brands that had a big impact on Canada this year. This article appears in the October 2016 issue of strategy. Gastronomes, for the most part, do not plan their Friday night meals around the multiplex. But behind the four walls of the Rec Room, a new entertainment space owned and operated by Canada’s largest exhibition chain, you’ll be able to order more than just Nibs and Twix Bites. There, you’ll find wine on tap, and a menu boasting edibles like Applewood smoked bacon maple jam with double-cream brie, and steak frites marinated in a béarnaise and cabernet wine sauce. The 56,000-square-foot Rec Room in Alberta is similar to the Dave & Buster’s franchise, where adults can be kids again in a merrymaking space stocked with games. It is, however, decidedly more ambitious: there are plans for bowling, ping-pong, bocce ball, axe throwing, billiards, an auditorium for concerts and live shows, in addition to the staple arcade arena. It’s also upscale, and not what you would expect from a traditional film exhibition company. But that’s because Cineplex, the architect behind the midway-come-casual dining space, is very much untraditional, and it’s proving to be about more than just blockbusters and 66- foot screens. Recently, the brand has been responding to an evolving market. There’s competition from watch-at-home upstarts like Netflix, and concern about its primary business. “[Cineplex] is beholden to the release schedule and the content that comes out,” says Peter Furnish, Cineplex’s VP of marketing. “We’re seeing a bigger percentage of the box offi ce going to a smaller percentage of the movies – they’re going to the big superhero movies, the sequels. But how long can these franchises keep going? I think the company recognizes that, [which is also] leading to the diversifi cation of the business.” That diversification is taking the form of new verticals, from food to media to gaming, while expanding the exhibition side (with luxury formats like VIP intheatre dining) as a way to gain a bigger share in entertainment as a whole, not just the talkies. The Canadian company, whose history dates back nearly 100 years, is today a conglomerate of dozens of businesses and a healthy balance sheet, recording $1.4 billion in total revenue for 2015 (an 11% increase vs. the previous year). It currently owns more than 80% of the theatrical market, with that side of its business spanning exhibition (163 theatres with 1,667 screens), food service (Outtakes, Poptopia, Yoyos Yogurt Cafe, among others), alternative programming (broadcasting live shows and events, like Raptors games and the MET Opera), and the online sale of films. But beyond its near-monopoly of Canadian cinema, Cineplex also has its hands in the amusement gaming and leisure market. The aforementioned Rec Room, designed with the help of Cundari, will see two more locations open in 2017, with a goal of 15 venues in the next five years. It also acquired (in late 2015) the remaining 50% equity in Cineplex Starburst, a distributor and operator of arcade games, supplying games to its Xscape amusement areas (which sit in 162 of its theatres), as well as other amusement players like Canada’s Wonderland and Disney World. And more recently, the company staked a claim in the eSports market (an online gaming industry expected to bring in global revenues of $1 billion by 2017) by purchasing 80% of U.S.- based World Gaming Network (WGN) last year. Shortly after, it partnered with Sony to launch the Cineplex WorldGaming Canadian Tournament. The four-part competition brought gamers together and inside Cineplex cinemas earlier this year to liveplay Sony’s Call of Duty: Black Ops III in front of an audience of avid gamers, family and friends. To bring players’ attention to what was happening at its cinemas, the brand partnered with the WGN and EB Games to plug the tournament. It also made sure to be right where the live-streaming action happens, buying ad space on Twitch.tv. The prize for the gaming champion after rounds of regional and national fi nals: a cheque for $20,000. For Cineplex: the chance to invite a new kind of guest to its cinemas to not only sit, but stay a while, too. That’s the point of this investment exercise, says Furnish. Diversifying its portfolio means attracting a new, sometimes niche, mostly younger audience (although, not as young as Furnish initially expected with the eGaming events; attendees were more in the millennial age demo). The strategy is to give them a reason to come back to the brand by signing them up to Scene — the glue that holds all of the company’s properties together — to find out about more gaming events, for example, and, of course, other Cineplex offerings. The same applies to its alternative programming, which brings in new audiences, from seniors to those with disabilities, to engage with and build brand loyalty. The idea, says Furnish, is to build capacity on the cinema side during off-peak hours, and continue engagement through their Scene membership. It does this by airing events like the encore presentation of the National Theatre Live shows from London early on weekend mornings and on weekdays. It also airs sporting events, like Wimbledon in 3D, and screenings of TV series, like last season’s Game of Thrones finale. And then there are special events like the “Sensory Friendly Screenings” in partnership with Autism Speaks Canada, for families and individuals living with autism to enjoy movies in a relaxed environment (lights turned up and sound turned down low). It’s all about creating new occasions for people to visit its theatres, other than to just see the top box office films. Once it has a guest in its box, the plan is to keep them there, says Furnish. “The [cinema] experience 20 years ago was so highly optimized. It was go up the escalator, get in, and leave. Literally. The exits were the alleyways out back,” he says. “Now, we’re discussing how to get you here earlier, how to get you to stay, and do other things in the box.” Timeplay — an in-theatre pre-show app that turns a person’s mobile phone into a remote control to engage with content on the screen — was one idea that came up in those discussions. Today, the app is used in 733 screens across Canada, and brands such as Mazda, Koodo and Pizza Pizza have worked with Cineplex to create gaming content. Timeplay gets 90,000 moviegoer plays per week, with the company tracking more than 1.5 million users since launch. When users were asked in the TimePlay Impact Research study if they would play again, 93% of them agreed. Timeplay is part of Cineplex Media, which includes other in-theatre engagement tools such as Cineplex Magazine and Interactive Media Zones (IMZ). The IMZ brands are made up of touch screens with Kinect cameras (for gesture and skeletel tracking) and feature branded content, sitting in and around the theatre entrance to provide “experiences” outside of the theatre box. With Cineplex growing its business portfolio, and exploring new verticals, Furnish and his team needed a way to better articulate the brand’s architecture. Before he arrived at the company, there really wasn’t an overall brand positioning or messaging. It also didn’t have a clear purpose, he says. “We did a great job at talking about ‘what’ we offer – great seats, great food, giant screens and sound. It was all really functional in its messaging,” explains Furnish. “But there was never really ‘Why’ we do it.” So the marketing team approached Zulu Alpha Kilo to help map it out. Having “dated” Cineplex for about a year (as president Mike Sutton puts it, describing how his shop did sporadic project work with the company before taking on the masterbrand assignment), Zulu came on board to help the brand define what it stands for. “We found that we were perceived [by consumers] very functionally, like a Costco or a Walmart,” says Furnish. There was a lot of respect for the brand. They would say things such as “I like you, but I don’t really love you,” and they would agree that “you’re big, you deliver on the experience, you’re highly optimized” but that didn’t necessarily drive loyalty, he says. The company needed to get people to not just “buy us, but buy into us.” The idea the team landed on was to encourage people to “prioritize pleasure” and to “See the Big Picture,” which became a pervasive tagline in Cineplex’s advertising after its introduction late last year. It took one year of research and strategizing to come up with the company’s more unified positioning, and another year to create its fi rst piece of emotional marketing, which was shown on Cineplex screens over the 2015 holidays. “Lily & the Snowman” was a short film that encouraged people to “make time for what you love” by showing the tear-inducing story of a young girl and her life-long journey with a friendly backyard snowman. The spot became a viral success, with more than 9.6 million YouTube views (of which eight million were tracked in the first month alone). In addition, three “making of” videos were viewed more than 300,000 times, while Facebook views of the original Lily video currently sit at 11.5 million. “We did some brand equity testing prior to the campaign to establish a benchmark for the emotional connectors related to the brand,” says Furnish, adding that the team saw positive movement on these indicators post-campaign. “In my experience, any type of movement tends to take some time, so this was great news.” They’ll continue to do the same kind of tracking for future campaigns, he says. “Any brand has functional attributes… but there’s also the intangible, the idea that a brand wants to be loved,” says Sutton. “And I think, with Cineplex, all of the positive attributes end up going to the actual movie. If you had a great experience at the theatre, people will talk about how the movie was great, and Cineplex, to a degree, is left out of the accolade. If there’s something negative, like the movie wasn’t great, the brand wears that.” The Lily video was meant to create both fertile ground for Cineplex’s new strategy, says Sutton, as well as to “tell a story that’s also linked to what Cineplex does and to create an emotional affinity for the brand instead of just the films that play on the screen.” Today, it continues to build on that connection through brief executions and experiences like the summer’s #WeatherOrNot stunt, where it gave away towels to beach-goers that looked like movie tickets, redeemable in cinemas. It also recently placed a giant popcorn bag in the middle of a Windsor, Ont. field where lightning frequently strikes. Inside the bag, a lightning rod and popcorn kernels were placed with the hopes that nature would do its work. While these smaller, seasonal events help drive consideration for the brand, Furnish says they’re also looking at content, like “Lily & the Snowman,” to continue building on the brand’s positioning around prioritizing pleasure. The brand will also continue to “see the big picture” by diversifying its offerings beyond exhibition, he says.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Small Cap Stock Employing Successful Distribution Business Model Small Cap Stock Employing Successful Distribution Business Model Posted on September 26, 2016 by Tamarack Advisors in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer KALISPELL, MT / ACCESSWIRE / September 26, 2016 / We are all familiar with brand names such as Guinness Beer, Crown Royal Whiskey, or Captain Morgan’s Rum, and while we think of these brands as individual companies, that is not the case. If you were to attempt to invest in Guinness for example, you would find out that they are now a part of Diaego (NYSE: DEO), a company formed from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1997. Diaego is using a tried-and-tested idea by employing the distribution business model. The idea is simple; if a store owner needs to stock his shelves with beer and liquor, would they rather contact 20 different vendors, have 20 contracts, 20 deliveries, etc., or would they rather have a one-stop distributor that can handle all their needs? Diaego, with their incredible size and buying power, is able to serve these needs while still maintaining consistent 60% gross margins. The same distribution model is employed by The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), as Odwalla juices, Dasani water, Minute Maid orange juice, and many more brands are all owned and distributed through the same channels. Ever heard of Constellation Brands Inc. (NYSE: STZ)? Next time you have a cold Corona or Modelo in your hand, you may want to; this $32 billion market cap company brings them to you. Looking deeper, you find this business model across a wide variety of industries; Altria Group (NYSE: MO) in tobacco, Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR) in audio and visual products, and Luxottica Group SpA (NYSE: LUX) in prescription frames and sunglasses. Changing the Negative Perception of E-Cigarettes: Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enacted a ban on the sale of E-cigarette products to minors citing a survey that showed between 2011 and 2015, E-cigarette use rose from 1.5% to 16% usage among high school students, resulting in 3 million individuals under the age of 18 having vaped in 2015. This news has gained the majority of the headlines, but it fails to see the upside advantages that E-cigarettes can provide to the millions of combustible cigarette smokers that are already hooked. The FDA sees the two products as one and the same, however, this is unfortunate because more and more studies are showing vaping to be safer, including this one done by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) which says E-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking combustible cigarettes. The RCP were years ahead of the US in declaring that combustible tobacco use was harmful. In 1962 they published a report linking smoking to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic bronchitis. In the current report, the RCP goes on to say, “Large-scale substitution of e-cigarettes, or other non-tobacco nicotine products, for tobacco smoking has the potential to prevent almost all the harm from smoking in society.” Continuing, “Promoting e-cigarettes&#8230;and other non-tobacco nicotine products as widely as possible, as a substitute for smoking, is therefore likely to generate significant health gains in the UK.” “E-cigarette vapour contains a far less extensive range of toxins, and those present are typically at much lower levels, than in tobacco smoke,” the report notes.” In normal conditions of use, toxin levels in inhaled e-cigarette vapour are probably well below prescribed threshold limit values for occupational exposure, in which case significant long-term harm is unlikely. Some harm from sustained exposure to low levels of toxins over many years may yet emerge, but the magnitude of these risks relative to those of sustained tobacco smoking is likely to be small&#8230;.Although it is not possible to quantify the long-term health risks associated with e-cigarettes precisely, the available data suggest that they are unlikely to exceed 5% of those associated with smoked tobacco products, and may well be substantially lower than this figure.” Physicians in the United States are echoing this sentiment with a survey released just last month. The survey, in which 560 physicians participated, showed that over 70% of the 560 doctors indicated that E-cigs could help patients reduce or eliminate smoking. Small Cap Investing: “If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50 percent a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that. The universe I can’t play in has become more attractive than the universe I can play in. I have to look for elephants. It may be that the elephants are not as attractive as the mosquitoes. But that is the universe I must live in.” – Warren Buffett, discussing the advantages of small-cap stocks Many of the most successful companies in the world started out as small caps. Legends have been made of the early investors in Coca-Cola. Pennies turned into fortunes; Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) started out as small caps. Small cap stocks do provide for a higher level of risk, but when the correct combination of a good idea, a proven business model, and high margins come to fruition, it can be rewarding. In fact, looking at historical 80-year returns in the markets; large cap stocks have returned 9.26% annually, while small caps have had an astonishing 15.9% annual rate of return in that same time frame. The Ibbotson study, which looked at the U.S. markets over 70 years, found that small caps outperformed their larger peers 79% of the time over a 15-year period, and 95% of the time over a 20-year period. A Closer Look at Gilla, Inc. (GLLA): Recently, an explosive new player in the E-cigarette industry has come onto the scene: Gilla Inc. (OTCQB: GLLA). The company manufactures and distributes generic and premium E-liquid brands, using the same business model as Diaego and Coca-Cola. Based in the United States, the company has corporate offices in Toronto, Newport Beach and Budapest, while maintaining a manufacturing facility in Daytona Beach, Florida. Offering 14 separate brands in 25 countries, Gilla and their team continue to execute on their long-term goals by regularly signing distribution deals, including new ones in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and China just this year. The company was also working to get ahead of their peers by introducing a whole new series of products before the August deadline by the FDA, which limits the introduction of new products without prior FDA approval. Gilla was able to do this in part because they own their laboratory and production facilities, an integral part of their 62% gross margins last quarter. In an August interview done by CEOLIVE.TV, Graham Simmonds, chairman and CEO of Gilla, talks extensively about the future of the company, their plans on expansion and where they see the global E-cigarette market going in the next decade. It is an eye-opening interview from an already successful public company executive; one that shows the true global potential of an industry that is growing at 24% CAGR.

Conclusion: The distribution business model is clearly an effective one, especially if a company is able to be the manufacturer of their own products. Cutting out a middleman in most instances can typically increase margins by up to 20%. In an ever-competitive world, this is often the difference between being profitable and not. This is true of large cap stocks as well as small cap stocks, but the above-mentioned historical averages prove that the potential for larger gains do exist within the small cap space. As long as investors do their own due diligence and rely on solid financial reporting, many gems can be found with a market cap under $100 million.

Bottom row (left to right): Roku Premiere, Premiere+, and Ultra Roku has launched a revamped and partially renamed streaming video device lineup as the OTT specialist gears up for the all-important buying season and a competitive field that includes rivals such as Apple, Amazon and Google.   Looking to appeal to different consumer segements, the new lineup factors in a range of pricing and capabilities that aim to run the gamut, including entry-level devices to models that support 4K and HDR and other bells and whistles.   -Roku Express: About 75% smaller while doubling the processing power of the product it’s replacing, this one for TVs with HDMI connectors fetches $29.99, supports 1080p video, WiFi (802.11b/g/n), support for Roku’s mobile app, and an IR remote. Notably, Roku is now providing its private listening feature (integrated with the remote control) across its product line.   -Roku Express+: This $39.99 version includes composite connectors for older TVs.   -Roku Streaming Stick: Of the group, this model is the same one that Roku introduced in April 2016. And the price remains unchanged, at $49.99.   -Roku Premiere: Supports 4K, plus an IR-based remote, and costs $79.99. It’s about 40% smaller than the 4K-capable Roku 4 that was introduced last fall, and includes a new quad-core processor, 802.11ac dual-band WiFi with MIMO, and removes the fan that was part of the Roku 4. The device also supplies access to Roku’s 4K spotlight channel.   -Roku Premiere+: Includes the features of Premiere, but adds support for HDR, RF-based remote with a headphone jack, a microSD card slot for added storage, and Ethernet for wired connectivity. Sells for $99.99.   -Roku Ultra: At $129, it represents the fully-loaded option of Roku’s lot, tacking on a voice-capable remote, headphone jack, and gaming buttons, audio optical out port (to connect to a receiver or soundbar), USB port for local media playback, and a lost remote finder feature.   All of Roku’s new 4K-capable players also feature a dynamic, night listening mode that will dampen the sounds of loud noises.   The new Roku Express, Premiere, Premiere+ and Ultra streaming players will be available for pre-order beginning today from Roku, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon and other retailers, and are expected to be in stores by Oct. 9. The Roku Express+ will be available exclusively at Walmart, Roku said.   Roku’s players complement integrated Roku TVs from makers such as Hisense, TCL, Sharp, Haier, Insignia (Best Buy), and Hitachi.   About 4 billion hours of content was streamed on Roku devices in the first half of 2016, versus 5.5 billion hours for all of 2015, said Lloyd Klarke, Roku’s director of product management. “It’s a monumental time for television,” said.   Roku is privately held, but has said the company pulled in $300 million in revenues in 2015, a figure that includes player sales, licensing and advertising. Roku has about 10.6 million active accounts, meaning that they have done some streaming in the last 30 days.   Roku is also nearing the launch of an Xfinity TV app that support’s Comcast’s pay TV platform.   According to Parks Associates, Roku was the top-selling streaming media player in 2015, accounting for 30% of units purchased.

The Los Gatos, California-based company has effectively replaced all of its media streaming boxes with new hardware; its streaming video stick, announced earlier this year, remains the same. The new Roku Express box replaces the Roku 1 with a much smaller form factor (75 percent smaller) and double the processing power of the original box. It streams HD video, not 4K like the top-of-the-line Rokus do, but it also costs just $30, making it the most affordable Roku. There's also a version of the Express box that comes with composite cables, for an additional $10. The mid-tier Premiere and Premiere+ Rokus replace the Roku 2 and Roku 3 boxes, respectively. The Roku Premiere will retail for $80 and supports 4K video at 60 frames per second (which helps smooth out the video when you're actually watching 4K video). It has a quad-core processor and comes with Roku's standard IR remote. The $100 Roku Premiere+ adds HDR support to the mix, along with an enhanced remote that includes Roku's "private listening" feature, aka a headphone jack. And the Premiere+ box itself has an Ethernet port and a microSD card slot. The new Roku boxes range in price from $30 to $130; the top model supports 4K and HDR Finally there's the Roku Ultra, which replaces the Roku 4, though the new pancake-style box looks quite similar to last year's box. This $130 streaming media player has many of the same features as the Premiere+ — it will stream both 4K and HDR video — but includes an even more advanced remote and a USB port on the box, allowing owners to plug in a thumb drive with their own media. The Ultra's remote is the only one that comes with the "Find My Remote" function, as well as A/B gaming buttons. The top three boxes — Premiere, Premiere+, and Ultra — all come with a "night listening" mode that compresses the audio levels of the video you're watching, so that loud music or harsh explosive sounds will more closely match the dialogue levels of the programming. And the search software on Roku has also been improved, to make it a little bit easier to find all of the stuff you could possibly want to watch out of more than — wait for it — the 3,500 channels the Roku currently has. All of this new hardware will ship sometime in October. The boxes will be sold through Roku's own site and other retail partners, with the exception of the Roku Express+, which will only be sold at Walmart. In terms of Roku's competition in "OTT" devices, it's hard to know exactly who is winning the streaming video game right now, especially when companies like Amazon don't release unit sales numbers and Apple puts out its Apple TV numbers intermittently. Data from NPD earlier this year suggest that game consoles are dominating the streaming market, with boxes like Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV close behind. However at least two research firms have reported that Roku is leading the race in the OTT market: Parks Associates said earlier this year that Roku accounted for 30 percent of streaming media players purchased in the US from the first quarter of 2015 to the same quarter this year; while comScore recently reported that Roku has 49 percent of household market share, with Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Google's Chromecast making up the share of the rest. Correction: A previous version of this article said that "night listening" mode would be available on all Rokus through a software update. This feature is only available on Roku Premiere, Premiere+, and Ultra. The article has been updated to reflect this.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Xiaomi Mi Box spotted in Walmart this early, could be an employee mistake By R Padla - September 26, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Xiaomi Mi Box Android TV is expected to launch this coming October in the United States. We have no doubts about its arrival in the country but we’re not sure when exactly or for how much. We’ve been looking forward to that set-top-box that will rival the several streaming devices we’ve seen and tried in the past and looks like it’s coming very soon. The Mi Box though is said to rival Roku directly. This Android TV device brings consumer video streaming closer to more people because of its affordability and ease-of-use. No, we’re not making the Mi Box up because we’re already got our feature on it as early as May. There’s mo mention of the price at all but now the unit is said to have been spotted in the wild. Someone noticed the device while in Walmart, snapped up a pic, and then posted on Twitter.We’re guessing it was an honest mistake and an employee didn’t know that it’s not yet time to display the gadget. Of course, the mobile industry gets interested because it doesn’t look fake at all. In fact, the device pictured on the box matches the Mi Box we featured a few weeks ago. Should we expect the $69 Mi Box soon? Definitely. With the Android TV device, you can expect an 8GB storage, 2GB RAM, 4K support at 60fps, and voice control. Support for the usual streaming services like VUDU, Sling, Netflix, or Hulu will also be ready. In the near future, you may be able to use it for Android gaming. A game controller is believed to be in the works right now so let’s wait and see.

LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Warning needed Has anyone else noticed that on approach from the southwest, the traffic light near the Margaret Sherry Library and Popp’s Ferry Fire Station is on a blind curve and cannot be seen until traffic is virtually under it? Why can’t the city place a flashing warning light before the curve informing traffic to prepare to stop? When one considers that the fire trucks make emergency runs daily through that very light, it would seem the sensible thing to do. Leading by example Kudos to the lady who was walking off of the Popp’s Ferry bridge on Saturday with the handful of trash in her hand. Maybe someone from the Public Works Department could take lessons from you. Electronic records You are correct. Thanks to the good old U.S. government, your doctor’s office is required to use electronic medical records or not take government sponsored insurance. What happens when the Internet is down or just the system in general? Your appointment may be canceled. Your doctor has no access to your reports, records from the last visit, anything. Unless he keeps a backup paper chart like the one I work for. We keep going and he "charts" in the computer later. The rest of the group cancels clinic. Sad state of affairs. Would add jobs Why can't Ingalls Shipbuilding build their own drydock? Over the years they have built submarines and drilling platforms and passenger, cargo and combat ships. Just think of the number of jobs involved. Thank you, Whitney To Whitney, that wonderful young lady at Wal-Mart who, early Sunday morning, went out in the back to find the size 12 shoes for my man: Thank you. Too much to risk In 2008 the economy tanked and we have not recovered yet. The recovery process has been under the Obama administration and for two years, the Democrats controlled both houses. If we elect another Democrat, I predict we will have another recession within 12 to 18 months and the government will have nothing to counter it with. I am not a Trump fan, but can we really continue the Obama policies? We have two of the worst candidates running and we must chose the lesser of two evils. Clear out ditches I live in a subdivision off Dedeaux Road in Gulfport where many houses were flooded during the deluge on April 28. Since that time, the ditches along Dedeaux have not been touched. They are full of weeds — not just weeds, but small trees and shrubs. Now, every time it pours for more than a few minutes, I pray that the water is able to drain from the subdivision. Gulfport, clear out the ditches along Dedeaux, and any others in areas where flooding is a concern. Yellen says the delay (which is long overdue) has nothing to do with the election. Yeah, right! Do as you’re told To the person who said just do as you're told if stopped by a policeman, you're 100 percent correct. If you have nothing to hide, it shouldn't be a problem. Arguing, being defiant, walking away and/or making abrupt gestures only escalates the situation. Send your Sound Off comments to soundoff@sunherald.com for consideration for publication.

"Vinyl is collected by 15-year-olds and 70-year-olds. People want a music collection." Back Alley has expanded its vinyl inventory over the past year, both new and used, he said. Competition for collectible vinyl is fiercer than ever, Deighan noted, and he's always seeking people who want to sell. More music companies are reissuing everything across the board from Patsy Cline to the Beatles and Stones, he said, and charging premium prices. "The cost is definitely a little bloated for some," he said, noting the new Jack White acoustic album is $48, but most vinyl averages $30 to $32. "We're not getting rich off it," Deighan said, noting the cost to produce vinyl is more than CDs or cassettes.  Competition increases too With the resurgence has come increased competition both locally from retailers of all kinds and from online. From Walmart to Best Buy and Urban Outfitters, turntables, amps and speakers that were crowding dumpsters a decade ago are now hot commodities.  'People like buying physical manifestations of the music,' notes Pete Forbes, who sold plenty of vinyl at his store in Murray River this summer. (Records on Main/Facebook) Back Alley now does a steady business buying and selling refurbished sound systems.  'People just really, really dig it.' — Mike Ross, Hop Yard restaurant Pete Forbes also ran a small record store in Murray River this summer called Records on Main.  The 40-year-old guitar teacher said he believes there are cycles in the popularity of vinyl that peak every six or seven years.  "The digital revolution fell short in a few ways, but I think people like buying physical manifestations of the music," he said. "The artwork is nice, and the weight of it is nice — it feels like you are actually buying something."  Many artists who issue their albums on vinyl now will include a digital download or code, Forbes pointed out, so people can listen to the music both ways — at home on a turntable or on the go. And a side of vinyl, bartender HopYard hopped on the trend when the restaurant opened this spring in Charlottetown. 'It's got the old-school feel to it,' says Hop Yard co-owner Brett Hogan of vinyl records available to play at the restaurant. (Hop Yard/Facebook) It borrowed 600 records from Back Alley Music, so diners can pick out a favourite and ask the bartender to spin it for them. The vinyl is also available "to go" — since it's all for sale.  "It's worked out great for both of us," said HopYard co-owner Brett Hogan, noting some customers even bring in their own records to be played while they dine. "It's got the old-school feel to it." "People just really, really dig it," shares HopYard co-owner Mike Ross. "I'm sure it will grow until the next big thing comes along and then die, but I don't think it will ever disappear," Ross added.  'Vinyl was dead' Vinyl has been Pat Deighan's passion for years — the 42-year-old musician been collecting since he was 14, and has a collecting of about 2,000 albums, listing a Sam Cook Night Beat original album as his favourite.  'People want a music collection,' says Back Alley Music owner Pat Deighan, showing off some of the store's new and reissued vinyl. (Submitted by Back Alley Music) "For a while there vinyl was dead. CDs are definitely declining," Deighan said, espousing his belief that, "Vinyl will be the defining, de facto piece of music that will be around forever." "Vinyl is a beautiful thing. It's a piece of art," he said, adding its sound is rich and authentic. MORE P.E.I. NEWS I 'We can be ambassadors of our own fate': A call to action on climate change MORE P.E.I.

When we think of bad corporate behavior, we tend to assume the usual suspects: energy companies, as in Enron 15 years ago or ExxonMobil’s current SEC investigation; banks, thanks to the 2008–2009 financial crisis and the current Wells Fargo “fake accounts” scandal; or big conglomerates, such as Tyco, with business models we don’t really understand and CEOs who prey on oblivious investors. Surely a food company that is on a mission to end animal torture, improve public health and save the environment would refrain from such shenanigans. But as last week’s Bloomberg investigation revealed, Hampton Creek and its founder and CEO, Josh Tetrick, have been accused of cooking the books, over-inflating data about products’ environmental footprint and, in the end, possibly defrauding investors. And all of this was apparently done to boost the valuation of the company behind Just Mayo in yet another quest to become a Silicon Valley “unicorn,” following the lead of privately-owned companies including tech superstars Uber, Airbnb, Snapchat and Pinterest. This is a spectacular fall from grace for Tetrick, who became a hero to the animal welfare, vegan and sustainability crowds with his Just Mayo and Just Cookie Dough products. With his chiseled good looks, irresistibly muscular frame and bravado, Tetrick had the cajones and persona these movements arguably needed. Brash testosterone-laden energy gave these campaigns a massive bicep flex and gregarious chest bump. It has always easy to lampoon animal rights activists and vegans — as in, you know, the people who work in your neighborhood health food store . . . that always looked unhealthy. But Tetrick scored some serious street cred to the noble cause of moving society away from a diet centered on animal protein. And who would argue with this guy, as he embraced science and technology while wowing investors in order to end animal cruelty? Plus, he was a college football player, proving veganism and animal rights activism did not have to be defensive and shrill. One thing that is very clear is that Tetrick believed in himself, as he often told stories that Bloomberg suggested were usually exaggerated. For example, he was on the West Virginia University football team, but unlike the bios he gave to the press over the years, he was actually on the practice squad, which rarely suited up in uniforms or traveled, wrote Bloomberg reporters Olivia Zaleski, Peter Waldman and Ellen Huet. He said he worked with poor people in Africa for three or seven years, depending on who asked him. And his life story’s fudging is where the cracks in the façade started. Zeleski, Waldman and Huet picked apart Hampton Creek’s success, and they didn’t walk on eggshells. And as if they could not dig in their knives keep enough, the story’s lede is an entertaining GIF, on which readers can click on a mouse in order to wipe the vegan mayo off Tetrick’s face. It turns out the copious amount of research to find a plant-based alternative was allegedly more of a sideshow to leave investors thunderstruck than an effort to discover the perfect molecular structure to replicate an egg yolk. The 1.4 trillion gallons of water saved by the company as of March 2015 was actually a smaller amount after a sustainability consultant crunched the numbers, the reporters found. The dubious science, however, did not get in the way of the products’ taste and quality. If any plant-based product really tasted like the “real thing,” it was the company’s cookie dough and mayonnaise. And Hampton Creek won more fans after its inspirational role as David against the Goliath of Unilever, which complained to the feds about the fake spread daring to pass itself off as “mayo.” Meanwhile, the American Egg Board was in full freak-out mode over Tetrick’s success, making the CEO even more of a hero to those of us who want to do something about animal cruelty and the poultry industry’s impact on the environment. Undaunted, Hampton Creek kept scoring wins, as Target and Walmart agreed to sell more of its products. Even 7-Eleven offered Just Mayo as a condiment for its famous hot dogs. But that momentum, the reporters charge, was built upon Tetrick’s skill in badgering investors into not missing out on the latest Silicon Valley can’t-miss opportunity. But most hilarious, if it were not so egregious, was Hampton Creek’s undercover buyback scheme, which sounds like a delicious plot served up by a sitcom such as “Arrested Development” or “The Office.” As widely reported, the company hired contractors, who were instructed to buy heaps of products at chains such as Whole Foods and Safeway. Some products were “tested” at home; the rest could be given away to friends, food banks or the mailman. Many of these hapless secret shoppers were reportedly overwhelmed with the task and ended up throwing much of the product away, which at a minimum sabotaged the company’s claim that it was being good for the environment. As a result, Hampton Creek’s “quality assurance” directive appeared to inflate sales figures; it under-reported those expenses; and, in turn, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into the company. Most likely this would have all been on the down-low, if it were not for Bloomberg’s research and “triangulation,” which reconciled the company’s financial statements, public statements and emails. The result will be more schadenfreude directed to Silicon Valley types, as Hampton Creek’s investors included the controversial Donald Trump lapdog Peter Thiel and Khosla Ventures. The winner of this saga will be the Hollywood writer who should have no problem finding gold in this story. The losers, of course, are Tetrick and Hampton Creek, saboteurs of a perfectly fine portfolio of products undone in the obsession to inflate sales numbers and another startup’s valuation.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Science EQ-Radio: A New Device for Wirelessly Detecting Emotions Monique Bethell - September 26, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Psychcentral  (Source: Psychcentral.com) Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a device that can detect a person’s emotions using wireless signals. “EQ-Radio” is a device designed to measure subtle changes in breathing and heart rhythms to accurately detect whether a person is excited, happy, or sad. Perhaps when you were younger, you had a tendency to reveal “too much” of your emotions. Or quite possibly, you may have had a difficult time showing your true feelings. Maybe you can even recall a time when you had to struggle to correctly “read” the emotions of another person which may have led to a particularly “awkward” social situation. But as you got older, you learned to conceal rather than reveal, and the poker face became the mask you wore to hide the emotions buried beneath the surface.   The ability to understand and read the emotions of people can often be a challenging and somewhat frustrating task. In fact, we depend on this ability to be able to determine our reactions and regulate our responses to social situations. Yet, despite our marginal attempts at being able to reliably interpret the emotions of others, it’s been more art than science.   Until now…   Photo Source: Jason Dorfman, MIT CSAIL A team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  (CSAIL) developed a device called “E-Radio” which can wirelessly detect and read emotions with 87 percent accuracy. Building on the previous work from Dina Katabi, the lead researcher, EQ Radio uses RF signals to recognize emotions by monitoring physiological signals (e.g. heartbeat and breathing) that change depending on our emotional state. The team claims that EQ Radio can wirelessly measure heartbeats within .03 margin of error compared to the precision of a regular ECG monitor device, but without the use of cumbersome electrodes or other body sensors placed on the skin. Their white paper provides details about the results of their experiments with 30 participants, collecting over 130,000 heart beats.   EQ Radio uses an algorithm that breaks down signals such as heartbeat and breathing that are beamed towards a person and bounce back to a wireless receiver. By measuring changes in the intervals between the returning signals, researchers can determine individual’s level of emotional arousal and whether they are experiencing positive or negative feelings. The algorithm matches the data according to preset emotional states such as happy, sad, excited, or angry.      Watch YouTube video for EQ-Radio demo.   The use of wireless technology to accurately measure emotions opens the possibility of exploring a wide range of applications, particularly related to consumer and health behaviors. Consumer marketing companies can use this technology to detect emotions during TV and film screenings, while “smart homes” can adjust lighting or other environmental controls based on the mood of the residents. Doctors can this device to help detect potential health conditions such as arrhythmia, as well as monitor patients with depression, anxiety or other mood disorders. The possibilities seem endless.   But wait…do these potential applications also open the door to some privacy issues? Do we want a future where our emotions can be “detected” and read with or without our consent like text on a screen? Perhaps there is something mildly comforting about being able to keep our emotions to ourselves, and not have them revealed to anyone within a wireless range.   Well I suppose that’s the next step in our emotional evolution. We’ve gone from EQ (emotional quotient) to EI (emotional intelligence) and now ET (emotional technology). So how do you feel now – happy, sad, excited, angry? Well perhaps EQ Radio can help us figure it out.  Source: Psychcentral "Nowadays, security guys break the Mac every single day.
