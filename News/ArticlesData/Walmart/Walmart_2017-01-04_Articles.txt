More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Walmart and Visa have ended an acrimonious and public battle over fees that saw the retail giant refuse to accept Visa credit cards in its northern Ontario and Manitoba stores. In a brief statement Thursday afternoon, Walmart said it would allow customers in those regions to once again use Visa cards beginning Friday. “We have come to an agreement with Visa which allows us to continue offering Visa as a form of payment in our stores,” Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs at Walmart, said in the emailed statement. Carla Hindman, a spokesperson for Visa, confirmed that Visa cards will be accepted “as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada” as of Friday. Related Walmart stops accepting Visa today at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Visa ups ante in battle with Walmart by offering Manitobans $10 to shop where card is accepted Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Neither side would provide details of their deal, with both citing confidential business terms. The fight, which emerged in June, stemmed from a re-negotiation over how much Walmart would pay in interchange fees. These fees are collected from all merchants that accept credit cards as a method of payment, and are shared among credit card companies such as Visa and Mastercard, the banks that issue the credit cards, and credit card processors. After a surprise weekend announcement by Walmart last summer that it would begin phasing out acceptance of Visa cards in its Canadian stores, Visa accused the retailing behemoth of using its own customers as “leverage” in an attempt to pay lower fees than others, including charities and schools. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants published in June, including in the National Post, Visa said the pair had been negotiating for months, with Walmart ultimately offered “one of the lowest rates of any merchant” in Canada. For its part, Walmart said it was trying to keep fees and all its costs as low as possible to avoid passing them along to customers through higher prices. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny around the world in recent years amid complaints from retail and consumer groups, and even some politicians, who fear they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. On Thursday, officials from both Walmart and Visa declined to say where the two sides landed on the interchange fees in their latest agreement. “Visa doesn’t disclose confidential business terms,” Hindman said. One industry source told the Post in June that Canadian banks that issue Visa cards had an incentive to urge the credit card company to go back to negotiations with Walmart. This person estimated the banks had $82 million in interchange fees at stake. All was not quiet over the months the two companies were feuding. In November, Visa launched a promotion in Manitoba that seemed to be encouraging shoppers to buy their groceries anywhere but Walmart, where they could not use their Visa cards at the time. A $10 credit was given to cardholders who registered their cards and then made a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. Disputes over interchange fees have led to government intervention to regulate the setting of the fees in some countries. This has not been the case in Canada where, in late 2014, the fees charged to retailers across Canada were voluntarily reduced after a series of negotiations. However, retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in Australia and parts of Europe.

Shaw  |  January 5, 2017 3:58 PM EST  |  1 Timothy Blake used his bodily fluids to sexually assault women at Walmart. The first incident was initially reported at the top of November. The woman was visiting a Walmart in Mineral Wells, West Virginia when she noticed a “creepy” man following her in the store. At some point, she felt something wet on her lower back. The women went into the restroom and cleaned herself. When she walked out, Blake was starring at the woman. She attempted to approach Blake, but he ran to his pick-up truck. Another women submitted a report to authorities on Dec. 28 at the same Walmart. This time, police where able to find his pick-up truck in a surveillance video. When police caught up to Blake, he was traveling to dinner with his wife and arrested. While being questioned by authorities, Blake admitted to masturbating at least 12 times in parking lots at public shopping centers and filling his semen with syringes. He would then follow the women and squirt the fluid on their backs. His wife revealed that she did not have knowledge of Blake’s criminal behavior. With Donald Trump’s revelation that he promotes the sexual assault of women, it’s going to be important for women’s rights groups and lawmakers to remain vocal when it comes to abuse against women. Blake has been charged with two counts of pandering obscenity, menacing by stalking and sexual imposition.

Both companies said they came to an agreement but did not provide details, calling the arrangement confidential. Walmart Supercentre in Kingston, Ont., on June 20. (Photo: Lars Hagberg/The Canadian Press) Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay in mid-July. It said it pays more than $100 million in fees every year for customers to use various brands of credit cards, and that the fees charged by Visa were excessive. That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Walmart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. A Visa Inc. logo on a credit card. (Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The campaign didn't explicitly mention Walmart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can't use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer's demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well.Also on HuffPost: Close  The Best Credit Cards In Canada 2015 of   Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite Card MBNA Smart Cash MasterCard Credit Card SimplyCash Card from American Express Scotiabank Gold American Express Card BMO World Elite MasterCard RBC Royal Bank Visa Infinite Avion Blue Sky Credit Card (from American Express) Capital One Aspire Travel Platinum MasterCard Shell AIR MILES MasterCard from BMO TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Card President's Choice Financial MasterCard MBNA Smart Cash MasterCard Credit Card Shell AIR MILES MasterCard from BMO Shell CashBack MasterCard from BMO MBNA TrueLine MasterCard Credit Card National Bank Syncro MasterCard Desjardins Visa Gold Modulo MBNA Platinum Plus MasterCard President's Choice Financial MasterCard Scotiabank Value VISA card National Bank MC1 MasterCard Home Trust Secured Visa Card Capital One Guaranteed MasterCard (both secured and unsecured) Scotiabank L'earn VISA card StudentAwards MBNA Rewards MasterCard BMO SPC CashBack MasterCard Scotiabank SCENE VISA card  Share  Tweet  ✖ Advertisement Share this ✖ close Current Slide More: video business video walmart visa walmart visa canada walmart visa dispute Walmart Visa fees walmart visa fees lawsuit walmart visa truce walmart canada walmart visa agreement Suggest a correction   Click here to view Conversations Conversations Suggested For You FOLLOW HUFFPOST Email Email Address Please check the checkbox to indicate your consent Options HuffPost Daily Brief Business Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..

Walmart Canada, Visa declare truce in half year battle over credit card fees by Alexandra Posadzki, The Canadian Press Posted Jan 5, 2017 6:31 pm EST Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 at 5:54 am EST Business National Signage at a Laval, Que., Walmart store is seen on Tuesday, May 3, 2016. The dispute between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees heats up today as the retail giant stops accepting the credit card at its 16 stores in Manitoba. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz Corporate behemoths Walmart Canada and Visa have declared a truce in their dispute over merchant fees, allowing Walmart customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., to resume using the credit card beginning Friday. Both companies said they came to an agreement but did not provide details, calling the arrangement confidential. Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay in mid-July. It said it pays more than $100 million in fees every year for customers to use various brands of credit cards, and that the fees charged by Visa were excessive. That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Walmart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. The campaign didn’t explicitly mention Walmart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can’t use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer’s demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well.

REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMore TORONTO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Visa Inc reached an agreement to continue offering Visa as a payment option for customers in Canada, the two companies said on Thursday. Last summer, Walmart Canada said it would stop accepting Visa cards after a public dispute with the credit card provider over what the retail giant called "unacceptably high" merchant fees. Three stores in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and 16 stores in the province of Manitoba were impacted by the initial roll-out of the decision last year. These stores will resume accepting Visa on Friday. A Walmart Canada spokesman said details of the agreement were confidential. The original decision would have eventually impacted more than 370 outlets across Canada. No U.S. locations were affected. Retailers have long complained about merchant fees charged by credit card companies. But Walmart and Visa's negotiations were unusually public, with Visa taking up ads in Canadian newspapers, saying Walmart was using its customers as pawns in its bid to get lower fees.

Fallon/Bloomberg Wal-Mart Ends Threat to Ban Visa Credit Cards Across Canada by Doug Alexander @dscrybe More stories by Doug Alexander January 5, 2017, 6:00 PM EST January 6, 2017, 8:41 AM EST Manitoba, Thunder Bay customers can use cards starting today Retailer had threatened to expel Visa from all Canada stores Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reached an agreement to continue accepting Visa Inc. credit cards across Canada, ending the retailer’s threat to bar the world’s largest payments network from its 409 stores in the country. Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, will be able to use their Visa cards starting Friday, Alex Roberton, a spokesman for the retailer, said in an e-mailed statement. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, stopped accepting Visa at its three Thunder Bay outlets on July 18, and followed up three months later with a ban at 16 stores in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Wal-Mart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Wal-Mart stores,” Carla Hindman, a Visa Canada spokeswoman, said in a statement. She declined to elaborate. Walmart Canada, which has said it pays more than C$100 million ($76 million) annually on credit-card transaction fees, called the amount Visa charges “unacceptably high” in a June 11 statement on its website. Visa rose 0.2 percent to $81.28 in early trading at 8:34 a.m. in New York. The stock gained 7.7 percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 17 percent advance for the 67-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(File Photo) Sarolta Saskiw, CTV Winnipeg Published Thursday, January 5, 2017 5:00PM CST Last Updated Thursday, January 5, 2017 8:08PM CST Manitobans will once again be able to use their Visa credit cards at Walmart stores across the province. The retail giant has been at a standstill with Visa over credit card fees since October of 2016, preventing the card from being used at any 16 Walmart locations in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Walmart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Walmart stores, including in Manitoba,” said Carla Hindman, spokesperson with Visa Canada. Walmart initially banned the credit card alleging it was paying too much for annual fees. However, Visa claimed it offered Walmart one of the lowest rates in the country, but the retailer wanted it reduced even more. After the ban was in place, Visa encouraged Manitoba card users in early November to spend their money at a grocery store other than Walmart – offering $10 credit for purchases $50 and more. The new agreement means cardholders can start using Visa again at Walmart starting Jan. 6.

Both companies have confirmed that shoppers at 16 Manitoba stores, as well as three in Thunder Bay, Ont., will be able to resume Visa-based purchases starting Friday. Walmart Canada has complained that service fees to accept credit cards topped $100 million annually, calling the charges from Visa “unacceptably high.” The company phased-out Visa cards at the three Thunder Bay, Ont. stores last July, followed by 16 in Manitoba in October. Walmart Canada had threatened to expand the ban to its more than 400 stores nationwide unless Visa agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit card transactions. Neither company has confirmed any changes to the service fees. Visa Canada had previously said it offered Walmart Canada one of the lowest transaction processing rates of any merchant in Canada. “Walmart is still demanding more. They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants -- lower than local grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores -- and yes, charities and schools too,” said the company in an open letter to Canadian merchants last June. “They are using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” Visa fired back against Walmart during the dispute by offering Manitoba cardholders a $10 credit on $50 grocery purchases. Thunder Bay, Ont. cardholders were awarded a $25 credit for every grocery buy of $75 or more. “We have come to an agreement with Visa which allows us to continuing offering Visa as a form of payment in our stores,” said Walmart Canada’s senior director of corporate affairs Alex Roberton in an emailed statement to CTV News. Visa Canada’s corporate and public affairs spokesperson Carla Hindman echoed Roberton’s message, saying “Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada.” Related Stories Customer credit latest move in Visa Canada-Walmart card-rate spat Fees dispute escalates as Walmart stops accepting Visa in Manitoba Why is Walmart phasing out Visa transactions in Canada?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen TORONTO – Corporate behemoths Walmart Canada and Visa have declared a truce in their dispute over merchant fees, allowing Walmart customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., to resume using the credit card beginning Friday. Story continues below In statement’s sent to Global News, both Walmart and Visa said they “came to an agreement” but did not list the details of the agreement. Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay in mid-July. It said it pays more than $100 million in fees every year for customers to use various brands of credit cards, and that the fees charged by Visa were excessive. READ MORE: Walmart vs. Visa: Canadians side with retail giant in fee dispute, poll says That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Walmart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. The campaign didn’t explicitly mention Walmart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can’t use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer’s demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well. *With Files from Global News   © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Credit Cards Transaction Fees VISA Walmart Walmart Canada walmart visa battle walmart vs visa Editor's Picks Canada Fake news: A real-life Cruella de Vil didn't skin dozens of Texas cats Canada Why Justin Trudeau’s trip to the Aga Khan’s island matters Consumer No, you do not have to pay a 'settlement fee' if you get an illegal download notice Health Trump's support for anti-vaxxers could lead to deadly outbreaks, disease expert warns Canada Why is Canada's top diplomat, Chrystia Freeland, banned from Russia?

(Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Related Stories The Walmart-Visa standoff: Who's winning? New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba Walmart goes Visa free in Manitoba next month Walmart extends Visa ban to all 16 Manitoba stores starting today Want 10 bucks? Then buy your groceries somewhere other than Walmart, Visa tells Manitobans Walmart goes Visa free in Manitoba A six-month spat between the world's largest retailer and the world's biggest credit card company is over, as Walmart has struck a deal with Visa that will see the latter's cards accepted at all of the chain's Canadian stores. The two companies announced the agreement on Thursday, but made no mention as to what concessions were made by whom to end the dispute. Two months after first shot, Walmart still quiet on battle plan in Visa war "Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada," Visa Canada spokeswoman Carla Hindman said in an email. Starting tomorrow, "Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Walmart stores, including in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont." Those two markets were singled out because they are the only locations thus far affected by Walmart's threat, made last June, to eventually stop accepting Visa cards at all of its stores. The move to drop Visa started at all three Walmart stores in Thunder Bay in July and then spread to all 16 stores in Manitoba in October. Interchange fees At issue were so-called interchange fees, which credit card companies charge retailers as a cost for processing a transaction. Typically they are a percentage of the total value of goods sold, but different cards and different stores have different rates. While consumers don't pay those fees directly, retailers pass on the costs to shoppers via higher prices. Walmart's Visa ban extends from Ontario into Manitoba Visa offers Manitobans $10 to buy their groceries anywhere but Walmart Walmart had insisted that Visa's fees are too high, saying it pays more than $100 million a year for the service — far more than it pays for other cards, or other payment methods such as debit, which charges a flat fee per transaction. Visa, meanwhile, countered that it already gave Walmart one of its lowest interchange fees on all its cards. Neither side was willing to disclose on Thursday what the new fee structure for Visa cards at Walmart will be, but data from research firm Value Penguin suggests the average interchange fee on Canadian credit cards is roughly 1.76 per cent. That's far higher than those in Europe, where fees below one per cent are the norm. The French average, for example, is just 0.21 per cent. According to payment processing firm Moneris, as of April 2015, Visa's internal guidelines said their cards charged between 1.42 and 2.08 per cent in interchange fees, depending on the card used, at a standard retailer. Although the company would likely negotiate another deal with a customer the size of Walmart. Visa fights back in high-profile fight with Walmart over credit card fees Mark Satov, strategy adviser at Satov Consultants, said the timing of the deal — right after the busy holiday shopping season — was likely significant. "It's after Christmas and somebody looked at their numbers and said, 'It wasn't as strong as we thought,'" he said in an interview. "And my bet is it's Visa." Satov suggested the card company had more to lose in the long run from feuding with a giant retailer such as Walmart. "People don't look for the best deal to find the cheapest TV or gadget or toy and then say, 'I'm not going there, they don't take Visa,'" he said. "That's not the way people think." From 2014: Banks, credit card companies agree to cut fees they charge retailers The card company also likely faced pressure from its banking partners to get a deal done, because Visa is a brand, but the payments themselves are processed by whatever Canadian bank has issued the card. When it comes to which credit cards to issue to their customers, "the bank has a choice [and] if Visa is not accepted at one of the biggest retailers in the country, it's not attractive anymore," Satov said.

This listing includes the most notable incidents for the reporting period and does not necessarily reflect all police activity. Editor’s note: All suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and values are estimated for stolen/damaged items. These are brief summaries of detailed BPD reports. Dec. 26 Stage Road and Memphis-Arlington Road (fraud) A man reported the day after Christmas that someone had used his debit card twice without his permission. The first was on Dec. 19 at Walmart (8400 Stage Road) for $85.61. The second use was the same day at another Walmart (6420 Memphis Arlington Road) for $112.44. North Street (theft from yard) A package thief took a UPS package from the front porch of a home on North Street sometime after 1:45 p.m. on Dec. 24, the homeowner reported on Dec. 26. The item stolen was a high-power nine-jet ultrasonic fogger/mister/humidifier ($150). Dec. 27 Steven Franklin Drive (home invasion) A woman reported on Dec. 27 that a friend armed with a black handgun, along with another acquaintance and two unknown white males, unlawfully entered her home between midnight and 12:30 a.m. , but they quickly left the residence. She said the friend he had stolen her car and keys on Dec. 24 from a hotel in Memphis, and she believes he used those keys to enter her home. The vehicle that the home invaders used wasn’t the one that was stolen from her, she said. Carla Lane (theft from motor vehicle) A man reported on Dec. 27 that someone had rummaged through his truck bed storage box the previous day. He parked his Ford F150 pickup in the driveway around 8 p.m., and he noticed the intrusion at 7:20 a.m. the next morning. The storage box’s contents were emptied out into the truck bed, and the only item missing was a small duffle bag containing paperwork and documents. Peyton Randolph (auto burglary) A victim reported on Dec. 27 that someone stole multiple items from a Saturn Outlook and Toyota Corolla parked in the home’s driveway. Items taken included a TomTom brand GPS device and a Craftsman toolbox ($45) filled with face painting brushes and paints ($350). The thefts happened between 7 p.m. Dec. 26 and 10:15 a.m. Dec. 27. Skylight Drive (theft) Someone removed the temporary tag from a 2010 Nissan Altima, the owner reported on Dec. 27. She said she parks the car on the street in front of her home. The theft happened between noon Dec. 25 and 1 p.m. Dec. 27. Dec. 28 Chesterfield Cove (theft from motor vehicle) On Dec. 28, a gun owner reported a weapon stolen from his vehicle. Items taken included a black Glock 43 handgun ($500), eight 9mm bullets ($5) and a black Remora handgun holster ($40). He noticed the theft the day of the report and said the weapon was stolen sometime within the past two weeks. During that period, he traveled to Nashville and Johnson City, but he believes the weapon was stolen from his vehicle while it was parked at home. He said he normally locks his vehicle but may have forgotten to do so a couple of times. Stage Road (theft from motor vehicle) A man returned from a meal on Dec. 28 to find his car’s keyhole had been punched and multiple items were stolen. He parked around 6:10 p.m. in the parking lot of 5705 Stage Road, ate dinner and returned around two hours later. The driver’s side keyhole was destroyed, along with his dashboard. His Kenwood DDC 790 radio ($500) was missing. Other stolen items included a camouflage backpack ($100) containing miscellaneous medical supplies ($100), a black iPhone 5s ($400) and two JL Audio 10-inch speakers ($500). A witness reported seeing a white male and an Asian male, both about 19-24 years old, in the area before the incident. Dec. 29 Court Street (attempted burglary) A man went outside when he heard noise in his backyard around 9:10 p.m. on Dec. 29, and he spotted someone running away. The suspect—a slim male wearing a black hoodie and black pants—climbed over the chicken wire fence and fled westbound on North Street. The man also found that the window screen had been removed from his home’s rear window. Dec. 30 Trey Hobbs Cove (burglary) A woman taking care of someone else’s dogs around 3:45 p.m. Dec. 30 found that the home had been burglarized. Items taken included a 60-inch Magnavox and a 42-inch TV of unknown make/model ($800). Officers cleared the property and found that the entry door from the garage had been pried open from an unknown object. They also noticed a small amount of drug paraphernalia in plain view, and it was photographed and later destroyed. Dec. 31 4th Avenue (suspicious circumstance) A woman reported on Dec. 31 that her back door had been pried open. She said the last time they had seen the door undamaged was around 8 p.m. Dec. 30, when her husband took the dogs outside. The family discovered the damage around 5 a.m. Dec. 31. She said she hadn’t noticed if anything was missing from the home.

(AP) - The online retailer Jet.com, now owned by Wal-Mart, says it's acquired the footwear-shopping website ShoeBuy for about $70 million. The deal, announced Thursday, closed Dec. 30. Based in Boston, ShoeBuy offers more than 800 brands of shoes, clothing and accessories. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a stand-alone website, and ShoeBuy's current executives and employees will still be based in Boston. The company says ShoeBuy suppliers will have the option to sell on Jet.com, too. The move is Wal-Mart's latest push to expand its reach online following last year's acquisition of Jet.com, which it bought for $3 billion plus $300 million in stock.

Police in Marietta arrested 26-year-old Timothy Blake on Dec. 30 during an investigation of two alleged acts of public masturbation and stalking, according to CBS News. Washington County Sheriffs Office Timothy Blake, 26, is accused of squirting semen on women shopping at a Walmart in Marietta, Ohio. The first incident was on Nov. 2, when a woman shopping at the local Walmart called police to report a “creepy” man who seemed to be lingering around her, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun. The victim told police the man walked up a few inches behind her, and then she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. The woman then “began to panic” and rushed to a bathroom where she discovered the substance was “sticky.” She walked out and saw the man who allegedly assaulted her continuing to watch her. “She said he then took off and she followed him until he got in his truck and left,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel. Surveillance video obtained by the police showed the suspect squirting the woman. The second incident happened Dec. 28 at the same Walmart. The victim told police that “some substance” had been “thrown or sprayed on her” while she was shopping, according to the arrest affidavit. The suspect was spotted driving away in a truck with an emblem on the side. Surveillance footage revealed that he was identical to the suspect in the November incident. Investigators used the emblem on the truck to track down Blake at a Wings Etc. location on Dec. 30. The suspect was seated inside, but came outside to the patrol vehicle to talk. When Blake was told he had been seen throwing or spraying something on women at the Walmart, he allegedly told officers he had tossed egg yolks. Blake was then informed that the substance found on the women had been tested, at which point he allegedly admitted he had squirted semen on the women, according to the arrest affidavit. The suspect allegedly told police he had done similar acts about a dozen times, but only used sperm on four occasions, and used egg yolks and flour or spit the other times.  Blake allegedly blamed his behavior on being molested as a child by his parents. Police also said he told them he masturbated in his truck or in the Walmart bathroom before his alleged acts, and used syringes he had purchased for the purpose of inoculating farm animals. Law enforcement also alleged that Blake said he usually aimed for the buttocks area of his victims and felt it was his way of having sex with them. He was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking. He has a preliminary hearing Jan. 11, but is currently free on $11,000 bond and was ordered to wear a GPS ankle monitor, according to WTAP. Anyone who experienced something similar at the Marietta Walmart is asked to contact the Washington County Sheriff’s Office at 740-376-7070, ext. 0.

(Courtesy, Haines City Police Department) By Stephanie Claytor, Reporter Last Updated: Friday, January 06, 2017, 9:03 AM EST HAINES CITY --  A mother of two was shot after an argument at a Haines City Walmart Thursday morning.  Mandy Guzman, 30, was shot in the abdomen Thursday morning Police: mother of two got into an argument with Yajaira Rivera while shopping Yajaira Rivera, 37, turned herself in to authorities According to acting Haines City Police Chief Jay Hopwood, Mandy Nicole Guzman, 30, was shot in the stomach following a confrontation in the Walmart on US Hwy 27 and Southern Dunes Blvd just after 11:30 a.m.  Police say Guzman got into an argument with Yajaira Rivera, 37, while inside the store. The pair parted ways, police say, and Guzman completed her shopping, then loaded her belongings and children into her vehicle. She was in the process of pushing her cart to the cart return rack when police say Rivera shot her. They have reportedly known each other for 'a few years.' When paramedics and officers arrived, Guzman was reportedly in the passenger seat of her car suffering from a gunshot wound. She was conscious and stable when airlifted to the hospital, Chief Hopwood said. Authorities also say her children were not injured during the shooting, and police don't believe they witnessed the crime.  Yajaira Rivera reportedly turned herself in to her attorney Thursday evening. She's currently being booked into jail on attempted homicide charges. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Polk County: Latest News Auburndale church to honor fallen Orlando police officer Winter Haven mother and daughter safe after fire destroyed home 'Clearly People' art exhibition set for downtown Lakeland Missing 75-year-old from Winter Haven found Lakeland transitional school for dyslexic children expanding Lakeland man hit, killed while crossing street Polk man to spend life in prison for raping, impregnating young girl Historical Commission votes to keep Polk monument at current site Man dies in Winter Haven house fire StormTracker 13 Radar Learn more  |  BHTV for iOS  |  BHTV for Android  |  BHTV for Kindle Fire  |  PC/Laptop Get the News 13+ App Download the News 13+ app for the latest News, Weather and Real Time Traffic at your fingertips.

Timothy Blake "repeatedly stalked" women inside an Ohio Walmart before squirting them with semen, CBS News reported Wednesday. Blake, authorities say, first told police he had thrown egg yolks at the victims but later admitted the substance was semen. "The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women," Marietta police wrote in the arrest affidavit. The first report of such incidents was received in November. A woman told authorities she was at Walmart when she noticed a "creepy" man who appeared to be "lingering around" as she attempted to shop. The man then approached her from behind, at which point she noticed a wet substance on her lower back and foot. After washing off the substance in a nearby restroom, the man was allegedly seen waiting on the woman. A similar report was received in December, with surveillance tapes reportedly showing the man fleeing the scene in a pickup truck. The truck was later discovered by police, leading to Blake—the owner of the vehicle—being questioned. Surveillance tapes also captured Blake using the syringe to squirt the woman who was stalked in November. Blake, 26, was ultimately booked and charged Dec. 30 with sexual imposition, pandering obscenity, and two counts of menace by stalking. According to the New York Daily News, Blake said he had previously used syringes full of either “egg, spit, or semen” to squirt women on a dozen occasions. Blake, who is married, reportedly blamed his parents for the behavior and accused them of molesting him as a child. Sadly, this doesn't mark the first incident of its kind.

Walmart’s Jet.com Jumping Into Shoe Game With $70M Purchase Of ShoeBuy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart’s Jet.com Jumping Into Shoe Game With $70M Purchase Of ShoeBuy January 5, 2017 11:41 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy all the shoes amazon walmart jet.com ShoeBuy shoes shopping online Acquisition deal Following the $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Walmart is continuing its bid to boost online sales, this time by targeting customers’ feet with the $70 million purchase of shoe-tailer ShoeBuy.  Walmart announced Thursday that Jet.com had acquired Boston-based online shoe retailer ShoeBuy on Dec. 30. The purchase is aimed at expanding Jet.com’s reach in consumers’ lives, including their closets. Walmart says the deal will allow Jet to gain the experience of a “well-established ecommerce player in the footwear industry.” With the deal, ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, and current CEO Mike Sorabella and the company’s 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston. ShoeBuy suppliers that are interested in expanding their consumer reach through selling on Jet will have that option. The purchase is just the latest in Walmart’s push for online sales. In Aug. 2016, the retailer announced would officially acquire Jet.com. A month later, the company was reportedly thinking of making a $1 billion investment in India-Based Flipkart to take on Amazon overseas. These types of purchases aren’t likely to stop anytime soon. Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview that it was a “fair assumption” that the company and Walmart would pursue more of acquisitions of online retailers, likely in “categories where they are long-tail, high-martian products and harder-to-crack brands.” January 5, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy all the shoes amazon walmart jet.com ShoeBuy shoes shopping online Acquisition deal Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related the other kind of deal Walmart Officially Acquiring Jet.com For $3 Billion focusing online Walmart Shuffles Staff To Take Online Sales Seriously… For Real This Time one way to boost sales Report: Walmart In Talks To Buy Jet.com the honeymoon is over What Should Walmart Do Now That It’s Landed Jet.com? gaining on Amazon Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas Previous You Can Drive A Different Cadillac Every Day — If You’ve Got An Extra $1,500/Month Next Chipotle Launches “Dietary Options” Tool For Better Burrito Personalization Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

The move underscores Walmart's continued push against Amazon, owner of online shoe store Zappos. The biggest retailer in the world, Walmart made online expansion its priority last year, taking over Jet for $3.3 billion and setting up a plan to invest billions more into e-commerce while cutting down new store openings. Jet said it bought ShoeBuy through its parent Walmart from media and internet company IAC, in a deal that closed Dec. 30. It said ShoeBuy is a leading online seller of shoes, clothes and accessories, stocking more than a million items. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, but its suppliers have the option of expanding to sales on Jet too, the company said. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and the company's more than 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston, Massachusetts.

Walmart announced Thursday morning that Jet has acquired ShoeBuy.com, a Boston-based footwear ecommerce company that was one of the first to sell shoes online when it launched in 1999. Jet paid about $70 million to buy ShoeBuy from its now-former parent company, IAC, Walmart said in a press release. As a result of the acquisition, ShoeBuy will remain a standalone site. The company's CEO, Mike Sorabella, along with his executive team and more than 200 employees, will stay in Boston. ShoeBuy had been acquired by IAC in 2006. Through the acquisition, Jet will gain the experience of a company that has played the ecommerce game longer than most. When ShoeBuy was founded by Scott Savitz in 1999, it was only four years after Amazon.com had launched. Savitz left in 2011 and formed Data Point Capital, a Boston-based venture capital firm that recently added Leonardo DiCaprio as a limited partner. ShoeBuy sells more than 800 brands, with over one million items spanning footwear, clothing and accessories for men, women and children — brands that will now have a chance to sell directly through Jet because of the acquisition, Walmart said.

AP Images. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is upping the digital ante. Just five months after the retail giant picked up e-commerce site Jet.com, Walmart said today that its new digital arm has snapped up online footwear, clothing and accessories retailer ShoeBuy. Related Texas Mother Claims to Have Found Razor Blades in Kid's Shoes at Walmart Jet.com shelled out $70 million for  16-year-old Boston-based ShoeBuy and expects the site to operate as a standalone but complementary component to Jet.com. The company said ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and 200-plus employees will continue to be based in Boston. Walmart, which has felt heightened competitive pressure from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc., has been moving aggressively over the past few months to expand its digital reach. According to the company, ShoeBuy — which became one of the first companies to sell shoes online around the same time that Zappos launched — carries more than 800 brands and over 1 million items, including footwear for women, men and kids, as well as clothing and accessories, such as outerwear and handbags. Hoboken, N.J.-based Jet.com sells a wide range of products, including electronics, furniture, specialty foods, household and beauty items. It also carries a smaller assortment of clothes, shoes and accessories. ShoeBuy’s suppliers interested in selling their wares on Jet.com will now have that option, according to the company. “Jet will gain the experience of a well-established e-commerce player in the footwear industry, who has transformed the online shopping experience for millions of customers,” Walmart said in statement. “ShoeBuy brings access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships, and rich content that will further enhance our customer experience.” Jet.com acquired ShoeBuy from IAC.

Advertisement Five days from now, activist Maile Hampton is scheduled to stand trial for the crime of touching a fellow protester’s arm for a handful of seconds in January 2015. And the future of Sacramento’s protest community could be shaped by the outcome. The charge facing Hampton is one of misdemeanor obstruction of a peace officer. The majority of misdemeanor allegations never see an actual trial, as judges and lawyers prefer to reserve limited taxpayer resources for exploring serious criminal accusations. But when tensions between activists and law enforcement do erupt into charges, Sacramento prosecutors are more likely than their counterparts in one nearby jurisdiction to take small-time infractions and misdemeanors the full distance, even to costly jury trials, according to records obtained by SN&R and interviews with multiple activists and attorneys. The intent is unmistakable, they claim: Speak out and pay fines. Embarrass the political elite and go to jail. “I do think handing out these kinds of charges to someone involved in a social movement is a very practical way of having a chilling effect on their First Amendment rights,” said veteran defense attorney Linda Parisi, who is representing Hampton. Hampton’s impending trial isn’t the only courtroom drama pushing this theme, however. Sean Thompson, an advocate for the homeless, is staring down a felony assault charge for smearing former Mayor Kevin Johnson with a cream pie. Veteran labor activist Eric Sunderland spent two years in Sacramento’s criminal court system for standing in the wrong spot during a Wal-Mart protest. And Hampton’s brother Jamier Sale has paid hundreds of dollars in fines for strolling too slow through a crosswalk during a demonstration—not to mention being informally banned from the Sacramento International Airport for protesting Donald Trump’s campaign stop there in June. Hampton, Sale, Sunderland and Thompson are all well-known organizers in Sacramento’s protest community. Whether that’s just a coincidence or a pathfinder for what constitutes unusual treatment and selective enforcement, it’s having a stifling effect, protest leaders say. “Compared to other cities, Sacramento’s protests are small,” Sale said in an interview with SN&R. “We have activists who are out, but they’re a small group and part of that is because people keep hearing about these things that are happening to us. People wonder, ’Why is the protest community so small in Sacramento?’” Sale said in an interview with SN&R. “This is why.” When it comes to jury trials for misdemeanor obstruction charges, Sacramento County prosecutors waged more than three times as many as prosecutors in Alameda County, a political hotbed with a similar population and demographics, according to a review of court data obtained by SN&R. In all, Sacramento County’s halls of justice were the site of 1,089 criminal jury trials between January 2014 and October 2016. Exactly 24 of those were held to determine the guilt or innocence of a person charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing a peace officer—the same charge Hampton faces for touching another protestor for a few seconds. That means cases like Hampton’s represented 2.2 percent of all jury trials in Sacramento County in nearly three years. While misdemeanor obstruction trials are uncommon in Sacramento, records obtained by SN&R suggest local prosecutors are hauling far more individuals in front of juries for the charge than their counterparts in Alameda County, the California jurisdiction most similar to Sacramento in population size. Alameda Superior Court held only seven jury trials for misdemeanor obstruction in the last three years, less than a third of Sacramento’s 24. That’s significant since it’s a charge often connected to demonstrating. Sacramento County Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi confirmed in an email that misdemeanor obstruction is one of several violations his office can file for protest arrests, though he denied that bringing a higher rate of those cases to jury trials proves harsh treatment for activists. “While resisting or interfering with a lawful arrest can often be associated with unlawful assembly arrests, the vast majority of [those cases] have absolutely nothing to do with protestors and demonstrators,” Grippi noted. The DA’s office didn’t provide case logs to back up that claim, but SN&R is aware of one such case. In December 2015, the DA’s office won a jury conviction for misdemeanor obstruction against a North Sacramento couple who refused to exit their home to a SWAT team platoon there to investigate false claims of a gun stash. While no firearms were found, the couple was arrested for refusing to accommodate the raid. Grippi also contended that the state capital is a bastion for activism, making legal confrontations more likely. “Sacramento County sees an inordinate share of political protests and demonstrations,” Grippi wrote. “Despite that reality, we do not charge an excessive number of so-called protest cases.” Yet the proposition that local law enforcement deals with more dissidents than their collegues in Alameda County is a shaky one: Between 2014 and October 2016, Bay Area news organizations reported more than 50 different demonstrations from the streets of Oakland to the UC Berkeley campus, some of which included crowds ranging from 200 to 2,000 activists blocking freeways, shutting down the Port of Oakland and laying on train tracks. One even included widespread public nudity. Attorney Todd Leras, who’s worked both as a local and federal prosecutor, said the yearslong court cases and jury trials he’s now seeing as a defense attorney fly in the face of campaign promises District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert made when the two competed for office in 2014. “When we were at a debate, she made comments that she wasn’t going to waste time prosecuting people for peaceful protests,” Leras said. “Regardless of what conversations she’s involved with around these cases, the prosecutors in her office are not keeping her campaign promises.” The stance that local prosecutors take toward activists came under national scrutiny during the early phases of Hampton’s case. The ordeal started at a Black Lives Matter event near the capital in January 2015, when Hampton put a hand on a fellow protestor who was being grabbed by police. Video evidence shows Hampton touched the man out of concern, for less than three seconds. While police never ended up arresting the man who was between Hampton and the officers, that didn’t stop them from later taking Hampton into custody at home on a felony charge of “lynching” him out of their custody. Parisi said the charge against Hampton wasn’t a case of a lone police officer being creative: It actually took Parisi several court appearances to convince the DA’s office of how inappropriate the lynching allegation was. Meanwhile, news that a 20-year-old, multiracial resident had to appear in court for “lynching” triggered a national uproar. California lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown unanimously changed the age-old state law that year, divorcing the historic connotation of lynching from the crime of prying another person from the hands of police. The DA’s office eventually dropped the racially-charged violation against Hampton, but quietly kept the case going by pursuing the lesser misdemeanor obstruction charge. Grippi declined to discuss the details of Hampton’s case or the impending trial, which is scheduled to begin January 10. Parisi told SN&R the costly event is going forward because prosecutors have yet to offer Hampton what the defense considers to be a reasonable plea bargain. The attorney added that the case is complicated by the fact that Hampton was exercising personal rights as an activist during the incident. “Peaceful protests and the right to expression are part of the foundation of a democratic society,” Parisi said. Prosecutors gave Sunderland his own reason to rethink his activism. The labor organizer was one of several people cited for obstructing traffic during a protest at the Wal-Mart in Rancho Cordova in 2014. When he and the other ticket recipients showed up to traffic court, prosecutors announced they were re-filing the infractions as more serious misdemeanor crimes. It took two full years for a volunteer team of defense attorneys to obtain an acceptable plea deal and prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for a trial. Leras represented Sunderland and was surprised by the level of pressure from his former colleagues. “I can tell you that myself and the other defense attorneys thought the district attorney’s office was being absolutely ridiculous and punitive,” Leras recalled. “The court itself finally made its own offer to settle the case, because it was clear the matter didn’t deserve this much attention.” Sale wasn’t as fortunate in 2014, when he had his most memorable brush with authorities. Sale was among some 200 demonstrators making a show against police brutality outside the Arden Fair mall when police grabbed him—and only him—in the crosswalk to be cited for jaywalking. Sale later appeared in court with witnesses, photos and videos to prove he was inside the crosswalk. Sale would never get the chance to defend himself. According to an appeal filed in 2015 by attorney Jeffrey Kravitz, when Sale showed up to address the ticket, Judge Patricia C. Esgro allowed a Sacramento police officer to simply alter his charge as they stood there. The violation was switched from jaywalking to obstructing traffic. The appeal states that swapping the charge was done without warning to Sale, and that Esgro abused her judicial discretion by failing to instruct Sale of his legal rights and options. The appeal also claimed that Sale was not allowed to present witnesses and evidence in his defense before Esgro found him guilty. Cres Vellucci of the National Lawyers Guild, the oldest U.S. bar association formed around protecting civil rights, watched Sale’s hearing unfold. “Each time Jamier tried to explain himself to the judge, he was cut off,” Vellucci said. “It was just a matter of the judge telling him that he was guilty.” Since Sale’s case was handled in traffic court, the constitutional right to be represented by an attorney didn’t apply. Sale was fined $250, plus an extra $50 fee to have a payment plan implemented. He has come to refer to that fine as his “personal protest tax,” owed to the city of Sacramento. “I don’t have $300 just lying around, but it’s still a small price to pay,” Sale told SN&R. “They can cite us for all these little things, but it won’t stop us from being out here to do what we think is right.” The nexus between personal convictions and criminal prosecutions is at the forefront of Thompson’s story. The military veteran made headlines in September by sidling up to the former mayor with a pie and drenching his face with coconut cream. Johnson responded by reportedly punching Thompson multiple times. While the level of Thompson’s culpability in the incident is debated (Johnson faced no charges for throwing blows), a recent preliminary hearing reinforced for Thompson that his fate in court is intertwined with his position as an activist. Thompson had spoken out numerous times about his belief that Johnson and other city leaders have pushed callous and dismissive policies toward their homeless constituents. He ultimately decided to make a public statement about the mayor with a soft, fluffy dessert not known for inflicting injuries. On November 3, Thompson’s attorney, Claire White, walked into the preliminary hearing with hopes of getting the assault charge dropped from a felony to a misdemeanor. Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz argued for keeping the legal stakes as high as possible for Thompson. It was a position White told Judge Paul Seave made no sense given what usually constitutes a felony assault in California. “The felonies we see in cases with this charge are for vicious attacks where significant injuries are sustained,” White asserted. “We have a young man who squashed a pie in someone’s face. This is textbook misdemeanor behavior.” Ortiz’s counter argument offered a rare glimpse into the district attorney’s approach to pursuing charges against political dissenters. Addressing the judge, Ortiz acknowledged that Johnson’s claim of getting “whiplash” from the pastry wasn’t the only reason for wanting a felony assault charge upheld. The prosecutor pointed to Thompson’s current activism as a motivating factor in keeping the charge severe. “Even after this incident happened, he called the mayor an asshole—he referred to him as a clown,” Ortiz said in closing statements. “The defendant has shown no remorse.” Legally, remorse can be a mitigating factor judges and prosecutors consider when weighing the severity of charges or sentencing. Ortiz stressed that Thompson’s decision not to renounce his political statement about Johnson was an element of the prosecutor’s refusal to sign off on lowering his charges. Seave ultimately sided with the DA’s office. Walking out of the courtroom, a surprised White told her client, “I guess they want a real fight.” It’s a fight the taxpayers will have to finance. For the National Lawyers Guild, the common thread linking Sale, Hampton and Thompson is that they’re all considered leaders within the local activist community. “Jamier Sale and Maile Hampton happen to be individuals who have helped organize some of these events. It’s not a secret,” Vellucci noted. “Sean Thompson had been arrested for protesting numerous times, and he was well-known as a key activist before the pie incident with the mayor.” Sunderland’s activism has been even better documented by Sacramento media. When asked if county prosecutors ever discuss with arresting officers whether a defendant is perceived as a leader at a protest event, Grippi declined to give a direct answer. His email did state that the office recognizes the importance of the First Amendment. “We are cognizant of the vital role of protest in American democracy and strive to evaluate potential charges related to conduct occurring during demonstrations with sensitivity to the importance of free speech and dissent,” Grippi wrote. “We also recognize there will be those who will exercise their right to disagree with charging decisions. … This, too, is part of a healthy democracy.” On a corner of the capital lawn, during a recent protest against the next president, Sale thought of Hampton and decided the pieces don’t add up. “How many of our public resources are being used to hold this misdemeanor trial for my sister?” he wondered aloud. “The only reason they would spend all that money is to try to dissuade people from protesting.” Tweet Contact us about this story RELATED LINKS: See all stories published in News See all stories published in Local Stories Reader Comments Displaying 2 comments.

( no matter if they be 1st or 8th) whose “hand are tied” will not budge on my misdemeanor charges, trying to subject a hard working mother with no prior record to 90 days jail time. Again the judge feels this is extream. I can never forget how, unprofessional the two officer I meet that night, where. I still can’t forget the look the officer gave me when he heard me tell the nurse my HIV status. The way the courts, and jail have manipulated an ill man, and knowingly exposed other inmates to infectious blood. The way they show no common decency, nor respect for their fellow man, is deplorable. I have lost more faith in humanity living and working in Sacramento, than Baltimore. It is due to the legal system, the people among us who’s job is :to protect and serve. I pray for those who have found them self afflicted by the corruption. LESS Sign in to submit a comment: e-mail: password: Don't have a login yet? Join now!, it's fast and free! Help!

News World Donald Trump is right: Silicon Valley needs to invest in America If tech companies agree to put a modest amount of money into projects outside their own sector, they will create jobs, bolster communities and contribute to greater social cohesion in America – Trump is right to nudge them to do so Kevin Maney Monday 2 January 2017 11:45 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Mike Pence listens as Donald Trump addresses tech chiefs in New York last month. From left: Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google parent Alphabet’s Larry Page and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg Getty When Donald Trump met with technology leaders in December to tell them he wanted them to create jobs in the US, their heads probably tilted to the side, as if you tried to explain physics to your dog and she just watched your lips moving and wondered when, among all those unfamiliar sounds, she was going to hear the word “treat”. Tech leaders aren’t in the business of creating jobs. They’re in business to help us do more with less. They like innovation and disruption and software eating the world but people – er, not so much. In his own Chance-the-gardener way, the President-elect might be on to something. His victory was a middle-finger salute from those who feeling left out by technology and globalisation. The tech industry’s trend is toward leaving more people out by automating yet more lower-level jobs while creating only high-skilled jobs. It’s becoming clear that if tech doesn’t change that trajectory, the consequences might look something like the Visigoths attacking Rome in 410. Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Larry Page and a bunch of their peers slinked into Trump Tower on 14 December for a meeting with the President-elect, who doesn’t use a computer, probably has never used Uber and no doubt thinks team messaging app Slack is what he finds at the tips of his gloves. If you can imagine how top neurosurgeons would react to a lecture on the brain by a TV chef – well, that’s how the tech leaders must have felt in this session. Trump praised the chief executives for the great work they do but once the doors closed, he reportedly told the group they need to create more US jobs – and not just for artificial intelligence specialists in Silicon Valley. He apparently emphasised that to make a difference, tech would need to invest in boots-on-the-ground jobs in the middle of the country. Tech companies have changed the employment landscape in the US (Getty) He’s right, in that tech companies played a have major role in creating the yawning wealth gap between digital America and analogue America. Look at one indicator: revenue-per-employee across different industries. Wal-Mart, which operates staff-intensive retail stores spread across the planet, employs 2.1 million people. Its revenue per employee stays pretty constant at $220,000 (£180,000). General Motors, a major manufacturer, does better: its revenue per employee is around £570,000. Now look at Facebook. Its revenue per employee is $1.4m, double GM’s. Apple bludgeons Facebook’s performance with $2.1m in revenue for each person who works there – 10 times that of Wal-Mart. But…Apple, the most valuable company in America, directly employs just 66,000 – the number of people who go to see a typical NFL game. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart’s stock is about the same price it was in 2012. At companies such as Facebook and Apple, far more money is flowing into far fewer hands. And most of those hands are in tech corridors in California’s Bay Area or the north-east. It’s hard to completely blame tech chief executives for this disparity. This is how business is set up in America. We reward productivity and efficiency – i.e. getting more from less. But Trump is asking business – as Steve Jobs might have put it – to think different. Trump is telling tech companies  numbers aren’t everything and don’t account for making a huge swath of the nation miserable. For that matter, the numbers won’t mean anything at all if the sense of being left out tears apart the social fabric and ignites a furious backlash. The disrupters might find themselves disrupted. And Trump’s right. IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty told the meeting her company will create 25,000 more jobs in the US. But her promise is a sign of tech’s obtuse thinking about jobs. Writing in USA Today a day before meeting Trump, Rometty said: “This is not about white collar vs. blue collar jobs but about the ‘new collar’ jobs that employers in many industries demand, but which remain largely unfilled.” She pointed out that 500,000 jobs are open in the tech sector because companies can’t find people with the right skills. But here’s essentially what Rometty and a whole lot of tech CEOs are saying – and I’m liberally paraphrasing, here: if only the unemployed and undereducated dumb asses would take some courses in Python coding, they could move to San Francisco, solve our programmer shortage and we’d pay them a hundred grand. Yet how realistic is that? The US is a highly educated society, and still just one-third of Americans are university graduates. A large swath of the country will never find their way into the tech ecosystem. And, by the way, a lot of people actually want to live in places that have little traffic and an absence of Asian-fusion vegan restaurants. Amazon is a huge employer with nearly 270,000 staff (Reuters) What can tech CEOs really do about jobs? There was vast wealth in that room with Trump, and there is so much more spread throughout the tech sector. The industry needs to promote the idea that some of its wealth should be deployed to build or keep alive schools, parks, bookstores, newspapers, orchestras, bowling alleys, small manufacturers or whatever else helps communities thrive and can’t be reduced to an artificial intelligence bot. The profit margins might suck, but if you can break even and sustain it, you’d be giving back in a way that helps the country and might even save your industry down the line. Jeff Bezos is setting a pretty good example. Amazon employs more people than most tech companies its size. The count today is 268,900, and Amazon’s revenue per employee is about £380,000 – less than GM’s. More significantly, in 2013 Bezos spent £200m to acquire The Washington Post. The Post is a terrible business. But it’s a public good, and it’s labour-intensive. Bezos is worth $66 billion, so to him the purchase was like you or me buying a pair of shoes. But Bezos took the kind of action there that can make a difference outside of technology. It’s an old-school way of thinking, but it deserves a new look. Back at the turn of the 20th century, one of the most progressive chief executives in America was a guy named George F Johnson. He ran Endicott-Johnson Shoes, then one of the biggest shoemakers in the world. Johnson built homes for his workers and sold them at cost. For the community, he built a library, a golf course, two hospitals and funded a minor league baseball team. When asked why he did such costly things, Johnson was known to say, “I’m out to make all I can of this concern, not take all I can out of it.” This was in my hometown. To this day, there are statues of Johnson there, and streets named after him. He is a legend and a hero. One hundred years from now, will anybody say the same about the people who met with Trump that day? © Newsweek More about: Silicon Valley Trump Donald Trump Talking points America Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

(WASHINGTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) BY Elizabeth Elizalde NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 10:17 PM A West Virginia man repeatedly stalked women at an Ohio Walmart and allegedly admitted to masturbating into syringes to squirt them with his semen, according to an arrest affidavit. Timothy Blake, 26, was charged on Dec. 30 with menace by stalking in connection to public masturbation incidents in the past two months. Ohio police said they received a report on Nov. 2 from a woman who said a "creepy" man followed her around Walmart, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CBS News. The woman told police she felt something wet on her lower back and then rushed to the bathroom to clean up the sticky substance. When she came out, the man was already waiting and staring at her, the affidavit states. Off-duty NYPD cop busted for stealing soap from Newburgh Walmart Authorities received a similar report from another woman on Dec. 28. Police managed to track down Blake by reviewing surveillance footage from both incidents that showed him fleeing the scene in his white pickup truck. Police say Blake admitted to masturbating into the syringes before stalking women at an Ohio Walmart.  (Seth Perlman/AP) After taken into custody, Blake told police that he threw egg yolks at the women. He then came clean when police tested the substance to be semen. Blake allegedly admitted to masturbating into the syringes in his vehicle or the Walmart bathroom before aiming at his victims. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” the affidavit states.

Surveillance video from Walmart showed Jemison and Jones arguing with each other, Tomball police said. According to investigators, Jemison hit Jones with the helmet, causing him to collapse inside the store. Jones died at the hospital. His girlfriend, Lindsey Stover, told ABC13 that Jones was withdrawing money to give a friend before the encounter with Jemison. She believes it was only about $60. "I don't think it was spur of the moment. This guy saw an old enemy," Stover said.

(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Lauren ZumbachContact ReporterChicago Tribune A Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market store at the Presidential Towers apartment complex in the West Loop will close at the end of the month, Wal-Mart said Wednesday. The store, which opened in 2011, was the Bentonville, Ark.-based chain's first Chicago Neighborhood Market — a smaller, grocery-focused Wal-Mart store. The decision to close came "after rigorous review and consideration of various factors," said Wal-Mart spokesperson Delia Garcia. The store will remain open until Jan. 25, though pharmacy customers can continue to pick up prescriptions until Feb. 3, Garcia said. Wal-Mart will work with the store's 100 employees to try to find opportunities to transfer to other locations, she said. Chicago-based Waterton, owner of Presidential Towers, first learned the store would be closing Tuesday but plans to "work diligently" to find a suitable replacement, said Waterton general counsel Erin Ankin. lzumbach@chicagotribune.com Twitter @laurenzumbach Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune APphoto_Retail Sales No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target A Target store offers 'quiet hours' for its autistic customers Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 31°

JANUARY 3--A West Virginia man confessed to following female shoppers around Walmart and squirting them with semen contained in a syringe, according to a criminal complaint filed against the accused pervert. Timothy Blake, 28, was arrested Friday by Ohio cops investigating a pair of vile incidents involving women “getting an unknown material sprayed or thrown on them by an unknown male.” Blake, pictured at right, was freed from custody today after posting $11,000 bond. Charged with a pair of felony obscenity counts, Blake has been ordered to wear a GPS monitor as part of his release conditions. In early-November, a Walmart shopper told police that a “creepy” man lingered near her in the store’s makeup aisle. After the man passed behind her, the shopper “felt something wet on her foot and lower back.” The woman then went to the bathroom “and tried to wipe the material off her but it was sticky.” On December 28, another woman told police that “some substance” had been “thrown or sprayed on her” while she was shopping at the same Walmart in Marietta, a city across the Ohio River from West Virginia. A review of store surveillance footage revealed that the suspect in last week’s incident was identical to the “creepy” man spotted in November. After identifying the truck driven by the suspect, cops confronted Blake at a Wings Etc. restaurant as he sat down for dinner with his wife. When asked what he was throwing on the female victims, Blake first claimed that it was egg yolks. But when police advised that they “had the material tested,” Blake “then admitted that it was semen in the containers he was squirting” at the buttocks of women. Blake, cops say, admitted to entering a single Walmart store on about 12 occasions “and squirting this material on women.” The defendant, according to a criminal complaint, “stated on about four of those occasions he had squirted semen on women and the other times he had used egg yolks and flour or spit.” Blake said that he would “masturbate in his vehicle somewhere and ejaculate into a syringe. The defendant stated sometimes he would masturbate in the Walmart bathroom, but in either case, spray it on the unwitting women,” according to the court filing. Blake said he had access to syringes since he owned a farm and inoculated animals. Blake said he targeted the victim in the early-November spraying because he “thought she displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed.” When asked if the semen spraying was like having a sexual encounter with the victim, Blake told cops that, “maybe it was his way of having sex with these women and that was what he thought of when committing these acts.” (6 pages) Tweet Walmart Squirter TAGS semen, Ohio, Walmart, pervert ‹ previous Document Police: Video Voyeur Copped To Weekly Ritual next › Document Friday Photo Fun Match Game Featured January 12, 2017 DOCUMENT: Crime Woman Caught With Purloined Prophylactics Cops: Suspect stole 31 boxes of Trojan condoms from market January 13, 2017 DOCUMENT: Internet, Crime Friday Photo Fun Match Game January 9, 2017 DOCUMENT: Sex, Crime Cops: Woman, 61, Clobbered Hubby For Sex Refusal Most Popular DOCUMENT: Woman Caught With Purloined Prophylactics DOCUMENT: Bill O'Reilly Falafel Lawsuit Turns Ten BUSTER: Masseuse, 70, Busted After Offering To Lend Undercover Cop A Hand (For $60) DOCUMENT: Porn Actress Pleads In Teen Sex Party Case DOCUMENT: Cops: Woman, 61, Clobbered Hubby For Sex Refusal The Smoking Gun © 2015 TSG Industries Inc.

Michael-Candice Ingram, 23, faces a misdemeanor charge of battery resulting in bodily injury. The incident happened Dec. 31 just before 5:30 p.m. at a Wal-Mart located in the 5800 block of West 10th Street. According to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Ingram was working at the customer service desk when an argument ensued between Ingram and a customer who wanted to use her own last name on a money transfer. When Ingram told the customer she could not use the name in place of a reference number, the customer called Ingram an expletive. As the customer walked away from the desk, Ingram approached her, grabbing her by the hair and punching her in the back of the head. Police say a manager at the store saw Ingram hitting the customer and removed Ingram, taking her to the back room. The victim has refused medical attention. Ingram was transported to the Arrestee Processing Center downtown. Ingram returns to court on March 6 for a pretrial.

L-R: Jam Master Jay, Joe 'Run' Simmons and Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels. By KristianoAng When is a deal a steal, and when is it too good to be true? It’s a question that brands ranging from consumer electronics makers to musicians are hoping consumers will ask more often. Last week, the hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. filed a $50 million lawsuit against retailers including Amazon AMZN, +0.43%   and Walmart WMT, -1.24%   alleging that they had allowed the sale and marketing of fake versions of copyright-protected products like apparel and hats. The New York City rappers are in august company. Other complainants include companies like Apple AAPL, -0.18%  , which claims that approximately 90% of branded chargers sold on Amazon are pirated, and Birkenstock, which stopped selling through Amazon due to what the sandals maker said was a massive counterfeit problem. That problem, of course, isn’t limited to Amazon. In December, Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s(BABA) Taobao e-commerce platform was placed on the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of “notorious markets,” and a recent report from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development claimed that up to $461 billion in counterfeit goods were traded in 2013, a sum that industry insiders say is likely to have increased since. With “the internet being largely unregulated, there was a perfect storm for the counterfeiting problem to go fantastically out of control,” says Bharat Dube, chief executive of Strategic IP Information, a brand protection agency. Dube says his clients are increasingly finding third-party resellers on Amazon to be a major problem. The rub is in Amazon’s “open marketplace” philosophy, which translates into the company not proactively removing potential counterfeited items, though it is quick to do so once brands complain, says James Thomson, a former top executive at the internet giant’s third-party seller platform. “Even if you remove a counterfeiter, five new ones will show up tomorrow,” says Thomson, now the co-founder of Prosper Show, an e-commerce education platform. According to some estimates, Amazon has over two million third-party resellers, who sold up to half the paid goods on the platform in the third quarter of 2016. How credit scores predict what you will buy next(2:22) For decades, FICO has used big data and mathematical algorithms to calculate people's three-digit credit scores. Now it's using the same technology to predict whether a consumer's likely to buy a product in-store or click on a link online. The “open marketplace” policy means Amazon generally doesn’t inspect products for authenticity before they’re sold, but rather waits for brands to complain about them. It’s an open marketplace because in theory, almost anyone can sell almost anything. Amazon, which didn’t respond to multiple requests to comment for this article, has pre-approval processes for some product categories. Consumer electronics don’t generally require a nod from Amazon, while apparel sellers need to provide high-resolution images and UPC codes. Health and beauty goods merchants have to supply Amazon with certain documentation. But industry observers still see counterfeit goods slip through the cracks. (Walmart didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Here are three ways customers can reduce their chances of being conned. 1. If a deal seems too good to be true, it usually is. “People have good instincts,” says Ryan Robison, president of the Robison Group, a detective agency. “The biggest tell-tale is the price.” So if a pair of Ray-Bans, which typically retail for over $100, are going for $12.99, then buyer beware. “Almost always, the incentive for people to buy [suspect goods] is that they’re cheaper,” says Thomson. “But the reason they’re cheaper is because they haven’t been tested and certified.” Another thing to look for is a lengthy history of positive customer feedback. And many big brands also list their authorized resellers on their website. And be wary if the online seller calls itself something like “We Love Selling Cheap Stuff.” Also check to see if the company has a returns policy and make sure to pay over the retailer’s platform and not a third-party -- over which Amazon and its counterparts have no control. 2. Mind the provenance. While major labels have customer protection teams scouring the internet for fakes, that’s not the case for the thousands of smaller, non-household names that are an integral part of the Amazon eco-system. And many of their counterfeited competitors originate from China. “I don’t want to pick on China, but that’s where most of the counterfeits are coming from,” says Thomson, who attributes this partly to Chinese postal subsidies, which can make shipping from Guangzhou to New York cheaper than sending a package from Los Angeles to Manhattan. Chinese fakers are an especially big problem for electronic accessories shoppers, he says. The sheer scale of Chinese production capacity compounds this problem. “There are some well-established private labels but it’s hard for the customer to know who they are because there are literally 100 times more counterfeits floating around,” he says. 3. Consider returning an item if the packaging is suspect. “It can be basic things such as not having plastic covering on the handbag’s handle,” says Dube, who formerly headed the anti-counterfeiting team at Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, owner of brands like Dunhill. If there’s no retail packaging or UPC barcodes, it might be worth your while seeking a refund. And things might get better. For fear that counterfeiters will seize the information and use it to improve their fakes, most brands don’t publicly provide information on how to discern an original product from a fake. But Fakr, a phone app designed by a company run by Robison that allows employees to alert businesses to potential fakes, is planning to open up access to the public. Industry observers also say that the likes of Amazon and Alibaba are working on better counter-piracy schemes, which the emergence of more sophisticated artificial intelligence could improve.

L-R: Jam Master Jay, Joe 'Run' Simmons and Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels. By KristianoAng When is a deal a steal, and when is it too good to be true? It’s a question that brands ranging from consumer electronics makers to musicians are hoping consumers will ask more often. Last week, the hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. filed a $50 million lawsuit against retailers including Amazon AMZN, +0.43%   and Walmart WMT, -1.24%   alleging that they had allowed the sale and marketing of fake versions of copyright-protected products like apparel and hats. The New York City rappers are in august company. Other complainants include companies like Apple AAPL, -0.18%  , which claims that approximately 90% of branded chargers sold on Amazon are pirated, and Birkenstock, which stopped selling through Amazon due to what the sandals maker said was a massive counterfeit problem. That problem, of course, isn’t limited to Amazon. In December, Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s(BABA) Taobao e-commerce platform was placed on the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of “notorious markets,” and a recent report from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development claimed that up to $461 billion in counterfeit goods were traded in 2013, a sum that industry insiders say is likely to have increased since. With “the internet being largely unregulated, there was a perfect storm for the counterfeiting problem to go fantastically out of control,” says Bharat Dube, chief executive of Strategic IP Information, a brand protection agency. Dube says his clients are increasingly finding third-party resellers on Amazon to be a major problem. The rub is in Amazon’s “open marketplace” philosophy, which translates into the company not proactively removing potential counterfeited items, though it is quick to do so once brands complain, says James Thomson, a former top executive at the internet giant’s third-party seller platform. “Even if you remove a counterfeiter, five new ones will show up tomorrow,” says Thomson, now the co-founder of Prosper Show, an e-commerce education platform. According to some estimates, Amazon has over two million third-party resellers, who sold up to half the paid goods on the platform in the third quarter of 2016. How credit scores predict what you will buy next(2:22) For decades, FICO has used big data and mathematical algorithms to calculate people's three-digit credit scores. Now it's using the same technology to predict whether a consumer's likely to buy a product in-store or click on a link online. The “open marketplace” policy means Amazon generally doesn’t inspect products for authenticity before they’re sold, but rather waits for brands to complain about them. It’s an open marketplace because in theory, almost anyone can sell almost anything. Amazon, which didn’t respond to multiple requests to comment for this article, has pre-approval processes for some product categories. Consumer electronics don’t generally require a nod from Amazon, while apparel sellers need to provide high-resolution images and UPC codes. Health and beauty goods merchants have to supply Amazon with certain documentation. But industry observers still see counterfeit goods slip through the cracks. (Walmart didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Here are three ways customers can reduce their chances of being conned. 1. If a deal seems too good to be true, it usually is. “People have good instincts,” says Ryan Robison, president of the Robison Group, a detective agency. “The biggest tell-tale is the price.” So if a pair of Ray-Bans, which typically retail for over $100, are going for $12.99, then buyer beware. “Almost always, the incentive for people to buy [suspect goods] is that they’re cheaper,” says Thomson. “But the reason they’re cheaper is because they haven’t been tested and certified.” Another thing to look for is a lengthy history of positive customer feedback. And many big brands also list their authorized resellers on their website. And be wary if the online seller calls itself something like “We Love Selling Cheap Stuff.” Also check to see if the company has a returns policy and make sure to pay over the retailer’s platform and not a third-party -- over which Amazon and its counterparts have no control. 2. Mind the provenance. While major labels have customer protection teams scouring the internet for fakes, that’s not the case for the thousands of smaller, non-household names that are an integral part of the Amazon eco-system. And many of their counterfeited competitors originate from China. “I don’t want to pick on China, but that’s where most of the counterfeits are coming from,” says Thomson, who attributes this partly to Chinese postal subsidies, which can make shipping from Guangzhou to New York cheaper than sending a package from Los Angeles to Manhattan. Chinese fakers are an especially big problem for electronic accessories shoppers, he says. The sheer scale of Chinese production capacity compounds this problem. “There are some well-established private labels but it’s hard for the customer to know who they are because there are literally 100 times more counterfeits floating around,” he says. 3. Consider returning an item if the packaging is suspect. “It can be basic things such as not having plastic covering on the handbag’s handle,” says Dube, who formerly headed the anti-counterfeiting team at Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, owner of brands like Dunhill. If there’s no retail packaging or UPC barcodes, it might be worth your while seeking a refund. And things might get better. For fear that counterfeiters will seize the information and use it to improve their fakes, most brands don’t publicly provide information on how to discern an original product from a fake. But Fakr, a phone app designed by a company run by Robison that allows employees to alert businesses to potential fakes, is planning to open up access to the public. Industry observers also say that the likes of Amazon and Alibaba are working on better counter-piracy schemes, which the emergence of more sophisticated artificial intelligence could improve.

January 4, 2017 By Christopher Koulouris Share on Facebook   Share on Twitter Because Timothy Blake just couldn’t help himself… What led to Timothy Blake squirting syringes of his own semen on unsuspecting female shoppers at a Marietta, Ohio, Walmart store? Timothy Blake a mystery man who over the course of recent months had been squirting syringes of his own semen on to the backsides of unsuspecting women has been arrested. The man’s arrest comes after authorities told of Blake following female shoppers at a Marietta, Ohio, Walmart store where over the last couple of months the man had in no less than 12 instances squired his own semen on the women from a tube. According to an arrest warrant cited by The Parkersburg News and Sentinel Timothy D Blake a 28 year old Sams Creek Road, Mineral Wells , West Virginia man had strategically carried out his feats of terrorism as he took to following women around a Walmart store in Washington County. Having masturbated his own fluid and placed it in a tube, Blake targeted female shoppers for his own sadistic pleasure, as he watched unsuspecting suspects struggle to come to terms with what had just happened to them. The man’s arrest over the new year came after a female victim noticed a ‘creepy man’ lingering around her whilst shopping in the makeup aisle of a Walmart store when she felt something wet an squishy on her backside. Oh no! Not again? Upon going to the bathroom in a bid to clean the ‘liquid’ off the woman noticed the fluid was ‘sticky’, before realizing what it was. But it gets better. After returning from the bathroom the woman told of Blake staring at her. Delicious! Omaha Westside High freshmen add semen to home economic teacher cake, notices something off….

Bullied high school girl feeds semen filled cupcakes to her tormentors Have you managed to taste semen in your yoghurt too lately? It was while the man tried leaving the store that the female victim followed him, where she was able to take down his driving particulars after noticing the man get into a company oil truck. It wasn’t soon there after that the woman’s description of her assailant matched that of other victims that Blake’s arrest was made. Of note, a report via WTAP told of the man being arrested while eating dinner at a restaurant with his wife. Told Sheriff Mincks of the Washington County Sheriff’s Office: ‘It’s not something that we’ve encountered before and after we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said it was something that he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it’. According to the criminal complaint, Blake claimed the material used was egg yolks until an officer advised that they’d had the material tested, at which point he admitted to it being semen, but only some of the time.  According to a court filing, Blake said he would masturbate in his truck or in the Walmart parking lot and then fill a syringe with his bodily fluid. When pressed as to what he thought he was doing, he replied ‘maybe it was his way of having sex with these women and that was what he thought of when committing these acts.’  Blake also said he was molested as a child, while saying his wife was completely unaware of his activities.   Blake allegedly drove three company trucks, all 2014 Fords, one black, one white and the third brown, during his alleged acts. According to the Smoking Gun, Blake was released on $11,000 bond on Tuesday but he is required to wear a GPS ankle monitor as part of his release conditions.   In the interim, investigators have asked other possible victims to come forward… Timothy Blake’s escapades took place at a local Marietta, Ohio, Walmart store.

The incident took place at around 1am on Monday at the Walmart on State Highway 249 in Tomball where the victim, 37-yer-old Justin 'JJ' Jones, was shopping with a friend.  According to investigators, at some point Jones and the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Michael Jemison, had some words and the younger man struck the victim with his motorcycle helmet, knocking him unconscious and causing him to collapse to the floor.

But needed repairs to a natural gas line may cause a delay. Storms in central Mississippi near Mendenhall and Mount Olive were identified as tornadoes by the National Weather Service, based in part on radar signatures. Both storms damaged farm buildings and homes.  Freddie Zeigler, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's New Orleans office, said heavy winds were preceding the squall line, possibly contributing to power outages. Pictured: Crews removing debris in Covington County, Mississippi In Louisiana, there was also relatively serious damage in the southwestern parishes of Beauregard and Allen, including the town of Reeves.  Some wind damage was also reported in Houston and throughout East Texas.  Though Arkansas had also been included in warnings, there was only a stray report of hail in Jackson County in the northeast part of the state. Freddie Zeigler, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's New Orleans office, said heavy winds were preceding the squall line, possibly contributing to power outages.

According to CBS News, a man named Timothy Blake was arrested for shooting semen at women in a Walmart. Related: Woman Adheres To A Strict Diet Of Sperm Smoothies & Semen Facials Per the report, multiple women revealed they encountered a "creepy" man at a Walmart in Ohio during the months of November and December. All the ladies claimed the perp would follow them around the store like prey while also staring them down. To make matters even more terrifying, two of the women recalled experiencing shock and "panic" upon feeling something sticky hit their bodies when Timothy got close to them. While the poor victims had no idea what the substance was at the time, police have now learned it was Timothy's semen. Though Blake initially tried to lie about the contents, he finally admitted to masturbating into the syringe before shooting victims with his sick concoction. Apparently this was the criminal's way of having "sex" with his victims. Mr. Blake then targeted women he believed "displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed." Umm… yeah. As of now, Timothy is currently in jail and is waiting to be arraigned. We'll definitely keep you updated as we receive more info on this case.

(AL BEHRMAN/AP) Trademark protection lands Etsy seller in trouble with Procter & Gamble Add to ... Susan Krashinsky Robertson - MARKETING REPORTER The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:16PM EST Last updated Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:18PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Ryan Ma’s business operation is so small that he has been hand-addressing all the envelopes he bought at Wal-Mart to send his product to customers. But in the age of online commerce, it was still big enough to attract the ire of Procter & Gamble Co. Mr. Ma had been noticing the criticism of Apple Inc.’s new wireless ear buds – called AirPods – which will likely be a growing product in the new year, as Apple’s new phones come without a headphone jack. Among the criticisms were that the small, untethered buds would be easy to lose or steal, with some noting that their case looks like a packet of dental floss. Mr. Ma decided that making them actually look like dental floss might be a theft deterrent. So on Sunday, he designed a sticker to place on the packet to do just that, and put it up for sale on Etsy. The idea quickly received coverage on news websites such as Gizmodo.com. “It kind of blew up from there,” he said. The problem was that he had used real designs as his inspiration, and the sticker looked a lot like P&G’s Oral-B brand of dental floss, called Glide. Mr. Ma’s sticker listed “Oral O” and “Glides” as its brand names, and borrowed the blue-and-white colouring and font style of P&G’s labels. On Wednesday, Mr. Ma received a message from Etsy saying that his listing had been deactivated following a trademark infringement notice from “Procter & Gamble Business Services Canada Company.” “I freaked out a bit,” Mr. Ma said. He revamped the sticker and renamed it “Flossy,” and reposted the listing. (P&G did not reply to a request for comment.) “I didn’t think it would take off, it was just sort of a joke,” Mr. Ma said, explaining that he had only ordered 250 stickers printed . The case raises an interesting question about trademark protection. It does not actually matter that the purpose here was not to use the brand to undercut P&G and sell floss, or that Mr. Ma’s fledgling business is tiny – the fact that the label was clearly based on P&G’s design would be enough to raise concerns. “This happens every day,” said Eric Macramalla, a partner at Gowling WLG in Ottawa who focuses on intellectual property law. “If trademark owners don’t protect their trademarks, then the strength of your trademark gets diluted … and ultimately, they may altogether lose the ability to effectively enforce their rights against other parties. So while big brand owners may be seen as the bad guy when they go after the little guy, it is important that they do so.” Report Typo/Error Follow Susan Krashinsky Robertson on Twitter: @susinsky Also on The Globe and Mail Etsy to launch crowdfunding platform to help artisans finance production (BNN Video)   PG-NProcter & Gamble Co Latest Price$84.01 +0.17 (+0.20%) Updated January 13 4:01 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Timothy Daniel Blake (Photo: Washington County Sheriff’s Office) Timothy D. Blake, 26, is charged with two counts of pandering obscenity, one count of menacing by stalking and one count of sexual imposition, according to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. The charges stem from two separate incidents involving the Mineral Wells, West Virginia man. In the first incident on Nov. 2, a woman reported a man lingering behind her at a Wal-Mart in Marietta, according to an affidavit obtained by CBS News. She said the suspect was walking a few inches behind her when she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. The woman said she hurried to a restroom and found a “sticky” substance. On Dec. 28, police responded to a similar report and noticed the same white pickup truck driving out of the parking lot in surveillance footage.  When officers questioned the owner of the truck, Blake, he initially claimed he threw eggs at the women, but later admitted to masturbating into a syringe either in his truck or in the Wal-Mart bathroom, CBS reported. Blake also said he had used syringes to spray eggs, spit or semen on women a dozen times, according to the affidavit. Deputies arrested Blake on Dec. 30 and took him to the Washington County Jail. 39.415352 -81.454844 Filed in: News Topics: Ohio, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular Uber Driver Killed, Passenger Critically Injured in 2 Car Hit-And-Run-Crash in South Los Angeles; Driver Identified Georgia Girl, 12, Live-Streams Suicide on Social Media; Police Say They Can’t Stop Video’s Spread Virginia Man Pays Taxes With 300,000 Pennies to ‘Inconvenience’ DMV Autopsy Results Show New Mexico Girl Was Raped and Strangled on Her 10th Birthday, Had STD at Time of Her Death Latest News Residents in Riverside County Community Outraged After Family Dog Fatally Shot Riverside Police Seek Men Who Allegedly Tried to Kidnap Woman Obama Offers President-Elect Trump Advice During Final ’60 Minutes’ Interview Author, Former State Librarian Kevin Starr Dies at 76 Nation/World Good Samaritan Fatally Shot in Texas Wal-Mart Parking Lot After Trying to Stop Domestic Assault: Police Chief Nation/World Stranger Grabbed, Choked 4-Month-Old in Wal-Mart Checkout Line, Kansas Mother Says Local News Temple City Man Accused of Killing Woman, Stabbing 3 Others Faces 7 Felony Charges Nation/World 5 Malnourished Children Found Living in Car Parked at Florida Wal-Mart; 2 Arrested Local News Lancaster Man Convicted of Raping, Sexually Assaulting Multiple Women Over 5-Year Period: DA’s Office Local News Woman Sentenced to 1 Year in Jail for Impersonating Ex-Boyfriend on Facebook, Sending Herself Threats: OC District Attorney Local News Woman Jailed for Months in ‘Rape Fantasy’ Ads Hoax Was Framed by Ex-Fiance’s Wife: Orange County DA Nation/World Pennsylvania Student Allegedly Put Bleach in Pregnant Girlfriend’s Water Bottle to Harm Unborn Baby Local News Huntington Beach Man Charged With Murder, Arson, Mayhem in Death of 2 Women Local News Long Beach Man Charged With Kidnapping, Sexually Assaulting 2 Teen Girls: DA’s Office Nation/World Arrest Made in Suspected Road-Rage Shooting Death of 3-Year-Old Boy in Arkansas News Washington Man Accused of Decapitating 2 Women, Burning House Down After ‘Hearing Voices’ Local News Man Convicted of Raping Boyle Heights Woman After Breaking Into Her Home Armed With Machete Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Wal-Mart de Mexico, Grupo Comercial Chedraui, Grupo Elektra and Organizacion Soriana stores were among those targeted this week in a wave of anger about the “gasolinazo,” or fuel-price slam. Looting, preemptive store closings and trucks robberies have been widely reported in local press and social media since Tuesday night. Even before the unrest, retailers were expected to take the biggest hit by the hike. The increase is likely to erode purchasing power and consumer sentiment that’s already suffering as a weaker peso fuels concern about inflation. The government is letting gas prices surge as part of a plan to gradually cede control of the fuel market to private development following a landmark energy overhaul in 2013. Antad, the Mexican retailers’ association, said it was a “tough” night for stores and that government efforts haven’t been enough to calm the situation. The association is meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo to discuss the matter, Manuel Cardona, the group’s head of government relations, said in an interview with Radio Red on Thursday. The economic fallout hasn’t been estimated, he said. Walmex, Soriana, Elektra and Chedraui didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Walmex, controlled by U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell as much as 2.1 percent in Mexico City trading. Planigrupo Latam, a real estate investment company, said in a filing that two malls in which it has a controlling stake were looted and vandalized Wednesday and Thursday in Mexico state. The company is working with local and federal authorities to protect the locations and the people who work there, the company said. In a conference Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto said he understood public outrage over the gas-price hike, but that it was a necessary move to reflect higher global prices.

Man Used Syringe To Squirt Semen On Women At Ohio Walmart Posted: Thursday, January 5, 2017 3:26 PM EST Updated: Thursday, January 5, 2017 3:26 PM EST Photo: Washington County Ohio Sheriff's Office MARIETTA, Ohio - Police say a West Virginia man repeatedly stalked women at a Walmart in Ohio and used a syringe to spray them with his own semen. According to CBS News, Timothy Blake was charged December 30 with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking.  According to an arrest affidavit, officials in Marietta say they initially received a report in early November from a woman who said she noticed a "creepy" man who "seemed to be lingering around her” while she was shopping at Walmart. The woman claimed a man was walking within a few inches behind her when she felt something wet hit her on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and went to a bathroom where she then discovered the substance was “sticky.” She then claimed to notice the man continued to watch her. Police say surveillance video from the store showed the man squirting the woman. A similar report was filed by a different woman in late December. Surveillance video from both incidents showed the suspect driving away in a pickup truck. The pickup truck was then spotted two days later by Marietta Police. When questioned by police, Blake initially told officials he had thrown egg yolks at the women, but an officer told him they tested the fluid. Blake then allegedly admitted it was semen. He then said he had used syringes to spray egg, spit or semen on women on a dozen occasions, according to the affidavit. Blake was booked into jail without bond, pending his arraignment.

Dennis Quan Tran, a 41-year-old man from Westminster, was found by the loading dock of a Wal-Mart located at 3600 West McFadden Avenue on Dec. 18 suffering from multiple stab wounds, according to a Santa Ana Police Department news release. Tran was rushed to a local hospital for emergency surgery, but he died of his injuries. Police obtained surveillance video from the store and used it to determine a person of interest in the case. However, they have been unable to identify the individual thus far, and have requested the public's help, the release stated. A description of the person was not provided. He was seen in the footage walking with the victim about 90 minutes before Tran was discovered with stab wounds. "We have additional video evidence that shows this person of interest walking to the loading dock area with our victim. And then they disappeared," said Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. The loading dock was the same one where the victim was found. "We think that if we can get this individual identified, then we can find out what their relationship was, and what this individual's involvement in the death of our victim is," Bertagna said. He added that the person was the department's "only lead" in the case at this point. Anyone who recognizes the individual or has information about the fatal stabbing is urged to call Santa Ana homicide detectives by dialing 714-245-8390. Anonymous tips can also be left by calling Orange County Crime Stoppers at 1-855-TIP-OCCS. Santa Ana police released surveillance images of a person of interested wanted in connection to a fatal stabbing outside a Wal-Mart. 33.737337 -117.915233 Related stories Man Found Stabbed to Death Outside of Wal-Mart in Santa Ana: Police Filed in: Local News Topics: Dennis Quan Tran, santa ana, santa ana police department, Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Twitter Popular Uber Driver Killed, Passenger Critically Injured in 2 Car Hit-And-Run-Crash in South Los Angeles; Driver Identified Georgia Girl, 12, Live-Streams Suicide on Social Media; Police Say They Can’t Stop Video’s Spread Virginia Man Pays Taxes With 300,000 Pennies to ‘Inconvenience’ DMV Autopsy Results Show New Mexico Girl Was Raped and Strangled on Her 10th Birthday, Had STD at Time of Her Death Latest News Residents in Riverside County Community Outraged After Family Dog Fatally Shot Riverside Police Seek Men Who Allegedly Tried to Kidnap Woman Obama Offers President-Elect Trump Advice During Final ’60 Minutes’ Interview Author, Former State Librarian Kevin Starr Dies at 76 Local News Man Found Stabbed to Death Outside of Wal-Mart in Santa Ana: Police Local News Santa Ana Police Pursue Suspected Stolen Vehicle Local News Santa Ana Police Look For 3 Men in Coffee Shop Armed Robbery Caught on Video Local News 2 Men Arrested in Connection With 1999 Kidnapping and Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl in Santa Ana; Cold Case Cracked by DNA Evidence Local News Authorities Arrest 24-Year-Old Son in Connection With Fatal Stabbing of Mother Inside Saugus Home Local News Man Killed in Santa Ana Hit-and-Run Crash: Police Seek Public’s Help Finding Driver Local News Authorities Seek Help Identifying Man Who Allegedly Robbed Santa Ana Gas Station Store Local News Man Who Attempted to Sexually Assault Woman After Exposing Himself Sought by Santa Ana Police Nation/World Dancing Officer Helps Raise Money for Salvation Army Outside Tennessee Wal-Mart Local News Daughter Arrested in Double Stabbing That Left Santa Fe Springs Man Dead, Girlfriend Wounded Local News Police Have ID’d Suspect Accused of Robbing 73-Year-Old Woman in Santa Ana CVS Parking Lot Local News Alleged Serial Shoplifter Arrested in Santa Ana: Police Local News Man Sets Fire Near Orange County Fire Stations, Burglarizes Them Once Firefighters Leave the Building Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Cops And Courts – January 6, 2017 Jan 05,2017 by Shawn Soper Assault Over NYE Food OCEAN CITY — A Belair, Md. woman was arrested on assault charges last weekend after allegedly throwing a beer can at the back of a man’s head during an early New Year’s Day morning argument over late night food. Around 2 a.m. on Sunday, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers responded to a midtown hotel for a reported domestic dispute that had already occurred. One officer met with a male victim in the reported hotel room, while another officer met with the suspect, identified as Jessica Pasko, 31, of Belair, in the hotel lobby. Pasko told police the couple had dated on and off in the past, but that she had broken off their relationship about a year earlier. However, they remained friends and came to Ocean City last weekend for a New Year’s Eve celebration. Pasko told police the pair had been out drinking off and on throughout the day and then returned to their room. According to police reports, the male victim told Pasko he had ordered food because neither of them had eaten all day. However, Pasko told the victim she was tired and would rather go to bed then eat the food he had ordered. Pasko told police that angered the male, who began screaming at her and pushed her to the floor in the hotel room. Pasko told police she got up and attempted to use the hotel phone to call police, but the male, identified as Joseph Garcia, also of Belair, pulled the phone from the wall. Pasko told police she then left the room and went to the hotel lobby to use the phone and Garcia followed. According to police reports, the hotel receptionist told the pair the police were on their way. Garcia returned to the hotel room and was later interviewed by police for his version of the events. Garcia told police it was Pasko that had ordered and paid for the late-night food and that she became angry when he decided to forego the food and just go to bed. According to Garcia, Pasko told him to leave the hotel room if he didn’t want to eat the food she had paid for, but when he gathered his belongings and started heading for the door, he was struck from behind in the back of the head by a full can of alcoholic beverage. According to police reports, Garcia had two deep and bleeding cuts on the back of his head, corroborating his version of the events. Garcia said he returned to the hotel room at Pasko’s request, but had waited on the balcony and held the sliding door shut while waiting for police to arrive. Based on the evidence, OCPD officers determined Pasko was the primary aggressor and she was arrested and charged with second-degree assault. Daughter Swiped Mom’s Credit Card OCEAN PINES — An Ocean Pines woman has been charged with multiple counts of theft after allegedly swiping her mother’s credit card and using it to make purchases including a flat-screen television. According to police reports, a 70-year-old Ocean Pines woman reported her credit cards stolen last Wednesday, Dec. 28. The victim told police her stolen credit cards had been used at the Wal-Mart on Route 50 in Berlin. An Ocean Pines police officer reviewed surveillance video at the Wal-Mart. Store management provided police with pictures of a female wearing a red jacket using the victim’s stolen credit card. The victim was then able to positively identify the suspect as her daughter, Heather Lynn Camp, 43, of Ocean Pines. Camp has been charged with two counts of theft of credit cards and three counts of charging a stolen credit card less than $500. She was taken before a District Court Commissioner and was ordered to be held on a $7,500 bond at the Worcester County Jail. False Armed Robbery Report OCEAN CITY — The Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) and allied law enforcement agencies last weekend searched for hours in vain for a suspect in a reported commercial armed robbery in the resort in what turned out to be a false report. Around 3:30 a.m. last Saturday, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) received a report of armed robbery at a commercial establishment. The OCPD and allied law enforcement agencies including a Worcester County Sheriff’s Office K-9 unit and the Maryland State Police Trooper 4 helicopter launched a manhunt for the alleged suspect in the reported armed robbery for several hours throughout the downtown area that concluded hours later around 8:30 a.m. However, after further questioning of the “victim” in the case, it turned out to be a false report and no armed robbery ever occurred. The OCPD and its allied agencies devoted several resources and man-hours to the search for the alleged “suspect.” However, no robbery ever occurred and the report turned out to be false. No further information was given about the location of the reported commercial armed robbery nor have any charges been announced for the alleged “victim” who started the false report. Scooter Assault SALISBURY — A Salisbury woman was arrested on first-degree assault and other charges last weekend after allegedly hitting a man over the head with a child’s scooter during a domestic incident. Around 2:15 a.m. last Saturday, a Wicomico County Sheriff’s deputy responded to a residence on Mineola Avenue for a reported domestic altercation. The deputy met with a male victim who reported he had just been assaulted by a female suspect, later identified as Dana Dennard, 28, of Salisbury, with a child’ scooter. During the ensuing investigation, the deputy learned the pair had been involved in a verbal argument that escalated when Dennard allegedly grabbed a child’s scooter and struck the male victim in the head. The deputy observed the male victim was bleeding profusely from a laceration on his head and that one of the scooter’s wheels had broken off and was lying by itself in the driveway. The deputy also observed what appeared to be blood on the scooter’s broken wheel. Based on the evidence and testimony, Dennard was arrested and charged with first- and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment. Wrong Way DUI OCEAN CITY — A New York man was arrested on drunk-driving and other charges last weekend after allegedly being observed speeding in downtown Ocean City and later going the wrong way on a one-way street at the Park-and-Ride in West Ocean City. Around 3:30 a.m. last Sunday, an Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officer was on stationary patrol in the area of 12th Street when he observed a vehicle heading south on Philadelphia Avenue at a high rate of speed. The officer observed the vehicle moving side to side in its lanes as it continued south and began pursuing it. The OCPD officer followed vehicle across the Route 50 bridge until it went the wrong way on an access point into the Park-and-Ride. The officer stopped the vehicle and made contact with the driver, identified as Exavier Lixence, 30, of New York, N.Y. Lixence did not perform to the officer’s satisfaction on field sobriety tests and was taken into custody on suspicion of driving while impaired and other traffic violations. Two Sentenced In Boardwalk Fight OCEAN CITY — Two more suspects arrested during a fight involving two groups of young people on the crowded south end of the Boardwalk in June pleaded guilty last week to various charges and each received jail time. Around 11:40 p.m. on June 12, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers responded to the area of Worcester Street and the Boardwalk for a reported fight between two groups of individuals. Upon arrival, OCPD officers observed the two groups yelling obscenities and enticing each other to fight. The altercation began to draw a large crowd of at least 100 onlookers on the crowded Boardwalk on a summer Saturday night. OCPD officers attempted to arrest the two primary instigators but both resisted. At that point, several members of the two groups became more uncooperative and several more officers were dispatched to the area to assist. Numerous individuals resisted arrest, which time OCPD officers targeted the combatants with Tasers to gain compliance and disperse the crowd. Among those arrested were Kameron Christopher, 18, of Delmar, who was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and second-degree assault; Allen D.J. Nelson, 19, of Salisbury, who was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering; and Luis Pirela-Linares, 20, of Salisbury, who was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering. Also arrested were Aaron Waples, 19, of Berlin, who was charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct; Jakhai Woodard, 18, of Berlin, who was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct; a 16-year-old male from Delmar, who was charged with second-degree assault and disturbing the peace; and a 15-year-old male from Snow Hill, who was charged with disorderly conduct. Last week, Christopher pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and resisting arrest and was sentenced to two years in jail. Also last week, Nelson pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. In November, Waples pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and second-degree escape and the sentenced to 60 days for the former and 95 days for the latter. Woodard and Pirela-Linares each have requested jury trials and their cases have been forwarded to Worcester County Circuit Court. Stet Docket For Resisting Arrest OCEAN CITY — A Salisbury woman, charged in November with resisting arrest and other counts after allegedly attempting to prevent Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers from taking into custody another individual involved in a fight in a downtown bar, had the charges against her put on the stet, or inactive, docket this week. Around 1 a.m. on Nov. 27, OCPD officers were attempting to arrest a man outside the Cowboy Coast bar and restaurant who had been involved in a fight inside the establishment. While officers were attempting to detain the man, a woman later identified as Elisia Fields, 23, of Salisbury, attempted to pull the suspect away from police while allegedly launching a steady stream of expletives. Fields was told to let go of the man and leave the area multiple times, but continued with her expletive-laced tirade as a crowd of at least 30 people gathered around to watch the scene. According to police reports, even after she had moved away, Fields fought her way back through the crowd and continued to try to prevent officers from arresting the suspect. Ultimately, Fields was arrested and charged with failure to obey a lawful order, resisting arrest and interfering with a lawful arrest. This week in District Court, however, Fields had the charges against her placed on the stet, or inactive, docket. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Shawn Soper Shawn Soper has been with The Dispatch since 2000.

Doling out $70 million, Wal-Mart said Thursday (Jan. 5) it acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy, a Zappos-like e-commerce business that offers more than 800 brands and a million-plus items online including footwear, clothing and accessories. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone and complementary site to Walmart.com and Jet.com and the retailer said it hopes this strategic deal will provide Jet an opportunity to learn from a well-established e-commerce player in the footwear industry. ShoeBuy offers popular brands such as Uggs, North Face, Rockport and Clarks with designer merchandise from Vera Wang, Ralph Lauren and Perry Ellis. Athletic footwear from Reebok, Adidas and Under Armor is also sold on the site. Wal-Mart said the deal with ShoeBuy brings access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships and rich content that will further enhance its customer experience. Mike Sorabella and his executive team, along with roughly 200 employees, will continue to be based in Boston and operate as a subsidiary of Jet and Wal-Mart. The retail giant said ShoeBuy suppliers interested in expanding their product reach will have the option to sell on Jet.com as well. The timing of the deal is likely not coincidental. Clothing and accessories sales have quickly gravitated online and Zappos has proven consumers will purchase shoes online and do it often. This is not Jet or Wal-Mart’s first attempt at acquiring expertise. Wal-Mart has long been a purchaser of talent and knowhow, evidenced by its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet in August of last year. Jet itself subscribes to the “buying knowledge” method having acquired home furnishing e-tailer Hayneedle for about $90 million in March of 2016. Wal-Mart’s top executives, CEO Doug McMillon and Walmart.com CEO Marc Lore, have each said the company is willing and able to seek out more of these types of acquisitions in the future. “It’s a fair assumption” that Jet and Walmart will pursue more of these types of acquisitions most likely “in the categories where they are long-tail, high margin products and harder-to-crack brands,” Lore said recently in an interview with Recode. One Wal-Mart watcher said the deal shows that Wal-Mart is interested in diversifying its e-commerce platform. “No sooner did it digest its massive acquisition of Jet.com then along came a category-killer chaser to kick off the new year. The ShoeBuy acquisition may have already been in the works for Jet.com but the fact that it is going through signals that Walmart is taking a portfolio approach to building its digital strength,” said Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail. “ShoeBuy brings with it an impressive roster of name brands, not to mention user data, content and footwear-specific platform capabilities. In mass retail, footwear often lags other categories in terms of trend and quality. ShoeBuy rectifies this while giving Walmart a plug-and-play entry into an important category, one that shoppers have grown quite comfortable ordering online.” Keith Anderson, senior strategist for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics the deal to acquire ShoeBuy provides Jet a slight increase in online market share, but it’s not a huge bump, as Zappos controls a much bigger piece of the pie. He said ShoeBuy has been around a long time (since 1999) and has been through several owners, which likely suggests sluggish growth or lagging profitability. He said estimates are ShoeBuy does a few hundred million in annual sales, which makes the $70 million price tag seem like a decent value. Anderson said the deal does give Wal-Mart might not typically have. He said in the past when Walmart has tried to experiment with more affluent brands in its own stores, the results were disappointing. By allowing ShoeBuy to retain its own site, Wal-Mart will vicariously have access to the higher-end brands and those more affluent shoppers. Looking specifically at ShoeBuy’s site, Anderson it doesn’t look like there is any compelling technology built in. That could change as ShoeBuy will now have access to Jet.com and Walmart.com technology teams. He said Walmart has the opportunity to help ShoeBuy restructure its site and create a compelling experience around shoe shopping online – something it can’t really do on its one-stop shopping site. Anderson said the ShoeBuy deal is also likely about the talent acquisition. He said ShoeBuy has an experienced team of technologists, marketers and merchants savvy about shoe, accessory and apparel sales online. He said as Walmart continues to invest in online abilities acquiring a company could make more sense that posting 100 jobs at a given time. “ShoeBuy already has talent sitting at their desks, in areas that Walmart and Jet hope to glean insights and grow share, in this case the deal makes sense,” Anderson said.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

According to reports, a woman said after she paid for her groceries she drove to the Ingles Gas Station for fuel and realized she did not have her wallet. The woman said she returned to the store and located her shopping cart but could not find her wallet. The woman said the wallet contained her and her three children’s Social Security cards, a L.L. Bean card, a Bank of Madison debit card, health insurance card, Kohl’s card and a Toys R Us card. On December 30 an information report was filed at Wal Mart, Eatonton Road. According to reports, a woman told officers that after she finished shopping she left her purse in the shopping cart in the parking lot. The  woman said she returned but could not find the purse. She told officers she had $900 cash in the purse. An officer reviewed surveillance tape and it showed a woman take the purse and leave the parking lot in a gold Honda. The woman later called authorities and said that she had been contacted by a woman regarding returning her purse. An officer retrieved the purse and delivered it to the complainant who said everything, including the cash, appeared to be in the purse. The woman later called an officer and said she believed $60 was missing from the purse. On December 26 an information report was filed at a Wheat Street residence. According to reports, a man called officer and told them that an unknown vehicle was parked illegally on his property. An officer observed a purple Honda with an orange hood that he recognized as being a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was processed by detectives and towed to an impound lot. On December 29 a fraud complaint was filed at a North Second Street residence. According to reports, a woman alleged that a man who she entrusted to use her debit card for one purchase also used the card to make nine other purchases that she did not authorize. In total the man allegedly took nearly $1,000 from the woman. The woman said she allowed the man to use the card on December 22 and then had “a hard time getting the card back.” The woman said the next morning the man, her vehicle and the card were all gone. An officer was able to obtain video surveillance from Wal Mart showing the man purchasing $72.78 worth of clothing using the woman’s card. The man is described as wearing bright yellow shoes, blue jeans, an open dark coat, a bright yellow shirt and a dark flat bill cap. Eight other charges were made in Covington, reports allege. On December 27 an information report was filed at Steve’s Place, West Washington Street. According to reports, an officer stated that he received a call from a Houston County deputy stating that two stolen ladies gold rings had been sold to Steve’s Place. An officer located the rings at the business and informed the owner. A woman told officers she believed her son had taken the rings and sold them. The woman arrived,  paid fees associated with the stolen rings and took possession of the rings. Morgan County Sheriff’s Office On January 2 Lewis Malik Duffie, 36, Covington was arrested and charged with driving while registration and insurance suspended. He was also detained at the Morgan County Detention Center on hold for Newton County authorities who, reports state, have several outstanding traffic citation warrants for Duffie. Duffie was arrested on Interstate 20 after a deputy responded to aid a motorist out of gas. When the deputy arrived to exit 105 and obtained Duffie’s information, the deputy was notified of the warrants and insurance and registration status. On January 1 an information report was filed at a Fairplay Street, Rutledge residence. According to reports, a deputy responded to a report of a domestic violence incident at the residence “with several guns involved.” Reports state that a couple alleged that a man pulled a pistol on the female complainant because the female complainant did not want another female to leave with the man. The male complainant said he requested several times for the man to put the gun back in his truck but the man refused. The male complainant said that is when he retrieved his pistol from the residence and pointed it at the man. While this was occurring, reports state, a third man was attempting to deescalate the situation and a woman was picking a fight with the female complainant. The male complainant then pointed his pistol at both the man with the pistol and the woman attempting to fight and demanded that they leave the property. Neither would, reports state, so the male complainant then called law enforcement. On December 31 a recovered stolen property report was filed on Interstate 20, near the 107 mile marker. According to reports, a 2004 Chevrolet pickup reported stolen from Putnam County was recovered. Reports state that law enforcement officers reacted to a GPS device alerting them to the vehicle’s location. On December 30 an information report was filed at a Sewell Road residence. According to reports, a man said he received a phone call from another man advising him that his three horses were loose. The complainant said he did not report the incident because the caller repeatedly makes false calls about his horses being out of their stall. Later, when the man’s son arrived home, they observed that the three horses were missing. Three days later the man called law enforcement to report that the three horses had been returned by a Morgan County Sheriff’s Office deputy. On December 29 a use of force report was filed at a Enterprise Road location. According to reports, a deputy stated that he observed an injured male deer lying next to a fence. The deer had compound fractures in both rear legs, reports state. The deputy dispatched the wounded deer with his shotgun. On December 29 an information report was filed at the EconoLodge, Eatonton Road. According to reports, a man alleged that while he was in the hospital, his former girlfriend had moved a camper he was living in off Doster Road to an area that was unaccessible to the complainant. The man said the ex girlfriend did, however, help him move into a room at the Budget Inn. He said after a few weeks at the Budget Inn he ran  out of money and moved to the EconoLodge. The man said the ex girlfriend refuses to return his personal items. A deputy located the ex girlfriend at the Relax Inn, North Main Street. The ex-girlfriend told the deputy that she had, at one time, been in a relationship with the complainant but had ended the relationship because of the complainant’s alleged drug use. The ex-girlfriend also disputed the allegation that she took any of the man’s personal items. She also said that she was now engaged to a new man and wanted no further contact with the complainant. On December 28 an information report was filed at the Morgan County Detention Center. According to reports, a deputy received three black and silver knives that had been placed in an inmate’s sealed property bag from Clarke County authorities. The knives were placed into a new evidence locker until the inmates release. On December 27 an injuring or tearing down mailbox complaint was filed at a Harderman Mill Road residence. According to reports, a woman said someone had shot the family’s mailbox with a shotgun. The woman said her son had found a .12 gauge empty shotgun shell the previous night approximately 10 feet from the mailbox. The woman said she suspects a relative who had confronted the family recently at church regarding the family allegedly “lying on him.” On December 27 Othilia Lopes Lancaster, 40, Stockbridge was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. According to reports, a deputy was called to a Whispering Lakes Trail residence regarding a custody dispute complaint. When the deputy arrived a woman at the residence told him she was watching a 5-year-old child for her brother. The woman said her brother and Lancaster were in the middle of a divorce and that the court had agreed for each parent to have custody of the child on alternate weeks and that this was the man’s week. Lancaster allegedly arrived and requested to enter the residence to inspect the child but was told by a deputy that the complainant did not want Lancaster on the property. The deputy told Lancaster that he would go inside the residence and check on the welfare of the child. He instructed Lancaster to leave again. This time as she was driving away she stopped, rolled down her window and screamed obscenities at the complainant and delivered a two-handed obscene gesture. She was then arrested. On December 27 a forgery complaint was filed at a Alford Lane residence. According to reports, a man said that on February 13, 2016 he wrote a $125.73 check to Macy’s to pay his credit card bill. The man said the following month he was billed for the original amount plus a late fee by Macy’s. The complainant said he assumed his initial payment had been lost in the mail. However, on December 22 the first check he had written to Macy’s was altered to $625.73 and was cashed in a man’s name who is unknown to the complainant.

Police Handout By Tess Koman Jan 05, 2017 Timothy Blake, 30, was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking Dec. 30, CBS News reports. He is accused of following women around in Marietta, Ohio, Walmart and squirting them with his semen through a syringe. Police were first notified of an incident Nov. 2. A woman reported a “creepy” man who, soon after she felt him walking inches behind her, also felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and rushed to the store’s bathroom, according to an affidavit, where she found the “sticky” substance on her. She also said the suspect was waiting for her outside the bathroom and continued staring at her when she emerged. Surveillance footage from the store showed the suspect squirting the woman with an unidentifiable substance. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below According to the Smoking Gun, authorities received a similar second report more than a month later from a woman shopping at the same Walmart who “had some substance thrown or sprayed on her.” More surveillance footage showed the same man squirting a syringe at the victim. After Blake was identified and taken into custody, he told police he’d been throwing egg yolks at the women who’d reported him. When police informed him they'd tested the substance and confirmed it was semen, Blake admitted he’d masturbated into the syringes in his car or in the Walmart bathroom, the New York Daily News reports. He also admitted to squirting women on “approximately a dozen occasions,” though he maintained he’d used egg yolks and spit most of those times. Blake also said he attacked the first reported victim because “she displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed,” according to the affidavit. He also told police he thought “maybe it was his way of having sex with these women." A court filing shows Blake said he had a farm and hence had the syringes because he inoculates his animals. CBS reports Blake is married but said his wife had no knowledge of his alleged crimes. He is currently in jail without bond pending arraignment. Follow Tess on Twitter.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Print Email Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 05, 2017 at 9:06 AM, updated January 05, 2017 at 9:52 AM comments "Wish lists" have become an essential shopping tool for many families. Let's say you're part of a large brood and everyone -- from Aunt Edna to Cousin Jerry to Grandma -- wants to know what to buy you or your kids for the holidays or for birthdays. You could tell everyone different items and hope they're within your family members' budgets. You can also cross your fingers that they choose the right product in the desired color or size. Or, you can create a wish list with your favorite retailer. It's simple. You go to the retailer's website, log in and create your list. Then you basically go shopping, plopping the items you long for on the list. When your relatives are ready to shop, they can visit the site, search for your wish list and select the items they want to purchase. It's seen as a win-win: you get what you want and you take the guesswork out of buying for your loved ones. But if you're not careful, wish lists can lead to identity theft. It's way easier than you might expect to get private information about people from their wish lists. As an example, we decided to see what we could learn about a Bamboozled relative who is married with two kids. We started at Amazon. (In case you missed it, read our recent warnings about fraudulent third-party sellers who sell their fake wares on Amazon.) We clicked over to the wish list page and entered the relative's name. Her list came up, as did her birthday -- an important factoid for those who might want to steal her identity. We clicked around her list, and we learned the names of her two children. That's because she added notes to the items her kids wanted, specifying which kid each item was for. Next, we tried Target to see if she had a list there. She didn't, but both of her kids did. Those were easy to find because we learned the kids' names on the Amazon site. Their lists told us the town and state in which they live. Not the full address, but the town and state are another nice chunk of information for fraudsters. Over at WalMart.com, wish lists showed us their town and the state, and the birthdays of the kids. So in less than 10 minutes, we had the names of mom and the kids, birth dates for all three and the family's town and state. This relative made a big mistake. All three retailers -- Amazon, Target and Walmart -- offer privacy settings for wish lists. But shame on the retailers -- the default setting is to make the list public. A 9-step plan for data breach victims So how could scammers use this information? Pretty easily. There are lots of public databases where the scammer can take someone's name and hometown and learn more. Exact addresses from property tax records. Email addresses from Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media sites -- if the user is loose with privacy settings. And you'd be surprised what a Google search can yield. Next, with readily available technology, the scammer could create a fake login page for any retailer, borrowing screen shots of the actual retailer login pages. Then the scammer could include code that would record whatever is typed into the login pages -- a user name and password. Once the fake web page is up and running, the scammer could send the user an email impersonating the retailer. It might say, "Here's a coupon code for an item on your wish list," or "We have a question about an item on your wish list" or "Somebody has made a purchase from your wish list." Anything to make the user want to get an update or visit the site. And the email would include a link. When the user visits the fake site and enters her login and password, the scammer now has access to the person's account. When the scammer visits the real account, they can get even more information about you: your full billing and shipping address (and the addresses of anyone you've sent a gift), your phone number, and the last four digits and expiration dates of as many credit cards as you've added to your account. They can also change your password. Does it matter if someone can break into your Amazon or Target or Walmart account? It matters plenty. They can make purchases and have the items sent to their own address, but that's not the worst of it. You see, despite warnings, most people use the same passwords and logins for most of their accounts. All the scammers have to do now is guess. Guess which banks or financial institutions you use -- and they have clues because they had access to your payment information on your retail accounts. Or they can simply use the info they have to open new credit cards or loans in your name. Or in your kids' names. Bamboozled: 2016 Hall of Shame So what should you do? For starters, if you use wish lists, don't allow them to be public. Again, public is the default for the lists we've examined, so be sure to actively click what you must to make the lists private. You can always send your relatives a link to your list, and some retailers allow you to invite people to your list via email. Next, don't use the same login and password for all of your online accounts. Just don't. Also, think twice about storing credit card information on any retailer's website. Hacks happen. Data mishaps happen. Don't let it happen to you. Finally, don't click on retailer emails unless you're absolutely positive the email is coming from the real business. If you want to use a coupon code from an email, copy it down rather than follow the link -- just in case the link takes you to a phony imposter site. Type the address for the real site and type in the coupon code at checkout. And don't forget you can check your credit reports for free once a year through AnnualCreditReport.com. Stay smart, Jersey.

ICONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP This Young Dad Created a Viral App That's Taking on the $710 Billion Nightlife Market Dan Fennessy founded Party With a Local to bring people together for better nightlife experiences whether you're in Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, or New York City. By Maisie Devine Maisie Devine is an investor at ZX Ventures, the global incubator and venture capital arm of AB InBev. Prior to ZXV, she co-founded a recruitment app for busy, professional women. She was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30, Tech.co Top 20 Startup Founders Under 30, and 26 Women to Watch in Tech by AlleyWatch. Devine also worked in digital media advertising at Interactive One and handled the 30 largest clients, including P&G, Walmart, Comcast, and J&J. @Maisie_Devine Investor at ZX Ventures@Maisie_Devine WRITE A COMMENT Dan Fennessy, founder of Party With a Local. Dan Fennessy, founder of Party with a Local. CREDIT: Company Advertisement Dan Fennessy has had a crazy last couple of years: from growing up in tiny coastal Australian town, to working odd jobs, to persisting after the two co-founders left his nascent start-up, to having a baby. To now: he is a darling of the Silicon Valley world and boasts a hot nightlife app, Party With a Local, that already has more than 100K users and is helping globe-trotting millennials have better nightlife experiences. Now together with his international and diverse team (from 5 continents, speaking 11 different languages) they aim to become THE app that connects people for nightlife, anywhere in the world. The team is passionate about fun nightlife experiences and also about meeting new people, so in many respects, they are solving their own problem. The Party With a Local team love seeing successful meetups, great nights out, and genuine friendships being formed via the app. The ability to bring people together for awesome experiences is what truly excites and energizes the team everyday. From humble beginnings and many challenges faced along the way, the team and the app are now doing exceptionally well. They are now one of 10 teams participating in Techstars Connection, in partnership with AB InBev, in New York. Techstars is widely considered one of the best startup accelerator programs in the world, and less than 1% of applicants are accepted. Now, Party With a Local is focused on the US market specifically to create partnerships with some of the world's biggest brands and to build a vibrant community of nightlife enthusiasts - one party at a time. Their relentless drive to succeed, their openness, their diversity, great team culture and sense of humor are the ingredients that hold Party With a Local together and give them an edge over the competition. Recently, Inc sat down with Fennessy to discuss Party With a Local over coffee and this is what he had to say: Why did you start Party With a Local? Party With a Local came from my own experiences of traveling, and living abroad, and finding that a night out anywhere is better with a local, but it's not always easy to meet locals. I did a 1 year 'round the world trip 10 years ago when I first experienced this problem. I was traveling from city to city in Asia, Europe, North America and Central America and wanting to go out, meet new people and sample the local nightlife. More often than not I would have no idea where to go out, and end up at crappy or expensive tourist bars, only meet other travelers (especially other Australians) and generally have a bad night out. I'd gone traveling to experience new things and meet new people from all over the world, but it just wasn't happening. In some rare cases I would randomly meet a local and have a totally different experience --meet amazing people, get the local perspective and  go to bars, clubs and events that I would never have found on my own. But these experiences were few and far between. This is where the idea came from -- I just wanted to solve my own problem and have more of these great experiences. Party With a Local has since expanded beyond just being a travel or new in town app, based on user behavior, to be about connecting anyone anywhere for nightlife. Not having people to enjoy nightlife with is a problem that a lot of people around the world face. How exactly does the app work? Whether it's to grab a drink, meet new people at festivals, or get nightlife tips, you can find like-minded friends through the app (no, not for dating). You can post a 'party status', join and share events, and just chat with people who are nearby and up for meeting up and going out to enjoy nightlife. Party with a Local App CREDIT: Company How is this different from a dating app? It's very different. Party With a Local is all about community, and we make sure to encourage the right kind of culture within our app. We state clearly pre, during and post sign-up that Party With a Local is not a dating or hookup up, which people seem respond well too. You can review people who you've met via the app - which brings a level of trust to the people you are meeting (and something dating apps will never do, for obvious reasons). Also, people are more and more meeting up in groups, which is why we'll soon be launching our events feature - for more group interactions and meetups. We hear from many of our users, who say they really like Party With a Local, specifically because it's not about dating; its purpose is to meet new people for good times and nights out. We think the world is ready for a meet new people app that is not about dating or hooking-up. What better place to start than nightlife? What are some of the best stories you've heard from people using Party With a Local? We hear lots of stories of genuine connections being made and amazing experiences being had via our app. My favorite is Florian and Michael's story. The short version: Florian, from Stuttgart, met Amsterdam local Michael through the app. They became good friends, had lots of great nights out in Amsterdam. Florian went traveling in SE Asia and Michael decided spontaneously to fly to Bangkok to join him. They then used the app to organize a rooftop party with a bunch of people in the State Tower of Bangkok (where Hangover 2 was filmed). What is the bigger vision for Party With a Local? The core of our app is about connecting people. We aim to own the nightlife niche first, and it's a very big niche. Beyond that, we might move into other verticals, like eating out, shopping, other local experiences, but right now we're fully focused on nightlife. If we can keep playing a part in bringing people from different backgrounds and beliefs together around the world, that would be a huge win for us. Go out and meet someone new, someone different from you, grab a drink, discuss your differences, find middle ground - after all, connections trump hate! What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced? I found out I was going to be a dad, right around the time I'd decided to go all-in on Party With a Local. Then it was still a self-funded startup that wasn't looking likely to make any money for the coming period. Whilst I was happy and excited for what was to come with a baby, I couldn't get my head around how around how I would be able to combine a startup (an app connecting people for nightlife!), with my new responsibilities of being a father, and of supporting a family financially. I agonized for weeks: Should I quit my startup and 'get a real job' to support my family? Most startups fail anyway, right? If I quit now, most people would understand, and in fact they'd think it was the responsible thing to do. But the thought of quitting felt terrible to me. Like a lot of founders, my startup felt like my baby too, one that was nowhere near grown-up and hadn't reached it's potential yet, and the thought of letting it go now filled me with dread. My girlfriend knew how much Party With a Local meant to me and was extremely supportive during this time. She told me to go for it, that we'd figure it out financially even if the app didn't work out. So while I was at times filled with doubt and anxiety, there was no doubt in her mind I needed to keep going and would succeed. Amazing support! I also spoke to a good friend at the time who said 'what does quitting now tell your future child about chasing your dreams? That you give up as soon as there's a challenge?' And: 'imagine in the future you have to tell your kid that because of him/her you had to give up on your dreams!' ...Right. I kept going, more determined than ever to make it work. Becoming a father made me more focused and a better entrepreneur.

Timothy Blake, 28, was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking after two female customers complained of a man following them around the Marietta, Ohio, superstore and squirting them with a “sticky” substance, according to CBS News. Surveillance footage from the two incidents showed the suspect getting into a pickup truck belonging to the oilfield company where Blake worked. Two days after the second incident, police spotted the truck while Blake was on his way to dinner with his wife. Originally, Blake claimed the white substance in question was egg yolks mixed with flour — a concoction he said he learned to make on the internet. But he later admitted it was his own semen after an officer told him they had run tests on the substance. Blake admitted to masturbating in his vehicle and in the Wal-Mart bathroom to obtain the semen samples, as well as committing the heinous act around a dozen times over two months. According to the criminal complaint, he used semen on four of those occasions and either the egg mixture or spit on the others. He also confessed to aiming specifically for his victims’ buttocks, saying it was his way of having sex with the women, according to the police report. When pressed on why he committed his crimes, Blake brought up a history of sexual abuse, claiming to have been molested by his parents. He also said he got the idea from reading about it online. “It’s not something that we’ve ever encountered before,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told WTAP. “After we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said that it was something he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ohio ,  perverts ,  sex offenders Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Apple removes New York Times from Chinese app store Read Next Apple removes New York Times from Chinese app store Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 12-year-old girl live streams her suicide in front yard Share Selection Trending Now in News 39,807 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure 31,257 Like clockwork, Trump rips 'Saturday Night Live' on Twitter 23,976 Bob Woodward calls Trump dossier 'garbage' Now On More women rip Michael Che’s dating app etiquette Katie Couric’s ready for her TV comeback Eric Schneiderman and Preet Bharara power lunch SEE ALL Now On How To Watch The NFL Playoff Games Online For Free SEE ALL Most Popular This Week Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon...

Follow @triplepundit 46.6k Triple Pundit: People, Planet, Profit Menu Special Series Progress to 2020: Tackling resource use from all angles In this series we’ll take a fresh look at resources and how they are used. We’ll go beyond natural resources like air and water to look at how efficiency in raw materials can boost the bottom line and help the environment. We’ll also examine the circular economy and design for reuse — with an eye toward honoring those resources we do have. Sponsored by Sealed Air Sustainability at Home and Beyond While changes at home can’t solve the many environmental crises we face today, they can sure help. Through this series, we’ll explore how initiatives like curbside compost pick-up, rebates on compost bins, and efficient appliances can help families reduce their impact without breaking the bank. Sponsored by Whirlpool Corporation Social Impacts in Apparel Despite decades -- centuries even -- of global efforts, slavery can still be found not just on the high seas, but around the world and throughout various supply chains. Through this series on forced labor, sponsored by C&A Foundation, we’ll explore many different types of bonded and forced labor and highlight industries where this practice is alive and well today. Sponsored by C&A Foundation Black Lives Matter and Beyond In this series we examine how companies should respond to national controversy like police violence and the BLM movement to best support employees and how can companies work to improve equality by increasing diversity in their ranks directly.

Smart/clean tech is on the cusp of disruptively reshaping our buildings, vehicles and businesses. This mega trend is the business opportunity of the 21st century. I actually predicted this in a 2008 Entrepreneur.com article that projected a $1 trillion annual global green economy by 2017. I called this projection a Green Economic Revolution. The social media reaction at the time ranged from a few calling me a visionary and more than a few calling me a green idiot. Today, the Green Economic Revolution annually generates trillions of dollars in annual sales and investments. Over a dozen ‘Green Giant‘ businesses like Costco and Target sell at least $1 billion annually in more sustainable goods and services. Companies from Apple to Walmart are saving billions of dollars annually using sustainability best practices like zero-waste manufacturing and green supply chains. Global investment in renewable energy is growing at a rate projected to reach $1 trillion annually. And financial data increasingly documents that sustainably-managed companies deliver higher returns. The coolest response from my 2008 article were the emails from a then-emerging group of green entrepreneurs. Inspired by how they were making money and a difference, I took on the goal of telling their stories. To do so, I created a website called Earth 2017 to host articles profiling their best practices. Two years later, I started a YouTube channel called Earth 2017 TV. I use this site to host video interviews with CEOs, business owners, and community leaders that are pioneering how to grow jobs and win customers by going green. Today, these two sites have hundreds of articles and videos. They are a gold mine of proven green best practices for saving money, growing sales and making a difference. Both of these sites are available without charge, ads or requests for your email address. Green does build business In early 2011, I moved from observer to practitioner. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce assigned me the task of designing and implementing a coaching program for business owners. Walmart committed the funding for this coaching program that the Chamber called Green Builds Business (GBB). Through GBB, I worked with hundreds of business owners covering every imaginable industry across 11 cities. The coaching provided business and community attendees with: A survey lecture on proven green best practices Assistance in designing a green project that could make money in 90 days One-on-one coaching My favorite GBB coaching project was with a Hispanic father and son who owned a Salt Lake City auto body shop. They tried for years to win a government or corporate contract. And they chose to become a green auto body shop in the hopes of finally sealing a deal. Building a green auto body shop was a huge investment challenge for this small business, so we focused on low-hanging fruit. The father and son agreed to invest in higher-efficiency lighting and water-saving technologies to save money and reduce the business’ environmental footprint. We also developed a plan for investing in lower-emissions paint technologies. At that time, these combined actions gave their business competitive advantage. Within 90 days of starting their GBB project, this father and son won a competitive bid with their local police department. Shortly afterward, they won a contract with a national rental car agency. Being greener than their competitors had opened the door to their sales success. Today, this company is truly a green auto body shop — thanks to its continued investment in green technologies and best practices funded by its sales successes. I could not be prouder of them, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Walmart and our country! To me, this is how America is supposed to work together for business success and a greater good. Earth 2017 I did not envision Election 2016 10 years ago. My enthusiasm for the future blinded me to the backlash created by disruptive change. But here’s the insight every business person must recognize about the Green Economic Revolution: Its growth was never based on politics. The Green Economic Revolution is driven by green products winning on price. It is anchored on smart/clean technologies gaining manufacturing economies of scale to drive down prices. One example is that we enter 2017 with utility-scale solar and wind being lower in price than coal or natural gas power plants. The Green Economic Revolution is also a customer revolution led by urban millennials. Urban millennials are driving innovations in lifestyles and work practices around diversity, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, connectivity, mobility, renewable energy and health. Their innovations will grow our economy. Their adoption of smart/clean tech will restore our environment and improve human health. Look no further than smartphones, companies like Patagonia or Toms with strong corporate responsibility programs, and the renewal of downtowns across America to see the influence urban millennials are having on our economy. This influence will surely continue in 2017 and beyond. And if the past is any indication, it will continue to drive low-carbon technologies into the mainstream. This article is the first in a series on Earth in 2017. I hope you find them engaging and thought provoking. Most importantly, I hope they provide you with at least one best practice that you can implement during 2017 for making money and a difference.

Courtesy of NAI Sawyer Courtesy of NAI Sawyer The former Wal-Mart store on Pass Road in Biloxi has been empty since the Wal-Mart Supercenter on C.T. Switzer Blvd. opened in 2012. The Pass Road building now has a new owner, which plans to create several retail spaces and bring in stores that don’t currently operate in South Mississippi. Mary Perez meperez@sunherald.com 1 of 2 i By Mary Perez meperez@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Biloxi After sitting empty for nearly four years, the former Wal-Mart store at 2381 Pass Road in Biloxi has a new owner. The 127,000-square-foot building on Pass Road at Popp’s Ferry Road was sold for an undisclosed price to an out-of-state investor. Wal-Mart did not own the building. Brian Bolis of NAI Sawyer represented the seller and Michael Sawyer of NAI Sawyer represented the buyer. The building, which sits on 9.7 acres, will be converted into several smaller retail spaces. The owners expect to fill it with retail stores that may be new to South Mississippi. That area of Pass Road has seen new restaurants open in the last four years, since a new Wal-Mart Supercenter was built on CT Switzer Road. Retail has lagged since Stein Mart followed Wal-Mart’s move nearer to Edgewater Mall. When complete, the shopping complex is expected to create 100 to 200 new jobs.

Metro Denver’s housing market developing a split personality, sending rents down and home prices up Passed out in the parking lot. A shopper at Walmart, 5990 Dahlia St., Commerce City, came out to his car Nov. 29 and noticed that someone had backed into it, and that the suspect car was still there, idling.

Apartment  burglary. A woman who lives in the 1400 block of West 85th Avenue, Federal Heights, called police Nov. 14 because someone broke into her apartment and stole her laptop and a gaming console. The woman’s dresser drawers were turned inside out, and the TVs were unplugged and moved. Officers found a burglary tool inside the residence. Overnight damage. Someone called Northglenn police Dec. 5 to report that the passenger window on their company car was smashed out in the 11600 block of Huron Street. There are no suspects. Stolen motorcycle. On Dec. 6, Northglenn police patrolling the 11300 block of Melody Drive found an abandoned motorcycle in a nearby parking lot.

Investigators believe the semen shooter struck at least a dozen times over a two-month period. Blake allegedly told cops he believed one victim was displaying“exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed.” The criminal complaint says detectives asked Blake whether the sperm spraying was like a sexual encounter and he told them that “maybe it was his way of having sex with these women and that was what he thought of when committing these acts.” According to the Smoking Gun, Blake told detectives that he would masturbate in his vehicle then ejaculate into a syringe. Other times he would repeat the act in the Walmart bathroom before striking the “unwitting women”. In November, a Walmart shopper told cops that a “creepy” man was shadowing her in the makeup aisle. And when the man passed, she “felt something wet on her foot and lower back.” The substance was “sticky.” Then,on Dec. 28 another woman said a substance had been thrown or sprayed on her buttocks in Marietta, Oh. On store surveillance video, cops realized it was the same man. Blake is charged with a couple of counts of felony obscenity.

For the second quarter, our consolidated gross margin increased 160 basis points to 13.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to this innovation strategy. We are on the way to achieving our full fiscal year 2017 net income growth guidance of 50% to 70%,” commented Molly Hemmeter, Landec’s President and CEO. “Net income in the second quarter, consistent with our prior guidance, decreased to $0.05 per share compared to $0.07 per share during the second quarter of last year primarily due to the Company recording a non-recurring $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of its debt during the quarter. We are estimating that the refinancing will result in approximately $400,000 in lower interest expenses over the next twelve months (see Questions & Answers #8 for more details). Net income also decreased as a result of no change in the fair market value of our Windset investment compared to a $200,000 increase during the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the second quarter decreased 3% compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a strategic decision to reduce low margin business in our packaged fresh vegetables business beginning in the second half of fiscal 2016. These efforts to shift away from non-strategic low margin business and to innovate and grow higher margin products as a larger percent of our business are resulting in continued improvement in both gross and operating margins and has us trending toward our stated net income goal for fiscal 2017,” stated Hemmeter.  Summary of Second Quarter 2017 Results Compared to Second Quarter of 2016 Revenues decreased 3% to $135.9 million Gross profit increased 10% to $19.0 million Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points to 13.9%   Operating income increased 16% to $3.3 million Net income decreased 29% to $1.3 million or $0.05 per share Continued Hemmeter, “Lifecore is off to a very strong start, with revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2017 increasing 27% and operating income increasing 46% to $4.7 million compared to the first six months of last year due primarily to a very favorable product mix change to a higher percentage of revenues being derived from higher margin fermentation sales. At Apio for the first six months, gross profit was up $3.4 million, or 13%, based on a favorable shift in product mix and positive operating efficiencies even though revenues were down 5% due to our prior strategic decision to focus on our higher margin business in the packaged fresh vegetables business, which resulted in lost business beginning in the second half of last fiscal year. Apio is focused on reducing operational costs through investments in productivity projects in all of its facilities and currently is realizing efficiency gains in its salad business as a result of the newly constructed, fully-automated Hanover facility.”  “Lifecore’s business,” added Hemmeter, “has expanded beyond its historical capabilities as a premium supplier of hyaluronic acid (HA) to become a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), providing differentiated fermentation, formulation and aseptic fill services for specialized medical materials. This transition is reflected in Lifecore’s revenue and operating income growth, both of which are expected to exceed our original expectations for Lifecore for fiscal 2017.”   “In our Apio packaged fresh vegetables business, we have been successful in significantly shifting our product mix to higher margin Eat Smart® vegetable salad products which now account for 36% of the packaged fresh vegetables business revenues and contributed to the packaged fresh vegetables business second quarter gross margin increase of 290 basis points to 12.2% and first six months increase of 260 basis points to 13.6%,” said Hemmeter. “Salad kit revenues were slightly down during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the first half of last year and lower than our expectations due to two primary factors. First, Costco moved to a multi-sourcing strategy from a sole sourcing strategy for their salad kit business due to industry-wide produce shortages during last year’s El Nino. Second, in the Canadian market, where Eat Smart salads have a 44% market share, there was a dramatic decline in the retail salad kit market growth rate due to the effects of a competitor’s salad product recall in January 2016. According to Nielsen, for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2015 of last year, the retail salad kit category in Canada grew 44% whereas for the 26 weeks ended this November 26, 2016 the retail salad kit category in Canada grew only 6% (see Questions & Answers #3 for more details).  In our guidance we had expected a 30% growth in the Canadian retail salad kit category,” added Hemmeter. “Even though overall salad kit revenues were down in the first six months of fiscal 2017, our salad kit business continues to outperform versus the U.S. salad kit category. For the six months ended November 26, 2016, the Nielsen U.S. salad kit category growth rate, excluding Costco, in consumer dollars was 17% while the comparable growth for Eat Smart salads during the same period was 42%, primarily driven by increased distribution of Eat Smart salads at Sam’s Club and Walmart. We continue to see high growth potential in our salad products as new salad products are added to existing accounts and as we add distribution in key U.S. accounts,” concluded Hemmeter.                                                                                                                      Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Results Revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 3% to $135.9 million from $140.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a 9% decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business partially offset by a 16% increase in revenues at Lifecore and a 16% increase in Apio’s export business. Net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.3 million or $0.05 per share compared to $1.9 million or $0.07 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net income was negatively impacted by a $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of Landec’s debt during the quarter and from a $1.2 million, or 9%, increase in operating expenses in the second quarter primarily at Apio resulting from additional headcount hired during the past year in the areas of sales and financial analysis. In addition, there was no change in the fair market value of our Windset investment during the quarter compared to a $200,000 increase during the second quarter of last year. These decreases to net income were partially offset by: (1) a $2.0 million, or 20%, increase in gross profit in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business due to a favorable product mix shift to a higher percentage of revenues derived from salad kit sales and from favorable operational cost variances, specifically lower produce sourcing costs and improved labor efficiencies in the Company’s processing plants and (2) a $376,000 decrease in income taxes. Fiscal Six Months 2017 Results Revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2017 decreased 3% to $268.3 million from $275.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to an 8% decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business partially offset by a 27% increase in revenues at Lifecore and a 10% increase in Apio’s export business. Net income in the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $4.6 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.18 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was due to: (1) a $2.9 million increase in operating expenses, primarily from headcount added during the last twelve months, (2) a $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of debt during the second quarter, (3) a $290,000 decrease in operating income at Corporate due to the completion of a 15-month license agreement during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and (4) no increase in the fair market value of the Company’s Windset investment during the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to a $1.0 million increase in the first six months of last year. The decreases in net income during the first six months of fiscal 2017 were partially offset by: (1) a $2.0 million, or 24%, increase in gross profit at Lifecore from increased revenues, and (2) a $3.2 million, or 14%, increase in gross profit in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business due to a favorable product mix and favorable produce sourcing costs during the first six months of fiscal 2017 and due to operational productivity improvement initiatives which combined resulted in the Apio packaged fresh vegetables business gross margin increasing 260 basis points to 13.6% compared to 11.0% during the first six months of last year. Management Comments and Guidance for Fiscal 2017 Ms. Hemmeter stated, “For fiscal 2017, we are reiterating our guidance for consolidated net income to increase 50% to 70% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, resulting in an estimated EPS range of $0.53 to $0.60. This is based on favorable produce sourcing continuing and on our continued shift to higher margin products. We are still not projecting a significant change in our Windset investment in fiscal 2017, although we do expect an increase in both the third and fourth quarters, which is included in our guidance. We now expect revenues for fiscal 2017 to be flat to slightly up compared to fiscal 2016. We expect consolidated cash flow from operations of $30 million to $35 million and capital expenditures of approximately $30 million. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to be in the range of $133 million to $140 million and net income to be $0.16 to $0.19 per share.”    Conference Call The live webcast can be accessed directly at www.landec.com/earningscall or on Landec’s website on the Investor Events & Presentations page.

Lifecore’s growth during the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year was driven by a substantial increase in revenues in its higher margin fermentation business as a result of increased demand from existing customers and from a 15% increase in aseptic sales primarily due to recent development products becoming commercialized.  These increases were partially offset by lower business development revenues as a result of a key customer obtaining FDA approval of its drug product, moving that program from development to commercial production. 2) Why were Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables revenues down 8% for the first six months? As a reminder, we lost approximately $30 million of packaged bag business during the last six months of fiscal 2016 as a result of (1) our strategic decision to discontinue select low margin business, (2) some customers deciding to shift from single sourcing to a multi-source strategy, and (3) prorating some customer orders during the produce shortages last fiscal year. A large majority of the business we lost was low margin business that carried a very high cost to service. Because this business was included in the first half of last year, over 80% of the decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business during the first six months of this year is attributable to this lost business. In addition, salad revenues were down 4% during the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year primarily due to the loss of some salad kit business at Costco due to a corporate-wide decision by Costco to move to a multi-supplier sourcing strategy following industry-wide produce shortages in 2016. This reduction in salad kit revenues at Costco was partially offset by significant growth in salad kit revenues in U.S. retail and some growth in Canadian retail. Other factors affecting salad revenues included the delay in customer commitments for new salad kit products following the extensive industry-wide produce shortage last year until sourcing returned to normal and the launch of a market test of plant-based protein salads throughout all Costco U.S. stores during the first half of last year that was discontinued later in fiscal 2016. Importantly, while packaged fresh vegetables revenues declined 8% in the first six months, that business generated a 14% increase in gross profit and a 260 basis point improvement in gross margin to 13.6%.    As consistent supply has resumed, customers are now reviewing our new products and we expect to launch new Eat Smart salad products during the second half of fiscal 2017 and first half of fiscal 2018. Although the shift to multi-sourcing salad kits by several customers has negatively affected Apio in the near term, there may be opportunities in the future for additional business as a result of this strategy.   (3) In the Canadian retail market, why was the salad kit growth in the 26 weeks ended November 2016 so much lower than the growth for the 52 weeks ended May 2016? The severe drop in growth appears to be directly related to a major recall of salad products by a competitor last January that has affected the entire product category. The recall of salads that had been distributed in the Eastern provinces was broadly publicized in Canada. According to Nielsen data, for the 10 months ended January 2016 prior to the salads recall, the retail salad kit market category in Canada had grown at 36%, in significant contrast to the growth of that category in the 10 months from February through November 2016 following the salads recall when the retail salad kit category grew at only 5%.  Any product recall in the category can affect all players in the category.  There have not been any reported incidents since the one last January and we expect that salad kit growth in Canada will start to increase again as consumers re-gain confidence in the category. (4) What is the expected revenue growth for salads for all of fiscal 2017? We now expect revenues from our salad products to be flat to slightly down this year compared to last year due to Costco’s multi-sourcing strategy and Canadian growth decline. However, on a positive front, our U.S growth for salad kits, excluding Costco, during the first six months of fiscal 2017 was 42% compared to category growth of 17%. We continue to see salads as a major growth platform at Apio as we innovate new items, add new products to existing accounts and expand our distribution to key U.S. accounts. Sam’s Club continues to expand our salad products within their stores. In May of 2016, we began shipping our Sweet Kale Salad to approximately 400 Walmart stores.  Due to its high performance, Walmart quickly expanded our salad to approximately 1,400 stores in October.  The next opportunity to expand further in Walmart will be in April 2017. Selling Eat Smart products to the highly competitive U.S. retail market has required Apio to evolve its sales capabilities. In May of 2016, we hired a new Chief Customer and Sales Officer at Apio to lead a re-structuring of the sales organization and the implementation of new systems and controls. Our new data analytics platform is a key tool that will arm the sales organization with the data required to drive a compelling brand story that includes shopper insights, merchandising, promotional and pricing information to grow a profitable business for both Apio and our customers. 5) In the previous earnings release call, you mentioned that you were transitioning to a new market database.  Is that transition complete and what are the updated Apio market share and All Commodity Volume (“ACV”) numbers? To further differentiate Apio, we have invested in upgrading our market data analytics platform and insight analysis.  Since our previous earnings call, Apio has completed the transition from Nielsen Perishables Freshfacts data to the Nielsen Answers data and added Nielsen Homescan Panel, which provides consumer scan data and shopper insights for all stores, including Costco. The switch to the new database provides many advantages. First, we now receive data from nearly double the number of retail stores (over 35,000 versus 18,000).  Second, we have store-specific product, pricing and promotional data that is available by geography and banner.  Finally, Homescan data provides consumer insights and Costco-specific data that we did not have previously.  This new platform will provide improved data and shopper insights that will drive more informed product development, pricing and promotional decisions. With the new data platform, Apio’s North American market share statistics showed very little change from the old platform (less than 100 basis points).  For 52 weeks ended October 29, 2016, the size of the North American market in which Apio participates (vegetable bags, vegetable trays and salad kits) is approximately $3.2 billion in consumer retail dollars including retail and club stores.  Of this market, Apio’s overall share is approximately 17% while Apio’s Eat Smart salad kits have a market share of approximately 13%.  In Canadian retail, Eat Smart salad kits enjoy a 44% share while in U.S. retail, Eat Smart salads have a share of approximately 3%, presenting a large growth opportunity for Eat Smart salad kits in the U.S. retail market. Apio’s North American ACV statistics differed to a slightly larger extent from the old platform (between 100 and 1000 basis points depending on the product segment or geography), primarily due to the large increase in the number of retail stores being included in the new database. ACV is also not tracked for some categories.  For the 52 week ended October 29, 2016, in U.S. retail Eat Smart salad kit ACV was approximately 17% while total Eat Smart branded packaged fresh vegetables ACV was approximately 34%.  In Canadian retail, ACV for Eat Smart salad kits was 84%. Our goal is to continue to grow the Eat Smart market share and ACV of salad kits in the U.S., specifically with major U.S. customers.  We intend to share our new analytics and insights with those strategic customers who choose Apio as their innovation partner to drive growth and profitability for both partners. 6) How is produce sourcing looking thus far in fiscal 2017? Produce sourcing for the first seven months of fiscal 2017 has been within expectations, with an adequate supply of virtually all of our high volume crops. During our third fiscal quarter we enter the winter season when we source most of our California crops from southern California and Mexico. This is also the time of year when we get virtually all of our green beans from Florida. The winter season has historically been the time of year when we have suffered our most significant produce shortages, which occurred last year. Overall, for the first seven months of fiscal 2017 our produce sourcing costs are on plan and so far winter sourcing is consistent with our expectations. 7) What is the status of Windset’s expansion plans and the permitting issues? Windset is nearing completion of a new ten-acre facility on land Windset owns in the City of Santa Maria using a new type of greenhouse structure that Windset intends to use to grow strawberries on a small commercial scale. They have also started construction on a new 30-acre glass greenhouse, which is also on land they own in the City of Santa Maria, where they currently intend to grow peppers and/or cucumbers.  Windset expects that it will begin commercially harvesting strawberries this month and peppers this spring. Windset is also looking at constructing an even larger strawberry structure on land it owns in the City of Santa Maria but it is in the early planning stages and any construction of this new facility will not begin until later this calendar year. Windset is still working with the County of Santa Barbara on permitting for land it is leasing in the County for the construction of greenhouses using its new type of greenhouse structures but does not expect approval for at least 9-12 months. 8) Why did the Company refinance its debt during the quarter? The Company refinanced its debt to lower its interest expense and increase its financial flexibility in support of Landec’s five-year growth plan. Landec plans to use these funds to capitalize on the significant tailwinds in the healthy living segments in which it participates by expanding its existing operations and fueling its internal innovation initiatives. Our new syndicated credit facility of $150 million with JPMorgan Chase, BMO Harris Bank and City National Bank, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada, consists of a $50 million term loan that refinanced existing debt and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The $50 million term loan has a five-year term with a ten-year amortization and no prepayment penalties. Our interest expense, excluding the $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing, over the next 12 months is projected to decrease by approximately $400,000 compared to the interest expense the Company would have incurred on the previous loans that were refinanced. The interest rate is based on Landec’s leverage ratio and can range from LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.25%. On November 1, 2016, the Company fixed its LIBOR rate for the next five years at 1.22%. The current spread is 1.75% and therefore the current interest rate on our term loan is 2.97%. 9) What are Landec’s top priorities for the next 12 to 24 months? Our continuing priorities are: (a) Shifting our product mix to higher margin products at both Apio and Lifecore while advancing the CDMO strategy at Lifecore. (b) Increasing demand for both our packaged vegetable products and our biomaterials products to fill the additional capacity added in fiscal 2016. (c) Developing innovative new salad products to broaden and strengthen our offerings. (d) Expanding our retail presence in the U.S. through gaining new customers and increasing distribution with existing customers. (e) Increasing return on invested capital by maximizing returns on each capital allocation decision. (f) Focusing on evaluating the natural food product segment to identify areas where Landec can enter through new product development and/or strategic acquisitions or investments. (g) Executing on our Lifecore programs with existing customers and securing new partnerships utilizing our CDMO strategy. (h) Supporting Windset in its expansion plans to build new hydroponic controlled atmosphere structures using new growing methods for new crops. 10) How do the results by line of business for the three and six months ended November 27, 2016 compare with the same period last year?

At 8:24 a.m. Sunday, a Milpitas police officer saw a gold 2014 Hyundai Elantra with temporary paper plates in the parking lot of the store at 301 Ranch Drive. The officer inspected the car and saw a man sleeping in the right front passenger seat, police said. A check of the vehicle identification number revealed the car was reported stolen from Santa Clara on Dec. 20. Officers detained the person sleeping in the Hyundai and continued to watch the vehicle, police said. Eventually, officers contacted Arce as he returned to the stolen car and tried to get in, but he ran away. Police say they chased Arce as he ran into Walmart, but he was quickly arrested in the store. A search of the car revealed drug paraphernalia and a stolen passport, police said. Arce was on probation for automobile theft in Santa Clara County. In addition, he had three felony warrants from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and the San Jose Police Department for robbery, narcotics sales, and violation of his probation. The suspect also had a misdemeanor warrant from the San Jose Police Department for possession of an illegal knife, police said. Arce was booked into Santa Clara County Main Jail for possession of a stolen vehicle, possession of stolen property, possession of drug paraphernalia and for the outstanding warrants. The passenger was released at the scene, police said.   Tags:  Crime Blotter Aliyah Mohammed Aliyah Mohammed covers local government, education, breaking news and community issues in Milpitas and Fremont.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988. From left, Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and the late Jason Mizell. MARK LENNIHAN / AP, file The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. It called the Run-DMC brand "extremely valuable," and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse Adidas sneakers from Adidas The lawsuit alleges defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group had officially disbanded. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suspect -- apparently a trespasser -- had opened fire on the officers last April before police killed him, Fox 10 reported. OFFICER'S 14-YEAR-OLD SON DIES IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER FOUND SHOT IN THE HEAD A worker at the Walmart in Chandler called 911 on 24-year-old Mitchell Oakley, saying he'd trespassed at the store before, according to investigators. Officers Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell arrived at the scene before Oakley fired at them, police said, adding that one gunshot critically wounded Pueblo.

(Arizona Dept. of Corrections) MAN ARMED WITH KNIFE SHOT TO DEATH BY NEW YORK POLICE As the video released by police showed, Colwell raced after the gunman, with the officer firing his weapon as he slid on the floor. Oakley barged out the door, dropping what appeared to be a gun before he stumbled on the ground. Police confirmed the officer killed the suspect. Colwell also suffered injuries in the gunfight, police said. Both officers were wearing ballistic vests at the time, Detective Seth Tyler told the Arizona Republic. Oakley had served a few months in prison for attempted aggravated assault and vehicle theft. Chandler is a 30-minute drive southeast of Phoenix. Click for more from Fox 10.

Surveillance video from the store shows 29-year-old Michael Brandon Jemison and Justin Jones arguing with each other, Tomball police said. According to investigators, Jemison hit Jones with the helmet, causing him to collapse inside the store. Jones died at the hospital. Lindsey Stover says she never imagined starting the new year without "JJ." "He told me he loved me, I told him I loved him. I didn't think that would be the last kiss I ever got from him," Stover said. Jones was a father of two and Stover says had taken on raising her children, too. "He was great with kids. My kids, my sister's kids, his own kids especially," she said. "He was a big kid himself. Happy, full of life." Police say Jones was inside the Walmart early Monday morning with a friend, then had a conversation with Jemison. "We have reason to believe that they knew each other. It appears it has been an ongoing feud between people in that group," said Sgt. Gary Hammond, with the Tomball Police Department. Stover says the friend Jones was with was withdrawing money to give him before the encounter with Jemison. She believes it was only about $60. "I don't think it was spur of the moment. This guy saw an old enemy," Stover said. She says the incident should have never ended like this. "Stand up, act like a man, you take another man's life, turn yourself in," Stover said. "Own up to what you did and quit hiding." If you have any information, you are asked to contact the Tomball Police Department at 281-351-5451.

The 36-second clip, released by the Chandler Police Department, shows how a “seemingly routine” police response to a reported trespasser turned deadly last April — when the suspect suddenly opened fire on the officers. The 24-year-old suspect, Mitchell Oakley, squeezed off several shots as soon as Officers Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell arrived at the store, the Arizona Republic reported. The video shows Colwell diving across the floor as Oakley, a convicted felon, dashes out of the store. The officer then returns fire as Oakley sprints through the exit and bullets shatter the storefront door. The video then shows another angle of Oakley storming out of the store with a gun in his right hand, with Colwell following just behind. Police officials said both officers were wearing ballistic vests, but Pueblo was shot in the face. Colwell took two bullets to his vest, knocking him to the floor, before he flipped over and fired back at Oakley. He was released from the hospital in a wheelchair just one week after the shooting, ABC15.com reports. Police officials created donation accounts for both officers last April. Pueblo, who was released from the hospital one week after the shooting, remains on medical leave while recovering. Colwell has since returned to duty, Detective Seth Tyler said. Meanwhile, Oakley’s parents told the Arizona Republic the incident was out of the norm for their son, who had never previously owned a gun or shot firearms. “It’s a shock,” Laura Oakley told the newspaper. “I never would have expected it.” Chandler Police Chief Sean Duggan told reporters in April that the incident was another example of how dangerous policing can be. “Our officers responded to what some may call a routine call, even though we realized that there is no such thing as a routine call,” Duggan said, according to KTAR.com. “But when they arrived, as they approached, they were shot multiple times in a matter of seconds. A seemingly routine call turned into a deadly encounter within a split-second.  At that point, the officers drew their guns and they shot and killed the suspect.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under arizona ,  police shootings ,  trespassing ,  walmart Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Trump blames 'Schumer clowns' for ObamaCare 'mess' Read Next Trump blames 'Schumer clowns' for ObamaCare 'mess' Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 12-year-old girl live streams her suicide in front yard Share Selection Trending Now in News 39,807 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure 31,257 Like clockwork, Trump rips 'Saturday Night Live' on Twitter 23,976 Bob Woodward calls Trump dossier 'garbage' Now On More women rip Michael Che’s dating app etiquette Katie Couric’s ready for her TV comeback Eric Schneiderman and Preet Bharara power lunch SEE ALL Now On How To Watch The NFL Playoff Games Online For Free SEE ALL Most Popular This Week Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon...

Bay County Sheriff's deputies, Bay City Public Safety Officers and Michigan State Police cordoned off entrances as Bangor Township firefighters dealt with the smoking compactor, which was extinguished by 10:15 a.m. Entrances were blocked at the south end of the complex, also home to Home Depot and Dollar Tree stores which remained open. The parking lot was still accessible by the north entrance near Home Depot. The fire was contained to the trash compactor, and no flames were visible when authorities arrived, according to a Bay County Sheriff's deputy at the scene. Authorities said the store may reopen later in the day, but remained evacuated as of 10:15 a.m. due to smoke inside the building. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, officials said.

The alleged trespasser pulled out a gun and shot the two officers multiple times before one of the injured officers returned fire, killing him. Although the incident occurred last April, the Chandler Police Department just released the video of the shootout yesterday. Both officers survived being shot multiple times. During the early morning of April 23, 2016, Officer Joshua Pueblo went to the Walmart store to help fellow officer Daniel Colwell. Colwell had gone to the store to evict a person who had previously trespassed in the store. The suspect was later identified as Mitchell Oakley. The video begins showing Pueblo walking in the store to answer what appeared to be a non-emergency call. The officers can be seen outside the McDonald’s restaurant located in the store. Video inside McDonald’s shows something is happening at the entrance way of the restaurant. Customers in the restaurant can be seen reacting to the shots being fired; an employee and another customer can be seen running to the back of the store. The next clip shows the entrance way to McDonald’s. Oakley is standing at the entrance as the two officers approach him and one comes within inches of the alleged trespasser. The suspect pulls a gun and fires, hitting each officer multiple times. Pueblo, who was shot in the face, managed to get away to safety. Colwell chased after Oakley and fell, hitting a sign near the entrance to Walmart. Oakley then runs out of the store and stops to pick up something he dropped, presumably his gun. Colwell, while in a sitting position after having fallen, shot and killed the fleeing man as he bent down to pick up the item he dropped. Despite being shot multiple times, Officer Daniel Colwell managed to shoot and kill shooter Chandler Police Department Colwell was taken to hospital and released the same weekend. Pueblo, who was shot in the arm and face, was initially hospitalized in the ICU but was later transferred to an ordinary ward. Oakley, who was described by police as a transient, had a criminal record, and spent time in jail for aggravated assault, car theft and destruction of jail property. He was last released from jail in March 2015. A few days after the shootings, Chandler Police Chief Sean Duggan praised the bravery of the two officers saying they put their lives on the line and “literally saved people inside the store.” He also said the incident served as a reminder of how dangerous the job is. Pueblo is now recovering at home and is on medical leave. Colwell is back on the job.

(NYSE: WMT), BMO Capital’s Wayne Hood noted that average price reduction in the broad grocery category remained flat in December as compared to November. Hood maintains an Underperform rating on the company, with a price target of $63. Price Moderation The analyst mentioned that the sequential price moderation was offset by more aggressive pricing in the household essentials, beauty and baby categories, while promotions increased year on year but were sequentially relatively flat. More specifically, average food price reduction improved in December to 17 percent, from 18 percent in November, while the household essentials, beauty and baby categories witnessed elevated sequential average price reductions, as Wal-Mart Stores attempted to take market share in these categories. “The improvement in average price reductions in Food leaves us believing traffic is in line with management expectations, leading to 4Q16 SSS growth of 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent,” Hood stated. Margins Food margins are expected to be in line with expectations, although margins in the household essentials, beauty and baby categories are likely to be under pressure due to more aggressive pricing throughout the quarter. “As expected, in Entertainment, we see a spike in average price reduction in Electronics, Video Games, and the Photo Center in December. Furthermore, the average price reduction in Toys spiked in November before tapering off at the end of December,” the analyst added. Wall-Mart Stores' electronics category is likely to generate better margins in Q4, given the average price reductions. In addition, there was meaningful improvements in price reduction in the apparel category, against the backdrop of lower price reductions in clothing.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Chandler cops Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell strolled into the store in April to deal with what they thought would be a straightforward case of trespassing. But as they approached Mitchell Oakley in a McDonald's inside the supermarket, shoppers were sent sprawling as bullets were sprayed, hitting both cops.  Pueblo was shot in the face and his colleague Colwell was hit with two bullets from close range which knocked him to the ground. CCTV footage shows the moment Colwell reaches for his gun as he is sliding backwards on the floor and fires back at the convicted felon. As Oakley attempts his getaway, he drops his weapon outside the store.  He tries to go back for it, but is shot dead by the injured Colwell. The clip also captures Pueblo escaping the melee leaving behind a trail of blood after being shot in the face. Officer Joshua Pueblo remains on medical leave while recovering from gunshot wounds to the face and arm.  Mitchell Oakley, left in the red top, shoots officers Pueblo - who can be seen scrambling away from the scene having been hit in the face - and Colwell who is sliding backwards The officers stroll into the Walmart in Arizona expecting to deal with a routine call Diving for cover: Officer Colwell dramatically jumps out of the way as Oakley opens fire Instinctive: He barrel rolls mid-dive to ensure he is in a position to return fire during the April shooting despite having been shot twice by Oakley  Fatal mistake: Oakley attempts to flee with his gun in his right hand while Officer Colwell is seen on the left taking aim Final seconds: Oakley manages to make it outside into the forecourt of the Walmart store but is shot dead seconds later by Officer Colwell  Response: Officer Colwell fires the fatal shots that killed Mitchell Oakley just seconds after he opened fire from the McDoanld's restaurant inside  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Pictured: Five of the eight relatives shot-dead 'execution...

Share this article Share Heroes: Officers Daniel Colwell (left) and Joshua Pueblo (right) responded to the shooting at Walmart in April Shooter: Mitchell Oakley was shot dead by cops at Walmart after he opened fire and injured two officers in April  Police were called around 6.30am regarding a trespasser at the store, said Chandler police spokesman Seth Tyler. The officers encountered the unidentified male suspect at the front of the store, just past the greeters' area. According to witnesses, the first officer entered the store and was fired upon immediately by the suspect, Tyler said. The second officer, who was in close proximity, was also shot but was able to return fire.   Chandler police spokesman Seth Tyler stands behind crime tape at the scene of a police-involved shooting at a Walmart store on Saturday 'I guess you can call it what you want. It sounds like an ambush to me,' Tyler said. Cynthia Ayala was on the other side of the store in a dressing room when she heard the gunfire but didn't at first realize what she heard. 'I thought it was like pallets falling. I never thought it would be gunshots,' Ayala said. She said the shots came one after another and then it became apparent they were bullets. 'I was just really scared as to where they would fall,' Ayala said. She came out of the dressing room when things calmed down. She said employees then escorted her and other shoppers to the store's garden center.  Read more: Surveillance video released in April shooting of two Chandler officers - ABC15 Arizona Share or comment on this article e-mail 2.3k shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow She's falling for him?

Blake is charged with squirting at least 12 women with syringes filled with his semen He would allegedly masturbate in his company truck or in the Walmart bathroom in Marietta, Ohio He allegedly would fill a syringe with his semen and then spray it on unsuspecting women According to police, he said 'maybe it was his way of having sex with these women'  By Daily Mail Reporter Published: 00:36 EST, 4 January 2017 | Updated: 01:45 EST, 4 January 2017 e-mail 5.5k shares 11 View comments Timothy D. Blake has been arrested and charged with squirting women with his semen A man has been charged with serial semen syringe squirting. The man, Timothy D. Blake, 28, of Sams Creek Road, Mineral Wells, West Virginia, was charged with being the suspect who had terrorized and grossed out a series of women in Marietta, Ohio who said they'd had semen squirted at them. Blake allegedly admitted to 12 instances over two months of masturbating, then filling a syringe with his semen, and following women around a Walmart in Washington County and spraying their backsides with his bodily fluids, reports News and Sentinel. He was tracked down when a woman noticed a 'creepy man' lingering around her as she shopped in the makeup aisle and then felt something wet and squishy on her backside and went to the bathroom to clean it off, but it was sticky, according to the criminal complaint. She said when she came out, she found Blake staring at her. Blake would target women at the Marietta Walmart (above) and spray them with his semen, according to police  When he tried to leave, she followed him and saw the company truck he was driving, which had a distinctive bumblebee insignia for the oilfield company where he works. Using this description as well as that from other women and surveillance video, police were able to identify and locate Blake, said the outlet. He was arrested as he ate dinner at a restaurant with his wife.   'It's not something that we've encountered before and after we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said it was something that he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it,' Sheriff Mincks of the Washington County Sheriff's Office told WTAP. According to the criminal complaint, Blake said the material used was egg yolks until an officer advised that they'd had the material tested, at which point he admitted to it being semen, but only some of the time.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Bikini-clad teen who was slammed to ground by former Texas...

Share this article Share According to a court filing, Blake said he would masturbate in his truck or in the Walmart parking lot and then fill a syringe with his bodily fluid. When pressed as to what he thought he was doing, he replied 'maybe it was his way of having sex with these women and that was what he thought of when committing these acts.'  He also said he was molested as a child, and said his wife was completely unaware of his activities.   Blake allegedly drove three company trucks, all 2014 Fords, one black, one white and the third brown, during his alleged acts. According to the Smoking Gun, Blake was released on $11,000 bond on Tuesday but he is required to wear a GPS ankle monitor as part of his release conditions.   Read more: Mineral Wells man arrested for stalking Mineral Wells man arrested for sex crimes in Washington County | News, Sports, Jobs - News and Sentinel Walmart Squirter | The Smoking Gun Walmart Squirter | The Smoking Gun Female Shoppers Squirted With Bodily Fluid | The Smoking Gun Share or comment on this article e-mail 5.5k shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow She's falling for him?

ASSOCIATED PRESS Items lie scattered about after a storm south of Mount Olive, Miss., took of a roof Monday. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Crews were assessing damage today in the aftermath of storms that killed at least five people and brought heavy rain and strong winds to the Southeast. The line of severe thunderstorms spawned several possible tornadoes as the storms moved across Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. The worst of the storms had passed through the region by late this morning as the system headed toward the Atlantic Ocean. Four people were killed Monday evening when a tree fell on their mobile home in Rehobeth, Alabama, said Kris Ware, a spokeswoman for the Dothan Houston County Emergency Management Agency. Teams of surveyors were headed out today to assess apparent tornado damage at three sites in southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, said Mark Wool, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida. Wool said authorities believe a tornado is responsible for damage that left the four people dead in Alabama, but he said the weather service won’t be able to say for sure until experts visit the site. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement on social media that the Houston County sheriff had told him about the deaths and he offered “prayers for those impacted.” In Florida, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that 70-year-old William Patrick Corley’s body was found Monday afternoon following flooding near the Shoal River in Mossy Head. Authorities said Corley’s car was partially submerged and his body was floating face-down nearby. The sheriff’s office said Corley’s death remained under investigation, but no foul play was suspected. State emergency officials reported no injuries or deaths in Louisiana and Mississippi, but a trip to Walmart was memorable for some shoppers in Marksville, Louisiana, as severe weather blew out skylights in the store, sending water and glass cascading onto shoppers. Marksville Fire Chief Jerry Bordelon said a fireworks stand in the Walmart parking lot was tossed 30 or 40 yards and mangled. The storm also knocked over 18-wheel truck trailers and punched holes in the store’s roof. The fire department ordered shoppers to leave the store, but some didn’t want to leave even as managers closed it. “Believe it or not, we had some people in there who were still trying to shop,” Bordelon said. Walmart spokeswoman Erica Jones said the Arkansas-based company hopes to reopen the store today, but wasn’t sure that will happen, citing needed repairs to a natural gas line. Storms in central Mississippi near Mendenhall and Mount Olive were preliminarily identified as tornadoes by the National Weather Service, based in part on radar signatures. Both storms damaged farm buildings and homes. Other possible tornadoes will be surveyed later. In Louisiana, there was also relatively serious damage in the southwestern parishes of Beauregard and Allen, including the town of Reeves. Some wind damage was also reported in Houston and throughout East Texas. Though Arkansas had also been included in warnings, there was only a stray report of hail in Jackson County in the northeast part of the state. Tens of thousands lost power in Louisiana and Mississippi at the height of the storm, according to utilities. Freddie Zeigler, a meteorologist in the Weather Service’s New Orleans office, said heavy winds were preceding the squall line, possibly contributing to power outages. It was the second episode of heavy rain within days for some areas. An area stretching from Biloxi, Mississippi, through Alabama and across Macon and Augusta, Georgia, received more than 4 inches of rain Monday, according to radar estimates. Parts of southern Mississippi and southwest Alabama have received more than 8 inches of rain since Saturday. Though rivers along the Gulf Coast were rising rapidly Monday, only minor flooding was predicted. Rains in recent weeks have eased drought conditions across parts of the Southeast, according to reports from the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. Despite the rain and storms, large parts of north Alabama and north Georgia remain in “exceptional drought” — the most severe category — according to the center’s most recent report on the drought issued last week. A new report is due out Thursday.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Site Archive log in weather First phase of residential project at Plymouth's Cordage Park OK'd Tuesday Jan 3, 2017 at 8:56 PM Jan 4, 2017 at 7:13 AM Emily Clark eclark@wickedlocal.com @emilyOCM PLYMOUTH – The Seaport at Cordage residential project is ready to begin at the site of the old Walmart store at Cordage Park. Lou and Joe Janetty of Janco Development Inc., the company that owns Cordage Park and the Cordage Commerce Center, went before the planning board in late December to discuss the project. The plans call for 204 apartments on the 9-acre site – 51 of them designated as affordable. Lou Jannetty told the planning board that Janco Development had entered into a joint venture with Cathartes, a Boston-based real estate developer known for transforming old industrial buildings and warehouses into apartment and condominium complexes. Cathartes has developed Mezzo Design Lofts in Boston, condos in Jamaica Plain, and a Portsmouth, N.H., project that transformed an old, abandoned office building into hotels, office space and restaurants. Each of these developments is near public transportation. Cathartes project manager Rob Simmons told the planning board that the MBTA will increase commuter rail runs to Plymouth if the riders are there. There is a commuter rail station at the rear of the property. The 204 apartments will be in eight three-story buildings. The complex will also include a 37,000-square-foot club, a fenced outdoor swimming pool, pocket parks and plazas. The existing MBTA parking will remain where it is. The redesigned road to the development, to be called Loring Boulevard, will include sidewalks. In 2006, town meeting rezoned the site to allow projects under the state’s Chapter 40R zoning law, which encourages a mix of denser-than-usual residential development and commercial use near public transportation. The property required expensive infrastructure improvements, which delayed development. A $2 million MassWorks grant will help pay for construction of the boulevard from Court Street to the waterfront parcels and help cover the cost of utilities and pedestrian walkways. The first phase of the project also includes 23,000 square feet of mixed retail development along Court Street, plans for which have yet to be presented. Town Planner Robin Carver said that piece of the project will be presented at a later date.

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988. From left, Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and the late Jason Mizell. MARK LENNIHAN / AP, file The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. It called the Run-DMC brand "extremely valuable," and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse Adidas sneakers from Adidas The lawsuit alleges defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group had officially disbanded. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The closings will affect 3,900 employees at those stores, who may be offered jobs at other stores. An additional 6,200 employees at central operations, mostly in management, will lose their jobs. As customers continue to choose online shopping to in-store shopping, Macy’s is attempting to streamline its operations across the country. Terry Lundgren, the company’s CEO, said that the majority of Macy’s transactions still occur in stores. Retail stores across the country have struggled with the transition to online sales. This week, Sears announced it would close an additional 19 stores. Late last year, Wal-Mart announced it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs, while American Apparel said it may soon layoff 3,500 employees. Layoffs in retails were at their highest level in 2016 than they had been since 2010, as many companies closed unproductive stores and dealt with growing expenses and increasing wages. Krishnadev Calamur Jan. 4, 2017, 1:35 p.m. Tweet Share UPDATE: Netanyahu Backs Pardon for Convicted Israeli Soldier Elor Azaria Elor Azaria’s father prays as he stands last March over the IDF soldier who was accused of killing a Palestinian man in Hebron. A military court in Jaffa found Azaria guilty on Wednesday. (Amir Cohen / Reuters) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he supports a pardon for Sergeant Elor Azaria, the Israeli soldier convicted of shooting and killing a Palestinian attacker who had been disarmed and was lying on the ground. Any such pardon lies in the hands of Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Haaretz reports the defense minister and chief military prosecutor must both submit a request for a pardon to the president in order for Rivlin to act. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has termed calls for the pardon “ignorance and slogans.” Our original post at 7:30 a.m. ET Sergeant Elor Azaria, the Israeli soldier who shot and killed a Palestinian attacker who had been disarmed and was lying on the ground, has been convicted by an Israeli military court in Jaffa. At issue is the incident that occurred March 24, 2016. A Palestinian man, later identified as Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, and his friend, Ramzi Aziz al-Qasrawi, stabbed an Israeli soldier. Qasrawi was shot and killed. Sharif was shot, wounded, and was lying immobile on the ground. Video from the scene showed Azaria, who was standing several meters away, cocking his gun, and shooting the Palestinian in the head, killing him. The Israeli Military Police arrested Azaria, 20, investigated the killing, and later charged him with manslaughter. The case caused widespread debate in Israel that has seen a spate of random knife and vehicular attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians and military personnel. Azaria’s defense attorneys argued the sergeant suspected Sharif, the 21-year-old Palestinian attacker, was trying to detonate a suicide vest. But military officials contended that Azaria’s actions violated the Israel Defense Forces’s (IDF) code of conduct. Indeed, one witness, a fellow IDF soldier, testified that Azaria had told him during the incident, “They stabbed my friend and tried to kill him—he deserves to die.” The three-judge panel, which made the ruling Wednesday, said it had no reason to doubt that testimony. J. Weston Phippen Jan. 4, 2017, 11:53 a.m. Tweet Share Dylann Roof's First Words to the Jury Chuck Burton / AP Dylan Roof, the man who killed nine black parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, spoke his first words to the jury on Wednesday, telling its members “there is nothing wrong with me, psychologically.” Roof has already been convicted by a federal court of all 33 counts against him, including hate-crime charges, and faces either life in prison or the death penalty. He chose to represent himself during the penalty phase, and previously said he’d provide no evidence or witness in his defense—only a statement. He’d had been ordered by the federal judge Monday not to approach the jury or witness stand, and he was restricted to talking behind the lectern. Roof spoke for about two minutes on Wednesday, saying he’d represented himself because he didn’t want his lawyers to try to sway the jury with arguments to make him seem incompetent to stand trial. Earlier, federal prosecutors urged the jury to sentence Roof to death, and also presented a jailhouse journal Roof kept shortly after his arrest. In it, the 22-year-old white supremacist wrote that he felt no remorse. “I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.” J. Weston Phippen Jan. 4, 2017, 10:34 a.m. Tweet Share Burmese Government Panel: No Evidence of Genocide Against Rohingya Soe Zeya Tun / Reuters An investigation commission set up by Burma’s president has found no evidence of genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, contrary to allegations made by human-rights organizations. The interim report was released Wednesday by the commission, created by President Htin Kyaw, following international criticism over the violence against the Rohingya. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Burma. Many live in Rakhine State, which shares a border with Bangladesh. The Rohingya are considered one of the world’s most persecuted people. In 2012 they were the targets of violence that killed hundreds and displaced 100,000. The most recent crackdown began in October after Burmese border guards were attacked allegedly by Rohingya. Since then the Rohingya have accused government soldiers of murder, rape, torture, and of burning their homes. The government has denied this, though there is growing evidence some of the allegations are true. Last month, 13 Nobel laureates and 10 other international humanitarian leaders petitioned the UN Security Council to intervene, calling the violence in Burma “ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” Krishnadev Calamur Jan. 4, 2017, 10:26 a.m. Tweet Share Commuter Train Derailment Injures 100 in Brooklyn (Reuters) Updated at 2:08 p.m. A Long Island Railroad train derailed Wednesday at the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, New York, causing injuries to 103 people—none of them life-threatening, the city’s Fire Department said. The train “came off the rail” as it entered the terminal at about 8:20 a.m., a department spokesman said. The New York Times, citing an unnamed Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee, reported the “train had come into the station and went past the area where it would normally stop. It hit the bumping block, a barrier meant to stop a train in an emergency,” causing the first car to be lifted off the rails. 103 injuries reported at scene of Atlantic Terminal LIRR train derailment, all non-life-threatening pic.twitter.com/t5p78cAFlU — FDNY (@FDNY) January 4, 2017 J.

The men killed at least one guard in the gunfight at North Cotabato District Jail, which holds 1,500 inmates, and is located in Kidapawan city. This area, on the southern island of Mindanao, is home to a decades-long insurgency. The attackers cut power to the prison and fired on the building. The goal apparently was to free members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a rebel group. The facility has a history of prison breaks, and this is the third and largest break in the past decade. Krishnadev Calamur Jan. 4, 2017, 7:51 a.m. Tweet Share Turkey Says It Has Identified Istanbul Attacker A frame grab made from a video distributed by Turkish police shows the suspected gunman. (Dogan / Reuters) Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says investigators have identified the man who carried out the New Year’s day attack on a nightclub in Istanbul that killed 39 people. No other details were offered about the gunman, who is still at large. Several suspects were arrested Wednesday in Izmir in connection with the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State. Another dozen people were arrested in raids in Istanbul on Thursday. The attack was the latest in Turkey that has seen a rash of similar incidents since last year, and marks, as my colleague Graeme Wood noted, the end of ISIS’s “separate peace with Turkey.” Past attacks have been blamed on Kurdish separatists and others.

They don’t own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics—dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale—are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam The 19-year old company has been purchased for $88 million, which may be the brand’s last great marketing feat. It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy turned-scandal plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials—especially those who identify with the term hipsters—likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive t-shirts were emblematic of made-in-America cool. The company’s marketing blended the feel-good altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured over-the-top sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. Continue Reading Bettmann / Getty The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak When it comes to basic policy questions such as the minimum wage, introductory economics can be more misleading than it is helpful. In a rich, post-industrial society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9–$10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a full-time restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Mike Segar/Reuters Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Alex Wagner Indiana Democrats weigh in on their experience with the former governor. Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready—maybe even months (or years!).   The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead.” Continue Reading Morgan Heim / Day’s Edge Production The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science J. Weston Phippen Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time.” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Continue Reading Paul Windle Machiavelli Was Right Michael Ignatieff The shocking lesson of The Prince isn’t that politics demands dirty hands, but that politicians shouldn’t care. You remember the photograph: President Obama hunched in a corner of the Situation Room with his national-security staff, including Hillary Clinton with a hand over her mouth, watching the live feed from the compound in Pakistan where the killing of Osama bin Laden is under way. This is a Machiavellian moment: a political leader taking the ultimate risks that go with the exercise of power, now awaiting the judgment of fate. He knows that if the mission fails, his presidency is over, while if it succeeds, no one should ever again question his willingness to risk all. It’s a Machiavellian moment in a second sense: an instance when public necessity requires actions that private ethics and religious values might condemn as unjust and immoral. We call these moments Machiavellian because it was Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince, written in 1513, that first laid bare the moral world of politics and the gulf between private conscience and the demands of public action. Continue Reading WIkimedia Commons Why More Writers Should Talk About Money Joseph Frankel A new collection of essays and interviews breaks one of the biggest taboos of the literary world. Money makes people anxious—perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it.” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a well-received debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance. Continue Reading Beth J. Harpaz / AP Flesh-Eating Worms Reach Florida's Mainland Sarah Zhang A massive eradication effort wiped out screwworms in the U.S. 35 years ago—but then they reappeared. The stray dog came with bad news. This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that a dog near Homestead, Florida—a city 15 miles north of the Florida Keys—was found with wounds infested with screwworms, the much dreaded flesh-eating pest. If you’re not familiar with screwworm, it’s because the U.S. poured millions of dollars into eradicating them back in 1982. But last fall, it reemerged in the Florida Keys, catching almost everyone by surprise. Wildlife biologists eventually found several deer on the archipelago with the parasite. Screwworms lay eggs in open wounds, burrowing into the flesh of pets and occasionally even humans. Livestock, historically, was the big economic concern. Florida still sends hundreds thousands of young calves to herds around the country each year, so a screwworm infestation could do some real damage.

"It's not that the mall is dead. It's that the mall's rent is too expensive for all but the most exclusive specialty retailers that can make money selling goods at nosebleed price points," the "Mad Money" host said. In the old days, Cramer's mom worked at Lit Brothers selling lingerie, and his father worked at Gimbels selling men's slacks. They used to marvel at how quickly a small retailer would go under when it would get steamrolled by the expansion of big players like Woolworth's, Grant's and K-Mart. The same vicious cycle continues to happen in retail today, he said. Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images The exterior of a Macy's department store is seen at the Fair Oaks Mall on January 5, 2017, in Fairfax, Virginia. "It's not that the mall is dead. It's that the mall's rent is too expensive for all but the most exclusive specialty retailers that can make money selling goods at nosebleed price points." -Jim Cramer Wal-Mart and Target are now the ones trying to stay relevant among fierce competition from online shopping. So, when it came to Macy's and Kohl's, Cramer wondered what the point of their existence even was. He would rather just go to Amazon or the boutique stores in the mall that cost a fortune, but can help him pick out something nice for his wife. "Macy's is the third-largest online seller in its categories after Amazon and Wal-Mart, but that doesn't pay the rent," Cramer said. There is still room for ultra-specialty retailers, but that is only because the elite one-percent has to shop somewhere, he said. They won't dish $10,000 for a pair of earrings without seeing them in person. Mass merchandise, even the higher-end kind from Saks or Nordstrom, on the other hand, doesn't cut it. If a shopper knows their size, they can just buy the item online or from Amazon. "Everyone is too cheap to shop at the mall. It's just too inconvenient unless you are uber-wealthy and need to see the ultra-luxury wares in person before buying them," Cramer said. And if Macy's and Kohl's haven't figured that out yet, Cramer fears there just might not be a solution. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Photo/AP Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to become secretary of state, disclosed personal wealth of as much as US$400 million ($569.3m), including a Texas cattle and horse ranch, ahead of Senate confirmation hearings expected next week. Tillerson, who met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others this week, promised to sell and restructure assets and resign from outside organizations that might pose a conflict. The newly retired ExxonMobil chief executive's federal financial disclosure filing shows that he directly holds stock in his former employer worth more than US$50 million that he has pledged to sell within 90 days if he is confirmed as the country's top diplomat. Tillerson has separately reached a US$180 million retirement agreement with ExxonMobil involving additional stock that would be placed in trust. He also pledged to recuse himself from any government decisions involving ExxonMobil for one year unless he is specifically authorized to participate. The State Department sometimes helps energy companies as they seek resources, markets and contacts around the world, and it advises many large corporations. During the decade that Tillerson led Exxon, the State Department supported some of the oil giant's deals and opposed others, most notably a 2011 agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq. That deal, which took US officials by surprise, directly contradicted the US goal of a federal oil deal that would benefit Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites. Continued below. Related Content Donald Trump and his companies 'owe more than $1.4 billion', says Wall Street Journal Cartoon: Another Kiwi classic - Household debt Summer Job: Spark chief executive Simon Moutter The listing of Tillerson's stock and bond holdings shows that he invested in competing energy companies including Total and Royal Dutch Shell while running Exxon. His portfolio includes American and international businesses ranging from Walmart and Walt Disney to Novartis, Sony and Yum China Holdings, which franchises KFC and other fast-food chains in China. Federal disclosure requirements call for the value of individual holdings or proceeds to be given as a range, so it is not possible to pinpoint Tillerson's net worth. Tillerson said he has already resigned from the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, and would resign from the Boy Scouts of America, the board of Ford's Theater and other organizations. He pledged to remove himself from business decisions surrounding the ranch in Bartonville, Texas, although he would continue to receive passive income from it. "I am committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct for government officials," Tillerson wrote in an accompanying letter to a State Department ethics lawyer. "If confirmed as secretary of state, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter," Tillerson wrote. The financial disclosure material was sent to the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday. Senate Democrats say they still want to see Tillerson's tax returns before holding what Republicans have said could be a two-day hearing January 11 to 12. Like Trump, Tillerson has refused to provide Congress with his tax returns, promising only "tax return information" upon request, and he has complex business interests from which he must disentangle himself to hold public office. Tillerson's energy-related work in Russia and his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to dominate his confirmation session. Tillerson's Capitol Hill tour does not appear to be winning new supporters, but it is convincing certain senators that when it comes to sanctions, he may not be as pro-Russia as he seems. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland, said after meeting with Tillerson for over an hour on Wednesday that the businessman was "pretty forthcoming" on sanctions and "understands the importance of sanctions and recognizes that you need to have the ability to get results." He was referring to US sanctions implemented against Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Cardin, the Senate's chief architect of comprehensive new Russia sanctions, has not indicated his support for Tillerson's nomination. Senator Christopher Coons, with whom Tillerson also met Wednesday, told NPR that he had a productive 90-minute meeting that included tough questions on Russia. Coons said he has not decided how to vote. Tillerson's close personal and business ties to Russia sparked an early backlash from senators, including a handful of key Republicans, who found alarming his acceptance of the Kremlin's Order of Friendship award in 2013 and his recorded opposition to Ukraine-related Russia sanctions in 2014. One of those Republicans, Senator John McCain, met with Tillerson on Wednesday, but he did not appear more favorably disposed to the businessman. When asked whether he would support Tillerson's nomination, McCain told a gathering of reporters "sure - there's also a realistic scenario that pigs fly." - Washington Post Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Philly Victorian homes is named a new historic district Jan 13 Posh health club to take over Macy's building in Suburban Square as Ardmore evolves Jan 12 Developer Bart Blatstein has secured a permit for a new grocery store on his sprawling vacant property along South Philadelphia’s Delaware River waterfront. The question is: Which one? Germany’s expanding Lidl chain was seen as coming to the site in a recent marketing presentation for the property, but it has since disappeared from the presentation. Whatever food retailer takes the space will be competing with a nearby Walmart Supercenter, a new Acme supermarket due to open in the summer, and other grocery options. “Supermarkets don’t want to open a store they don’t think is going to be successful,” said Steven Gartner, managing director for retail at commercial real estate firm CBRE in Philadelphia. “They have to be doing their research and looking at a void in the market and looking at competition.” The permit for “retail sale of food, beverages and groceries,” as well as 149 parking spaces, was awarded in November, according to a notice posted at the site. It applies to a section of the 21-acre property along South Columbus Boulevard, between Reed and Tasker Streets, that has been subdivided into a separate three-acre parcel, according to Philadelphia’s Department of Licenses and Inspections. The grocery store permit is the clearest sign yet that Blatstein is moving forward with plans for a shopping center and residential complex on his waterfront property, where a Foxwoods casino had once been planned. Some have criticized components of the proposal, such as its strip-mall-style retail, as being antithetical to larger planning goals for the Delaware waterfront that emphasize walkability and cohesion with neighborhoods to the west. Blatstein has said the shopping center would encourage vibrancy along the South Philadelphia waterfront by making residential development there more viable. He declined this week to discuss the grocery-store permit, saying he planned to share details about the entire development site as a whole at a later date. Plans posted to the website of Philadelphia brokerage MSC Retail, which is marketing space on the property, show a Wawa and other retailers, in addition to the grocery store, on the western half of the property. Jason Bock, an MSC broker involved with the project, said last year that the Wawa would be a "super" version of the convenience store with a gas station. Bock and Wawa Inc. spokeswoman Lori Bruce did not respond to messages this week seeking comment. The proposal also includes about 670 apartment and townhouse units east of the shopping area and on a pier that is part of the property, according to MSC’s presentation. The version of the site plan posted to MSC’s website early last year, when Blatstein’s proposal was first disclosed, identified the development’s supermarket as a branch of Germany’s Aldi Inc. chain. It was later replaced with a version that showed the market as being Lidl, another German chain that is currently expanding into the United States. The version currently posted identifies no supermarket by name. Lidl spokesman Will Harwood said in an email Thursday that the company is “not addressing each individual site or a total number of locations we intend to open.” Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG, a unit of the Schwarz Gruppe grocery conglomerate, aims to own and operate 150 stores in the Eastern United States eventually, according to the German Embassy’s website. The company's Arlington, Va.-based U.S. unit acquired a nearly four-acre development site in Philadelphia’s Port Richmond neighborhood last year.

Retailers often announce store closures in January following the holiday season, with Macy’s (68 stores) and Sears/Kmart (150 stores total) making large closing announcements this week. Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle said late Wednesday that it was closing five supermarkets in Ohio — two near Cleveland and three in the Columbus market. Those stores are expected to close between Feb. 4 and March 4. In addition, Giant Eagle said it was closing a Get Go location in Northern Ohio, as well as units in Altoona, Pa. and in Frederick, Md. These stores would close by Jan. 17. The company said the closures were “difficult but necessary” decisions but did not elaborate further on the reasons behind the closures. In Columbus, Giant Eagle was facing competition from a variety of retail banners “and fell on the higher end of the price spectrum vis-a-vis Kroger, Walmart, Meijer and obviously Aldi,” Sandy Skrovan, a Columbus-based retail consultant, told SN Thursday. In addition, she said, each of the closing units — which date to former Big Bear sites in which Giant Eagle first established its market presence in Columbus more than a decade ago — appeared to face real estate challenges due to surrounding competitors and in one case, a lack of retail neighbors. The Cleveland stores closing date to 2007 and 2008, reports said. Giant Eagle also said this week that one Get Go location and two Giant Eagle stores would close following the opening of new Giant Eagle in Erie, Pa. set to open this spring. Wal-Mart Stores in the meantime is expected to close a Neighborhood Market store in Chicago by Jan. 25, local reports said. That store was the first Neighborhood Market in Chicago, opening to much local fanfare in 2011. Walmart officials were not immediately available for further comment. Sears noted the 150 stores (108 Kmart, 42 Sears) set for closure generated about $1.2 billion in sales over the past 12 months, they generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $60 million over that same period. Sprouts Farmers Market on Thursday said it would open 11 new stores during its second quarter beginning in April, including two additional stores in Florida, where the first Sprouts in the Sunshine State is set to open next month. Sprouts said it intended to open 35 stores during the fiscal year.

Brian Hill | Staff Photographer   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     Plans for a new multi-tenant retail development that's expected to include a drive-through coffee shop have been given the green light by Carpentersville officials. The 10,000-square-foot building, containing five tenant spaces, would be built along Route 25 on vacant land between the existing AutoZone and Walgreens, Senior Planner John Svalenka said. The property is directly in front of the new Wal-Mart Supercenter that opened last summer -- a project officials say has since sparked business interest on the east side of the village. "Obviously because of that new development, there's (more) interest in developing properties in the area," Svalenka said. The village board this week OK'd plans for the new building, as well as a special use permit to include a drive-through along one side of the structure. Owners of the Meadowdale Shopping Center, who also own the vacant property, have been in negotiations with businesses interested in occupying the new building, he said. Though the names of the potential tenants are not being revealed, economic development director Pat Burke said earlier the space with a drive-through would contain a coffee shop. With a Wal-Mart nearby, Trustee Pat Schultz said the village has a unique opportunity to market and revitalize the village's east side, which has been lacking development the last few decades. Citing proximity to Interstate 90 and routes 72 and 62, she said the Route 25 corridor is convenient and accessible for travelers commuting to and from work. "We are right there in that hub for those main arteries," she said. "It's really great to see movement on the east side."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump’s pick for State Dept. discloses $400 million in wealth Thu Jan 5th, 2017 2:02pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Anne Gearan The Washington Post Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to become secretary of state, disclosed personal wealth of as much as $400 million, including a Texas cattle and horse ranch, ahead of Senate confirmation hearings expected next week. Tillerson, who met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others this week, promised to sell and restructure assets and resign from outside organizations that might pose a conflict. The newly retired ExxonMobil chief executive’s federal financial disclosure filing shows that he directly holds stock in his former employer worth more than $50 million that he has pledged to sell within 90 days if he is confirmed as the country’s top diplomat. Tillerson has separately reached a $180 million retirement agreement with ExxonMobil involving additional stock that would be placed in trust. He also pledged to recuse himself from any government decisions involving ExxonMobil for one year unless he is specifically authorized to participate. The State Department sometimes helps energy companies as they seek resources, markets and contacts around the world, and it advises many large corporations. During the decade that Tillerson led Exxon, the State Department supported some of the oil giant’s deals and opposed others, most notably a 2011 agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq. That deal, which took U.S. officials by surprise, directly contradicted the U.S. goal of a federal oil deal that would benefit Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites. The listing of Tillerson’s stock and bond holdings shows that he invested in competing energy companies including Total and Royal Dutch Shell while running Exxon. His portfolio includes American and international businesses ranging from Walmart and Walt Disney to Novartis, Sony and Yum China Holdings, which franchises KFC and other fast-food chains in China. Federal disclosure requirements call for the value of individual holdings or proceeds to be given as a range, so it is not possible to pinpoint Tillerson’s net worth. Tillerson said he has already resigned from the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, and would resign from the Boy Scouts of America, the board of Ford’s Theater and other organizations. He pledged to remove himself from business decisions surrounding the ranch in Bartonville, Texas, although he would continue to receive passive income from it. “I am committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct for government officials,” Tillerson wrote in an accompanying letter to a State Department ethics lawyer. “If confirmed as secretary of state, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter,” Tillerson wrote. The financial disclosure material was sent to the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday. Senate Democrats say they still want to see Tillerson’s tax returns before holding what Republicans have said could be a two-day hearing Jan. 11-12. Like Trump, Tillerson has refused to provide Congress with his tax returns, promising only “tax return information” upon request, and he has complex business interests from which he must disentangle himself to hold public office. Tillerson’s energy-related work in Russia and his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to dominate his confirmation session. Tillerson’s Capitol Hill tour does not appear to be winning new supporters, but it is convincing certain senators that when it comes to sanctions, he may not be as pro-Russia as he seems. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin of Maryland , said after meeting with Tillerson for over an hour on Wednesday that the businessman was “pretty forthcoming” on sanctions and “understands the importance of sanctions and recognizes that you need to have the ability to get results.” He was referring to U.S. sanctions implemented against Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Cardin, the Senate’s chief architect of comprehensive new Russia sanctions, has not indicated his support for Tillerson’s nomination. Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., with whom Tillerson also met Wednesday, told NPR that he had a productive 90-minute meeting that included tough questions on Russia. Coons said he has not decided how to vote. Tillerson’s close personal and business ties to Russia sparked an early backlash from senators, including a handful of key Republicans, who found alarming his acceptance of the Kremlin’s Order of Friendship award in 2013 and his recorded opposition to Ukraine-related Russia sanctions in 2014. One of those Republicans, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., met with Tillerson on Wednesday, but he did not appear more favorably disposed to the businessman. When asked whether he would support Tillerson’s nomination, McCain told a gathering of reporters “sure — there’s also a realistic scenario that pigs fly.” Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

That means deals, strategies, and money-saving hacks. However, although most money-saving hacks are well worth your time, some are red herrings. They appear to be great ways to save, but in reality, they can end up costing you a lot of time and trouble for very little reward. Here are five you should avoid. (See also on WiseBread.com: 8 Reasons Time Is Worth More Than Money) See Also on Kiplinger: 7 Budgeting Tools to Get Your Finances in Order 1. Changing Your Own Oil No doubt many people are shouting, "Hey, that is totally worth it!" at the screen right now, but let's look at the time, effort, and costs involved and see what kind of saving you're looking at. First of all, you have to purchase the initial equipment. This is a one-off expense, but you're looking at a good jack with jack stands, a drain pan, a filter wrench, a good flashlight, and maybe a creeper, a set of gloves, and coveralls. Depending on the quality of those items, you're looking at a minimum of $300. Then, you have the parts you need for every oil change: the oil, and the filter. Again, quality here can dictate cost. You can pay anywhere from $4-$60 for a filter, depending on the make and model of your car. But let's just say $5 for a filter. Oil is also a variable, depending on your climate, your car, and your budget. You can go for regular, blend, or full synthetic. You'll need at least four quarts, and even if you get the cheapest regular oil, you're in the hole for about $20. So there you have it — $25 for materials. Then there's your time. Mechanics with access to pneumatic tools and lifts can easily get under the car and do this in 15 minutes. You probably don't have those though. You'll spend around 30 minutes changing the oil, or longer if it's your first time. You also need to purchase a container for the old oil, and dispose of it safely. Consider all of that, and then look around for deals in your area. Many garages will offer oil changes at a loss, so that they can inspect your car, and find problems that they can work on for a profit. You can get an oil change for $20 or less, most of the time with a synthetic blend oil, plus a top-off your fluids. Just don't take it to the dealership, where an oil change can set you back $50 or more. Advertisement 2. Making Your Own Detergents, Soaps, and Cleaning Supplies You will often hear people (frugal experts especially), talking about the great value of making cleaning supplies. But before you dive into this process, take a look at the basic costs involved, and the time it takes to make them. Most of the time, you will have to buy ingredients that cost as much as, or even more than, the actual cleaning products themselves. These days, stores like Target and Walmart carry store-brand products that are so cheap it boggles the mind. And empty squeeze bottles can actually cost more than cleaning products that come in squeeze bottles! So while it may be fun to turn your kitchen or garage into a chemistry lab, purchasing bora, baking soda, lemons, bleaches, lye, essential oils, aloe vera gel, clay, oatmeal, and all the tools needed to make your own products, just remember you're not saving much money. When you can pick up laundry detergent for a few bucks, and window cleaner for 99 cents, you are literally spending a lot of time for a few cents.

Cutting Coupons When you see these shows about people who clip coupons and get two carts full of groceries for under $10, you might think cutting coupons is an excellent use of your time. This, in most cases, is not actually true. Professional "couponers" go to great lengths to get these deals, and usually fill their garages and basements with hundreds of bottles and cans that they may never use. It's a lengthy investment. For the average shopper, cutting coupons involves sitting at the kitchen table with a pair of scissors and a pile of circulars, spending a good 30-60 minutes looking for deals that apply. It's 25 cents off here, and 30 cents off there. See Also on Kiplinger: 15 Ways to Save on Groceries Without Clipping Coupons Then, when it comes time to shop, many of us simply forget to use them, or they sit at home in a drawer waiting to expire. When you do see deals that are great, they're for products you usually don't buy, so you're actually spending money to save money. If you spend an hour cutting coupons and save $7, congratulations… you're earning less than minimum wage. Advertisement 4. Searching Endlessly for a Slightly Better Deal The internet, deal apps, and plethora other price comparison tools have turned us all into deal hounds. However, we can often get sucked into the trap of refusing to buy something until we get the absolute best deal we possibly can. We go to Amazon, then eBay, then do a bunch of searches looking for promo codes and special offers. In fact, many websites experience something called "cart abandonment" because they have a box for a promo code or discount. When we see that, we start the long, drawn out search for coupons and codes that are often only sent out to former customers in an email blast. Sites like RetailMeNot have certainly helped, but even then, we can waste hours trying code after code, eventually hitting pay dirt with that $2 off coupon. Was it worth it? We may feel like it, but in reality, so many stores price-match and offer competitive values. In the end, we could have just bought the deal we found in the first five minutes. Don't accept the first price you see, but after five minutes, when you notice the lowest prices aren't changing, it's time to throw in the towel. See Also on Kiplinger: 10 Financial Decisions That Will Haunt You Forever 5. Driving Extra Miles to Save a Few Bucks We're all guilty of this. Some people swear by apps that promise to find them the cheapest gas in the state, and then drive miles to save 10 cents a gallon. Other people will drive halfway across town to save 50% on the price of a toy or game, which saves them $5–$10, but costs them gas, mileage, and their time. What's even more bizarre is that often, people look at the percentages involved in deals, not the money. The same person who drives across town to save $10 on a game costing $20 will not bother doing the same on a TV that costs $1,000 versus $990. Keep in mind that $10 is $10, regardless of the original purchase price. But all that aside, really consider how far you're driving, and the money you're spending, to see if it's really worth it.

The commission voted to recommend the annexation to the Cullman City Council. The annexation covers two tracts of land: 81.79 acres zoned for manufacturing (M1P) and 9.79 acres zoned for general business (B2). The land is across from the Wal-Mart Distribution Center. Commission member Andy Page abstained from voting, due to his position on the Cullman City Council. In other business, the commission held two public hearings: A short-form subdivision near Third Street and Austin Avenue Southwest was approved, with the construction of three new homes. A short-form subdivision at Cullman Regional Medical Center was approved, with Chairman Mike Voss noting that a requirement was missing from the request for the third time; he said the commission will resolve the issue of the missing requirement. Regarding a developer’s request for the proposed site plan of Park View Duplexes off McNabb Drive Southwest, a lengthy discussion occurred over whether or not Hudson Drive Southwest technically exists. Voss cited a 1955 plot map that showed the road; however, no record of the road being transferred to the city has been found. The owner of the property has been paying taxes on the road for several years, and the commission was split on if the city did in fact own the road. The commission approved the developer’s request for the proposed site plan for Park View Duplexes, subject to verification that the city doesn’t own Hudson Drive Southwest. If it can be proven that the city does own the road, an abandonment process will need to take place with the City Council. If that occurs, the duplex project but would be delayed. The council discussed a proposed revised site plan for retail development at 300 Second St. SE in an effort to increase parking space; however, the developer, John Leonard, withdrew the proposal since the commission had already approved a previous site plan that included landscaping as required by a city ordinance.   Copyright 2017 Humble Roots, LLC.

Wait. That might make me unpopular in church. Still, that might be worth it. News stories sent in by readers indicate that Destiny has run out of believable plot lines and fallen back on extreme stereotypes. I can predict the end of every tale readers send me. Example: After a child custody deal recently, a little boy was set to be handed from one grandma to another. In most places, that would be straightforward—but this took place in America, in the state of Texas no less. You can guess what’s coming. Both grandmothers carried loaded weapons as they entered the chosen transfer site, a Walmart parking lot. Both shooting. Police got involved, the area was sealed off, blood was spilled, violent grannies had to be subdued, hundreds of people were inconvenienced and a global nuclear war started. Well, maybe the last thing didn’t happen but everything else did. "America can no longer be parodied, as it is already a ridiculous version of itself," said Marie Kan, who sent me the link. True, Marie. The same is true of China. That country’s reputation for bureaucratic obtuseness reached a new pinnacle. A reader from that country, in which fingerprints are often used instead of signatures, sent me a tale about a man with no arms who tried to get a bank loan. You can guess the rest. "We’ll need your fingerprints," said bank officials. "I have no arms," said Wu Jianping, 25, of Henan province. "Refusing to co-operate, huh? The deal’s off," said bankers.The same thing happened at every bank he tried. I wonder what the bankers would say if you put a decapitated corpse in front of them? "So, you refuse to talk, or even stay upright in the seat? The deal’s off, Mr. Headless Corpse." Even in placid, drama-free places like Canada, irrationality is the new norm. Officials in Torontorecently decided to discuss the importance of making facilities accessible for wheelchairs—and you guessed it, they chose a venue only reachable by stairs. Perhaps, the saddest recent tale in this regard was that of Shoga Takeda, a Japanese man of 24 who wanted to get his life together. He applied for a job. Halfway through the interview, the boss left the room for a moment, and Shogo stole his wallet. And following the dumb criminal stereotype, he left behind his application form, complete with his name, address and numerous ways to contact him. My colleague has a theory that Destiny has upped the weirdness quotient of real life so as to combat all that fake news circulating these days. "That couldn’t happen in real life," we will say to each other as we scan the clickbait headlines. "It’s not weird enough." Meanwhile, if any female reader will draw one eyebrow higher than the other on her face and kindly report back to me on the general effect, I will be grateful. But just don’t try to get a bank loan in China. "So, you’re skeptical about everything, applicant? The deal’s off." *** Send ideas and comments via the author’s Facebook page.    Hits: 277     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Jan 15 2017 | 09:13 pm ...   Featured News A Conjecture and Refutation 2017-01-15 Read More   Don’t rush to judgment,... 2017-01-15 Read More   What is the best time to study? 2017-01-15 Read More   Another land grab in Hambantota... 2017-01-15 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Monday, 16th January 2017 [Current Issue] Sunday, 15th January 2017 Saturday, 14th January 2017 Friday, 13th January 2017 Thursday, 12th January 2017 Wednesday, 11th January 2017 Tuesday, 10th January 2017 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.

We may cavil that in the Fifties, African Americans still suffered under Jim Crow laws and women endured their own distinctive discrimination, but for the white male working class—whose heirs, today, are the core of Trump’s support—things had never been better. They were still the guys who’d won World War II, and their newfound material prosperity was the social miracle of the age, and testament to the rightness of the American way.            But if Trump’s appeal to his base is his promise to restore these onetime protagonists of the American epic to their rightful place, he’ll need a radically different set of economic policies than those he now champions. Bringing back the factories won’t in itself recreate the lost economic Eden of the Eisenhower era. A factory can sustain a community by generating middle-income jobs—or it can submerge that community by paying no more than Walmart wages. Increasingly, American factories do the latter. Trump may hail the promise of a manufacturing renaissance, but as a report last year from the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education, citing a previous study from the National Employment Law Project, made clear, “the typical manufacturing production worker made 7.7 percent below the median wage for all occupations.” In 2014, the median hourly wage for assembly line workers employed directly by the manufacturer was $15.04, but for the growing number employed by staffing agencies (which the Berkeley Center put at a rapidly rising 9 percent of factory workers, and who constitute the majority of the workers at Nissan’s auto factories in Mississippi and Tennessee), the median wage was $10.88. Indeed, fully 59 percent of the families of factory workers in Mississippi, the Berkeley study documented, were on some form of public assistance (Medicaid, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the like), while the national average for such factory worker families was 34 percent. Today, the only factory workers who can claim some kind of economic kinship with those of the era which Trump vows to resurrect are the ones in unionized factories, where hourly wages can reach as high as $30. But there are fewer and fewer such workers. In 2000, according to a Pew Research Center report, 19 percent of manufacturing workers belonged to a union. By 2014, that figure had fallen to 13 percent, even as the number of all manufacturing workers also declined from 11 million to eight million. That’s a far cry from the 1950s, when close to 60 percent of manufacturing workers enjoyed the pay and benefits of a union contract, which is the main reason why median household income in those years rose at the same rate as productivity. The steeply progressive taxation of the years during and following World War II (which saw the highest marginal rate top 90 percent) also yielded working-class gains the likes of which we’ve not seen since. As John Kenneth Galbraith documented in his 1958 classic The Affluent Society, the lowest-income quintile of American families saw their after-tax incomes rise by 42 percent during the 1940s, the second lowest by 37 percent, the third lowest (that is, the middle) by 24 percent, the fourth lowest by 16 percent, and the fifth lowest (that is, the richest) by 8 percent. The wealthiest 5 percent actually saw their incomes drop by 2 percent. In short, absent unions and New Deal progressive taxation, the economy of the 1950s that Trump sees as the era of American greatness would never have existed. And how will Trump’s policies recreate that broadly-shared prosperity? They won’t. The tax plans his campaign put out were every bit as regressive as those of the ‘40s and ‘50s were progressive, slashing taxes chiefly on Trump’s economic peers. The anti-union designs of congressional Republicans and such Trump appointees as Labor Secretary-designate Andy Puzder will likely push the rate of private-sector unionization below 5 percent, all but extinguishing the last vestiges of collective bargaining. A factory may open here or there, but odds are it will pay its workers—or rather, the temps who labor there full time—what they could make at Walmart or one of Puzder’s fast-food franchises. Bringing back the widely-shared prosperity of the time when America was Trumpianally Great requires a great deal more than bringing back a factory or two or 200 or 2000—even if those factories aren’t as automated as nearly every factory is these days. It requires giving workers the right to demand their fair share of the revenues they produce. It requires a tax code that rewards work rather than speculation. American won’t be “great again” until ordinary Americans regain the power that Trump and the Republicans are determined to keep far from their grasp.

As the crazy Christmas shopping season ended, Macy's and Sears announced broad cuts, including two Sears stores in Northeast Ohio. (No Macy's, but the stores in Elyria's Midway Mall and Akron's Chapel Hill closed last January, and there are only three left in Cuyahoga County.)  Previous coverage: Chapel Hill Mall loses Macy's: See the vacancies (photos) Dillard's, Kohl's, Target, Wal-Mart and J.C.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Rex Tillerson, former chief executive of ExxonMobil and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, meets with Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) on Wednesday. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) By Anne Gearan January 5 Follow @agearan Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to become secretary of state, disclosed personal wealth of as much as $400 million, including a Texas cattle and horse ranch, ahead of Senate confirmation hearings expected next week. Tillerson, who met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others this week, promised to sell and restructure assets and resign from outside organizations that might pose a conflict. The newly retired ExxonMobil chief executive’s federal financial disclosure filing shows that he directly holds stock in his former employer worth more than $50 million that he has pledged to sell within 90 days if he is confirmed as the country’s top diplomat. Tillerson has separately reached a $180 million retirement agreement with ExxonMobil involving additional stock that would be placed in trust. He also pledged to recuse himself from any government decisions involving ExxonMobil for one year unless he is specifically authorized to participate. The State Department sometimes helps energy companies as they seek resources, markets and contacts around the world, and it advises many large corporations. During the decade that Tillerson led Exxon, the State Department supported some of the oil giant’s deals and opposed others, most notably a 2011 agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq. That deal, which took U.S. officials by surprise, directly contradicted the U.S. goal of a federal oil deal that would benefit Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites. The listing of Tillerson’s stock and bond holdings shows that he invested in competing energy companies including Total and Royal Dutch Shell while running Exxon. His portfolio includes American and international businesses ranging from Walmart and Walt Disney to Novartis, Sony and Yum China Holdings, which franchises KFC and other fast-food chains in China. Federal disclosure requirements call for the value of individual holdings or proceeds to be given as a range, so it is not possible to pinpoint Tillerson’s net worth. Tillerson said he has already resigned from the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, and would resign from the Boy Scouts of America, the board of Ford’s Theater and other organizations. He pledged to remove himself from business decisions surrounding the ranch in Bartonville, Tex., although he would continue to receive passive income from it. “I am committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct for government officials,” Tillerson wrote in an accompanying letter to a State Department ethics lawyer. “If confirmed as secretary of state, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter,” Tillerson wrote. The financial disclosure material was sent to the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday. Senate Democrats say they still want to see Tillerson’s tax returns before holding what Republicans have said could be a two-day hearing Jan. 11-12. Like Trump, Tillerson has refused to provide Congress with his tax returns, promising only “tax return information” upon request, and he has complex business interests from which he must disentangle himself to hold public office. Tillerson’s energy-related work in Russia and his ties to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin are expected to dominate his confirmation session. Tillerson’s Capitol Hill tour does not appear to be winning new supporters, but it is convincing certain senators that when it comes to sanctions, he may not be as pro-Russia as he seems. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin (Md.), said after meeting with Tillerson for over an hour on Wednesday that the businessman was “pretty forthcoming” on sanctions and “understands the importance of sanctions and recognizes that you need to have the ability to get results.” He was referring to U.S. sanctions implemented against Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Cardin, the Senate’s chief architect of comprehensive new Russia sanctions, has not indicated his support for Tillerson’s nomination. Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), with whom Tillerson also met Wednesday, told NPR that he had a productive 90-minute meeting that included tough questions on Russia. Coons said he has not decided how to vote. Tillerson’s close personal and business ties to Russia sparked an early backlash from senators, including a handful of key Republicans, who found alarming his acceptance of the Kremlin’s Order of Friendship award in 2013 and his recorded opposition to Ukraine-related Russia sanctions in 2014. One of those Republicans, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), met with Tillerson on Wednesday, but he did not appear more favorably disposed to the businessman. When asked whether he would support Tillerson’s nomination, McCain told a gathering of reporters “sure — there’s also a realistic scenario that pigs fly.” Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report. world national-security Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Photographer: ILSE HUESCA/AFP/Getty Images Looters sacked at least 250 stores across seven Mexican states, reflecting growing unrest over a 20 percent hike in gasoline prices. Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB, Grupo Elektra and Organizacion Soriana SAB stores were among those targeted this week in a wave of anger about the “gasolinazo,” or fuel-price slam. Looting, preemptive store closings and trucks robberies have been widely reported in local press and social media since Tuesday night. Even before the unrest, retailers were expected to take the biggest hit by the hike. The increase is likely to erode purchasing power and consumer sentiment that’s already suffering as a weaker peso fuels concern about inflation. The government is letting gas prices surge as part of a plan to gradually cede control of the fuel market to private development following a landmark energy overhaul in 2013.

The association is meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo to discuss the matter, Manuel Cardona, the group’s head of government relations, said in an interview with Radio Red on Thursday. The economic fallout hasn’t been estimated, he said. Walmex, Soriana, Elektra and Chedraui didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Walmex, controlled by U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell as much as 2.1 percent in Mexico City trading. Planigrupo Latam SAB, a real estate investment company, said in a filing that two malls in which it has a controlling stake were looted and vandalized Wednesday and Thursday in Mexico state. The company is working with local and federal authorities to protect the locations and the people who work there, the company said. In a conference Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto said he understood public outrage over the gas-price hike, but that it was a necessary move to reflect higher global prices.

Mr Kroenke, 69, who has a net personal wealth of $7.4bn (£6bn), according to Forbes, has bought a majority share in Bonneau du Martray, whose vintages are a favoured tipple of the Queen; she reportedly served them at her private 80th birthday party in 2006. US billionaire Stan Kroenke and Arsenal owner buys ancient Burgundy vineyard in move that rocks the close-knit local wine world Credit: SCOTT ROVAK/EPA It is one of only only two estates in Burgundy that produces nothing but grands crus. The other is Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, which produces the world's most expensive wine. While the estate was unavailable for comment, insiders said the sale came as a "total surprise" to the local wine community - the regional wine board had not even been informed of the decision - and that it likely went for well over €100 million (£85.3m). Dubbed "Silent Stan" by Arsenal fans, Mr Kroenke owns American football team the Los Angeles Rams, basketball's Denver Nuggets, as well ice hockey side the Colorado Avalanche. Mr Kroenke, who is married to Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton, who is worth £3.7bn in her own right, already has serious wine credentials in California, owning Napa Valley's prestigious Screaming Eagle estate. Ripe Chardonnay grapes in vineyard of Domaine Bonneau du Martray on the hill of Corton with village of Pernand-Vergelesses in background. Côte d'Or, France. Credit: CEPHAS - Ian Shaw Screaming Eagle's manager Armand de Maigret told Les Echos newspaper that Mr Kroenke's first purchase of a foreign vineyard was the "product of love at first sight". Most of the grand cru wines produced on Bonneau du Martray's 11-hectare (27-acre) site are destined for export, served in expensive restaurants around the world. It produces only two: a red Corton and, in greater quantities, the famed Corton-Charlemagne white. Since 2013, all the wine is biodynamic. Burgundy wine makers are notoriously protective of their small plots of coveted vineyards. Feathers were ruffled in 2012 when Chinese gambling tycoon Louis Ng Chi Sing outbid local vintners to pay €8 million for Chateau de Gevrey-Chambertin - a 12th century listed building and two-hectare vineyard. "But here it was a shock to everyone. The domain wasn't for sale, so they must have tried their luck. It suggests that anything is for sale at the right price," said wine merchant Gael Chauvin. "We're talking about dozens of millions or even hundreds of millions of euros. When you see that two years ago, the Clos des Lambrays an 8-hectare domain of grands crus, was sold to Bernard Arnaud, France's richest man, for €101 million, you can get an idea," he said. Default Caption: APX1XF Domaine Bonneau du Martray vineyard on the hill at Corton between Pernand Vergelesses and Aloxe Corton, Burgundy, France Credit: Malcolm Park wine and vineyards / Alamy Stock Photo One neighbouring winemaker who asked not to be named said: "In Burgundy there is virtually nothing for sale ever. A domain like this with 11 hectares of grands crus is unbelievably rare. It wouldn't surprise me if someone with billions to spare forked out well over the market value." Laurent Gotti, a Burgundy wine taster and writer, said: "For a foreigner to buy an estate of this size and prestige is unprecedented."  He said it drove home the reality that "it has become impossible for heirs to take over family estates due to rocketing prices and inheritance tax. Only the superrich can afford them now." One vintner said: "Vineyards have become a refuge investment for wealthy wine fans, but in Burgundy while the land prices have rocketed, wine prices haven't followed suit. "Fifteen years ago if you bought vines in a known village appellation it took 10 years to make a profit, now it takes 50. That coupled with inheritance tax of up to 40 per cent places domains beyond wine families' reach." In control of Arsenal since 2011, Mr Kroenke has come under fire from some Gunners fans for his staunch support for manager Arsene Wenger, who has failed to win the club the Premier League since 2004. They have also taken umbrage at his reluctance to fork out big sums for top players and bring down ticket prices. Arsenal Director Stan Kroenke (2nd L) in the stands at a Watford v Arsenal Barclays Premier League game at Vicarage Road. Credit:  Alan Walter/SOCCER-ENGLAND-WAT-ARS/ Mr Kroenke in the process of moving his Rams franchise from St Louis to Los Angeles, where they last played in 1994 before defecting to Missouri. At an estimated $3billion (£2.28bn) the new Rams stadium he is building in Inglewood, Los Angeles County, will be the most expensive in the world. Bonneau du Martray has only had three owners in more the 1,200 years. It was first the personal property of Emperor Charlemagne and then the Church, but was confiscated during the French Revolution and then sold to the Véry family. In 1835 Marie-Eugénie Véry married Charles Bonneau du Martray, whose descendant Jean-Charles le Bault de la Morinière has just ended the two-century family ownership. Mr Kroenke reportedly wants to remain faithful to the work of Mr Le Bault de la Morinière, who is expected to remain in his post for at least a few months.  Follow Telegraph News READ MORE ABOUT: Wine France Family Arsenal FC Los Angeles Premier League Show more News latest 16 Jan 2017, 2:22am Beijing will 'take off the gloves' if Donald Trump continues on Taiwan 16 Jan 2017, 12:41am New Brazilian prison riots leave 26 dead 16 Jan 2017, 12:38am Health tourism warning as NHS chases £350,000 bill from Nigerian woman who gave birth in a British hospital 16 Jan 2017, 12:34am Israel says Nazi camp excavations unearth link to Anne Frank 16 Jan 2017, 12:01am RSPCA officers recount bizarre rescue calls after woman mistakes smoke alarm for trapped bird 16 Jan 2017, 12:01am Nuisance calls can now be blocked at the touch of a button for the first time 16 Jan 2017, 12:01am Philip Hammond under pressure to increase marriage tax allowance  16 Jan 2017, 12:01am Eight people have same wealth as half the world, Oxfam reveals ahead of Davos 16 Jan 2017, 12:01am Tampon sales fall as working women choose contraceptives to stop their monthly cycles 16 Jan 2017, 12:01am Motorists warned of unprecedented rise in potholes  15 Jan 2017, 11:41pm Tibet protesters detained in Swiss capital during Xi Jinping visit 16 Jan 2017, 2:25am When is Donald Trump's inauguration as US president – and what happens on the day? 15 Jan 2017, 11:29pm Donald Trump says Britain was right to vote Brexit and he will offer a 'quick' and 'fair' trade deal 15 Jan 2017, 10:46pm Bahraini authorities execute three Shia Muslim men convicted of killing an Emirati police  15 Jan 2017, 10:30pm Sherlock episode 3: The Final Problem, review: 'an exhilarating thrill-ride' 5 15 Jan 2017, 10:00pm Navy facing heaviest Russian activity since Cold War says First Sea Lord 15 Jan 2017, 10:00pm Endeavour is well crafted but lacks John Thaw's sharp characterisation - review 3 15 Jan 2017, 10:00pm BBC investigating whether Sherlock series finale leaked from offices of Russian state broadcaster 15 Jan 2017, 10:00pm Buy La La Land tickets in advance, cinemas warn, as musical sells out 15 Jan 2017, 9:55pm Labour's best hope for the next election is to be propped up by the SNP, Len McCluskey says 15 Jan 2017, 9:42pm Ukip is the main challenger in the Stoke-on-Trent by-election, former Tory minister says  If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 Your support makes a big difference In order to bring you award-winning content and investigative journalism from your favourite writers, we rely on revenue generated by advertising.

USA TODAY Sears Holding announced it will close 108 Kmart and 42 Sears stores. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) Sears is  closing  150 stores and selling its vaunted Craftsman tool brand, but those steps may not be enough to stop the unraveling of the American icon. With Sears' announcement Thursday coming only a day after rival Macy's saying it would close 68 locations, the department store concept itself is looking like an endangered species. In a retail landscape now dominated by online sellers like Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, Sears finds itself in a search for a reason to exist. "The brand has lost relevance,  it’s lost customers and it’s lost its real reason for existence on the American retail scene,'' says Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a retail consulting firm. Following "the trajectory they're on, there are no real signs of them turning it around to profitability.'' USA TODAY Is your local Sears or Kmart among 150 stores to be axed? See the list Sears has more than 1,300 stores remaining in its portfolio, so its demise could be prolonged. But if the retailer is unable to stem its financial bleeding and is forced into bankruptcy or perhaps a final assets sale, its loss would be akin to that of dominating American companies like airline Pan Am or five-and dime F.W. Woolworth. "I honestly don’t see a spot for Sears long-term," says Van Conway, CEO of Van Conway & Partners, who has advised retail companies and other businesses on reorganization and insolvency. "My mom shopped at Sears. That was the only place she could go. Now you have 50 choices, and Sears is outdated.’’ Founded in 1886, Sears launched its first large, general catalog a decade later and for generations was the go-to source for products ranging from watches to washing machines. Though it lost its place as the nation's biggest retailer to Walmart in the 1990s, Sears enjoyed a renaissance during that decade under the helm of then-CEO Arthur Martinez, who pushed a greater focus on apparel sales and other initiatives. The company faltered in the 2000s, selling its more than $30 billion credit portfolio to Citibank in  2003 and merging the Sears brand with Kmart, another struggling big box chain. USA TODAY Macy's is closing these 68 stores: Is yours on the list? CEO Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who shepherded the Sears tie-up with Kmart, initiated his own turnaround strategy, loaning the company cash, spinning off parts of the business and putting Sears' Kenmore, Diehard and Craftsman brands up for sale. Sears' travails are part of a broader struggle that has engulfed many traditional retailers trying to compete in an environment in which consumers can buy virtually any item by browsing online and without setting foot in a store. USA TODAY Expect more store closings despite big holiday sales "One thing people used to use department stores for was wide choice and selection,'' Saunders says. "There's no wider choice than on the Internet, so a lot of the reasons for going to those department stores just doesn't exist the way it once did.'' In addition to Sears, many retailers, including Kohl's and JCPenney, have failed to innovate in ways that will continue to woo shoppers. “We're seeing now in retail a lot of legacy players that are dead, dying or in danger of dying because of their inability to do that,'' says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School,  who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. The flurry of steps taken in recent days by Sears is a stark illustration of the moves it is making to try to survive. In addition to the store closures, Sears announced Wednesday that it had obtained a $500 million loan commitment backed by mortgages on 46 properties belonging to its subsidiaries. That adds to its long-term debt, which had ballooned from $2.2 billion at the end of January 2016 to $3.7 billion at the end of October. "From what I can see, these are very intelligent financial maneuvers to raise money,’’ says Conway. “But the whole issue is, is the core business of the retailer viable?" 12288 CONNECTTWEET 115 LINKEDIN 44 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j8ftvY NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Orange County Public Works said the new road, cutting through nearly a half-mile of hilly terrain, “will significantly reduce commute times for residents.” San Clemente residents near the new link will gain a shorter way to reach Ortega Highway and points beyond or reach Target, Walmart, Lowe’s, Vista Hermosa Sports Park, Rancho San Clemente or Talega Business Parks, the San Clemente/Dana Point Animal Shelter and other in-town destinations. Coming the other way, Del Rio will provide new way for Talega residents or people from out of town to reach Krikorian Theaters, Sprouts and I-5. The city plans to ease traffic flow on the preexisting stretch of Del Rio by reconfiguring the street and building roundabouts at Camino de los Mares and Sarmentoso this spring. Work should begin this month, with completion expected in mid-May. Two new restaurants open at Outlets at San Clemente The Outlets at San Clemente greeted the new year offering two new dining opportunities – Ruby’s Diner and Slapfish seafood restaurant. Both are in the same section of the outlet mall at 101 W. Avenida Vista Hermosa. Ruby’s offers indoor and outdoor dining facing the parking lot and the ocean.

Timothy Blake, 28, from Mineral Wells, West Virginia, was arrested on two counts of pandering obscenity, menacing by stalking and sexual imposition, according to a press release by the Washington County Sheriff’s office in Marietta, Ohio. A woman claimed that a “creepy” man followed her around a Walmart and then informed authorities that she felt something wet on her lower back, an arrest affidavit obtained by CBS News stated. “The first report came in two months ago [Nov. 2] from a woman who had found this on her bottom and after cleaning it off in the bathroom had walked out to find him waiting and staring at her,” Sheriff Larry Mincks said. “She said he then took off and she followed him until he got in his truck and left,” he added. Another report on Dec. 28 followed a similar storyline and authorities were able to track Blake down through security footage, where he was subsequently arrested. Related Stories Cosby's Pretrial Began As A Debacle Why You Should Stop Removing Your Pubes “The insignia on the side of the truck was a very distinct insignia for Yellowjacket Oilfield Services which he works for in the area,” he said. “Then there was another incident this week with a separate woman which added to his description.” Mincks said that detectives approached Blake and his wife as they were traveling to dinner prior to his arrest. His wife was unaware of Blake’s episodes at the shopping centers, the affidavit said. “The defendant stated maybe [squirting women with semen-filled syringes were] his way of having sex with these women,” the affidavit also wrote. Blake is facing two felony and two misdemeanor charges while being held in Washington County Jail without bond until his arraignment.

Ronald A. Beard Jr., 19, of Carneys Point and Ameir S. Ross, 18, of Penns Grove, were charged in the case, according to Pennsville Chief of Police Allen J. Cummings. On Dec. 16 around 9:44 p.m. police were called to Walmart on South Broadway for a shoplifting complaint. They were told a suspect had fled the store with merchandise and drove off in a black Honda Accord. According to Cummings, police stopped a vehicle matching that description on North Hook Road. Inside were $181 in items allegedly stolen from Walmart. Also, drugs were reported to have been found in the car, the chief said. Ross was charged with shoplifting and possession of marijuana and failure to make lawful disposition of a controlled dangerous substance, police said. Beard was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (fentanyl patches, Promethazine and Xanax), Cummings said. Ross and Beard were both released after being charged pending a court appearance. Bill Gallo Jr. may be reached at bgallo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow Bill Gallo Jr. on Twitter @bgallojr.

Two officers on patrol spotted Michael Christopher Clark, 30, of Rochester, walking into Walmart Supercenter, 25 25th St. SE, about 12:30 a.m. They followed him inside; Clark saw the officers near the front of the store, said Capt. John Sherwin, and the chase was on. Clark allegedly ran through the women's clothing department, across the store to the frozen foods section, then back to the women's clothing area, where he was arrested without incident. A search of his clothing recovered about 8 grams of meth, the report says. He appeared in Olmsted County District Court Wednesday afternoon, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail for the felony probation violation. Clark could face new charges of fifth-degree drug possession and fleeing a peace officer on foot.

In November 2015, the police identified three Romanians as suspects who placed a skimmer device in a bank ATM gaining hundreds of First Financial Bank customer’s financial information and stealing thousands from the bank. They are also believed to be the people behind several home repair scams where they go door-to-door work to the homeowner, asking for money up-front and never following through with any work. In the statement, the Police warn Abilene citizens that these individuals mainly target the elderly, as well as Wal-Mart stores and its customers, and they even use children to help garner trust from their targets in hopes of scamming more money from individuals. The Police say that these suspects have hit many other Texas cities. They are believed to live in larger cities and branch out into smaller cities like Abilene where they perform their scams in travelling groups. “This organized crime ring has worked in 20 states including Texas,” the statement reads. Romanian nationals have been involved in several scam operations in the U.S. For example, Alin Carabus admitted last November to being part of a large ATM theft scheme in the U.S., and pleaded guilty to bank fraud before a U.S. judge. He was part of a crime ring that managed to steal more than USD 5 million from thousands of American bank customers by using card-reading devices installed in ATMs. A total of 15 people were convicted in this case. In September, Romanian hacker Mircea-Ilie Ispasoiu, 31, received a three-year prison sentence in the U.S. for orchestrating an identity theft scheme that stole data from American firms. The most famous Romanian hacker, known as Guccifer, was sentenced to 52 months in prison by a U.S. court last September. He was accused of breaking into computer accounts of the Bush family, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and others.

Timothy Blake faces charges of pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and stalking. According to CBS News, officials said a woman noticed a "creepy" man was lingering around her, before she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. Surveillance video showed the man squirting her. A second victim also came forward, with surveillance video showing the incident. Police located 26-year-old Blake, who allegedly told police it was semen he had used. An affidavit obtained by CBS News states he is married, though his wife was unaware of the accusations. close News In Pictures Puppies from Canton rescue of 140 dogs ready for adoption event in Waynesville 1 person killed in Rosman Highway wreck Residents wake up to house fire in Canton Second round of snow expected Friday evening Trending 1   Elementary school investigating after student says classmates fondle each other 2   Virginia man delivers 300,000 pennies to DMV, spends over $1,000 to do it 3   Fla. man jailed for having sex with his dog; roommate says abuse went on for years 4   1 person killed in Rosman Highway wreck 5   Residents wake up to house fire in Canton DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Elementary school investigating after student says classmates fondle each other 2 Virginia man delivers 300,000 pennies to DMV, spends over $1,000 to do it 3 Fla. man jailed for having sex with his dog; roommate says abuse went on for years 4 1 person killed in Rosman Highway wreck 5 Residents wake up to house fire in Canton 6 Police: Man drags woman into the woods, says the devil told him to rape her 7 Fire at Pisgah View Apartments displaces 6 families 8 Top local stories we are following today 9 West Henderson High teacher voluntarily resigns 10 Dave Chappelle to perform in Asheville
Menu Home Local News Business Health Community Schools Sports Voices Bill Rauch Lee Scott What 2 Do Calendar Contact Full Issues Go Bringing Our Community Together City: 2016 was year of progress for Beaufort Published on January 5, 2017 in Local News by The Island News Editor’s note: The following was provided by the city of Beaufort. From opening a new fire station to kicking off construction on Boundary Street to opening the long-awaited Southside dog park to launching an incubator for technology companies, progress was the key word for Beaufort in 2016. “After months and sometimes years of planning and review, it was refreshing to be able to open the new fire house on Ribaut Road to improve our fire department’s efficiency. On the other end, in December it was great to see all the families and pets enjoying the dog park,” Beaufort City Manager Bill Prokop said. “We have another year of work on Boundary Street, but that team has done an exceptional job of keeping the project on track and within budget,” he said. “While that work goes on, our city’s economy has a brighter future with our new incubator partnerships.” The economy Much of the city’s work in 2016 – and before – focused on economic revitalization and growth. The Beaufort Digital Corridor is an offshoot of the successful Charleston Digital Corridor. Located at 500 Carteret St., the remodeled office space targets small businesses focused on technology. Another spinoff is the city’s branch of the Don Ryan Center of Innovation, based in Bluffton. The incubator will be housed in the first floor of Beaufort City Hall and will assist non-technology businesses in starting up. Both business incubators have ribbon-cuttings scheduled for January and Prokop said he expects both will be busy in short order. “Between our preserved history and our protected environment, we have the ability to attract small and new businesses, especially those in the knowledge sector,” he said. “Sometimes all they need is a guiding hand to get started, and that’s what the Beaufort Digital Corridor and Don Ryan Center will provide.” The anticipated opening of the new Walmart within the city limits on Lady’s Island and a new car dealership on Robert Smalls Parkway will bring additional jobs and revenues to the city. Highlights of 2016 include: • Construction started in early 2016 on the $32 million Boundary Street Improvement Corridor. The work includes moving overhead power and communications cables underground for safety and aesthetics, realigning the Boundary and Robert Smalls Parkway intersection and improving traffic signal intersections, including a new signal at Carolina Cove. • The Southside dog park, previously used as a water treatment site by the Beaufort-Jasper Water & Sewer Authority, had been discussed for years by the community and the Beaufort City Council. In 2016, it became reality. “We had a lot of volunteer help in cleaning up the property, and our Public Works crew did wonderful work removing all the debris and tearing up old asphalt,” said Libby Anderson, planning director for Beaufort. “Open park space is an important part of Beaufort.” • Other highlights for city leaders in 2016 included expanding the popular Spanish Moss Trail; reviewing, once again, parking needs and possible solutions, including a potential parking garage; and adjusting the city business license ordinance to allow a more streamlined process for group events, and taking payments online for business licenses and the accommodations/hospitality taxes. • Beaufort voters returned incumbent Mike McFee to the Beaufort City Council alongside newcomer and downtown businesswoman Nan Sutton. They join Mayor Billy Keyserling, Phil Cromer and Stephen Murray on council. • In December, city leaders joined Rep. Jim Clyburn and National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis at historic Brick Baptist Church across from the Penn Center for a standing-room only public hearing of major support for a proposed Reconstruction Monument district to recognize local contributions to Reconstruction. • On the tragic side, fire destroyed the Black Chamber of Commerce office building just days after the November election. The structure was nearing completion on Bladen Street. Federal investigators determined the fire was an electrical accident. • In October, Hurricane Matthew changed the Lowcountry landscape, downing thousands of trees. Homes in Beaufort were damaged and the debris clean-up will continue into 2017, but thankfully no deaths or major injuries were reported from the Category 2 hurricane.

This is all going to make sense in a second. by Mike Olson@visiblemike Jan 5, 2017, 2:16am PST tweet share pin Rec Michael Malone is looking for some answers Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports Silly students sometimes still slip straddling sartorial sensibilities. That poor little bastard. Those of us born without a lick of fashion sense spent the better part of our early years in things like patchwork bell bottoms. Fortunately, some higher power begat Garanimals in 1972. The pic above shows my first Garanimals shirt from 1973. The upshot of the clothes was that the bottoms matched the tops, a real boon for those of us amongst the visually challenged. No more mismatching parts for yours truly. The only trouble with the early versions was that the icons to match the component pieces were prominently displayed on the outside, and when seen, gave way to unmerciful teasing. It was still totally worth it. Now my clothes were only embarrassing because some marketing shlub didn't think about where to station my orange hippo. Everything old is new again, and smart investors realized that having your sh—together as a kid is of huge value, emotionally to kids and financially to parents. The brand re-launched in 2008, and are still selling strong at outlets like Wal Mart. Seems the Denver Nuggets could use a little more of their bottoms matching their tops, as an observant Stiffs poster added this morning, noting that the Nuggets had a top-five offense to go with their bottom-five defense. The bottom(s) seem to be the sticking point, as the post was linked to ESPN's coverage of coach Michael Malone's very candid assessment of his team's defensive performance. To the poster whose post I lost, apologies for the lack of attribution here. Denver's offensive successes are the byproduct of timing, health, and stumbling into the good fortune of Nikola Jokic's laser-sharp passing. To hope for such a fortuitous combination to occur on the defensive side of the ball seems naïve, at best. As the offense blossomed, the defense continued to slide, and the Nuggets are now the fourth-lowest-ranked defensive unit in the league, a drop of several notches from their status early in the season. Part of that drop may be attributable to a shift in personnel, but the difference in communication and effort cannot be ignored. That it was raised as a topic of discussion by coaches, players, and eventually media is a telling moment in how this team is progressing, and the next several games will tell if Denver puts forth enough defensive effort to keep themselves in the low-tier playoff hunt, or if they'll find themselves back in the low-tier lottery once again. Ryan Blackburn had a very solid piece earlier in the week as to why that distinction is important. But that effort probably only returns you to a defensive squad still ranked in the low teens and high twenties without more defensive talent, skill, and physical build than the current roster currently possesses. That, and several other incongruities, are a big part of the compelling fork-in-the-road conversation Gordon Gross started yesterday. The Nuggets find themselves at a crossroads a bit earlier than they'd hoped to. To that end, shoring up the defense, how big a factor is effort and understanding versus physical gifts, Nuggets Nation? Many professional pundits feel that brains and training only get you so far without a defender's physique. If every Denver Nuggets player gave his best defensive effort in concert, what's the highest defensive ranking the Nuggets could hope to achieve with the current roster? If that ranking is not above 15, the middle of the pack, how does a defensive-minded coach build a system with players who are not wired or built to defend? It seems like getting our bottoms to match our tops may be a little more difficult than picking something off the rack in this case. Poll Playing at their cohesive best, the best the current Denver Nuggets roster could hope to rank as a defensive squad is: (currently 27th) 1-5 6-10 11-15 16-20 21-25 26-30 vote view results 1% 1-5 (3 votes) 2% 6-10 (8 votes) 19% 11-15 (56 votes) 44% 16-20 (129 votes) 24% 21-25 (70 votes) 8% 26-30 (25 votes) 291 votes total Vote Now More From Denver Stiffs Recap: Denver gives Atlanta a nice Christmas gift, falling to the Hawks 109-108 Denver Nuggets Tweet of the Week: Wilson Chandler responds to George Karl’s tell-all Kenyon Martin responds to George Karl’s comments with a Player’s Tribune article What makes Nikola Jokic so effective?

USD is Down at 102.305. Energies: February Crude is Down at 53.14. Financials: The Mar 30 year bond is Up 8 ticks and trading at 150.30. Indices: The March S&P 500 emini ES contract is 8 ticks Lower and trading at 2262.25. Gold: The February gold contract is trading Up at 1174.00. Gold is 87 ticks Higher than its close. Initial Conclusion This is not a correlated market. The dollar is Down- and crude is Down- which is not normal but the 30 year bond is trading Up+. The Financials should always correlate with the US dollar such that if the dollar is lower then bonds should follow and vice-versa. The indices are Down- and Crude is trading Down- which is not correlated. Gold is trading Up which is correlated with the US dollar trading Down. I tend to believe that Gold has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar as when the US Dollar is down, Gold tends to rise in value and vice-versa. Think of it as a seesaw, when one is up the other should be down. I point this out to you to make you aware that when we don’t have a correlated market, it means something is wrong. As traders you need to be aware of this and proceed with your eyes wide open. Asia traded mainly higher with the exception of the Nikkei exchange which traded lower. As of this writing Europe is trading mixed with half the exchanges higher and the other half lower. Possible Challenges To Traders Today – Challenger Job Cuts is out at 7:30 AM EST. This is major. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change is out at 8:15 AM. This is major. – Unemployment Claims are out at 8:30 AM EST. This is major. – Final Services PMI is out at 9:45 AM EST. This is not major. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI is out at 10 AM EST. This is major. – Natural Gas Storage is out at 10:30 AM EST. This is major. – Crude Oil Inventories are out at 11 AM EST. This is major. Treasuries We’ve elected to switch gears a bit and show correlation between the 30 year bond (ZB) and The YM futures contract. The YM contract is the DJIA and the purpose is to show reverse correlation between the two instruments. Remember it’s liken to a seesaw, when up goes up the other should go down and vice versa. Yesterday the ZB made it’s move at around 9 AM EST with no real economic news in sight. The ZB hit a low at around that time and the YM hit a high. If you look at the charts below ZB gave a signal at around 9 AM EST and the YM was moving lower at the same time. Look at the charts below and you’ll see a pattern for both assets. ZB hit a low at around 9 AM EST and the YM hit a high. These charts represent the newest version of Trend Following Trades and I’ve changed the timeframe to a 30 minute chart to display better. This represented a long opportunity on the 30 year bond, as a trader you could have netted about 30 plus ticks per contract on this trade. Each tick is worth $31.25. We added a Donchian Channel to the charts to show the signals more clearly. Charts Courtesy of Trend Following Trades built on a NinjaTrader platform Click on an image to enlarge it. ZB – March, 2017 – 1/4/17 YM- March, 2017 – 1/4/17 Bias Yesterday we gave the markets an upside bias as both the Bonds and the USD were trading lower yesterday morning and this is indicative of an upside move, hence our bias was to the upside. The Dow rose 60 points and the other indices rose as well. Today we aren’t dealing with a correlated and our bias is to the downside. Could this change? Of Course. Remember anything can happen in a volatile market. Commentary It looks like the Trump Bump is continuing its move forward as this is what the pundits are calling the Trump rally. We suggested yesterday morning that the markets would move higher as the USD and the Bonds were both trading lower and this is indicative of an upside move. The markets didn’t disappoint as the Dow gained 60 points and the other indices rose as well and mind you that was with a hawkish Fed Meeting Minutes which stated that the Fed could raise interest rates sooner if warranted. What would make it warranted? An economy that is growing too fast, too soon and price hikes (inflation). If I were them at this point I wouldn’t be too concerned about the economy growing. We’ve been looking for growth for the past 8 years and thus far have seen a very tepid recovery. Producer Price Hikes (inflation)? I wouldn’t be too worried about that either as currently it’s a race to the bottom in terms of prices. Want proof? Go to any Walmart and compare…. Could this change? Of course, anything is possible in a volatile market. Just so you understand, Market Correlation is Market Direction. It attempts to determine the market direction for that day and it does so by using a unique set of tools. In fact TradersLog published an article on this subject that can be viewed at: http://www.traderslog.com/market-correlation-is-market-direction/As readers are probably aware I don’t trade equities. While we’re on this discussion, let’s define what is meant by a good earnings report. A company must exceed their prior quarter’s earnings per share and must provide excellent forward guidance. Any falloff between earning per share or forward guidance will not bode well for the company’s shares. This is one of the reasons I don’t trade equities but prefer futures. There is no earnings reports with futures and we don’t have to be concerned about lawsuits, scandals, malfeasance, etc. Anytime the market isn’t correlated it’s giving you a clue that something isn’t right and you should proceed with caution. Today our bias is to the downside. Could this change? Of course. In a volatile market anything can happen. We’ll have to monitor and see. As I write this the crude markets are Lower and the futures are trading Lower. This is not normal. Crude and the markets are now reverse correlated such that when the markets are rising, crude drops and vice-versa. Yesterday February Crude dropped to a low of $52.15 a barrel. It would appear at the present time that crude has support at $51.26 a barrel and resistance at $54.32. This could change. We’ll have to monitor and see. Remember that crude is the only commodity that is reflected immediately at the gas pump. Please note that the front month for crude is now February. Three weeks ago and after two years OPEC finally decided to cut production but the price crude is still tame (as of this writing). What they haven’t figured out yet is that the more countries like Canada and the US produce their own crude (by whatever means) the more crude prices will fall. The move by OPEC to cut production in an attempt to pump up prices is liken to “too little, too late” as the world doesn’t need their oil as much as they used to. Power equipment that used to need oil (Grass Trimmers, Lawn Mowers, Autos) now run on battery power and Canada and the United States are producing more of their own crude. As an update to this the non-OPEC countries have come to an agreement to unilaterally cut production across the board and this has served to temporarily raise crude prices. We’ll have to see if and how long this lasts… If trading crude today consider doing so after 11 AM EST when the inventory numbers are released and the markets gives us better direction. Future Challenges I must admit that I’m never amazed at what this new President-Elect will or will not do. Yesterday he appointed Omarosa Manigault as the new White House Press Liaison. If you recognize the name then you saw the 1st season of The Apprentice and it seems that more and more this President is going to run the White House like Corporate America. Omarosa was well hated during her tenure on the show but basically has somehow continued to serve under Trump even after she was fired from the series. As I’ve said previously, if anyone is expecting full disclosure and transparency under this new administration; forget it because we’re not going to see it. This administration will probably be the most secretive of modern times. Everyone that he’s appointed into a job are those that under ordinary circumstances hate those jobs. Carl Icahn as a Regulation chief. Carl Icahn hates regulation. His Secretary of the Treasury was also known as the Foreclosure King who foreclosed on a widowed senior because she was off by 27 cents on her payment. Each and every individual chosen is absolutely ruthless with no concept of mercy whatsoever but I guess that’s what Mr. Trump can relate to. After all he told his own daughter Ivanka “I’ll fire you like a dog if you fail”. TradersLog has just published an article entitled “So You Think You Can Trust Your Elected Officials?” That article can be viewed at: http://www.traderslog.com/trust-elected-officials Crude Oil Is Trading Lower Crude oil is trading Lower and the markets are Lower. This is not normal. Crude typically makes 3 major moves (long or short) during the course of any trading day: around 9 AM EST, 11 AM EST and 2 PM EST when the crude market closes. If crude makes major moves around those time frames, then this would suggest normal trending, if not it would suggest that something is not quite right. As always watch and monitor your order flow as anything can happen in this market. This is why monitoring order flow in today’s market is crucial. We as traders are faced with numerous challenges that we didn’t have a few short years ago. High Frequency Trading is one of them. I’m not an advocate of scalping however in a market as volatile as this scalping is an alternative to trend trading. Remember that without knowledge of order flow we as traders are risking our hard earned capital and the Smart Money will have no issue taking it from us. Regardless of whatever platform you use for trading purposes you need to make sure it’s monitoring order flow. Sceeto does an excellent job at this.

By Tom Danehy click to enlarge Before we jump into what is certain to be a horrible year, let’s take a quick look back at some of the things that happened in 2016. ODDLY ENOUGH, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED TOM AND EACH HAD AT LEAST ONE NIECE OR NEPHEW A slightly higher percentage of African-Americans voted for Donald Trump than had voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. (Thanks to Jeff Sessions, they will soon find out exactly what it is they have to lose.) IT WAS ONLY THE THIRD STRANGEST THING SEEN AT THAT LOCATION THAT DAY A recent headline said that a dismembered body, with the head and genitals cut off, was found behind a WalMart store. YEAH, BUT IN GILEAD, SHE'LL BE KNOWN AS OFDONALD In a couple weeks, we will have a First Lady with her own array of online nude photos. Millions of Bubbas will think that this is an upgrade from the Ivy League educated lawyer/health advocate whom Melania will succeed. IN THEIR YOUNGER DAYS, THEY WERE THE CHILDREN WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND A recent poll showed that majority of people who voted for Donald Trump (including the handful of college graduates who did so) believes that Trump won the popular vote. (He actually lost by nearly three million votes.) IT'S LIKE THAT OLD STEVE MARTIN BOOK, "HOW I TURNED A MILLION IN REAL ESTATE INTO $100 CASH UA quarterback Anu Solomon, who had led the Wildcats to the Pac-12 South championship as a redshirt freshman, suffered through his second consecutive injury-plagued year and announced that he will graduate early and transfer to another school where he can play his senior season. HE COULDN'T BRING HIMSELF TO PART WITH THE ALLY MILLER DARTBOARD Retiring Pima County Supervisor Ray Carroll raised some money for charity by auctioning off stuff he found lying around his office. He says he wishes that he could have raised more. THERE'S A SPOT FOR THEM IN THE NEW TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Some spoiled (and drunk-ass) rich kids thought it was funny to throw empty beer bottles from the balcony of their high-rise UA-area apartment onto the grounds of the Islamic Center of Tucson below. YEAH, BUT IT WAS A DRY HEAVE On Father's Day of this year, the temperature hit 116 degrees in Tucson. That night, many of us had to watch as the (ugh!) Cleveland Cavaliers won Game 7 of the NBA championship playoffs to win the title over the Golden State Warriors. It was most unpleasant. I SWEAR I THOUGHT IT WAS THE PUERTO RICO FUNDS Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos lost his job to challenger Mark Napier after Nanos' office was beset by scandal and criminal charges involving the misuse of RICO funds. MAYBE THEY CAN BRING BACK WHAT'S LEFT OF BEN AFFLECK'S CAREER The Osiris REx program, being administered by a team from the UA, is sending a spacecraft on a two-year journey to the asteroid Bennu. It will blast a sample of asteroid dust off the rock and return to earth with its booty. THEIR HUSBANDS TOLD THEM TO Several women, claiming to be feminists, admitted that they voted for Trump. MCCLUSKY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL PART OF THE CHINESE CLIMATE-CHANGE HOAX Pima County Supervisor Sharon Bronson was in danger of drowning when her county vehicle was swept into a culvert during a monster summer storm. Radio talker Shaun McClusky thought that she had faked the whole thing and demanded that she—and not the county—pay for the repair on the vehicle. IN THE END, SHE GRACIOUSLY MADE THE ANIMAL AN OFFER OF SANCTUARY While driving a City-owned car, Tucson City Councilwoman Regina Romero was involved in a crash with a deer. The Councilwoman was unhurt, but the car was totaled. HE WAS SAVING THE TRICK PLAY FOR THE PAC-12 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME After his Wildcat football team scored a touchdown in the final minute to pull to within one point of national power Washington, Arizona Coach Rich Rodriguez eschewed going for two points and the win, instead opting to kick the extra point and go into overtime. Washington quickly scored to win the game in OT. It was one of eight consecutive Pac-12 losses for the woeful Cats. MY MAN CRUSH IS PROVEN WORTHY British actor Hugh Grant has been nominated for several Best Actor awards for his work in Florence Foster Jenkins. AND SOME UNABASHEDLY GOOD NEWS • The Amphi High School football team won its conference championship and returned to the State playoffs after a long hiatus. Retired Coach Vern Friedli, who turned 80 on 9/11, will be glad to know that his amazing legacy lives on. • The UA baseball team made an unlikely run to the College World Series and then came within one game of winning the school's fourth national championship. First-year coach Jay Johnson had the Cats playing an exciting style of baseball (if such a thing actually exists.) • And finally, a brand-new Popeye's Chicken opened up on Campbell near Ft. Lowell Road. This will help to decrease my personal carbon footprint as I will no longer have to drive nearly an hour from where I live to the one on 22nd Street and Kolb Road. However, having one only half as far away will probably also have a significant impact on my actual footprint.

Publicity shy Kroenke, 69, who has an estimated personal wealth of $8bn, has bought a majority share in Bonneau du Martray, a history-soaked wine grower in France's Burgundy region. 'Silent Stan', as he is known by Arsenal fans, also owns American football team the Los Angeles Rams, basketball's Denver Nuggets, as well ice hockey side the Colorado Avalanche. Arsenal's billionaire owner Stan Kroenke has purchased a prestigious French vineyard The newspaper did not reveal the price of the buyout, and the family which owns the site, the Le Bault de la Morinieres, could not be reached. Regional industry body BIVB said it had not been informed of the decision. Most of the red and white grand cru wines produced on Bonneau du Martray's 11-hectare site are destined for export, ending up on the tables of expensive restaurants. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Crush the mega-basement! Celebrities line up to try to block... Arsenal players worry Alexis Sanchez could be ready to quit... Share this article Share Kroenke, who is married to Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton who is worth £3.7bn in her own right, already has Californian vineyards in his business empire in the form of Napa Valley's Screaming Eagle. Screaming Eagle's estate manager Armand de Maigret told Les Echos newspaper that Kroenke's first foray into the foreign market was the 'product of love at first sight'. Kroenke is currently in the process of moving his Rams franchise from St Louis to Los Angeles Kroenke has been at the Arsenal helm since 2011, where he took his stake in the North London club to 66.64 per cent. He has attracted the ire of Gunners fans because of his continued backing of manager Arsene Wenger and reluctance to splash the cash in the transfer market. Arsenal have not won the Premier League since 2004. He also outraged fans as his company received an annual £3m payment 'for strategic and advisory services'. That ended in October after a backlash from supporters. Kroenke is currently in the process of moving his Rams franchise from St Louis to Los Angeles, where they last played in 1994 before defecting to Missouri. The new Rams stadium he is building in Inglewood, Los Angeles County, promises to be the best in the world.  At an estimated $3billion (£2.28bn) it will also be the most expensive.  The move has delighted residents in Los Angeles, but enraged those in Kroenke's home state of Missouri where accusations still fly about how it was allowed to happen.          Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow She's falling for him?

So as the esteemed 205 Live recapper, where would I place the show in the increasingly broad selection? We have Raw, Smackdown Live!, NXT, Main Event and 205 Live. I disqualify myself from ranking Main Event, as I haven't watched it often enough to comment, so with that in mind I would see the following on the podium: Smackdown Live! 205 Live NXT Raw In five short weeks, 205 Live has become the second best wrestling show WWE has to offer. It will take some real chops to knock Smackdown Live! Off the top spot - especially after last week's ratings-blockbuster mini-PPV - but neither the finding-its-feet-again NXT nor the bloated Raw can match its storytelling and in-ring display. This said, we were treated to the 205 Live equivalent of a placeholder episode this week. Does that mean it wasn't any good? Well, you'll have to read on to find out... Or skip to the end like the lazy fuckers you are #stillloveyou Right... Onto the show. We start with a shit video package. It's the kind of standard that a high school student could do better. Nah, only kidding. It's the usual brilliance. What a glib twat I am. But I thought I would mix it up instead of starting every review with ‘What a great a video package!' for variety's sake. What is pleasing is that it seems the company really want this to succeed. Both Raw (via storyline) and Smackdown Live! (via skits) point people to the program as well as giving wrestlers a little showcase. There ain't no politicking happening here, as many suspected when the division was seemingly slotted unceremoniously into Raw. We're told Rich Swann is unable to compete due to injury via that dastardly Neville. This is great storytelling; selling an injury, giving Swann a week off, and making Neville look like a dangerous badass. Tajiri vs Sean Maluta Tajiri! He's here! Damn, it's good to see him. He had one of the strongest stories in the Cruiserweight Classic and it was genuinely heartbreaking to see his departure from the tournament. And for the second time in 205 Live, Sean Maluta gets the jobber entrance. I have my money down on this lasting less than five minutes. We start with what's known as ‘The Shine'; matt based work, throwing blows back and forth, Tajiri immediately torquing limbs in horrid fashion. Mauro offers the insight that "Tajiri wanted to be a kickboxer, hence his fierce kicks," which adds a nice touch. And we get a Ta-ran-too-la from Tajiri! (gimmick infringement with OSW Review, there) Mauro remarks "that will make people instant arachnophobes". Love that man. Tajiri executes a Springboard back elbow that has a distinct beauty to it; he sets his position early and falls gracefully into the move. A nasty Buzzsaw Kick to the head and we're done in under three minutes. Tajiri def. Sean Maluta via pinfall following a Buzzsaw Kick Post-match Interaction - Brian Kendrick And here comes Kendrick. Perfect. Kajiri looks ready; adopting a battle stance in-ring the entire time. Kendrick plays up the false (?) accolades, welcoming Tajiri to 205 Live and suggesting a partnership. "First we have to get rid of the trash," he says, before kicking poor Maluta's prone body out of the ring. Kendrick offers a handshake. Tajiri accepts, before green misting the ever loving fuck out of Kendrick's face. So this begs the question... Is Kendrick a bad guy at this point? This is twice he has been jumped while ostensibly trying to be nice. Yet we know his intent is likely insidious, so does this simply mean we're finally getting smart faces who can preempt such nonsense? LAYERS! Backstage interview - Neville "TJ Perkins wouldn't have been champion if I was included," Neville intones about the CWC tournament. He puts over people's love of Perkins (which is questionable). Neville's promo is thus - Fuck TJ's struggles; what about mine. I've been discriminated against. "When the system is broken; you create your own system." He says ‘Bonnie lad'. He says ‘King of the Cruiserweights'. I can see Neville's run sheet: - Put opponent over - Talk about struggles - Insert British-ism - Say King of the Cruiserweights This, in no way, is a bad thing. I'm slightly more at peace with the ‘angry foreigner' angle - although I still think it unnecessary - because they're going in a slightly different direction with it. That of discrimination, rather than "GRRRR! ME FOREIGN! ME HATE ‘MERICA!" that we've been blundered over the head with so often in the past. We get a slick promo for Tony Nese. Having promos for the heel before a match is a really unusual, but welcome, touch. This leads us to... ‘The Extraordinary Gentlemen' Jack Gallagher vs Tony Nese w/ Ariya Daivari In light of Daivari's slick attire, Corey quips, "What do you know about style, Mauro? You bought that suit from Walmart." Banterific. We're treated to the Gentlemen's Duel promo recap. I love the black and white reel, and the frankly magnificently use of classic music. And they didn't miss the bow-tie straightening. Can someone please give the video department a freakin' medal already? Also, Gallagher's frickin' umbrella is called William. It's become a gimmick. Move over, Mitch the Plant. I have it on good authority that Hollywood is greenlighting Cast Away 2 starring Gallagher stranded on an island with William (the scene where William is blown away by the wind is Oscar-bait tearjerker stuff). With a great mini-build, onto the match... I will never tire of Gallagher's transitions out of locks. The nip out of the leg head lock, and the little shuffling of the feet back and forth beforehand, was magic. Gallagher really has fun with this pro wrestling thing. There seems to be a small miscommunication when both men push at each other at once after bouncing against the ropes, but they covered beautifully. Good tip for new wrestlers on how to be when things go wrong. Gallagher executes possibly his best cornerpost headstand to date, coming in at a belter of a pace beforehand. Nese rolls to the outside, and villainy beckons. Daivari comes swinging in with the Most Devastating Move in all of wrestling... The chop block. Jack Gallagher def. Tony Nese via disqualification when Ariya Daivari attacks the Extraordinary Gentleman mid-match Hmmmm. Hard to know how to feel about this. Another super short match, and a DQ finish always leaves one feeling a bit flat. But I guess we have to play the long game here. There's a story being told, and we're likely meant to feel frustrated. That said, Gulak exhibits his vicious smashmouth style. The largely ludicrous Tree of Woe KINDA makes sense for once by Daivari attacking Gallagher immediately after he's suspended upsidedown. Backstage segment - Alicia Fox and Cedric Alexander Cedric is concerned about losing so often; Alicia is deeply apologetic. Cedric doesn't make it Alicia's fault, he just wants her to be safe. Nawwww. Sweet. (This will end badly) We get an NXT promo of the Melbourne show (the one where the cage didn't come down properly... Whoops!) Did I tell you I blagged my way into the NXT hotel when they were in Canberra? That's another story for another post. Or it can be told vocally if Sean and Geno finally invite me onto Cageside Live as they've said they would. The bastards. #stillloveyou ‘The Scottish Supernova' Noam Dar vs Mustafa Ali So, we have Mustafa against Noam... They ARE trying to make Ali a face despite the video packages. This is lovely. No Chicago pop this week, but there's time. Loving Noam screaming at the ref for the rope/corner break. The man is OWNING this skeezy personality. He is now demonstrating it in the ring. We get a stiff looking spinning heel kick that is amazing in that Noam doesn't come up bloody. Noam executes a nasty looking dropkick as Ali gets into the ring. Straight away, Noam targets the arm. Despite all this great action, the crowd seems a bit down. Perhaps it's merely a contrast to the lively Chicago crowd of last week? This said, Noam playing to the crowd gets a handful of boos. Bonnie lad. In another beautiful heel move, Noam starts using the corner to attack Ali in the same way he was complaining against earlier in the match. What a beautiful twat of a hypocrite he is. There's a Snapmare into an armbar into a modified crossface. The supposed ‘rest holds' looks vicious, and play into the working of the arm. Noam keeps switching the holds, ending in a top wrist lock. Ali escapes, performs a tidy flip out of the corner, sprints to the opposite corner and unleashes a crowd-popping 3DT. Nice stuff. The crowd wakes up for an on-the-apron roundhouse kick from Ali, into a dive-through-the-ropes rolling neckbreaker. A wonderful little sequence. Noam deftly reversing a high flying attack from Ali into an armbar with added twist and torque on the worked arm. This, for mine, should have been the end of the match. After a good time in the lock, Ali rolls Noam into a pin to break the hold. Ali smashes Noam with a stiff kick in the corner. Corey Graves remarks, "Might want to find a good dentist," and the comment is warranted. That set up Noam for the delightful Inverted 450 from Ali for the win. Mustafa Ali def. Noam Dar via pinfall following an inverted 450 splash Of all of 205 Live, this is the one result I disagree with. Yes, Ali needs wins to establish himself, and Noam is enough of a character to weather the loss. But more of a story could have been told with Noam winning, particularly after working the arm so beautifully throughout the match. It could have set up Ali as a babyface with something to prove, and added a layer of threat to Noam's character to back up that magnificently slimey persona he has inhabited so well. Noam is on point. He is near perfect as a heel. Ali is clearly a great in-ring talent, but I feel he needs more work as far as in-ring psychology and distinct character goes to give himself the best chance of getting over. At the moment he seems to be going through the motions. And don't get me wrong; they're great motions. But some more quirks and characteristics will serve him well. Post-match interview - Noam Dar "Listen, chick..." Did he just say, ‘Listen, chick?' MAN, that guy's a bastard. Looking the way I do, I can hardly talk. But Noam has some interesting looking armpits. I think Noam may have forgotten his promo for a bit. But he got there in the end. We get a promo package for Akira Tozawa. The Cesaro interview is a nice touch. Fun Fact: Akira Tozawa and hometown hero Buddy Murphy put on the workrate match at the Canberra NXT show. It was 15 minutes of fantastic. I had the pleasure of shaking Mr Murphy's hand the following morning in appreciation. "What grade would you give it?" asked Wesley Blake, who was sitting with him for breakfast. "Oh, a solid A easily," I remarked. "Meh. I wouldn't give it more than a B myself," Blake quipped. Such wags. I also amused and confused my fellow Australians by switching that infuriating "Aussie! Aussie Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!" chant (birthed at the Sydney 2000 Olympics) to "Ja-pan! Ja-pan! Ja-pan! Oi! Oi! Oi!". We're not ALL racists down here. Right, enough of that. Onto yooooooouuuuuuurrrrrrr MAIN EVENT! Neville vs TJ Perkins Neville snarls his way to the ring. As is his wont. We get a quick TJ interview. Says Neville's attitude is all in his head. Calls him a bully. I'm not a fan of the ‘ugly' remark, and neither is the crowd. Leave that shit on the high school playground, TJ. But I bloody love those 8-bit glasses. Internet shopping ahoy! We get a great bit of commentary again come handshake time: Corey - Will we see sportsmanship here? Austin - I hope not. TJ's neglection of the handshake once again tells us a story. I've seen a lot of people hate on the handshake, but they do a lot with it. The initial tie-up has energy to it; a real angst and tussle is on display. The Shine sees TJ twist Neville's arm, which the latter sells the force of in a way that makes TJ look strong. I will never not pop for the head spin from TJ. It's one of my favourite moves in all wrestling. Commentary does an excellent job selling TJ's flashy style versus Neville's aggression. It's the story of the match. We're treated to a beautiful bulldog followed by a flying head-scissors by TJ. Neville takes a powder. His facial expression pays respects to his opponent whilst showing disdain. And there's a little bleeped swear thrown in there too for good measure. Neville is back in and executes a simple scoop slam. Even that has an added viciousness to it when Neville is the master of it. Again, it's the little things that Neville gets so right. The way the man STARES at his opponent as he goes to the top rope sells every high flying move as pure HEEL. Said corner ascension is followed by a nasty dropkick. We get a now-trademark headlock by Neville. TJ fights out. Neville slaps TJ down. Pin. Back to the headlock. Powering out, TJ flips over, lands on feet, executes an enziguri. Neville counters, then goes to the top once more. A stunning Twisting 450 splash/Phoenix splash misses. TJ whips through moves. Basement dropkick; neckbreaker, twisting corkscrew plancha to the outside, climbs up top, waits, and lands a diving crossbody. Great finishing sequence. Except Neville kicks out. Both men are looking formidable right now. Neville sets up TJ with a Superplex from the outside. Aries sells the danger of the edge of the apron. TJ then performs a precision Springboard frankensteiner. Now THAT is a great finish. Except Neville kicks out. The slow-mo replay tells us something about TJ's greatness. Look at how he meticulously positions himself for such a dangerous move. He makes it look like he has all the time in the world to think exactly where his body needs to be placed. The more I see him wrestle, the more I understand why he was picked as the CWC winner. He have some more back and forth grappling. Neville strikes TJ with two quick kicks before TJ counters with his own. TJ throws in a crazy Triangle wrecking ball dropkick. And then we get one of the best german/wheelbarrow suplexes I've seen Neville do. And that's saying something. Watch this episode for that alone. A. Thing. Of. Beauty. And it's a great way to end the match. Except TJ kicks out. There's a sharp kick to the face from TJ. I can't type fast enough to keep up at this point. TJ goes to the top. Neville crotches him. Corey makes a great point about both men being tired and taking too long while going for the high risk maneuver. There's fighting on the top rope. A desperate back and forth. A great story here, selling the desperation of trying to escape the Superplex. It ends with a big kick to the head from Neville. Here comes the Superplex. There's a big pause. And then that glorious Superplex. And end. Neville def. TJ Perkins via pinfall following a Superplex HOW is a Superplex a finisher? How? Everyone does it. And yet it is. Neville makes it believable. And the slow motion replay shows why. Neville bends his back as far as possible before releasing his feet from the ropes. THAT'S why it looks so fantastic. And the pause beforehand helps with the drama too. "Neville Showing He's At A Different Level," remarks Mauro. Yes indeed, my friend. Grade - B Thoughts This was the 205 Live equivalent of a placeholder show. Bad? Not at all. There was good action, storylines pushed forward, Tajiri, all the good stuff. But for the first time I feel they tried to put too much into the 42 minutes. This may be a problem going forward as more talent is brought into the fold. That said, the main event - as always - did not disappoint. Neville is a star, TJ is an unquestionable in-ring talent, and they told a magnificent story between their contrasting styles. This is a great show, people. And it only takes up 42 minutes of your precious time. Get involved.

Entertainment Services Health & Beauty Business Directory 2017-01-05 / News of the Weird Tweet Print NEWS OF THE WEIRD BY CHUCK SHEPHERD Distributed by Universal Press Syndicate Oh-so-sweet dreams The Hastens workshop in Koping, Sweden, liberally using the phrase “master artisans” recently, unveiled its made-to-order $149,900 mattress. Bloomberg News reported in December on Hastens’ use of superior construction materials such as pure steel springs, “slow-growing” pine, multiple layers of flax, horsehair lining (braided by hand, then unwound to ensure extra spring), and cotton covered by flame-retardant wool batting. With a 25-year guarantee, an eight-hour-a-day sleep habit works out to $2 an hour. (Bonus: The Bloomberg reviewer, after a trial run, gave the “Vividus” a glowing thumbs-up.) The job of the researcher Humans are good at recognizing faces, but exceptionally poor at recognition when the same face’s features are scrambled or upside down. In December, a research team from the Netherlands and Japan published findings that chimpanzees are the same way — when it comes to recognizing other chimps’ butts. That suggests, the scientists concluded, that sophisticated recognition of rear ends is as important for chimps (as “socio-sexual signaling,” such as prevention of inbreeding) as faces are to humans Least-competent criminals ¦ Leonard Rinaldi, 53, was arrested in Torrington, Conn., in November following his theft of a rare-coin collection belonging to his father. The coins were valued at about $8,000, but apparently to make his theft less easily discoverable, he ran them through a Coinstar coin-cashing machine — netting himself a cool $60. ¦ James Walsh was arrested in Port St. Lucie on Dec. 12 at a Wal-Mart after carting out an unpaid-for big-screen TV. Walsh said he had swiped a TV on Dec. 11 with no problem — but failed to notice that, on the 12th, the store had a “shop with a cop” event at which St. Lucie County deputies were buying toys for kids. Suspicions confirmed Humanity has accumulated an estimated 30 trillion tons of “stuff,” according to research by University of Leicester geologists — enough to fit over 100 pounds’ worth over every square meter of the planet’s surface. The scientists, writing in the Anthropocene Review, are even more alarmed that very little of it is ever recycled and that buried layers of technofossils that define our era will clutter and weigh down the planet, hampering future generations. (Don’t just think of “garage sale” stuff, wrote Mother Nature News; think of every single thing we produce.) The passing parade ¦ In October, Chicago alderman Howard Brookins Jr. publicly denounced “aggressive” squirrels that were gnawing through trash cans and costing the city an extra $300,000. A month later, Brookins was badly injured in a bicycle collision (broken nose, missing teeth) when a squirrel (in either a mighty coincidence or suicide terrorism) jumped into one of his wheels, sending Brookins over the handlebar. ¦ In October, officials of Alaska’s Iditarod reaffirmed an earlier decision to allow mushers to use mobile phones during the 2017 race; “purists” maintain that phones destroy the “frontier-ness” of the event. Finer points of the law A federal appeals court agreed with a jury in December that Battle Creek, Mich., police were justified in shooting (and killing) two hardly misbehaving family dogs during a legal search of a house’s basement. Mark and Cheryl Brown had pointed out that their dogs never attacked; one, an officer admitted, was “just standing there” when shot and killed. The officers said that conducting a thorough search of the premises might have riled the dogs and threatened their safety. (Unaddressed was whether a dog might avoid being shot if it masters the classic trick of “playing dead.”) ¦ Return to top If you have any problems, questions, or comments regarding www.FloridaWeekly.com, please contact our Webmaster.

GROSS11 days ago Man Accused of Semen Attacks in Walmart Police in Ohio have arrested a 26-year-old man accused of squirting semen onto women at a Walmart on multiple occasions after using the store’s bathroom to masturbate into a syringe. The man, identified as West Virginia resident Timothy Blake, allegedly attacked women throughout November and December before being arrested Dec. 30. Details of his crimes have emerged in court affidavits obtained by CBS News. The first victim reported to police on Nov. 2 that a “creepy” man had been following her around the store before squirting her with something “sticky.” A similar incident on Dec. 28 led police to Blake, who ultimately admitted to assaulting a dozen different women in the store. He reportedly told police he used either his own vehicle or the Walmart bathroom to masturbate into a syringe before picking a target in the store. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” police said in an affidavit. Blake has been booked without bond, pending an arraignment.

In the time we were there, we took many pictures. We are so proud! Upon returning home I was taking the pictures to be developed but had a few stops to make first. Yes, I lost my camera with all the pictures I could never replace. After many sleepless nights, I backtracked the route taken and the stops made, but no camera. I then went to the Hallmark store in Cranberry Mall and was greeted with “Grace, we have your camera.” Sure enough, a wonderful person had found it in the store and had given it to the great girls working there who thought it was probably mine. I was overwhelmed. Then the other day I was in Wal-Mart buying a buggy full of plants. I let a lovely lady go ahead of me in the checkout line and she asked me why I was buying so many plants. I told her I was paying forward a random acts of kindness (my camera,) and she insisted on helping with the cost. I didn’t get her name but I surely appreciate and am so grateful for her help. The greatest people live in Cranberry. Thank you, I will never forget these wonderful people. GRACE THOMAS Cranberry Murray Avenue angel On a cold Saturday evening I was driving on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill when a beep from my nine-month-old Ford told me there was something wrong with one of my tires. Panic set in. At the tender age of 86, I have never put air in a tire and reading all that jibberish on the air pump is beyond me. Besides, I couldn’t bend down to do whatever needed to be done. I was at a total, frustrating loss. I pulled into the GetGo gas station at Murray and Forward avenues, looked around and knew there was no way the station attendant could help me because he was knee-deep in customers. I pulled up to a small truck where a young man was putting air in his tires. I asked him how to use the air pump. He took one look at my desperate old face and just knew he had to help me. He checked all my tires, put air in where it was needed and was so gracious about it. I knew he was coming from work because of his attire and he was probably tired at 7 p.m., but he took the time to help me. I offered him money for his kindness but he refused, saying I should donate the money to an animal shelter, which I certasinly will do. Thank you, thank you, thank you. RUTH STONE LASDAY Squirrel Hill Acknowledging a Marine’s service My husband, John Sapsara III, has been working very hard renovating our home. I suggested treating him to dinner and he could pick the restaurant. He chose the Olive Garden in McIntyre Square. We were both dressed casually and my husband was wearing a retired Marines ball cap. We decided to sit at the bar to eat dinner and watch the news. A former Marine saw my husband’s cap, and like all Marines, he said to my husband, “Semper Fi.” That’s all it took to get a conversation going regarding MOS (Military Occupational Speciality), bases, etc. When we finished dinner, I asked for the check. The waiter said that a gentleman seated behind us overheard my husband’s conversation, and offered to buy both of our dinners as way to say thank you. He wanted to remain anonymous. Whoever you are, your act of kindness touched both of us, especially my husband. He is very proud to be a U.S. citizen and more importantly to have served his country as a Marine. It brought tears to his eyes. From the bottom of our hearts, we wish you peace and happiness this Christmas season and for the New Year. Thank you! JENNIE L. SAPSARA Ross Has someone done you right?

On April 23, 2016, at around 6:21 a.m., Officers Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell responded to a non-emergency call about a person trespassing at a Walmart store, police said. Colwell arrived first and spoke with the suspect, whom police identified as Mitchell Oakley. Police said that shortly after Pueblo arrived, Oakley then shot both officers multiple times. In the video footage, which shows multiple angles of the scene unfolding, officers can be seen talking with Oakley, who is seated in a chair in front of them. As Oakley stands up, he suddenly starts shooting as shoppers scatter. Pueblo, 34, was shot three times — in the torso, arm and face, police said. Colwell, 29, was shot two or three times in the torso. The force of the bullets sent him flying through a display. But he was able to get back up and return fire, killing Oakley as he tried to run out of the store, according to police. “In a matter of seconds, the suspect fired six rounds at the officers,” Officer Seth Tyler, a police spokesman, told ABC News in an email today. “Faced with the threat of imminent death, both officers were exceptional in their actions. The threat was stopped and no innocent bystanders were injured.” Both officers were wearing ballistic vests. Chandler police said that Pueblo is still recovering from his injuries — he has nerve damage in his face — and has not returned to duty. Six days after the April shooting, however, he left the hospital to a standing ovation. Colwell has been back on duty for a few months. Police said the Maricopa County District Attorney’s Office was still investigating the incident. Police did not comment on why Oakley opened fire. Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

up next: now reading: Will China's RMB Ever Trump the U.S. Dollar? Will China's RMB Ever Trump the U.S. Dollar? By John Tamny January 05, 2017 X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...

Shanghai is China's richest and most important commercial city. Interesting about it is that as of 1978, a mere 15 skyscrapers dotted its largely empty skyline. Back then China was an intensely poor, communist (in the literal sense) country. But as of 2006, and after a few decades of economic liberalization, Shanghai's skyscraper count had increased to 3,780. In 2017, the number of tall buildings surely exceeds what seemed enormous in 2006. Though China remains a poor country by developed world standards, to visit is to see people who are very much in a hurry. They want to live like we do, and they're working incredibly hard to get there. China is for real. For those who claim it's a creation of "easy credit" (an oxymoron if there ever was one - credit is always and everywhere difficult to attain) thanks to its central bank and state run banks, they should think again. Figure that lots of countries have central banks, along with politicized credit allocators, but few can claim even a fraction of the stunning growth that is plainly visible to anyone lucky enough to visit the rapidly advancing country. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, has published an important new book on China's economic rise; albeit through the prism of its currency: the yuan, or the Renminbi, or as Prasad references it, the RMB. Up front, it should be said that Prasad's Gaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi is a very informative book, and it's mostly very good. Prasad is clearly well connected within the economics profession. Endorsers of his book include former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, and former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers. This is mentioned early on as a way of addressing what would understandably turn off perhaps more than a few potential readers. How could what's a very worthwhile and informative read have the endorsement of three economists who are so frequently ridiculous? It's a good question. My own speculation is that they agreed to endorse Prasad's book without actually having read it. This is assumed simply because Prasad's book is decidedly not ridiculous. It's once again very informative, and while Prasad on occasion lapses into nauseating "economist think," he's quite a bit more serious than the trio mentioned. Lest we forget, Bernanke is convinced that economic growth causes inflation despite centuries of evidence that reveal soaring growth as the greatest foe of rising prices. In Rogoff's case, his modern war on cash has him concluding that the best cure for recessions is rampant spending despite the tautology that entrepreneurs can't be entrepreneurs without access to savings. As for Summers, though books could be written about his silly assertions about government spending driving economic growth (I guess the politicians in Haiti missed this memo), it's hard to forget his mind-numbingly obtuse conclusion that Japan's tragic 2011 earthquake would stimulate economic growth there thanks to the spending required to rebuild all the wealth and lives destroyed. In Summers' defense, a poll of credentialed economists would reveal a nearly unanimous and horrifyingly dim belief that all the killing, maiming and wealth destruction that took place during World War II revived the global economy; the U.S. economy most notably. The economics profession of the modern day is decidedly unserious, so much so that it took a while to open Prasad's book. Having recently read and reviewed the comically bad "Phishing for Fools" by Nobel Laureates George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, I wasn't exactly eager to commit more precious time to another book widely praised by economists. Thankfully I dismissed my recurring nightmare that includes a read of Akerlof's alleged insights only to open up Gaining Currency. I'm glad I did. So will the readers of this column if they can get beyond the individuals who endorsed Prasad. His book is one that I'll be referring to for a very long time. Prasad begins by providing the reader with a brief, but highly interesting history of China's experience with currencies. In a book full of fun and interesting facts, the reader learns that while the RMB was introduced in 1949, China was the first country to use paper money. Interesting to some will be why. Prasad explains that rising Chinese prosperity during the Song dynasty (960-1279) made it "increasingly cumbersome and impractical to use these heavy coins for business transactions." Money is a measure despite what modern economists worshipful of floating currency values tell us, so while China moved to paper money out of convenience hundreds of years ago, the Song government understood that money's only purpose was as a ruler, or measuring rod. As Prasad put it, the Song government resisted private money given its belief that "only the government could ensure a reliable supply of a currency stable enough to support economic activity." Wise minds can and surely will continue to debate the public versus private money concept, but the good news is that Prasad fascinatingly reports that there were some currency dissenters inside China many centuries ago. While the Song government should be cheered for understanding what neither economists nor politicians understand today (that money is a measure which facilitates exchange and investment, and nothing else), it's encouraging to read that Confucian scholars disagreed with the notion of government-issued money. Prasad writes that they felt "the market would compel private issuers of money to maintain its value." It says here the Confucians were right. Private sector players expertly create for us computers, Wi-Fi and navigation gadgets (GPS) that seamlessly guide us when we're lost, and odds are they could issue money that would hold its value. They would because market discipline enforces good behavior. While the U.S. Treasury can consistently devalue the dollar only for us to keep accepting what is the world's currency, Visa, Amex and Walmart couldn't so easily devalue their currencies. Competition would keep them honest. Speaking of devaluation and currency instability, Prasad very helpfully notes that the Song dynasty "was eventually weakened by monetary instability" only for it to give way to the Yuan dynasty. Yet it too was eventually felled by devaluation. Prasad writes that "Reckless issuance of large quantities of paper money undermined confidence in the currency..." Lenin, Mises, Keynes and others all understood what Prasad is reporting: if you want to turn society upside down on the way to tantrums in the citizenry that invariably force changes at the governmental top, debauch the currency. It's so basic. People go to work in order to get what they don't have, and the money they earn amounts to the "tickets" (to take a word from John Stuart Mill) that they accept in return for their toil, and that represent their demand for what they don't have. In that case, is it any wonder that citizens lose it when their money is devalued? Economists generally think it's low rent to talk about the price of anything in gold, but the dollar plummeted in gold terms from 2001 to August of 2011, and is still quite a bit weaker than it was when the 21st century began. The latter in mind, Lenin, Mises and Keynes might not be too surprised by Donald Trump's recent victory, not to mention a globally frustrated electorate. Figure that the world remains on an implicit dollar standard despite the end of Bretton Woods in 1971, so when the U.S. Treasury devalues the greenback, it's a global event. As Prasad himself notes, "most countries that manage their currencies, especially those in Asia, tend to use their own currency's value relative to the dollar as the benchmark." Devaluation wrecked the regimes of the past, and it still does now. The difference is that most economists nowadays talk excitedly about the alleged good that comes from devaluing the money that people earn. Again, the profession has become ridiculous in modern times. All of the above speaks to a needless analytical weakness within Gaining Currency. Having established the logical truth that currency devaluation is the greatest enemy of political stability, Prasad then contradicts himself. At the beginning of Chapter 2 he strangely writes that "Trying to cheapen a domestic currency's value relative to that of other currencies can actually help boost exports and, therefore, offset weak domestic demand and raise GDP growth." It was as though Akerlof, Bernanke, Rogoff and other typical economists entered Prasad's body all at once; that or Chapter 2 was written by some misguided teacher's assistant in Prasad's employ. Here the book is humming along informatively, then Prasad reverts to discredited "economist think." What a waste. Addressing what is false, cheapened currencies aren't the path to export nirvana for the simple reason that shrinkage of the measure logically drives up the cost of imported inputs necessary to create the final good in the first place. It also can't be forgotten that transportation costs necessarily rise (a dollar in 2016 buys quite a bit less fuel than did a buck in 2001) to reflect the debased currency, as do labor costs; workers generally don't sit back and allow their pay to be eviscerated without protest. Most crucial of all is the basic truth that investment in productivity enhancements is the single best way to drive down the price of anything, and investors are buying future currency income streams when they commit capital to investment in productivity enhancements. Yet devaluation logically makes it quite a bit less likely that investors will put capital to work in the first place. In short, Prasad gets it all wrong about devaluation. Needlessly. One wonders if he simply forgot that Japan had some of its best export years into the U.S. right as the yen was soaring over 200% against the dollar from the 1970s through the 1980s. If devaluation were the driver of GDP growth, then Mexico, Argentina and Zimbabwe would list among the richest and most dynamic countries in the world. In fact, devaluation is anti-growth and anti-falling prices simply because it's anti-investment. A few pages later Prasad writes that "'intervention' in the foreign exchange market limits domestic currency appreciation and therefore improves a country's trade balance by limiting imports and propping up exports." There's so much wrong with the previous statement. Back to reality, a rising currency would at least in nominal currency terms reduce the cost of production and shipping, and boost the very investment that would once again bring down prices. Good money is an investment lure, and by extension it's a muscular price chopper. Not to Prasad. In his analysis, rising currencies bring on all manner of horrid outcomes, while devaluation is less than costless. But that's simply not true. More realistically, a falling currency necessarily reduces the investment necessary to bring down prices to begin with. As for a country's trade balance, there's no such thing. What Prasad is writing about is an accounting abstraction. Countries don't trade; rather individuals trade. And their trade balances, as a rule. They run "trade surpluses" with their employers, and then their reward if they're really productive is massive "trade deficits" with their favorite clothiers, carmakers, restaurants, hoteliers, airlines, etc. The strange thing about Prasad's unfortunate lurch into "economist think" is that while a stable currency was by his own reporting essential in the China of 1,000 years ago, in modern times good, stable money has somehow become a liability in his eyes. Of course, in order to defend what is absurd and indefensible, Prasad sadly reverts to the silly "truth" accepted by economists that devaluation is good for the economy. The problem is that an economy isn't some blob, it's just a collection of individuals. And just as individuals are not made better off when the purchasing power of the money they earn is diluted, neither is an economy better off. Forgotten by Prasad is that an economy isn't some machine that attains "balance" thanks to floating currencies; rather an economy is just individuals producing so that they can get. Money in an economy properly defined remains what the Song government felt it was, what the Confucians felt it should be, and what Adam Smith said about it: "the sole use of money is to circulate consumable goods." Once this is properly understood, or remembered, all this talk of devaluation, strength, weakness, and trade balances quickly goes out the window. Trade always balances, by definition. In what is still a very good book, Prasad needlessly weakens it with a persistent argument throughout that currency devaluation is a principal driver of exports that boost prosperity. More realistically, imports are paradoxically (at least to economists) the biggest driver of exports. Stating the obvious, countries that are importing a lot are logically exporting a lot. The book is also weakened by Prasad's occasional reference to the "over" and "under" valued RMB. But that's like saying the inch is sometimes too long and sometimes too short. An inch quite simply is, as is a foot and a minute. Fiddling with the exchange value of money can't change the on-the-ground reality. Money is what we need to facilitate trade and investment. Nothing else. Prasad's history of China's currency situation makes the latter quite obvious, only for the Cornell professor to stray from what is basic economics as he talks about the RMB's gradual evolution into a global currency. Returning to Prasad's early point that much of Asia (and realistically much of the world) benchmarks its money to the dollar, he reminds readers of what people like president-elect Donald Trump would prefer that voters forget: that China officially pegged the RMB to the dollar in 1994. This is important when we consider the silly commentary from Trump and others about a "weak" RMB. Sorry, but the RMB has long been pegged to the dollar. When the latter is weak, so is the RMB. When it's strong, so is the RMB. Prasad also reminds the reader (what this reader would give to have members of the Trump administration's protectionist wing read Gaining Currency) that from 2005 to 2014, the RMB rose 25 percent against the dollar. All this runs counter to what we heard from Trump during his presidential campaign. Still, Prasad and other economists perhaps deserve some of the blame in light of their floating money worship, not to mention their talk of money that is "over" and "under" valued. In going to great lengths to deprive modern money of its singular purpose as a measure or concept, they hand demagogues the words and catch-phrases that inform ridiculous economic commentary. Prasad is ultimately discussing the path of the RMB to reserve currency status. It's not quite there yet, but it's getting there. While the dollar accounts for 64 percent of global reserve currency holdings, and the euro 21 percent, the RMB was up to 1.1% as of 2014. It's in the conversation. Prasad writes early on that the non "market determined" exchange rate of the RMB is a barrier to it becoming more of a reserve currency, but it seems he gets the story backwards. While the RMB's peg to the dollar isn't absolute a la 1994, it's still pretty tight. And that's the problem when we consider the dollar's 21st century volatility. Money is most useful when it's stable. Prasad intuitively knows this from his early analysis of China's currency history. Assuming Chinese monetary authorities move in the direction of RMB-price stability (whether through a gold definition, or more intriguingly private money issuance), odds are the RMB's use as a reserve currency will increase. One can only hope. Treasury's oversight of the dollar has been atrocious over the last 16 years to the logical detriment of the global economy. A better, more stable RMB would perhaps force Treasury to get serious. One other weak point of the book was Prasad's all-too-typical assertion that the U.S. economy recovered more rapidly from the 2008 thanks to the Fed printing "large amounts of money rapidly" alongside a U.S. government that "used fiscal policy aggressively." That's just silly. And Prasad surely knows why. The Fed quite simply can't increase so-called "money supply" where economic activity doesn't already rate it. If he doubts this, he need only ask himself how long the dollar proceeds from Fed purchases of bonds from Baltimore, Compton, or Buffalo, NY banks would stay in all three locales as performing loans. After that, simple logic tells us that Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi can't allocate precious resources extracted from the real economy as well as Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos can. Prasad's already good writing would be so much better if he weren't so eager to be conventional at times. And if he might throw statistics aside in favor of common sense. Simply put, neither the Fed nor Congress can allocate resources more effectively than can the private sector. As for this notion that the economy will halt if Congress won't spend what savers will not, let's be serious. Recessions when left alone correct quickly precisely because people spend less such that their savings morph into the very investment that powers the recovery. As for saving that doesn't become investment, banks don't take in deposits to stare at them lovingly; rather banks pay for deposits only to lend them out immediately. To save isn't to not consume as economists think. In truth, when we save our consumption is shifted to someone else eager to consume. Getting more specific, notions of "export-led growth" are utterly nonsensical. We're exporting so that we can import. Always. Yet despite the quibbles with commentary that Prasad is seemingly too smart to associate himself with, Gaining Currency is otherwise very good. If readers are willing to look beyond the conventional economist-speak previously discussed, they'll come away much more informed. Prasad provides readers with an interesting overview of Chinese currency history, and then offers myriad fun facts and commentary about the impact of S&P downgrades on U.S. and Japanese debt (it's not what you'd expect), how Chinese investors get around rapidly eroding capital controls, why Treasuries are so attractive to global investors (it's not necessarily a quality thing), along with the exciting development of China's "shadow" financing system. And while Prasad is plainly an optimist about China's future, he describes as "far-fetched" the notion that the RMB will eventually overtake the dollar as the world's reserve currency. I hope he's wrong. One way he could be proven wrong is if China's monetary authorities seek what economists like him strangely decry: stability of the unit as a measure of value. If Chinese monetary authorities ditch the dollar in favor of currency stability, watch out. What is 1.1% reserve penetration will quickly soar. The problem is that Prasad and his esteemed colleagues recoil at the very RMB stability that would give the dollar serious competition, all the while serving as a massive investment lure into China. Of course, all of the above helps explain why a very good and informative book isn't great. Simply put, the wise thinking that informed Prasad's explanation of early Chinese currency history (when stability as a measure of value was crucial) went out the window when he set out to tackle the present. This doesn't mean Gaining Currency wasn't highly informative despite Prasad's occasional migration into the absurd, but it does mean the book wasn't as excellent as it could have been. Readers should read Gaining Currency with an eye on learning a lot, but with eyes wide open to how much better it could have been had Prasad ignored the economists in favor of common sense about why the Chinese first introduced money to begin with.   John Tamny is editor of RealClearMarkets, Political Economy editor at Forbes, a Senior Fellow in Economics at Reason Foundation, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Research and Trading (www.trtadvisors.com).

In the process, he also struck a man who was removing a suitcase from the trunk of the car. When he asked how much he had to drink, he told officers "too much to drive." He also refused to take sobriety tests. Both men were taken to the hospital. Suspicious person, Elmwood Road: Officers located two 14-year-old Cleveland Heights boys walking in the street at 3:18 a.m. Dec. 22. They said they were coming from a party. They were taken to their homes and released to their parents. The mother of one voiced concerns over her son's behavior and asked that he be charged with curfew violation. The other will likely be charged with the same violation, along with falsification charges, as he lied about his identity. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee was arrested at the store for theft Dec. 21 after admitting to taking gift cards and using them. The Cleveland woman, 40, was also suspected of returning customer items and re-ringing them at lower prices and putting the difference on gift cards for personal use. Harassing communication, South Green Road: A woman said Dec. 15 she is pregnant and the father of the child has been verbally harassing her due to the fact that she wants to keep the baby. She said the man, 22, has threatened to kill her grandparents and show up at her place of work to get her and the baby. She also said he has a video of her from when she was 16-years-old that he is threatening to post on Facebook. Officers have been unable to make contact with the man. Stolen vehicle, Bexley Boulevard: Officers located a minivan partially on a tree lawn and geared in reverse with nobody inside of it Dec. 22. They discovered the column ignition was missing and there were no keys inside of it. They determined it belonged to an area resident, who said he last saw it in his driveway. It was believed someone tried to steal it and it stalled while in reverse and would not start again, so the suspect abandoned it. Theft, Cedar Road: A Bob Evans employee reported Dec. 24 someone stole $800 cash from her purse while it was in an employee break room. The co-worker she suspected was a Cleveland man, 29, who she said had knowledge of the money being there because he went to the bank with her when she withdrew it. Surveillance video showed the suspect take something from the purse and place it into his purse. The manager said he left work early than usual that night. He has not returned to work for subsequent shifts. Violation of protection order, Bexley Boulevard: A man reported his wife, whom he has a protection order against, was inside his home when he returned to it around 1 a.m. Dec. 25. She said she needed to talk but only stayed a few minutes. Later, he reported someone was flashing their lights at him and trying to get him to pull his vehicle over while he was driving in Cleveland Heights. He then received a phone call from someone identifying himself as a Cleveland Heights police officer and asking him why he failed to pulled over. The man subsequently confirmed with Cleveland Heights police that there was no officer by the name the suspect provided him with. The incident is under investigation and a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the man's 34-year-old wife for violating the protection order. Theft, Okalona Road: At 8:30 a.m. Dec. 24, a woman said she was sitting with a friend in his vehicle in her driveway smoking a cigarette when she saw a man walk up her driveway and enter her vehicle. She said the man opened her trunk and stole several toys from it. When she went to approach him, she said he pulled out a gun and pointed it at her. He then left and was not located. The value of the toys, intended as Christmas gifts, was $90. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland woman, 34, was arrested for theft without consent at Walmart Dec. 22 after she was suspected of ringing up remote control cars at the self-checkout at a more favorable price. An employee said she can be seen on surveillance video scanning a separate bar code she was holding in her hand. It was for an item priced at $9.97 and the cars were priced between $30 and $60. Fraud, Liberty Road: A man reported Dec. 22 he received his credit card statement and found 15 unauthorized charges from the Apple online store and for purchases on iTunes for a total of $3,345. He suspected a former foster child of his was responsible because the girl, 17, emailed him in November and stated he may be in for a surprise when he gets his credit card bill. He said he also spoke to her and she told him some of the purchases were for four iPhones, which she bought and sold to friends. The man's bank has since removed the unauthorized charges and he decided he does not want to press charges. He believes the girl is living in Akron. Robbery, South Belvoir Boulevard: A woman, 18, reported around 7:30 p.m. Dec. 18 she was attacked by an unknown man while she was in Quarry Park North. She said she got off a bus and decided to cut through the park when the man tackled her and pulled her into the bushes. She said he wanted her book bag, but she refused to give it to him. He left with her cell phone, wallet and headphones. Officers were unable to locate the suspect. Counterfeiting, Warrensville Center Road: A man said Dec. 20 someone tried to pay him $4,200 in counterfeit $100 bills when he met with him in the Walmart parking lot to sell him a dirt bike. He said he met the suspect on Craigslist and drove over three hours from Belle Center to meet with him. He said the suspect took off running after they both went into the store to try to make change for the money, which the man suspected was not real. Officers were unable to identify the suspect.

Make no mistake, Trump will be doing the bidding of the same corporate interests as his predecessors. By Dean Baker / CEPR January 4, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Christopher Halloran/Shutterstock Shortly after Donald Trump enters the White House, we should get an answer to a key question from his campaign: What does he actually intend to do about trade? Trade was one of his main issues when he campaigned in the key industrial states that he won in November. Trump argued that past presidents of both parties had failed the country's workers by signing bad trade deals. He said that the negotiators were "stupid" and that he would instead appoint "smart" negotiators who wouldn't let Mexico, China and other trading partners beat us at the negotiating table. Trump is correct in identifying trade as a force that has caused enormous economic damage to millions of people in these states, but he is wrong that the problem was "stupid" negotiators. The vast majority of people who have been given the responsibility for negotiating trade deals are smart, ambitious and hard-working. The large trade deficits we have been running in the last two decades are not due to negotiators. We run large trade deficits because securing manufacturing jobs in the United States has not been a priority for our negotiators.   When our trade negotiators sit down with Mexico, China and other trading partners, they have a long list of items on their agenda. For example, they want longer and stronger patent protection for our drugs and copyright protection for Microsoft's software. They also want better market access for our financial, telecommunications and retail industries. Our trade negotiators have been quite successful in these areas. Furthermore, the trade deficit is not a bad thing for everyone in the United States. Many of the items that we import from Mexico, China and other developing countries were actually produced by US companies. They wanted to take advantage of low cost labor to get an edge on their domestic competition. Similarly, Walmart and other major retailers are happy to have low-cost suppliers in the developing world. The US manufacturers that took their operations overseas and the retailers that benefit from low-cost supply chains did not lose from recent trade deals, they got rich. The problem for US workers has not been that our trade negotiators are not smart; the problem is that they have a different agenda. This raises the question of the agenda that Donald Trump wants to pursue in trade deals. If his goal is first and foremost to regain manufacturing jobs by reducing the size of the trade deficit, then the top priority should be lowering the value of the dollar against the currencies of China and other trading partners. A lower valued dollar will make US exports cheaper for people living in other countries leading them to buy more of our exports. It will also make imports more expensive for people in the United States. That will cause US consumers to substitute domestically produced items for imports. The net effect would be a smaller trade deficit and more jobs in manufacturing. While it is not possible to get back the 5 million manufacturing jobs we have lost in the last two decades, plausible reductions in the trade deficit could bring back 1-2 million manufacturing jobs. This would have a noticeable impact on the labor market for workers without college degrees. However, it is not clear that Trump plans to pursue a trade policy focused on getting back manufacturing jobs. While he railed about currency "manipulation" in the election campaign, he also complained that other countries didn't grant our companies adequate market access or respect the patents and copyrights of US companies. These are conflicting agendas, and it remains to be seen whether Trump pursues a trade agenda that will increase manufacturing jobs, or one that will further enrich corporate America. With the top two economic posts in the Trump administration going to Goldman Sachs alums, the money is betting on the corporate agenda. But that doesn't mean that US workers will be left entirely out in the cold. After all, Trump did engineer a deal that saved the jobs of 800 Carrier workers in Indiana. This amounts to 0.008 percent of the 12,260,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trump has indicated that he plans to push other deals with individuals companies, which could amount to several thousand more jobs. In other words, when it comes to the policies that actually determine the jobs and wages of tens of millions of working class people, Trump will be doing the bidding of the same corporate interests as his predecessors. But he will give us more Carrier-type shows, which should net us a number of jobs that you can count on your fingers.   Dean Baker is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).

On April 23, 2016, at around 6:21 a.m., Officers Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell responded to a non-emergency call about a person trespassing at a Walmart store, police said. Colwell arrived first and spoke with the suspect, whom police identified as Mitchell Oakley. Police said that shortly after Pueblo arrived, Oakley then shot both officers multiple times. 2 Police Officers Shot, Killed in Ambush Attacks in Iowa In the video footage, which shows multiple angles of the scene unfolding, officers can be seen talking with Oakley, who is seated in a chair in front of them. As Oakley stands up, he suddenly starts shooting as shoppers scatter. Pueblo, 34, was shot three times -- in the torso, arm and face, police said. Colwell, 29, was shot two or three times in the torso. The force of the bullets sent him flying through a display. But he was able to get back up and return fire, killing Oakley as he tried to run out of the store, according to police. "In a matter of seconds, the suspect fired six rounds at the officers," Officer Seth Tyler, a police spokesman, told ABC News in an email today. "Faced with the threat of imminent death, both officers were exceptional in their actions. The threat was stopped and no innocent bystanders were injured." Arizona Department of Corrections Chandler police identified Mitchell Oakley as the suspect who opened fire on the officers at a Walmart in Phoenix, Arizona, in April 2016. Both officers were wearing ballistic vests. Chandler police said that Pueblo is still recovering from his injuries -- he has nerve damage in his face -- and has not returned to duty. Six days after the April shooting, however, he left the hospital to a standing ovation. Colwell has been back on duty for a few months. "Officers Colwell and Pueblo are two examples of the men and women who continue to risk their lives every day protecting our communities ... They put their lives on the line and acted heroically ... I couldn't be more proud of both officers," police chief Sean Duggan said. Police said the Maricopa County District Attorney's Office was still investigating the incident. Police did not comment on why Oakley opened fire.
