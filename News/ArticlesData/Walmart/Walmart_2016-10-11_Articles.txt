Richard Brian/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @vegasphotograph By ALEXANDER S. COREY LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL A Fortune 500 company is expanding to Nevada, with at least four locations in North Las Vegas. For 20 years, Arkansas-based gasoline station chain Murphy USA had a partnership with Wal-Mart to build stations near its stores. The brand will continue to manage nearly 1,100 existing gas stations near Wal-Mart stores and some under development, but in January the retail giant announced it would take over the gas pumps at future locations. While most of its locations are located near Wal-Mart stores, Murphy USA also has about 220 standalone stores under the Murphy Express brand. “We are scheduled to have two Murphy Express locations open and operating in Nevada by the end of the year along with two other locations under construction,” said Jerianne Thomas, a spokeswoman for Murphy USA, in an email. Thomas added that the locations would create approximately 40 jobs in North Las Vegas. “Gas station operators have seen very strong fuel margins for the last couple of years,” said Les Eisinga, a broker with Northcap commercial. Eisinga, who has worked on gas station deals for 15 years, said more companies are looking to expand in response. “Gas stations have been making pretty good money. Because of that nobody is looking to sell,” said Eisinga. The broker said he was aware of at least 31 valley gas stations under construction or in development stages. Eisinga added that the valley was fairly densely populated with gas stations compared to other parts of the country, but that the added income of gaming allows stations to sell less gasoline and still thrive. Nevada ranks near the top in terms of gasoline cost. As of Wednesday, the average price of gasoline in Nevada was $2.50, compared to the national average of $2.25, according to AAA’s daily fuel gauge report. The lowest price for gasoline in the valley Wednesday was at an Arco in southwest Las Vegas, where the price for regular fuel was $2.23 a gallon, according to GasBuddy, a Boston-based tech company that operates apps to find the lowest gasoline prices. Murphy USA is based in El Dorado, Arkansas, and has more than 1,300 gas stations across 24 states. Founded as a spinoff of Murphy Oil in 2013, the company has nearly 10,000 employees. The company ranks 258 on the Fortune 500 list, compiled annually by Fortune magazine. Contact Alexander S. Corey at acorey@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0270. Find @acoreynews on Twitter.

Since the company’s announcement last year, several of the corporate giant’s competitors, including Target and TJX, announced similar base minimum wages for their employees. A $10 per hour wage is $2.75 an hour higher than the federal minimum wage. Wal-Mart and its competitors are often criticized for paying their employees low wages and for treating them poorly. Many claim the wage increases are a public relation move and that these companies can afford to pay much more. Even at $10 an hour, these companies' workers would still be paid far less than the typical American. The average hourly earnings of all U.S. workers is $23.23. Wal-Mart and Target have raised wages, others in the retail and service industry continue to pay front line workers $9 and $8 an hour. Some often just pay the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the largest American companies paying their workers very low wages. Millions of workers in the United States are currently earning minimum wage or just a few dollars above. David Cooper, senior analyst at left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute, discussed the difficulties these low-wage workers face with 24/7 Wall St. Visit 24/7 Wall St. for the complete methodology “At $7.25, a minimum wage worker with one child is going to be below the federal poverty line even if they're working full-time, year-round," Cooper said. "There is a federal bill to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. But the reality is that in many parts of the country, you would need more than that minimum wage target in order to have a decent quality of life. In most cities in the U.S., you would probably need at least $15 an hour in order to have a basic decent income.” Cooper explained that because of the nature of the service sector, companies employing these low-paid workers tend to view them as exhaustible resources. This explains the low pay and high turnover that can sometimes reach nearly 100% in a single year. Further, these companies have a high share of part-time workers. Indeed, a massive share of frontline workers in the service industry is employed part time. Of Dollar Tree’s 167,800 employees, about 112,00, or two-thirds, are employed in a part-time capacity. Of the 140,000 workers employed by Kohl’s, 77% are part-time workers. Click ahead to see the companies paying Americans the least. 15. Dollar General © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/    > Ticker: DG > Workforce: 113,400 > Annual revenue: $20.37 billion > CEO: Todd J. Vasos > CEO compensation: $8.72 billion Dollar General is one of several discount retailers on this list. Unlike Wal-Mart, Dollar General stores tend to be smaller, described by the company as small-box locations. They are also numerous with roughly 12,600 stores in almost every state. The vast majority of these stores are in communities that have fewer than 20,000 residents. The company’s core customers, according to its most recent financial report, are low and fixed income households. But to keep prices low, the retailer must also keep its costs down. One way it is doing so appears to be paying some of the nation’s lowest wages. 14. Kohl’s  © Provided by 24/7 Wall St.    > Ticker: KSS > Workforce: 140,000 > Annual revenue: $19.20 billion > CEO: Kevin Mansell > CEO compensation: $8.19 million Department store chain Kohl’s announced in February it will close 18 locations this year, the first time in the company’s history. At the time of the announcement, CEO Kevin Mansell told analysts that the weak comparable sales were partially the consequence of growing store payroll. Mansell is paid more than $8 million annually. According to a 2014 EPI paper, CEO pay and company profits in the United States have risen dramatically in recent decades, even during the financial crisis. 13. Gap © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: GPS > Workforce: 141,000 > Annual revenue: $15.80 billion > CEO: Arthur Peck > CEO compensation: $6.14 million The Gap, Inc., the holding company controlling the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands, is one of the largest companies in the apparel retail industry, which itself is one of the nation’s lowest-paying industries. While CEO Arthur Peck is paid more than $6 million annually, thousands of Gap employees are paid minimum wage. In 2014, Gap raised the hourly wage of 65,000 workers to $10. While the raise was certainly helpful for workers, $10 per hour is still less than half the average hourly wage across all occupations and does not help push Gap off the list of America’s lowest paying companies. 12. Darden Restaurants © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: DRI > Workforce: 150,942 > Annual revenue: $6.76 billion > CEO: Eugene Lee > CEO compensation: $6.14 million Fast-casual dining conglomerate Darden Restaurants employs more than 150,000 employees worldwide at over 1,500 restaurants. Darden owns and operates well-known brands such as Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, and The Capital Grille. The company also owned Red Lobster but sold the chain in May 2014. According to employee reviews posted on Glassdoor, the typical server at Olive Garden makes $4.51 per hour before plus tips, and an average of $19,248 a year after tips. Like several other companies that pay employees well below minimum wage, Darden’s profits have risen. Darden’s net earnings rose from $286.2 million in fiscal 2014 to $709.5 million in fiscal 2015. 11. Macy's © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: M > Workforce: 157,900 > Annual revenue: $27.08 billion > CEO: Terry J. Lundgren > CEO compensation: $11.70 million New York-based department store Macy’s operates more than 800 locations in 45 states and employs 157,900 workers, according to the 2015 annual report. Macy’s front line employees are paid slightly better than those working at some of the food service companies on this list, but their salaries are still only a few dollars above minimum wage. The typical sales associate at Macy’s, by far the most common review listed on Glassdoor, makes just $9.35 per hour. CEO Terry Lundgren, meanwhile, earned $11.7 million in 2015, about 618 times the annual salary of the $18,920 average for a Macy’s retail sales associate. Many of the store’s low wage employees will be earning even less shortly. Macy’s announced in August it would be closing 100 stores around the country. 10. Dollar Tree © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/ dollar-tree-store > Ticker: DLTR > Workforce: 167,800 > Annual revenue: $15.50 billion > CEO: Bob Sasser > CEO compensation: $9.53 million Discount store Dollar Tree has locations in all but two U.S. states, as well as in a number of Canadian provinces. The 60-year old company employs more than 160,000 workers at its nearly 7,900 stores. Dollar Tree cashiers can expect to make just $8.22 an hour, roughly $1 above minimum wage. An assistant manager at Dollar Tree makes an annual salary of $41,466. In contrast, the company's CEO Bob Sasser annual salary of $9.53 million is more than 223 times that figure. In addition to earning close to minimum wage salaries, many Dollar Tree workers likely need to find a second job to make ends meet as 112,500 of the company’s 167,800 workers are part-time employees. 9. Sears Holdings   © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: SHLD > Workforce: 178,000 (U.S.) > Annual revenue: $25.15 billion > CEO: Edward Scott Lampert > CEO compensation: $4.3 million Sears Holdings Corporation is the parent company of the Sears and Kmart brands. Frontline employees at these stores are not paid especially well. The average pay of hundreds of cashier salaries reported to job review website Glassdoor is $8.34 per hour. While cutting labor costs by paying low wages appears to be helping most companies on this list achieve tremendous financial gains, this does not seem to be the case with Sears. Comparable sales have declined each year for over a decade. As a consequence, store closures and layoffs have become routine in recent years. The company’s U.S. workforce of 178,000 is down from 315,000 in 2007. 8. The TJX Companies © Wikimedia Commons   > Ticker: TJX > Workforce: 216,000 > Annual revenue: $30.95 billion > CEO: Ernie L. Herrman > CEO compensation: N/A The TJX Companies, which owns and operates retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, employs 216,000 people. The company announced last year it would increase the minimum wage of workers who had been employed at the company for at least six months to $9 an hour in 2015, and to $10 an hour this year. Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 weeks a year, $10 an hour comes to $20,800 annual wage. As of January 31, CEO Carol Meyrowitz stepped down and was replaced by Ernie Hermann. Before she departed, Meyrowitz received an annual salary of $19.6 million. 7. Starbucks  © Wikimedia Commons Starbucks Employees > Ticker: SBUX > Workforce: 238,000 > Annual revenue: $19.16 billion > CEO: Howard D. Schultz > CEO compensation: $20.09 million As is generally the case in the service industry, wages at Starbucks are some of the lowest in the United States. In addition to their meager paychecks, the substantial number of Starbucks employees working part time also lack of benefits and have low job security. Starbucks employees have also complained of erratic hours, which can make ordinary life planning a challenge. CEO Howard Schultz’s salary of over $20 million is in stark contrast with the low pay of his employees. His compensation is one of the highest even compared with other chief executives. 6. Aramark © Wikimedia Commons   > Ticker: ARMK > Workforce: 265,500 > Annual revenue: $14.33 billion > CEO: Eric Foss > CEO compensation: $21.14 million Philadelphia-based Aramark provides dining services, uniforms, and other food service logistics for corporations and educational institutions. This September, a group of female lunch servers at a public school in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, threatened to strike, citing a substantial gap between their salaries and the salaries of men doing comparable work. Aramark agreed to raise the employees’ salaries by a total of $1.20 over the next three years. As of the end of the most recent fiscal year, Aramark employed 265,000 people worldwide, 110,000 of whom in a part-time capacity. 5. Target © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/   > Ticker: TGT > Workforce: 341,000 > Annual revenue: $73.79 billion > CEO: Brian Cornell > CEO compensation: $16.95 million Target had a very successful 2015 fiscal year. After reporting an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2014, Target reported net income of $3.3 billion in 2015. Based on hundreds of employee reports at Glassdoor.com, the typical cashier at Target makes around $9 an hour. A sales floor team member earns an average $9.19 an hour. However, Target recently announced it would raise its minimum pay to $10. Based on this figure, a Target employee working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year would earn $20,800 annually. Target CEO Brian Cornell made $16.95 million last year. 4. McDonald's © https://www.flickr.com/photos/dave_mcmt/   > Ticker: MCD > Workforce: 420,000 > Annual revenue: $25.41 billion > CEO: Stephen Easterbrook > CEO compensation: $7.91 million Thousands of low-wage workers protested for higher wages outside McDonald’s headquarters last year, one of a string of related demonstrations reported in recent years. The protests are a strong indication that for many employees, including those at McDonald’s, wages are inadequate. Amid flagging sales in recent years, the hamburger chain replaced CEO Don Thompson with Stephen Easterbrook earlier this year. With mounting protests, the company announced a pay raise for its employees, although the move was criticized as a public relations stunt since the increase would only apply to company-owned stores, which only account for around 10% of McDonald’s restaurants. The vast majority of stores are franchises. 3. The Kroger Co. © https://www.flickr.com/photos/fanofretail/    > Ticker: KR > Workforce: 431,000 > Annual revenue: $109.83 billion > CEO: W. Rodney McMullen > CEO compensation: $11.75 million Supermarket chain Kroger employs over 430,000 workers at more than 2,700 stores. Based on hundreds of employee reviews on Glassdoor, the average front-line worker at Kroger locations do not earn much more than the minimum wage -- cashiers earn an average of $8.39 an hour. Working full-time, year round, a cashier earning these wages would make $17,451 annually before taxes. In contrast, company Chairman and CEO W. Rodney McMullen earned $11.75 million last year. Meanwhile, company profits have steadily increased in recent years. Net income of the Cincinnati-based company rose from $2.73 billion in fiscal 2013 to $3.58 billion in fiscal 2015. 2. Yum Brands © Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Yum! Brands Inc. Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg > Ticker: YUM > Workforce: 505,000 > Annual revenue: $13.11 billion > CEO: Greg Creed > CEO compensation: $7.49 million Yum Brands is the owner and operator of fast food chains KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. The vast majority of workers at these fast food chains are part-time, hourly paid employees. Based on salaries reported to Glassdoor, delivery drivers, crew members, shift managers and cooks are paid as little as $8 per hour. Most of Yum Brands restaurants are located in the United States. With success in countries such as China, however, 70% of KFC restaurants are located overseas, where working conditions are often considerably worse than they are for low-paid U.S. employees. 1. Wal-Mart Stores  © https://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartcorporate/    > Ticker: WMT > Workforce: 2.3 million > Annual revenue: $478.61 billion > CEO: C. Douglas McMillon > CEO compensation: $19.81 million C. Douglas McMillon’s annual compensation of nearly $20 million is one of the largest even among U.S. chief executives. Yet McMillon’s salary pales against the wealth accumulated by the Walton Family, two of whom currently serve on Wal-Mart’s board of directors. With a combined worth of more than $140 billion, the Waltons are the wealthiest family in the United States by a wide margin. Meanwhile, Walmart employs the largest force of low wage workers in the world. After four consecutive years of revenue gains, Walmart reported a 0.7% decline in revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Walmart’s latest revenue of $482.13 billion still dwarfs the revenue of any other U.S. company.

Published Oct 12th, 2016 5:24 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas John Furner, Sam’s Club executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, said the biggest lessons the wholesale club might learn from Wal-Mart’s recent acquisition of Jet.com is how to target Millennials and encourage customers to put more in their online baskets. Sam’s Club is a $60 billion retailer but is often left in the shadows of its big brother Wal-Mart Stores. Furner illustrated that point Wednesday (Oct.11) as the keynote speaker of the Bentonville Bella Vista Chamber WalStreet Breakfast held at Sam’s Club Home Office. Furner said last week at the retailer’s investor conference he was talking with an analyst, and answering a question when the analyst spotted Jet.com founder Marc Lore and quickly followed after him. When asked how Lore might work with Sam’s Club, Furner said running Jet and Walmart’s global ecommerce business was enough to keep Lore busy for a while. And while there are exciting technology initiatives at Walmart, it’s really Sam’s Club leading that charge inside the clubs, Furner said. LEAD IN DIGITAL Furner said a top focus for Sam’s Club is to lead in digital. The recently rolled-out Scan & Go in Sam’s Club has the potential to drive more overall sales simply because it’s changing the way people shop the club, he added. Earlier this year Walmart moved to a scanning device in its test of Scan & Go in lieu of using a smartphone application. In Walmart’s Scan & Go test the shopper still has to go to register and scan the device code before leaving the store. Sam’s Club Scan & Go allows a member to scan the item with a phone and then skip the checkout line. “Clubs have always been a great format for stock-up trips, but I am finding it’s very easy to run in and grab one or two items, scan them, go through the door check and be back to my car in five minutes. That is convenience shopping,” Furner said. “Our members love this app, it’s rated 4.5 stars in the app store.” Sam’s Club executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, speaks to suppliers and the local business community in Bentonville on Wednesday (Oct. 11) about the retailer’s game plan. Sam’s Club recently rolled out the Scan & Go service nationally, with the exception of Puerto Rico. SALESFORCE HELP Growing membership is another focus for Sam’s Club. While Sam’s Plus members have been at the front of the retailer’s agenda, Sam’s recently partnered with Salesforce.com to gain business memberships. The Salesforce partnership is a way to help business members automate many of the membership functions from paper-based processes into a more flexible, digital model and enable more integration between physical and digital shopping experiences. Sam’s Club announced in July it is using Sales Cloud as the foundation of its B2B business. This will allow for quicker automation of the wholesale chain to anticipate the needs of its business members, and more quickly remove cumbersome manual processes. Sam’s Club is also looking to connect the dots of its business members across every club by improving more visibility into the business member interactions with the help of Salesforce’s Analytics Cloud. Furner said the Salesforce partnership is part of Sam’s Club efforts to digitally transform the overall business. He said club pickup for online orders is also widely used by business and plus members and this is being built into remodels and new clubs and is available in all the U.S. clubs. He said Sam’s Club also had success with its direct-to-home program that is a subscription based automatic replenishment system. When asked about memberships industrywide being flat or down, while Amazon Prime nearly doubled memberships in recent years, Furner said there is always competition and retail is not soon going to get easier, regardless of what the economy does. He compared the changing retail landscape as a beast. He said Sam’s Club just has to stay out in front and outrun at least one of its competitors to keep from being eaten alive. BETTER MERCHANDISING Furner said the clubs live or die by the merchandise, because if shoppers aren’t compelled to come into a club they won’t bother with a membership. Part of the Sam’s Club’s merchandising efforts has been to decentralize the buying offices. He said the regional buying office in Dallas is open and there are six buyers on the ground. He said they are using the Sam’s Club in Grapevine, Texas, as testing lab for new regional products adding items like frozen quail and more local salsa brands. He said it’s too early to tell what a localization strategy will do for the overall organization, but so far so good. Another area Sam’s Club has been focused is reigning in the number of private labels offered. Over the past 18 months he said Sam’s has downsized from 19 private labels to the Member’s Mark brand which is working on packaging designs that go from “literal to lovable.” He said items that make it into Sam’s Club have to beat on price and value, with no exceptions. Sam’s Club has pushed the bar higher in jewelry, fresh meats and apparel, Furner said. The company is also working with private label wines using the expertise of a buyer with almost 20 years in wine commerce in France. He said Sam’s Club buyers must be experts in their categories because the selection in clubs are narrowed to one or two choices per item so those choices must be right. He was also in favor of more co-branding opportunities with suppliers in certain categories in which he said there has been positive traction with a few products. Furner also said the move away from standardized modular has been a good one. He said Club managers have the expertise to design their own layouts. In taking away the prescribed layout, Sam’s Club has been able to divert resources and people into the ongoing Member’s Mark branding work.

And in a series of highly paid appearances after leaving the State Department, Clinton praised the company’s practices and spoke fondly of its founder in speeches that were kept secret from the public. Wal-Mart, America’s largest private employer, has become a top target of progressives because of its aggressive union-busting and notoriously low wages and lack of benefits. But emails documenting a continued warm relationship between Clinton and the massive retailer are among thousands posted by Wikileaks over the past week from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s gmail account. One emailed document is an 80-page list prepared by Clinton’s own research department, detailing the most potentially damaging quotes from the secret speeches. The last four pages are devoted to Wal-Mart. During a November 2013 speech at an event sponsored by the Canadian pharmacy firm London Drugs, Clinton seemed to suggest that Wal-Mart stores were particularly good for people who lived in the nation’s less cosmopolitan areas. “Those stores — you know, you don’t have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don’t — but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before.” She continued: “So this spirit of community that I think is absolutely essential to the maintenance of our democracy, our freedom, our strength, is alive and well across North America, particularly among young people.” Clinton’s suggestion that Wal-Mart is somehow helping foster community stands in contrast with how the retail giant has devastated local and family businesses as it has expanded across the country. The chain’s use of cheap Chinese-produced products has also sucked money out of local communities and helped expand the U.S. trade deficit. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the “Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013.” The one group that has really benefited from Wal-Mart is the heirs of its late founder, Sam Walton. Today, the Walton family is worth $130 billion. Altogether, they are wealthier than the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Sam Walton’s daughter, Alice Walton, as well as a grandson, Sam Rawlings Walton, gave $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Clinton repeatedly told audiences at her speeches the same story about being appointed to Wal-Mart’s Board of Directors by founder Sam Walton. She told the November 2013 pharmaceutical event that “in the late 1980s, probably about ‘86, he called me one day and he goes, Hillary Clinton, my wife and my daughter think I need a woman on the Board and I can’t think of anybody else. I said, Well, you sure know how to flatter me, don’t you.” She also expressed disappointment that Wal-Mart abandoned its plans to build retail stores throughout India because it wouldn’t be able to meet an Indian government requirement that it buy 30 percent of its products from small and medium-sized Indian businesses. “I think that if India can ever get its regulatory system straightened out, you know, we have gone back and forth on opening up to retailers, large, multinational retailers. Wal-Mart just withdrew and it is a real shame and because one of the things Wal-Mart promised to do was to help set up the supply chain for agricultural products to actually get to the end user consumer,” she said. The hacked emails include a fairly extensive back-and forth about the request Clinton got to pressure Wal-Mart to raise wages. In the spring of 2014, a group of activists, led by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and political scientist Adolph Reed, called on Clinton to ask Wal-Mart to raise wages. The activists pointed to both Clinton’s time on Wal-Mart’s board as well as her history of advocacy for women, and called on her to use her voice for female Wal-Mart employees, whom they noted held the majority of low-wage positions at the chain. Unsure of how to respond, Clinton’s aides reached out to Leslie Dach, who until 2013 was Wal-Mart’s top lobbyist. He counseled them to marginalize Nader: The Intercept reached out to some of the signatories of Nader’s letter to ask if they ever heard back from Clinton’s team. “Nope,” Reed responded in an email. Dach continues to be a close confidant; in 2016, the Clinton campaign tapped him for the role of recruiting Republican support for the campaign.

 Cocaine prices in the US have barely moved in decades — here's how cartels distort the market Christopher Woody Oct. 13, 2016, 9:31 AM 10,316 facebook linkedin twitter email print Workers during an eradication operation at a coca-leaf plantation near San Miguel, southern Putumayo province, Colombia, August 15 2012.REUTERS/Fredy Builes See Also 'Blood, sweat, and tears': What a Trump presidency could mean for the Western Hemisphere 'The agents are bought': A cartel enforcer says US border agents are on his payroll The Palace of Justice siege: 31 years since rebels unleashed Colombia's 'holocaust' Efforts to staunch the flow of cocaine in recent years have focused on the source — ripping coca plants out of the ground or dousing them with herbicide. And attacking cocaine production at the source has yielded some success at the beginning of that supply chain. In 2014, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru — the drug's three biggest producers — destroyed some 300,000 acres of the crop, up from 15,000 in 1994. "When you look back, we've seen that there has been a pretty effective interruption of the supply of coca," Tom Wainwright, the former Economist reporter in Mexico City and author of "Narconomics," told Business Insider earlier this year. But the drag created on the production of the cocaine that's shunted north toward the voracious US market doesn't seem to be reflected in the price of the drug on US streets in recent years. "The price of cocaine in the United States has hardly moved," Wainwright said. "In the past couple of decades it's been about $150 per pure gram, and that's barely budged, so there's a puzzle there." The static nature of cocaine prices can likely be explained by the hold cartels and other traffickers have over the cocaine market at its origins — specifically their ability to dictate prices to producers. Wainwright elaborated: "What's really going on there is that the cartels in parts of South America have what economists call a monopsony, which is like a monopoly of demand for a particular product — they're the main buyers by far." "And what this means is that even when the supply is interrupted or restricted the farmers there aren't able to push up the price in the way that you'd expect, because the cartels there have this kind of Walmart-like grip on the market, which means that they can say, 'Sorry guys, we're the only buyer in this region, the price stays where it is.'" Wainwright explained the Walmart comparison in his book. For farmers and manufacturers, "Their complaint is that Walmart and other big chains have such a big share of the groceries market that they are able more or less to dictate terms to their suppliers." Average prices of cocaine in the US at the retail and distributor level over the past 30 years.US government data "In the same way that a monopolist can dictate prices to its consumers, who have no one else to buy from, a monopsonist can dictate prices to its suppliers, who have no one else to sell to," Wainwright writes. Walmart, one of the world's biggest retailers, and the drug cartels that control the world's cocaine market are vastly different enterprises — most significantly in that Walmart is a legal business operating in accordance with national and local regulations, while cartels are organized-crime groups operating outside the law. But they are both businesses, with similar dynamics. Just as Walmart's suppliers can strain under the low prices that the retailer can dictate, coca farmers are caught between pressure on their crops from authorities and prices dictated by traffickers. "And so the effect of all these interruptions of supply" from eradication efforts, Wainwright said, "are to really squeeze the farmers. It's not hitting the cartels. It's not hitting the consumers in the States or in Europe. The people that it's really damaging are the farmers who grow this stuff." 'The real drugs millionaires are right here in the United States' Coca goes through several stages to become cocaine, with value added at each step. To produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pure cocaine requires about a ton of fresh coca leaf, Wainwright told Business Insider. "It then gets dried out, it weighs a bit less, but that ton of leaf to start with costs only about $400 or $500 in Colombia," he said. Farmers who process that coca leaf into a base paste and then sell that to traffickers can get about $900 a kilo, an Associated Press report earlier this year found. Once that paste is turned into cocaine and shipped north, it can fetch between $10,000 and $20,000 a kilo, depending on where it arrives. In this January 7, 2016, photo, coca paste ready for sale sits in the kitchen of a home in the mountain region of Antioquia, Colombia. Later, at some point along the way, the paste is made into cocaine that is eventually sold on the streets of such places as New York and Amsterdam for many thousands of dollars.AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd "Then, by the time it makes it to dealers, it's worth maybe more like $70,000, $80,000, and by the time they cut it into grams, sometimes dilute it, a pure kilo is worth equivalent of about $150,000, so the markup is gigantic," Wainwright said. The actual price paid by the street-level customer can vary based on location, purity, and other factors. But overall, "You're going from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's why the profits involved in this business are just so sky-high," he added. According to Wainwright, the pressure eradication efforts put on cocaine's source have little impact on the consumer. "Imagine that through eradicating coca plants in Colombia, you managed to double the price coca leaf from, say, $400 to $800," he said. If all that extra cost lands on the US buyer, the price of that pure kilo is only $150,400. "You've increased the cost of the raw material by 100%, and you've only increased the price of final product by less than 1%," Wainwright said. "The economics of the war on drug just don't add up."

Published Oct 12th, 2016 12:41 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. ––––––––––––––––– Rogers-based Pioneer Products recently took bold steps to create a closed-loop business model which included more control of its plastics resin business from start to finish. Pioneer, which sells a 45-gallon wheeled plastic trash can in more than 3,800 stores, purchased resin maker Sable Polymer in Flowery Branch, Ga., earlier this summer for an undisclosed sum. For at least five years Pioneer has been supplying this sustainable trash can to Walmart, contracting out several pieces through the supply chain. But with its recent acquisition of Sable Polymer, Pioneer can control more of the business as well as expand with new products and applications. The sustainable focus of Pioneer is also in line with Walmart’s efforts to sell more earth-friendly products and require sustainable manufacturing processes. Pioneer is one of four sustainable businesses owned by parent Ecoark Holdings (OTC: EARK) which raised $17.4 million with a public offering in July after its acquisition of Magnolia Solar, another one of its portfolio businesses. Former Wal-Mart executive Randy May is the CEO of Ecoark which continues to invest and grow its portfolio of companies. Roshan Weerasinghe, chief operating officer for Pioneer, told Talk Business & Politics Pioneer sought to grow its share of an $8 billion plastics polymer business and the best way to do that as product supplier was to own more of the manufacturing process while working to create a closed loop from source to retail shelf with Pioneer having more touch points along the way. Weerasinghe has a retail background and has been with Pioneer for about two years, prior to that he worked in operations, global sourcing and logistics for Wal-Mart. He said he loved retail but after 18 years he needed change. THE RECYCLING PROCESS Pioneer sources plastic bakery icing buckets and other waste/returns at Walmart U.S. return centers, which is then sent to the Sable Polymer facility and put through a proprietary process to produce resin pellets. Pioneer then contracts with a plastic fabricator who makes the trash cans which Pioneer then sells back to Walmart. Weerasinghe said the fabricator does not wish to be named, but is a Wal-Mart approved U.S. manufacturing site. Weerasinghe said the sorting and culling of source material is a difficult process because not all plastic is the same. He said some includes chemicals that render it unusable for some applications and creates another market of plastic wastes which are sold off. He said plastic water bottles and shopping bags are not the right kind of plastic and not used by Pioneer which focuses on hard plastic resin waste products as its source for making recycled pellets. As Pioneer sells the trash cans back to Walmart U.S. the loop is then closed. Weerasinghe said having just one product at Walmart or in retail is not cost effective so the company expanded the R&D team in the Sable facility to look for niche products that could be made from the resin it creates and then sold back into retail. Weerasinghe said much of retail is moving online with Walmart and its other retail customers. That has left Pioneer looking for ways to expand its overall business beyond just the retail application. The acquisition of Sable Polymer has made that possible, he added. BEYOND RETAIL SUPPLIER He said acquiring Sable allows the company to be aggressive with costs. Weerasinghe said recycled resin has virtually the same prices as virgin resin, even though it’s a sustainable product. So the company is exploring ways to improve margins and offer a non-commoditized resin product. He said a new process and material source has allowed the company to develop a milky white resin pellet, in contrast to the black pellets that are most common. He refers to this market as the “natural” pellets and said because it’s white there are more color control possibilities for the end products than with the blackish pellets. Pioneer is sourcing the natural pellet material from a contact lens case manufacturer in Puerto Rico. He said the plastic used has been densified and has very few chemicals – aka, sterile grade. Weerasinghe said Pioneer plans to shift about 1 million pounds of production per month into this natural grade. He said another 2 million pounds a month are made into the traditional black resin pellets. “We want to be a leader who is pushing for this use of natural polymer because there are more applications for the white pellets,” he said. The company is working with the automotive industry that is using the natural pellet in its industrial applications that require light testing. He said the move into natural pellets will also help the company diversify its business away from largely retail applications. The Sable operation also can use a densification process that takes the hard plastic wastes and turns it into a popcorn-like substance that can be made into a plastic-like fabric widely used in the medical field. He said disposable medical gowns are made out of this type of material that has a plastic component. Pioneer Products also has a brokerage arm that helps to rep other suppliers into Walmart and Sam’s Club. Weerasinghe said the company represented three new products for clients at Wal-Mart’s Open Call in July. He said two of the products were accepted in and are now going through the process of getting on the shelf which can take nearly a year. He declined to share the product names but did say they are in paint and food categories. The other product was not accepted in store, but was given the online option which the retailer made to nearly all of the Open Call products this year. Weerasinghe said because Pioneer is a supplier the company knows its way around Wal-Mart from the supplier’s view and that’s been advantageous for its clients. He said the brokerage business is just another way Pioneer is diversifying its business, given that trash cans aren’t items people need to buy every week or month.

 Walmart, the country's largest private employer, just hiked its minimum wage for entry-level managers Rachel Gillett and Reuters Oct. 12, 2016, 1:02 PM 2,181 facebook linkedin twitter email print David McNew/Getty Images President Obama's new overtime rule, which was approved in May, hasn't gone into effect yet, but we're already seeing some consequences. Walmart, the country's largest private employer, has raised salaries for entry-level managers ahead of the rule change, set to take effect December 1, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees. Walmart raised salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. Joe Raedle/Getty Images "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Walmart employs 1.5 million workers in the US, which includes store staff, store management, and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Walmart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99% of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout, and better service. Earlier this year, Walmart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its US stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the US economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality, and restaurants. While the Obama administration said the proposal will extend overtime pay to nearly 5 million American workers within the first year of its implementation, others have argued this number is a conservative estimate and put the number of affected US workers closer to 12.5 million, which is how many workers earn salaries between the old threshold of $23,606 and the new threshold of $47,476. Last month, officials from 21 US states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. REUTERS/Rick Wilking But advocates of the rule change argue that millions of Americans will have their rights improved. Because the salary threshold has been so low, explained Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of nonprofit think tank the Economic Policy Institute, during a press conference in May, employers have been able to render people exempt who shouldn't be by, for example, treating low-level assistant store managers or frontline store managers as executives. Arguably, entry-level managers would benefit from the new overtime rule either by receiving time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked over 40 in a week, having their hours scaled back to 40 hours a week while still taking home the same pay, or, as in the case of Walmart's entry-level managers, getting a raise to put them above the threshold. Eisenbrey also said that 100,000 more US workers would benefit, as the overtime work will likely be shifted to either new employees or part-time employees who would not be working overtime. In fact, a study by Oxford Economics found that if the salary threshold were raised even to $808 a week, 76,000 part-time workers would be hired to fill the labor needs of businesses. Only 7% of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62% in 1975, according to the Department of Labor. Eisenbrey said the new overtime rule would bring that coverage closer to 23%. Advocates also argue that the rule change makes things easier for businesses. "It is going to be so much clearer now for employers that they have to pay people under this salary threshold regardless of what their duties are," Eisenbrey said.

Dogs sniff out invasive species of mussel in Montana After opening bookstores last year, the online retail giant now wants to expand by launching its own grocery stores. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 12, 2016 Save for later Saved A woman talks to a driver in an Amazon Fresh delivery van in Los Angeles, California, on June 14, 2013. Amazon is planning to expand the store-brand products it sells to new categories including food and household products, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Amazon is often seen as the disruptor, the company that drove retail sales online and sent brick-and-mortar stores scrambling to innovate. But now there are reports that the e-commerce giant is venturing into the traditional market of grocery shopping – and doing it the old way, by opening physical stores. According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon plans to open convenience stores that sell perishable goods such as milk and produce and drive-in pickups for customers who placed their orders online. The company is even developing license-plate reading technology to speed up grocery pickups.  Amazon's project will bring it head to head in competition with Wal-Mart, which is also in the midst of driving up its online sales and offering drive-by pickups for online orders. Competition for grocery sales can be crucial since restocking home refrigerators creates a perpetual market for groceries, and more consumers may be choosing to do so online. Recommended: 'The Everything Store': 5 behind-the-scenes stories about Amazon Despite the similarities in its online strategies, the two competitors have one crucial difference: Wal-Mart, which already has a strong physical presence, is embracing digital shopping to catch up with the times, while Amazon, with its online dominance, is recognizing the values of physical stores. 'The Everything Store': 5 behind-the-scenes stories about Amazon Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Their strategies may be specific to the food and beverage industry: customers have traditionally been wary of letting others pick their meat and milk, but, at the same time, seek convenience in grocery shopping – such as a speedy pickup on the way home from work. The ideal situation may be having both online and in-store options, although as people become more comfortable with online purchases, the tide may turn in favor of Amazon’s online strategy. "The U.S. food and beverage grocery market has reached a tipping point, in our view," Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge said in an industry report this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Blackledge estimated that as consumers become more comfortable with purchasing groceries online, Amazon may become the seventh-largest food and beverage retailer by 2021.  Amazon's project, known internally as Project Como, is not its first venture in the food and beverage market. Amazon Fresh, a service that delivers fresh groceries for an annual fee, was launched and expanded to several cities in 2013. Wal-Mart currently holds the biggest market share in grocery sales. According to CNBC, it has rolled out its online grocery business and drive-in services to 80 markets and 500 stores. By the end of this year, it expects to be in 100 markets and 600 stores. "We're going to be really focused on winning in fresh and consumables over the next couple years," Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce, told The Wall Street Journal. In August, Wal-Mart bought Jet.com, an e-commerce discount store that specializes in offering deals. Online growth for Wal-Mart had been slow, and it hoped that with the acquisition of Jet, it would  obtain valuable technology, pricing software and warehouses.  Other traditional grocery stores and startups are also vying for market share, including Kroger, with its ClickList program that offers curbside pickups and home deliveries. "Consumers appear to favor services and experiences over merchandise," the National Retail Foundation wrote in June, citing Bryan Gildenberg, the chief knowledge officer of Kantar Retail, as saying the group's research indicates that by 2020, customers will spend $2 on services for every $1 on "stuff." Will Amazon’s stores win out its competitors? It might be tough, as grocery giants like Wal-Mart, Kroger, and Giant already have existing infrastructure to deal with the challenges of storing fresh goods, establishing delivery systems, and space for pickups. As Sarah Halzack with The Washington Post writes, "Grocery is something of the final frontier of the online shopping revolution.... [A]nd retailers have had a hard time figuring out a durable business model, since the grocery world already operates on razor-thin profit margins." But Amazon already has a notorious ability to break into new markets and embrace change. It did so by boosting online book sales – and then opening a brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle last year.

Cecilia Rivas said that she woke Sunday morning with labor pains, but figured it would be hours before her contractions became serious. So she went to Walmart alone for some last-minute items, leaving her husband at home with their two children.  'I was really feeling well - I didn't think I was going to have the baby,' she told Fox 13.  Scroll down for video  'I didn't think I was going to have the baby': Cecilia Rivas woke up Sunday with labor pains but decided to go shopping- and then gave birth in Walmart  Rivas gave birth to a son, Matias, who is being kept at Mountain View Hospital under observation However, while she was in the aisles shopping, the pains became more severe. 'So while I was doing that I started getting worse and then I went to pay and I got even worse and all of the sudden I broke water and I felt the head of the baby right then and there,' Rivas said.  Few people around spoke English, but it was clear she was in labor. They grabbed towels from the aisles and held up sheets for privacy. By some miracle, the customer behind Rivas not only spoke Spanish, but was a former EMT. 'And the lady that was right behind me, the one that spoke Spanish, was like an angel to me because she was the one that helped me bring the baby out,' Rivas said. This is the third child for Rivas and her husband. She said she had no idea she would go into labor so quickly when she decided to go pick up some things from Walmart  Rivas was shopping alone in Walmart in Payson, Utah when she unexpectedly gave birth Ravas gave birth to a son, Matias, who is being kept at Mountain View Hospital under observation.   Payson Fire Department spokesman Terry Reilly says it was not the woman's first pregnancy and things 'progressed pretty rapidly.' 'The baby was delivered right there in the checkout line,' Reilly told The Daily Herald.  Employees and other customers had to help deliver the bundle, which eagerly came out into the world in the store before emergency crews arrived. In 2000's Where the Heart Is, Natalie Portman gives birth to a baby in a Tennessee Walmart, much like the woman in Utah who welcomed her bundle of joy RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon, Walmart and Target pull offensive 'Tranny Granny'... Is Walmart building self-driving shopping carts? Patent... Share this article Share Customers called 911, but the impatient baby was in the Walmart aisle before EMS, according to KSL. Apparently everyone stayed very 'calm,' according to Reilly.  The mother and baby were taken to Mountain View Hospital in Payson, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Both are reportedly doing fine. In the movie Where the Heart Is, which was based on the novel of the same name, a 17-year-old girl (played by Natalie Portman) stops into a Walmart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma with her boyfriend, who abandons her in the store with little money. The girl, who is seven months pregnant, secretly starts living in the behemoth store and eventually has her baby, Americus, in aisle five of the Walmart, becoming a local celebrity.  Read more: New moms give birth on I-80 and in Payson Wal-Mart checkout line | KSL.com Healthy baby delivered in Payson Walmart checkout line | Payson News | heraldextra.com Payson woman talks about giving birth to child in Walmart checkout line | fox13now.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

BROWN Police man the front of a Walmart store amid heightened Black Friday security in Paramount, California on November 23, 2012 as shoppers arrive and Walmart employees and their supoorters protested nearby. The US retail giant Walmart admitted on November 27 some of its products were made at the Bangladesh garment factory that burnt down at the weekend killing 110 workers, as anger grows over lax safety standards. The fire broke out at the ground-floor warehouse of the multi-storey Tazreen Fashions factory 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Dhaka on the night of November 24, trapping hundreds of workers on the upper upper floors, police said. AFP PHOTO / Frederic J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) If Walmart (WMT) has its way, it might just clean up in the grocery aisle. The massive retailer, which is recreating itself under CEO Doug McMillon, has struggled in recent years with everything from customer complaints about poor service to pressure from labor activists to raise wages. But Walmart’s new curbside grocery pickup is earning praise from some customers, who, ironically, don’t have to step inside one of its stores to use the service. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 476.60 +8.00 +1.71% The retailer, which started testing the service last year, said it will offer it in 600 locations by the end of October. The idea is simple: Order groceries through Walmart’s grocery app or on its website, and then drive to your local Walmart, where employees deliver the groceries to your car. “Walmart grocery pickup without ever going inside is maybe the greatest invention EVER!!!!” one woman wrote on Facebook. Unlike some rival grocery chains, Walmart isn’t charging extra for the service. So far, some customers are expressing enthusiasm about the idea on social media, and Walmart says it’s gaining new shoppers through word-of-mouth recommendations. The company plans to add another 500 stores to the pickup program, according to a Walmart spokesman. So far, it’s offered in a range of small and large cities, ranging from Ogden, Utah, to Atlanta. Walmart may soon face increased competition, however. Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly developing small brick-and-mortar grocery stores that would also allow consumers to order online and use curbside pickup, according to The Wall Street Journal. (The Seattle-based e-commerce giant declined to confirm the report, stating, “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.”) Walmart’s service is geared toward millennial parents with small children. After all, Walmart Chief Operating Officer Michael Bender has written on the company’s blog that finding time to shop is often a problem for its customers. “This new, easy shopping experience is an innovation that’s helpful for anyone with a busy schedule -- particularly moms with small children,” he wrote. “They can shop online and choose the pickup time that works for them, and they never have to unbuckle anyone’s seat belt.” Of course, grocery pickup may also appeal to other demographics who have difficulty getting inside stores, such as people with disabilities or seniors with limited mobility. Despite its early positive reception, the real test for Walmart may be whether it can turn a profit on the service, which may be difficult given the grocery industry’s thin margins. Plus, the additional labor that might be needed for packing and bringing bags to curbside cars could only heighten Walmart’s challenge. Some consumers are hesitant to order groceries online because of concern that the produce wouldn’t be as fresh as they would have picked themselves, for example. But Walmart’s personal shoppers are trained on how to judge produce and meat for quality, a company executive told The Washington Post. The company is adding staff to work as personal shoppers, although it’s not disclosing how that might affect margins or labor costs. “These are dedicated personal shoppers,” said Ravi Jariwala, senior director of Walmart’s media relations. “They aren’t other associates from other part of the store. That’s important, because they execute the service from end-to-end.” Unlike Amazon’s grocery delivery service, Walmart has a built-in advantage: Its 3,500 supercenters are located all across the U.S. About 70 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a Walmart, which means its locations are “already in place” to create the curbside delivery service, COO Bender wrote. Rival services charge additional fees for the delivery, in some cases because they don’t have existing infrastructure and need to pay for new warehouses and staff. Amazon’s Fresh delivery service, for instance, charges $14.99 per month to deliver groceries and restaurant dishes. Still, Walmart faces a number of hurdles. For one, consumers aren’t all that crazy about its groceries. The retailer scored dead last among the country’s top supermarkets and among health and personal care stores in a survey published earlier this year by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.  Second, rival grocers are offering similar programs. Wegmans, the cult supermarket that earned the ACSI top ranking this year, has a personal shopping app for customers who want curbside pickup, although it does cost $5.95 per order. Kroger (KR) and Giant are among other chains that offer similar services. And lastly, online grocery shopping isn’t exactly catching on like sliced bread. Ordering groceries online increased only half a percentage point this year, reaching just 4.5 percent of consumers in 2016, according to an analysis from TABS Analytics. Walmart was flat in both 2015 and 2016, while Amazon gained online grocery customers this year, the study found. “This is not a sustainable business model,” said TABS Analytics CEO Kurt Jetta in a statement about the study. “Food companies and grocers need to figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the online channel before they continue to invest any further in it.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CBS News 6 tips to save on Halloween candy CBS News CBS News View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Published Oct 12th, 2016 8:07 am staff2@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: Each Wednesday, Talk Business & Politics provides “Health Beat,” a round-up health-related topics. ––––––––––––––– WALMART TO OFFER FREE HEALTH CHECK-UPS ON SATURDAY For a four-hour period on Saturday, Oct. 15, Walmart will offer access to free health screenings, education, services and products at retail stores nationwide. Based on the impact of its nationwide health fair held last year, Walmart said it is again hosting the largest single-day health event in the nation with free health screenings expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of people, some of whom may be taking an active role in their health for the first time. The newly named Walmart Wellness Day will take place from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. The event will provide free blood glucose, blood pressure, vision screenings (where available), product samples and information on health insurance options. Additionally, more than 10,000 of Walmart’s licensed pharmacists will offer immunizations in all Walmart pharmacies in the U.S. Also, Walmart is working with DirectHealth.com for the third straight year to help customers identify their health insurance needs, compare coverage options and enroll in plans. The customer open enrollment program for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans – Healthcare Begins Here – will be available Oct. 15, 2016 through Jan. 31, 2017 in more than 2,300 Walmart stores, online and via phone. HHS ENHANCES NATION’S HEALTH PREPAREDNESS FOR RADIOLOGICAL THREATS As a part of its mission to help protect Americans’ health following a national radiological disaster, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is purchasing two medical products to treat injuries to bone marrow in victims of radiological or nuclear incidents. The two products, called colony stimulating factors, stimulate bone marrow to produce blood cells including neutrophils that reduce the body’s risk of developing an infection and decrease risk of death from acute radiation syndrome. Bone marrow is essential to producing blood. Infections often occur after exposure to high doses of radiation. These types of products are used commonly to reduce the risk of infection in patients with cancer. ASPR’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is purchasing the first of these two leukocyte growth factor products, called Neulasta, from Amgen USA under a $37.7 million agreement. BARDA will purchase the second product, called Leukine, from French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi-Aventis for $37.6 million. Neulasta is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults and children exposed to high levels of radiation that damage bone marrow. BARDA will purchase both products using funding and authority provided through the Project BioShield Act of 2004. AMERIGROUP TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE IN TENNESSEE TO REACH DOCTORS THROUGH REMOTE ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES Members of Amerigroup’s healthcare plans in Tennessee will have coverage for reaching doctors through remote access technologies starting in 2017. Members can contact a U.S.-based, board-certified network doctor on a secure connection over the Internet via a smart phone, tablet or computer. The plans will be sold during Medicare’s Annual Election period, which begins Oct 15 and continues through Dec. 7 with an effective Jan. 1, 2017, and will feature the ability to reach doctors for medical and behavioral health services through remote access technologies at $0 copay. Doctors will be able send prescriptions if needed directly to a member’s pharmacy of choice where they may be paid by the member’s MA or Medicare prescription drug plan. A summary of each visit is created and can be forwarded to the patient’s primary care doctor with their permission, supporting continuity of care and collaboration among providers.

She’s not Hannah Montana, but she’s also not a wild and crazy girl who will do anything for attention, she says. It’s been a struggle to discover who she is, and to portray that to the world, because she said she never felt comfortable fitting into any “boxes,” and it felt like everyone wanted to categorize her. She feels that she, along with most humans, is beyond categorization, according to Yahoo. She is actually balanced and introspective, she says. Her partying days are over. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” At just 23-years-old, that statement seems like it would come from a much older person, but Cyrus said she’s been in the world of show business her entire life, playing Hannah Montana and selling a line of clothing at Walmart that was branded Hannah Montana. But when Walmart found out that Cyrus smoked marijuana, they let her clothing line go, she said. “It was Walmart or weed. And you see what I did — I chose the weed.” According to Variety, Cyrus had a difficult time making sense of her sexuality because she was raised in a southern, traditional household. “My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and s–t never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand.” [Image by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images] She said it was difficult at the time to identify with anyone, because she didn’t feel like a boy or like a girl, unlike her ultra-feminine mother. Her mother loves all aspects of femininity, but Miley could not relate, even though at the time, the world was trying to make her the poster child for girlhood on the show Hannah Montana. “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I f—–g hated it. My nails look like s–t. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” According to The Daily News, “pansexual” is a term that means you are open to every possibility. Jennifer Bass, communications director at the Kinsey Institute, a prominent research center on human sexuality, says that “calling oneself pansexual is to open yourself up to every human possibility.” [Image by Rob Kim/Getty Images] Miley says she is neutral — neither straight or gay. What she is definitely not neutral about is her feelings for Donald Trump. She says she is a big Bernie Sanders supporter and she says she thought that Donald Trump running for president was just a joke that would not amount to anything big. “This is not a dig. But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate.” Now that he is the candidate, however, and Bernie Sanders is out, she minces no words about people who don’t support Hillary Clinton. “That’s f*****g crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally p*****g me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place.” [Featured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Dream Kardashian Is Already A Social Media Sensation Now Read This: Lil Wayne Dances To Politically Upset Fans At Flog Gnaw After Race Incident Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Amy Schaeffer Tags: Miley Cyrus Bernie Sanders Supporter, Miley Cyrus dislikes Trump, Miley Cyrus pansexual Comments LATEST HEADLINES 2016 College Football Playoff Rankings: Predicting Top 4 Teams After Week 11 Action Reince Priebus Named Chief Of Staff By Donald Trump In Controversial Move NBA Trade Rumors: Shaquille O’Neal Hints Demarcus Cousins on Trading Block ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date Stahl-Trump Interview: Up To Three Million Deportations, Special Prosecutor For Clinton Possible [Video] L.A.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile sells Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone T-Mobile sells Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone October 5, 2016 Alex Wagner 28 Comments Walmart Family Mobile launched as a prepaid mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using T-Mobile’s network way back in 2010. Now, six years later, it’s got a new owner. T-Mobile has confirmed that it’s sold Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone. Terms of the deal weren’t given. Navigating to the Terms & Conditions page on Walmart Family Mobile’s site confirms the deal, too. The second sentence on the page reads “Your agreement for wireless service branded as ‘Walmart Family Mobile Powered by T-Mobile’ is with TracFone Wireless, Inc.” While there’s no mention of GoSmart Mobile in T-Mobile’s confirmation today, Prepaid Phone News recently discovered that GoSmart’s T&C page includes the same sentence: “Your agreement for wireless service branded as “GoSmart Mobile Powered by T-Mobile” is with TracFone Wireless, Inc.” Both Walmart Family Mobile and GoSmart’s T&C pages say that these terms took effect on September 1. These services are still running on T-Mobile’s network, they’ve just been added to TracFone’s roster of brands that also includes StraightTalk, Net10 Wireless, Simple Mobile, and more. TracFone is the largest MVNO in the US, and now it’s getting even larger by adding Walmart Family Mobile, which is said to have around 1.4 million customers.

BreakingData Doubt it, they have been very happy with the metro brand. taron19119 No metro owns 25 percent of t-mobile Sabrina Keyhani NO, T-Mobile owns ALL of Metro PCS! taron19119 That’s not true Mac Nasti It was a reverse merger… I think… T-Mobile( a private company) bought most of Metro(a public company), then merged and become T-Mobile USA(the public company). Andrew Singleton you’re right, but everything Sabrina said is still true. Metro is 100% a T-Mobile USA owned brand. Tanner Robertson T-Mobile USA actually became Tmobile US hence the ticker TMUS :D Sabrina Keyhani Tell me how this isn’t true, exactly? Mr.Bean I guess you haven’t been following the news Walt Didnt t-mobile own gosmart entirely? Sabrina Keyhani No. T-Mobile Inc. US owns Metro PCS acquired 5/1/2013 while T-Mobile simultaneously became an openly traded stock company & Deutsche Telecom is the majority stock holder. Sabrina Keyhani As I stated erroneously above, explain how this is untrue, exactly? Bklynman Some dumbass on my job was telling people that Metro bought out Tmobile, I didn’t say anything,he was one those he thinks he knows everything,I just say to myself ok sure. LoL Sabrina Keyhani I’m going to assume you work for T-Mobile, too? Yeah, not sure why people are questioning who owns what. In my case, like you, I think, you work for the “parent” company (T-Mobile), so, we have no doubts whom the owners are of Metro, but, the same answers are easily, enough discovered with a Google search, as I did, just to make sure the answers were easy to find. Metro holds 25% of TMO stock, whereas, T-MO owns all of Metro PCS. Bklynman No I don’t work for Tmobile. Do you? wright1bby Here is how the deal went down…. The terms of the merger are unusual: technically, MetroPCS is acquiring T-Mobile in a reverse acquisition. MetroPCS will declare a 2-for-1 reverse stock split, pay $1.5 billion to its existing shareholders (a bit over $4 per share), and then buy all of T-Mobile’s capital stock by giving Deutsche Telekom 74 percent of MetroPCS. In the end, Deutsche Telekom winds up the majority owner of MetroPCS Read more: http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/t-mobile-metropcs-merger-explanation/#ixzz4NAsE6WPp The company also chose at that time to quit using the name MetroPCS as the parent company’s name and change it to T-Mobile. This was done in this convoluted way to take advantage of the fact that the “acquiring” company was already public and so the new company would continue to be public as long as MetroPCS was the “buyer”. wright1bby The T-Mobile Metro PCS merger was structured as a Reverse Takeover. It is a bit confusing. The surviving company was technically the already public Metro PCS not the privately controlled T-Mobile. DT was the majority shareholder in the newly merged company (74%) (Metro PCS shareholders received 26% of the shares). The surviving company changed its stock symbol and name from Metro PCS to T-Mobile and thus the publicly traded T-Mobile was born without going through an IPO like is typically required for a company to become public. Metro PCS now only still exists as a T-Mobile brand and does not “own” any of T-Mobile, though the public company that was Metro PCS is now the public company T-Mobile. Clear as mud? Bklynman Yes,this has made it as clear as day!!! LoL! Sabrina Keyhani Yes, I am proud to say that I DO work for T-Mobile. Bklynman Cool,that’s great,hope you do well while working for them,wish you nothing but the best in all areas of your life. Take care. BreakingData Didn’t this occur early last month. I feel like I have already heard about this before. SirStephenH From above. “Both Walmart Family Mobile and GoSmart’s T&C pages say that these terms took effect on September 1.” Ricardo Magallon Tracphone is owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim seems he wants a huge share of American market now too Philip He fail CompUSA. Mr.Bean When you want more, you just can’t get enough Matt I’m honestly surprised T-Mobile did not convert them into MetroPCS customers. Maybe it was cheaper to sell the book of business. René Marquardt So no more buying Walmart Family Mobile phones for less than what T-Mo sells them for and using them with a T-Mo SIM?

The sale price was $8.5 million, yielding a cap rate of 5.33 percent. The transaction represents a record-low cap rate for a fully-leased multi-tenant retail pad over 10,000 square feet in the Inland Empire since 2008, according to CoStar. Hanley Investment Group Executive Vice President Eric Wohl represented the seller, Pacific Development Group of Newport Beach, Calif. Hanley’s Senior Vice President Patrick Kent represented the buyer, SHA Enterprises, Inc. of Irvine, Calif. The retail property is located in San Bernardino County at the Hesperia Marketplace Shopping Center at the hard-corner signalized intersection of Main Street and Escondido Avenue in Hesperia, near the Interstate 15 freeway. Built in 2015, the multi-tenant building is occupied by national and regional tenants including Pieology Pizzeria, The Habit Burger Grill, Firehouse Subs, Yogurtland, Great Clips, Nutrishop and Metro PCS. The Walmart Supercenter-anchored shopping center also includes a 10,000-square-foot Petco. “Utilizing Hanley Investment Group’s weekly strategy meeting, we leveraged our long-standing relationship with Pacific Development Group to connect a motivated 1031 exchange buyer with an off-market listing to fulfill the requirement,” said Wohl. “We were also able to facilitate a new corporate lease with Daniel’s Jewelers prior to closing to bring the property to 100 percent occupancy.” According to Kent, “The buyer closed escrow in 45 days without requiring a financing contingency.” Kent also said that having Walmart and Petco as anchors, the hard-corner, signalized intersection location, proximity to the I-15 freeway, and that 91 percent of the building’s space was occupied by credit tenants were all factors that made this property very appealing to the buyer. Wohl recently completed the sale of a similar Walmart shadow-anchored asset in Ontario, Calif., on behalf of Pacific Development Group. The multi-tenant retail pad sale in Ontario achieved a record-low cap rate and the highest price per square foot for a multi-tenant pad building shadow-anchored by Walmart in California, according to CoStar. “This is the second property that Hanley Investment Group has sold for us within a 30-day period,” said Bob Lewis, partner at Pacific Development Group who handled the sale for the firm. “We were not motivated to sell the property; however, based upon the value they assured us they could achieve, the strength of the buyer that they represented and the success we have had with Hanley Investments in selling our properties, we decided to move forward with the transaction.” “Multi-tenant outparcels to big box retail is a product type that is in very high demand,” said Wohl. “This type of retail asset is a relatively low-risk option for investors due to the high-exposure location, diversity of corporate and regional tenants, and a strong traffic-driving anchor like Walmart. Additionally, investors can typically spread out their risk over multiple tenants versus single-tenant assets.” About Pacific Development Group Founded in 1980, Pacific Development Group and its partners currently own and manage over three million square feet of commercial buildings with approximately 600 tenants with a value in excess of one billion dollars. These properties are located throughout California and consist primarily of major tenant-anchored shopping centers. The company is actively pursuing development opportunities.

Employees at Walmart say register 11 will never be the same. “I think we’ve renamed it register baby – so whenever we call for help on register 11 it will be now register baby,” Haight said. Employees say a woman was shopping with her husband and family on Sunday morning, when she told a manager she wasn’t feeling well. She went to register 11 to pay for her items while that manager called 911 and told the woman not to worry about paying. They could tell she was in labor. “The funny thing is that the customer was down on her knees and she insisted on paying for her merchandise and we’re like you know that’s just not important. You know, we were going to take care of her on it,” Haight said. “…Literally right after she paid for her merchandise, they rolled her over and she began to give birth,” Haight said. Walmart employees and customers helped. They grabbed towels and blankets. Some also held up sheets as the woman delivered a baby boy. “By the time the EMTs got here she had paid for her merchandise and had a baby,” Haight said. One of the responding EMTs said he’s never seen anything like it. After 20 years of working in the field, Terry Reilly, assistant chief with Payson Fire Rescue, said he’s never seen a baby born in such a public place. “She was very calm she did very well — it was her third child so she had experienced childbirth before so I don’t think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart,” Reilly said. He added everyone at the store did a good job. Mom and baby were taken to the hospital in good condition. “We’re happy for mom and for baby and the whole family… I’m sure they’ll have quite the story to tell someday,” Reilly said. Walmart has been in contact with the mother and they say they’re happy to report mom and baby are doing well. “So we’re gonna buy her a whole bunch of goods like diapers and formula, that type stuff when the mother comes in so, and this time we won’t make her pay,” Haight said.

Karol Fitzgerald, 72, of Stanton was sentenced to six months of probation and ordered to take parenting or grandparenting classes after she was convicted Tuesday of a misdemeanor. Kent County District Court Judge Jeffrey O'Hara found Fitzgerald guilty of leaving a child unattended in a vehicle after a short trial. Testimony showed that Fitzgerald went to Walmart at 3999 Alpine Ave. NW about 6 p.m. May 21 to get a prescription filled. Her 2-year-old granddaughter was sleeping, strapped in car seat in the rear seat, when she arrived at the store. Fitzgerald testified she could not carry the child and also couldn't get her to wake up, so she decided to leave the child in the running car. She had an extra set of keys with her and locked her 2009 Dodge Challenger, with the air conditioner going and a window cracked open. The situation quickly caught the attention of Gretchen Behrens, who had been in Walmart with her husband and found the Challenger parked next to their motorcycle. She said the girl appeared to be wearing some type of polar fleece and did not wake up when she tapped on the window and spoke at the child. Grandmother in court after allegedly leaving girl, 2, in hot car at Walmart "I saw her face and she was beet red," Behrens testified. "I thought she was passed out from the heat." The Behrens' waited several minutes, hoping the vehicle owner would return, then called 911. Kent County sheriff's Deputy Anthony Ysquierdo testified he put his fingers inside the cracked window and it seemed warm. He also said the girl's face appeared to be "bright red and sweating" with her hair matted from moisture. Ysquierdo use a tool to break a window and get the girl out. The child was limp and only woke up when he took some of her outer clothing off and put her in the back seat of his cool cruiser. The girl later was checked at DeVos Children's Hospital and released to her mother with no injuries. Ysquierdo soon after found Fitzgerald. He said she initially was upset about someone breaking her window. Testimony showed that Fitzgerald had gone into Walmart only for the prescription, but received a call from someone asking her to get groceries. She ended up spending 40 minutes in the store. Fitzgerald said she never thought the child was in any danger at the time, but acknowledged to the judge Tuesday she made a poor decision. "I wish I could relive that day and do things differently," she said. "And I would tell other people not to do that." O'Hara said he doesn't doubt that Fitzgerald loves her granddaughter, but said other dangers besides the heat -- a car fire or a car thief breaking a window and driving away -- were possibilities. "The court believes she used extremely bad judgment," he said.

REUTERS/Daniel Becerril By Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has raised salaries for entry-level managers before a rule change that extends mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million U.S. workers, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees. Wal-Mart raised salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.

The ‘Wrecking Ball’ singer has made no secret of her fondness for marijuana in recent years, posting several joint-smoking selfies on Instagram and even wearing an onesie with a marijuana leaf pattern on stage. A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Aug 18, 2015 at 3:35pm PDT “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus told Variety. “And you see what I did – I chose weed.” During the interview, Cyrus also discussed her LGBTQ activism, which includes running a nonprofit organisation, Happy Hippie, which aims to reduce youth homelessness, particularly among LGBTQ teenagers. “My empowerment comes from feeling like I have a purpose now,” she explained. “On my tombstone, I didn’t want the ‘Wrecking Ball’ lyrics. I wanted it to be something greater. I’m the only fucking Disney star who would say I’m pro lesbian and gay, before it was OK to say that.” Asked if she got in trouble with Disney for her LGBT activism, Cyrus replied: “I actually didn’t, because a lot of the dudes that work for Disney are gay, so they were very happy to have someone on their side.” During the interview, Cyrus also spoke at length about identifying as pansexual, and shared her thoughts on the sex abuse allegations aimed at her recent director, Woody Allen.

She gave birth at register 11, which has now been dubbed “register baby” by store associates, on Sunday shortly before 7 a.m. “When she went to the register she was in distress, on her knees holding her stomach,” the store’s manager, Dustin Haight, told ABC News about the unusual incident. Despite her labor pains, the store manager said he was surprised that she insisted on paying before having the child. “Just before she went into full labor, she insisted on paying for her merchandise,” he said. “But we weren’t really interested in taking her money at the point, but she insisted. It wasn’t like she was like, ‘Ok, let’s get this baby out and I’ll pay,’ she paid and then had the baby. You can’t make that up. It was pretty funny.” “She was very calm. She did very well,” Terry Reilly, assistant chief with Payson Fire Rescue, told FOX affiliate KSTU. “It was her third child so she had experienced childbirth before so I don’t think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart.” The mother and child were taken to Mountain View Hospital in Payson where “They are doing well,” the hospital’s communications director, Nate Black, told ABC News. The Walmart manager said the exciting occurrence has helped boost moral for his employees. “A lot of crazy things happen at Walmart but not a lot of babies being born,” Haight said. “It’s kind of good for my associates and their moral, too. We’re going to do a grand opening this month so it puts a nice little christening on that. We’ve done a lot of remodeling so we have a little ceremony coming up and this is a nice touch.” The Walmart employees have spoken with the mom of three, the store manager said, since the unexpected store delivery. “We have been in touch with the young lady. We’re going to have her back on Friday for some gifts,” Haight said. “We have a whole list of things. We’re going to buy her some baby supplies like diapers and formula, clothes and a birthday cake.” They are now hoping they have a new little customer for life. “Now she’s got a story she can share with us forever,” Haight said of the mom and what he believes is her new baby boy. “We’re pretty excited. Hopefully we’ll be part of his life forever.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Reuters 2:22 Beauty blogger Nura Afia is CoverGirl's new brand ambassador USA TODAY 0:38 UP NEXT On the latest season of NBC’s “The Voice,” Miley Cyrus has reinvented herself from a twerking pop star to a mama-hen mentor. “I cry all the time,” Cyrus says about having to axe members of her team during the show’s elimination rounds. Behind the scenes, she dispenses copies of the self-help book “The Untethered Soul” to her contestants, trying to calm them down before live performances. On camera, she showcases an eclectic style — like an outfit covered in paper flowers — meant to counteract any last-minute jitters. “I think it makes the contestants feel safer,” says Cyrus of her colorful wardrobe. “When I turn around, people laugh and feel lighthearted. I think they get to see that side of me.” For many years, Cyrus had a different public persona. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” © Provided by Variety It’s hard to keep a straight face when Cyrus uses that line — she’s only 23. Then again, she’s been on television since grade school. At 11, Cyrus was cast as the squeaky-clean face of Disney Channel’s “Hannah Montana,” which made her the Hayley Mills of her generation. The role brought intense tabloid scrutiny, particularly as she tried to grow up. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” In 2013, the Miley media circus reached a tipping point at the VMAs, where she gyrated alongside a row of teddy bears. She insists that the moment was misunderstood. “That was a joke,” she says. Cyrus has taken a U-turn since then. Her new career path revolves around her foundation: Happy Hippie, dedicated to supporting at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. “I am only doing ‘The Voice’ because that helps Happy Hippie,” Cyrus says about engaging the show’s audience to promote her cause. Cyrus has headlined such films as “The Last Song” and “Bolt,” but she’s ambivalent about making movies now. “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” She almost turned down the Woody Allen TV series “Crisis in Six Scenes” but was eventually won over by the role — playing a 1960s activist. Over a vegan lunch in Los Angeles, Cyrus talked about what drives her, recalled how she struggled with her pansexual identity as a teenager (she’s currently dating Liam Hemsworth), and shared her thoughts on the election. You just filled in as host of Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show. I had to introduce Sarah Jessica Parker, and she asked me if I had any friends that are voting for Donald Trump. I was like, “Do you think I have friends that would vote for Donald Trump. Come on!

But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate. Were you always a Hillary Clinton supporter? I was a really big Bernie supporter. What do you say to Bernie supporters who still won’t vote for Hillary? That’s ----ing crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally pi**ing me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place. Where did your sense of activism come from? I think I just felt so stupid. I felt like what I was doing didn’t have value, because being a pop star was really silly when people are homeless and hungry. In 2013, when I did the VMAs, it became the biggest story in the world. I never expected that to happen. I just did my own thing. I went out there dressed as a teddy bear, danced with teddy bears, never thought about the world thinking that was going to be a bad thing. Did the experience make you feel bad about yourself? It was making me feel like I was living a dumb life — like I should just pick another job. I didn’t understand my power at that point. People listen because of who I am, so instead of being embarrassed, I should say: “---k yeah, I got the microphone.” How did you become involved with the LGBTQ community? My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word “bisexual,” because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my n*pple pasties and ---t never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand. Did you talk to them about how you felt? Yeah. My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I -----ng hated it. My nails look like s---. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” When did you first identity as pansexual? I think when I figured out what it was. I went to the LGBTQ center here in L.A., and I started hearing these stories. I saw one human in particular who didn’t identify as male or female. Looking at them, they were both: beautiful and sexy and tough but vulnerable and feminine but masculine. And I related to that person more than I related to anyone in my life. Even though I may seem very different, people may not see me as neutral as I feel. But I feel very neutral. I think that was the first gender-neutral person I’d ever met. Once I understood my gender more, which was unassigned, then I understood my sexuality more. I was like, “Oh — that’s why I don’t feel straight and I don’t feel gay. It’s because I’m not.” Why do you think inequality still exists for women in Hollywood? A lot of it could be changed if we had a female president. That would give us a subconscious boost. I think people will have to realize they’re looking really dated. For example, there’s a show called “Supergirl.” I think having a show with a gender attached to it is weird. One, it’s a woman on that ----ing billboard — it’s not a little girl. Two, what if you’re a little boy who wants to be a girl so bad that this makes you feel bad? I think having a title like “Supergirl” doesn’t give the power that people think it does. Where does your power come from? My empowerment comes from feeling like I have a purpose now. On my tombstone, I didn’t want the “Wrecking Ball” lyrics. I wanted it to be something greater. I’m the only ----ing Disney star who would say I’m pro lesbian and gay, before it was OK to say that. Did you get in trouble? I actually didn’t, because a lot of the dudes that work for Disney are gay, so they were very happy to have someone on their side. You’re a mentor on “The Voice.” Do you think you’ll do more seasons? I don’t know. I definitely would like to if it made sense. I haven’t done the live shows yet. I want to see how that feels. They might be a lot more pressure. Do you not like live TV? I don’t mind the live TV as much as I do that America gets to vote when it comes to “The Voice,” and America did vote for Donald Trump to be the candidate. I actually told my team they can be the Bernie Sanders of “The Voice.” How often do you cry on the show? When I have to kick them off. It’s a nightmare. For a non-confrontational person, it’s the worst gig ever. How did you get cast in the Woody Allen TV series? Were you a fan of his work? I am. I had moved, and the only thing that I brought into my new house was a picture of Woody Allen. My first night I slept in my new house, [my manager] called and said, “Woody wants you to fly to New York.” I loved working with Woody. You do like two takes. He just wants to go home and have dinner with his wife. One night it was 5:30, and the camera operator wanted to do another take. He goes, “I can’t dedicate my entire life to making movies.” Many people are now having a conversation about whether it’s possible to separate the art from the artist. Were you aware of the sexual-abuse allegations made by Dylan Farrow against her dad, and if so, did that give you pause? I live a similar life to Woody — I live a public life. Until I know someone and I know their story, I never really judge anyone. That’s kind of how I went into it. From the way I saw him with his family, I never saw him be anything but an incredible person and a really great dad. People might slam me for saying that. I’m sure it was a hard time for that family. My family has been through hard things, and I think everyone’s suffering is different.  What do your parents think about your work now? On “The Voice,” this young girl started crying when she left, because I’m the reason she came out. My mom started crying. She was like, “I’m so sorry about the way I was when you were that age and coming out.” She never understood me until she saw that girl who couldn’t be herself. It was very cool.  The latest pics from 'The Voice':  Latest photos from 'The Voice' Go to MSN Home More in Music Leonard Cohen dies at 82 Billboard Leonard Cohen: Career in pictures ICYMI: The Week in Music 8 Things You Didn't Know About Sia Metrolyrics New and upcoming album releases Boone sings 'the witch is dead' after Trump win Associated Press AdChoices Up Next Musicians who served AdChoices More from Variety Chinese Metals Firm Xinke Buys Voltage Pictures for $345 Million Variety Leonard Cohen was the Natural Born King of Movie Soundtracks Variety John Oliver Urges Vigilance Against Trump, Sounds Alarm About Fake News and Declares ‘F— 2016’ Variety ‘CHiPs,’ ‘Future Man,’ ‘Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD’ Win California Location Awards Variety Variety View the full site AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter MSN Music

Employees at Walmart say register 11 will never be the same. “I think we’ve renamed it register baby - so whenever we call for help on register 11 it will be now register baby,” Haight said. Employees say a woman was shopping with her husband and family on Sunday morning, when she told a manager she wasn't feeling well.  She went to register 11 to pay for her items while that manager called 911 and told the woman not to worry about paying. They could tell she was in labor. “The funny thing is that the customer was down on her knees and she insisted on paying for her merchandise and we’re like you know that’s just not important. You know, we were going to take care of her on it,” Haight said. “…Literally right after she paid for her merchandise, they rolled her over and she began to give birth,” Haight said. Walmart employees and customers helped. They grabbed towels and blankets. Some also held up sheets as the woman delivered a baby boy. “By the time the EMTs got here she had paid for her merchandise and had a baby,” Haight said. One of the responding EMTs said he’s never seen anything like it. After 20 years of working in the field, Terry Reilly, assistant chief with Payson Fire Rescue, said he’s never seen a baby born in such a public place. “She was very calm she did very well -- it was her third child so she had experienced childbirth before so I don’t think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart,” Reilly said. He added everyone at the store did a good job. Mom and baby were taken to the hospital in good condition. “We’re happy for mom and for baby and the whole family… I’m sure they’ll have quite the story to tell someday,” Reilly said. Walmart has been in contact with the mother and they say they’re happy to report mom and baby are doing well. “So we’re gonna buy her a whole bunch of goods like diapers and formula, that type stuff when the mother comes in so, and this time we won’t make her pay,” Haight said.

Police: Permit carrier stops assault TIMES STAFF REPORT 6:12 a.m. CDT October 12, 2016 Philip Keys (Photo: Stearns County Jail) A 22-year-old man with a permit to carry stopped a possible assault in a Wal-Mart parking lot on Wednesday, according to the St. Cloud Police Department. Officers were dispatched to an assault at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday at the Wal-Mart on Second Street South in St. Cloud, according to police. Officers were told a 22-year-old man and 22-year-old woman were walking to their car in the parking lot when they were approached by a man who would later be identified as Philip Keys, 30, of St. Cloud. Keys was dragging a baseball bat and asked them if they had ever been hit on the head by one. At that point the two victims began to walk away, but the report indicates Keys approached them and held the bat as though he was going to attack.  The male victim holds a permit to carry and was carrying at the time, police said. The male victim pointed the handgun at the suspect and told him to drop the bat. Keys dropped the bat and laid down on the ground before getting up and walking away. No shots were fired and neither of the victims were injured, police said. Officers arriving later to the scene located Keys and took him into custody. Keys is currently being held in the Stearns County Jail and could be charged with second-degree assault.

Workers at the Payson Walmart said the woman was in line with her husband at register 11 Sunday morning when she started experiencing stomach pain and asked a manager to call 911. "The funny thing is that the customer was down on her knees and she insisted on paying for her merchandise and we're like, 'You know that's just not important.' You know, we were going to take care of her on it," store manager Dustin Haight told KSTU-TV. "Literally right after she paid for her merchandise, they rolled her over and she began to give birth," Haight said. Walmart employees and customers helped the woman with the delivery, which was completed before EMTs arrived on the scene. "By the time the EMTs got here she had paid for her merchandise and had a baby," Haight said. "In about 15 minutes we went from having a little bit of stomach problem to delivering a baby." The manager said the experience is one employees will never forget. "I think we've renamed it register baby -- so whenever we call for help on register 11 it will be now register baby," Haight said. He said the store is eager to help the family. "So we're gonna buy her a whole bunch of goods like diapers and formula, that type stuff when the mother comes in so, and this time we won't make her pay," Haight said Like Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com   Related UPI Stories Utah dad crowdfunds $39.95 to pay hospital's extra 'skin to skin' charge after birth Mother fulfills 4-year-old's birthday cake request: a cow giving birth Woman gives birth on flight from Dubai to the Philippines Comments Latest Headlines U.K. Christmas tree left half-decorated after tinsel deemed 'too heavy' 2 days ago LEICESTER, England, Nov. 11 (UPI) -- Residents of the English city of Leicester have criticized a city center Christmas tree that has been left unfinished as "heavy tinsel" caused stress on the branches.

The Seattle company aims to build small brick-and-mortar stores that would sell produce, milk, meats and other perishable items that customers can take home, these people say. Primarily using their mobile phones or, possibly, touch screens around the store, customers could also order peanut butter, cereal and other goods with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Morgan Stanley MS ▲ 38.49 +0.47 +1.24% For customers seeking a quicker checkout, Amazon will soon begin rolling out designated drive-in locations where online grocery orders will be brought to the car, the people said. The company is developing license-plate reading technology to speed wait times. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. The grocery stores, known internally as Project Como, are for now slated exclusively for customers of its Fresh subscription service, which promises same-day food delivery at set times, the people said. Last week, Amazon dropped its $299 annual price for Fresh and instituted a $15 monthly fee, available to members of its $99 Prime delivery service. The new stores are designed to capture the large share of people who prefer to pick out their produce or bring home their groceries on the way from work. Amazon aims to compete more directly with grocery discounters, as well as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has recently been expanding its own pickup sites. Groceries account for about a fifth of consumer spending, but online grocery purchases make up only about 2% of U.S. grocery sales, according to Morgan Stanley Research. They estimate the online grocery market could more than double to over $42 billion this year. Grocery sales may be crucial to the company’s growth because Americans restock their refrigerators each week, and that could provide opportunities to sell more profitable items alongside orange juice. U.S. households average more than one-and-a-half grocery store visits a week, racking up $107 in goods, according to the Food Marketing Institute. That is roughly $5,500 a year, more than double the $2,500 Amazon Prime members spend annually with the web retailer and 10 times what nonmembers spend, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. Groceries would represent the latest effort by Amazon to upend a new market to become a central hub for shoppers and businesses. Amazon has taken an early lead in cloud computing, and has branched out into making its own clothing labels, snack foods, consumer electronics, videogames and movies. Amazon has cautiously rolled out its Fresh service after testing it in its hometown for nearly six years, extending it to seven U.S. cities and London since 2013. The handling of perishable items, such as ice cream in the summer heat, is tricky, and the business is costly, requiring expensive refrigerated storage that thins profit margins. Brick-and-mortar stores are a newer addition to Amazon’s arsenal after two decades of centering its business around the dot-com operation. Last year, Amazon opened its first bookstore in Seattle, and plans a handful more across the U.S. It is considering other brick-and-mortar store concepts, including a showcase for its consumer devices, said two of the people. For its planned convenience stores, Amazon is drawing influence from discounters like Aldi and Lidl, as well as dollar stores, which are expanding in the U.S. with spartan stores, private-label inventory and few employees, according to the people familiar with the matter. Such stores may take a year or more to open while Amazon scouts locations, and may be shelved because of financial or operational concerns, the people said. With curbside pickup, Amazon will have to contend with Wal-Mart, which plans to bring the service to nearly a quarter of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores by the end of next year, executives said on a conference call last week . “We’re going to be really focused on winning in fresh and consumables over the next couple years,” said Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce. Wal-Mart recently paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com, the e-commerce company Mr. Lore founded in 2014. Amazon may be just weeks from opening its first drive-in grocery location in Seattle, one of the people said. Documents uncovered by tech site GeekWire indicate the company is behind a storefront being built there, which would allow customers to schedule 15-minute to two-hour windows to arrive for pickup. Beyond Wal-Mart, Amazon faces a broad swath of competitors in grocery delivery, from national supermarket chain Safeway Inc. to regional companies like FreshDirect LLC and fast-growing startups such as Instacart Inc. Amazon is being careful to avoid following the fate of Webvan Group Inc., the online grocery company that during the dot-com boom burned through more than $800 million in less than three years as it went public, filed for bankruptcy and then shut. Several former Webvan executives work at Amazon. Grocery delivery is even more complex than delivering the average package. Grocers must keep food cold, manage large orders and schedule them within tight delivery windows, said Ivan Hofmann, a transportation industry consultant and former FedEx executive. Drivers may end up driving around in circles, killing any profit. “There’s just so much variability in the grocery delivery model, that it’s always going to be a more costly delivery, and it doesn’t lend itself as easily to economies of scale as packages do,” he said.

(Reuters/Brendan McDermid) Share Written by Alison Griswold October 11, 2016 Grocery delivery is the holy grail of online shopping. Everyone is chasing it—startups like Instacart, traditional retailers like Walmart, and of course e-commerce giant Amazon—but so far no winner has emerged. Amazon has worked on its grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, since 2007. Fresh is a competitor to services like Peapod and FreshDirect, which allow customers to place their orders online and have them dropped off at home. Until recently, Amazon Fresh cost $299 a year, but last week it was rebranded as a $15-a-month add-on to Amazon Prime. Turns out that was only the beginning of the changes in store for Amazon Fresh. Today the Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is planning a line of tiny grocery shops for Fresh customers, internally dubbed “Project Como.” From the Journal: The Seattle company aims to build small brick-and-mortar stores that would sell produce, milk, meats and other perishable items that customers can take home, these people say. Primarily using their mobile phones or, possibly, touch screens around the store, customers could also order peanut butter, cereal and other goods with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery. A spokeswoman for Amazon said in an email that the company doesn’t comment “on rumors or speculation.” According to the Journal, Amazon will also build designated drive-in pick-up spots for consumers who want to place grocery orders online and have them brought to the car, a move rumored earlier this summer. The online retailer would be following in the footsteps of Walmart, which offers free, same-day curbside grocery pick-up at around 400 locations in the US. The system takes advantage of Walmart’s extensive network of nearly 4,000 US stores, which are already equipped with freezers, fridges, and other things needed to store and distribute fresh food. “Walmart has built probably the world’s best fresh supply chain,” Ravi Jariwala, a company spokesman, told Quartz in August. Online retailers believe that grocery sales are important because everyone needs to buy food. In 2015, the average US consumer went to the grocery store 1.5 times a week. That might not be frequent enough to sustain an entire business (see: Instacart), but it can be a powerful driver of sales for more general businesses. Before Jet.com was purchased for $3.3 billion in August by Walmart, the e-commerce startup said customers who bought groceries were doing so 2.4 times per month, compared to the average customer who made only 1.5 purchases a month.

Woman Gives Birth To Baby Boy In Walmart Checkout Lane, Pays For Merchandise First Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Woman Gives Birth To Baby Boy In Walmart Checkout Lane, Pays For Merchandise First Image courtesy of Mike Mozart October 11, 2016 11:33 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler rush delivery walmart baby another walmart delivery register birth Babies don’t always have the best timing. When it comes to being born, they might wait until you’re at the hospital, but that baby might decide to make its debut on a Southwest flight, a Walmart parking lot, or in a Sam’s Club bathroom. So why not the Walmart checkout line, where you can give birth and pay for your groceries at the same time. Fox 13 Now reports that a customer in a Utah Walmart was shopping with her family Sunday morning when she began experiencing stomach problems that quickly turned out to be labor pains. A manager for the Walmart store says that the incident unfolded in about 15 minutes. During that time, the woman notified the manager that she wasn’t feeling well. While he went to call 911, the woman headed to the checkout lane to pay for her items. “The funny thing is that the customer was down on her knees and she insisted on paying for her merchandise and we’re like you know that’s just not important. You know, we were going to take care of her on it,” the manager said, noting that employees and fellow shoppers quickly grabbed towels and blankets to help the woman to deliver the baby boy. “By the time the EMTs got here she had paid for her merchandise and had a baby,” the manager said. A responding EMT tells Fox 13 Now that the woman “was very calm, she did very well — it was her third child so she had experienced childbirth before so I don’t think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart.” The woman and baby were taken to the hospital in good condition. The Walmart manager, who joked that the store would change the name of register 11 to “baby register,” says the company plans to buy the woman some necessities like diapers and formula.

Jim Sly, who is in charge of Fanning Funeral Home in Welch, the county seat, remembers when two people who had come to make funeral arrangements for a deceased relative passed out at the parlor. He suspects that they were under the influence of some kind of narcotics. Randy and Alma McNeely outside their house in McDowell County.

It’s hard to find someone in this mining region who doesn’t have a family member or friend with a drug problem No freeways connect this county to the outside world. There are no supermarkets stocked with fresh fruits or vegetables, and no opportunities to earn a living unless it’s thanks to government subsidies. The most isolated region in the country, the whitest and most rural of the United States, is slowly dying – and not just because of an overdose. “I have a funeral tomorrow,” says Martin West, the county sheriff. “A young man with some problems.” There are two boxes at the entrance of the office that invites visitors to deposit pills and syringes anonymously for disposal. Besides serving as sheriff, West is a Protestant pastor. As an agent of peace, his mission is to chase down crime: nine out of 10 cases he works on involve drugs. As a preacher, he must console the families destroyed by an epidemic that has contributed to a sharp rise in mortality among whites aged 45 to 54. Life expectancy for men in McDowell was 64 years in 2010, 18 years fewer than their counterparts in Fairfax County, a suburb of Washington, D.C., that sits 560 kilometers away. The county was once home to 100,000 residents, years when coal was to Welch what the car is to Detroit Shop windows in Welch and in other nearby towns along US Route 52 are boarded up. An abandoned school with a music room, a piano and its last score. A hotel in ruins. Houses whose interiors are overgrown with vegetation. These are the remains of a glorious past, when the county was home to 100,000 residents, years when coal was to Welch what the car is to Detroit. Today, 18,000 people live in McDowell. There are no dealerships and, since Wal-Mart closed last winter, there are no big stores either. Wal-Mart, with its low prices and endless sales, is blamed for destroying the fabric of small shops and urban centers throughout rural America. Yet, paradoxically, when Wal-Mart closed its doors, it dealt a second blow, perhaps the hardest, to McDowell County. Now, residents have to travel more than an hour over sinuous highways to nearby counties to shop. “Store closed at 7pm. Thursday January 27, 2016,” says a note taped to the door of the boarded-up Wal-Mart center. It reads like a death certificate. Paradoxically, when Wal-Mart closed its doors, it dealt perhaps the hardest blow to McDowell County “It was the center of social life in the county,” says Linda McKinney. She and her husband, Bob, manage a food and clothing bank that helps 1,200 to 1,800 people – 10% percent of McDowell residents – every month. Wal-Mart’s departure also affected the bank; the giant store donated left-over food. One-third of McDowell residents lives in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. Annual incomes per capita reach $14,813 (€13,300), half of what the rest of the nation makes. McKinney attributes the high mortality rate to a lack of exercise and poor nutrition because the area lacks supermarkets that could provide fresh foods. “We are not different from other parts of the world, except for one fact: we do not have a middle class,” says Harold McBride, McDowell County president. As people migrate to other counties, McBride says, they take away the social glue needed for this community to recover.

In the reception hall of Widener Funeral Home, a headline from The Welch News reads: “Carfentanil: A New Factor in the US Opioid Crisis.” Kenneth Widener, who works in the family business, says the number of deaths due to overdose is still a small fraction of the total. But “when we show up in the news,” he explains, “they always show the worst home and the worst-looking person.” In photos A visit to West Virginia (Spanish captions) Driving through back roads among idyllic landscapes, Sabrina Shrader, a tireless fighter for the good name of this land, recalls her childhood in McDowell, where she lived until she was 13 years old. She participated in the campaign launched by Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s rival in the Democratic primaries, and she is running for a West Virginia Legislature seat for Mercer County. “I am an Appalachian Christian,” says Shrader, who shows pride in her identity and peppers her sentences with Bible references. Davy, a town of 400 residents located next to a railroad line, is home to the Wingates: Adam, his wife Heather, and their two children. Adam Wingate immigrated to the United States from Lebanon when he was five years old. A local family adopted him. Wingate is a miner and he has been out of work for four months. “There is no way I want my kids to stay here,” he says. He has found needles in the park nearby. Heather Wingate remembers the car accident she had when she was 22 years old. The doctor prescribed 180 painkillers. “Here,” she says, “good people do bad things.” English version by Dyane Jean François. The “invisible audience” According to economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, the rise in mortality among middle-aged whites is not happening in any other developed country or among other ethnic groups in the United States. These men and women fill the ranks of Donald Trump supporters. His populist nationalist message has helped the Republican candidate connect with voters who feel displaced by globalization, scorned by elites, and put at a disadvantage in a country that is growing increasingly more diverse. As Anne Case wrote, they are “an audience that feels increasingly invisible.” McDowell County, West Virginia is the county with the third-highest rate of premature death in the United States, according to “County Health Rankings” from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, a study that measures where residents are most likely to die before the age of 75. The other two counties with the highest mortality rates are on Indian reservations in South Dakota.

Instead, as the world's largest retailer pushes forward in the category — which makes up roughly half of its sales — Amazon is reportedly eyeing a bigger piece of the action. According to The Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce giant plans to open convenience stores that sell milk, produce and other consumables, as well as drive-up destinations where shoppers can have their orders brought to the car. People familiar with the strategy told the newspaper that shoppers could use their smartphones or screens scattered around the shops to place their orders. The drive-up service, which replicates Wal-Mart's successful online grocery strategy, would be designated for shoppers who place their orders ahead of time. A spokeswoman for Amazon told CNBC the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. The Journal story comes just days after Wal-Mart reiterated its commitment to its online grocery business. When Wal-Mart's online sales growth picked up in the fiscal second quarter, growing roughly 12 percent, management attributed part of the acceleration to this service. Not only has it brought new customers into its ecosystem, but these shoppers tend to grab additional items when they pick up their orders, the company has said. This capability has been rolled out to 80 markets and 500 stores, and will be in 100 markets and 600 stores by year's end. Though digital grocery sales have been slow to take off for both Amazon and the industry overall, as shoppers have been reluctant to allow someone else to choose their produce, Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge says there's huge potential for the e-commerce giant to grab a larger share of spending. Online groceries now account for about 2 percent of total grocery sales within the United States, according to IBISWorld. In a report on the grocery industry earlier this year, Blackledge said Amazon's food and beverage revenues fell shy of earning it a slot in the top 20 grocery retailers. However, as shoppers become more comfortable with the idea of purchasing groceries online, Amazon has emerged as a name that they trust, his research has found. As such, Blackledge estimates Amazon will become the seventh-largest food and beverage retailer in the U.S. by 2021. "The U.S. food and beverage grocery market has reached a tipping point, in our view," he said in the report. Grocery could signal a big opportunity for Amazon, as food needs to be replenished frequently. However, its Fresh service is only available in a handful of markets, and comes at an additional cost to Prime members. Whereas an annual Prime membership is $99, Amazon Fresh tacks on another $14.99 a month. Amazon has been dipping its toe into bricks-and-mortar stores, including a bookstore in its home market of Seattle and 25 pop-up locations around the U.S. Krystina GustafsonEditor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AMZN --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The red areas had the most accidents followed by the yellow and then the green. By Alexis Bechman As of Monday, October 10, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss 3 comments, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Advertisement Watch out if you are driving near Walmart or Safeway! These remain among the top places for accidents, according to data the Roundup recently received. If you’ve driven around Payson you are probably aware of a few other hot spots when it comes to accidents and near mishaps. From January to August, drivers reported 325 accidents to police in Payson, a small increase for the same period last year. Last year, Payson averaged 30 accidents a month — this year, we’re up to 40 a month. The Roundup recently requested a series of data sets from the Payson Police Department including, locations, dates and times of accidents, burglaries, thefts and domestic violence. In the first in a series, today we’ll focus on the data documenting a sharp increase in accidents in the past year in a town often overwhelmed by out-of-town traffic. The data reveals locations where you are most likely to get into a wreck and what time of day that will occur. Basically, avoid Highway 87 altogether between noon and 7 p.m. That’s when 56 percent of accidents occur. If you just have to run that errand — at least avoid driving the highway between noon and 2 p.m., when 20 percent of accidents happen. The best time to drive? Between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., according to the data. In fact, Payson hasn’t had a single traffic crash between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. so far this year. Keep that in mind next time you need groceries — since the grocery remain a prime spot for accidents. Walmart, at 300 N. Beeline Highway, and Safeway, at 401 E. Highway 260, remain the top locations for accidents in Payson. So far this year, there have been 11 near Walmart and nine near Safeway. Other top spots for accidents include nine at Home Depot, 2000 N. Beeline Highway; seven at Tyler Parkway and Highway 260; six on South Highway 87 as you enter town and six near the Jiffy Lube and Highway 260 intersection, 160 E. Highway 260. Earlier this year, a Gila County Sheriff’s Office deputy got into a wreck at that intersection outside Jiffy Lube. The accident caused no serious injuries. Among the 325 wrecks this year, 139 involved injuries — roughly 42 percent. Police report two fatalities. Ronald Richardson died when the front-end loader he was working on rolled, pinning him at 1001 W. Gold Nugget Lane. In August, a Christopher Creek man died of a medical condition after crashing into several vehicles at the intersection of Manzanita Street and East State Route 260. Statewide in 2015, there were 116,609 auto crashes in Arizona, 811 of them fatal. That’s a toll of about 2.45 people killed each day in a motor vehicle accident, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. The number of crashes and fatal wrecks has risen every year since at least 2011 in Arizona. In Gila County last year, police reported 844 crashes, including 25 crashes that claimed 31 lives. Payson police in 2015 reported three fatal wrecks. While 81 percent of crashes in Arizona occur in urban areas, the accidents that do occur in rural areas are usually more serious. In 2015, 46 percent of all fatal crashes occurred in rural areas with just 19 percent of fatal accidents occurring in urban areas. On Wednesday, a Pine man died when his car crossed the centerline coming into Payson on the Beeline Highway, hitting a van head-on. In Gila County, the number of fatalities increased dramatically from 2014 to 2015. The increase from 18 deaths in 2014 to 31 in 2015 amounted to a 72 percent increase. Of those deaths, eight were alcohol related. Around the state, the number of fatalities increased in 11 of the 15 counties from 2014 to 2015. ADOT’s report does not speculate as to a reason for the increase in fatal wrecks. People are driving more around the state. The amount of gasoline sold in Arizona has been increasing every year since the recession hit in 2007-08. The market took a hit when the downturn occurred, going from a peak of 2.87 billion gallons sold in Arizona in 2006-07 to 2.65 billion in 2008-09. In 2015-16, 2.84 billion gallons of gasoline was sold around the state as more people drove more often — and further. In Gila County, gallon sales have not recovered as quickly as statewide. Gasoline sales peaked in 2004-05 in Gila County at 34 million gallons sold. Last year, they hovered at 27.3 million gallons in Gila County. In Payson, the most wrecks occurred in April, dropped slightly in May and June and then increased again in July. The winter months typically see fewer visitors to Rim Country and fewer accidents. While there is no way to predict when or where a wreck will occur, the Payson Police reports tell us to be more vigilante when driving during the day and when visiting the store.

Don't put in a stupid roundabout on McLane near the Library. The town is creating traffic hazards with them. I noticed a lot of people at the intersection of Longhorn and McLane today. Seems they may be putting in a death trap at that intersection with a roundabout. What are they going to do with the mini storage, and big steel electric poles and the fenced in area that has something to do with APS? I can see 200 high school students getting tangled up there in a huge crash.

Justin Daniel Sturm, 28, of Ubly, was sentenced Monday to seven to 40 years for conducting a criminal enterprise; two to 20 years for breaking and entering a building with intent to commit larceny therein; and one year for heroin possession. Each sentence was enhanced by Sturm’s status as a third-offense habitual offender, which doubles the maximum sentence. Derrick Nicholas Grifka, 23, of Ubly, was sentenced in August to five to 25 years for a conviction of conducting a criminal enterprise and for being a fourth-offense habitual offender. Due to his prior criminal history, he had faced up to life in prison. Brad Allen Galloway, 33, of Caseville, pleaded guilty on Aug. 29 to a charge of conducting a criminal enterprise and to being a third-offense habitual offender. Combined, the convictions carry a possible maximum prison sentence of 40 years. He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 24. Sturm and his two associates took the televisions by loading them onto carts and walking out with them through the store’s front doors. They then transported the stolen items to Flint, where they traded the items for heroin. In total, the televisions were valued at $18,985. Grifka and Sturm were both ordered to pay their share of the cost in restitution to Walmart, and the same order is expected when Galloway is sentenced. Huron County Prosecutor Timothy J. Rutkowski said the men typically worked in two-man teams while stealing the televisions. Sturm and Grifka were present during seven of the 11 incidents, and Galloway took part in nine of the thefts. Sturm’s breaking and entering conviction was for a theft from Thumb Pawn, which was unrelated to the Walmart case. Co-defendant William John Messing said he was unaware Sturm was stealing items from the store until Sturm returned to the vehicle Messing was driving. Since Messing assisted Sturm by helping him leave the site with the stolen goods, he was also charged with breaking and entering with intent. On Monday, Sept. 26, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 60 days held in abeyance, and 18 months probation. Before his sentence was read, Sturm apologized to the court and stated his crimes were linked to his drug addiction. In a letter Sturm submitted to the court, he said he was doing well following his release from prison approximately five years ago. Then, he was injured in an automobile accident, which also nearly killed his best friend. “Even though I had a really good job, I couldn’t keep up, and that’s when everything spiraled out of control. I was scared to ask for help until it was pretty much too late,” Sturm wrote. On the date of his arrest, May 20, he was scheduled to begin treatment at a rehabilitation facility. Rutkowski said he requested a sentence of 12 to 14 years, which fell within the guideline range. Defense attorney Dallas Rooney asked for leniency, arguing that all Sturm’s crimes involved property, not violence against people. Rutkowski said just because Sturm did not directly attack a person doesn’t mean people were not injured by his crimes. “People are affected,” Rutkowski said. “Business owners are losing money, and they have to try to get that money back by charging honest customers more. It affects the rest of society.” He said a lengthy prison sentence will serve to protect the community. “Sturm’s not going to change. His history is littered with thefts,” Rutkowski said. Sturm received 136 days credit for time served. He was ordered to pay $594 fines and costs.

(NYSE:WMT) is bumping up its workers’ salaries to improve the company’s business. Source: Flickr> The company said that salaries are going up from $47,456 to $48,500 per year, which will make for happier manager, happier employees and happier customers. The move will affect more than 4 million U.S. workers. Walmart recently raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour. Additionally, there is a new rule being passed by the Obama administration on Dec. 1 that will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers who earn less than $47,500 a year, which is twice as much as the previous minimum of $23,660. The $10 per hour pay bump for entry-level workers has been in place since September. The company has more than 1.5 million workers in the U.S., which includes managers, store clerks, truck drivers and more. Walmart has yet to announce when it plans on releasing its figures for holiday hires that other companies have already planned, including JCPenney, UPS and Kohl’s. The retailer is the largest one in the U.S., and it is working on using technology to advance its shopping with self-driving shopping carts. Hopefully these will not cause any accidents for shoppers or employees. Walmart came under fire a couple of weeks ago for refusing a woman a birthday cake that would honor her father and the local police force, as he was retiring after a quarter of a century of service. WMT shares is up 0.5% Wednesday.

Effective Sept. 1, pay for new and current entry-level salaried managers increased 7.8% to $48,500 from $45,000. That came three months before the Department of Labor’s new rule goes into effect. It doubles the minimum annual pay—from $23,660 to $47,476—in which full-time salaried workers remain eligible for overtime pay. “We wanted to make these changes before the holiday season, which is a very busy time of the year,” Wal-Mart spokesperson Kory Lundberg told MarketWatch in a phone interview Wednesday. The raises come about year into Wal-Mart’s two-year plan to invest $2.7 billion in its workers, in an effort to lift sales by improving customer service through increased worker engagement. Lundberg said, as the company has learned over the last couple of years, “when we help our associates be successful, it helps our company be successful.” Wal-Mart didn’t say how many employees will be affected by the salary increase. The company ended fiscal 2016 with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. The stock WMT, -0.22%  rose 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday. The stock had tumbled 6% over the past four sessions, in the wake of a downbeat earnings outlook, to close Tuesday at a five-month low. It has rallied 10% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-trade fund XRT, +1.58%  has tacked on 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21%  has gained 4%. “Better stores are the key to us running a better business. And it starts with improving the associate experience,” said Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart U.S., at an analyst gathering last week. “When we provide them with a great start, a path to grow and succeed, they’ll provide a better experience for our customers.” Don’t miss: Wal-Mart rivals and haters, beware.

The rule will double (to $47,476) the salary threshold under which virtually all workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay whenever they work more than 40 hours in a given week. Entry-level managers at Walmart were making $45,000 when the rule came out in May, but starting in September they made $48,500, Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose report for Reuters. A spokesperson for the retailer said “the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company.” More here. Story Continued Below GOOD MORNING.

CHICAGO DODGES TEACHER STRIKE: Chicago’s public schools kept running Tuesday after teachers announced a tentative four-year deal with the school district just a few ticks of the clock before they were set to go on strike. The contract — if approved by the city’s Board of Education and the union — will resolve a thorny pension dispute. Under the proposed terms, the district will continue paying 7 percent of annual salary into the pensions of teachers hired before Jan. 1, 2017. Teachers hired after that date won’t receive the benefit; instead, they’ll get a cumulative 7 percent boost in base salary by July 1. Background from the Washington Post: “Teachers — who have been working without a contract since June 2015 — had planned to walk off the job Tuesday, a move that would have forced the school system to cancel classes for more than 300,000 students. But the two sides reached a compromise just before midnight, capping nearly two years of negotiations about issues ranging from pay and benefits to class sizes, special education, teacher evaluations, layoffs and charter schools.” The proposed deal will also give teachers a cumulative 4.5 percent cost of living raise by 2019 (though none this year or next). The agreement could be finalized in less than three weeks, Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey told Morning Shift. It must be ratified by the union’s House of Delegates, Chicago’s Board of Education and CTU’s rank-and-file members. Sharkey said he’s “not particularly happy to have a zero [cost-of-living adjustment] when people in the private sector are doing much better.” Still, he acknowledged the district’s financial difficulties and called the deal “fair.” In a press release Tuesday, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten touted a “a much-deserved raise” for Chicago teachers. She also took a swipe at Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner — who’s squared off against unions — saying the negotiations were more difficult because of the state’s “toxic and austere environment.” More from the Washington Post. DWINDLING DETENTION FUNDS: The Wall Street Journal’s Devlin Barrett reports: “The Department of Homeland Security is a month away from running out of money to detain illegal immigrants … If they don’t get more money by early November, officials will be forced to stop holding newly captured illegal immigrants, including high-priority arrests at the border, the officials said.” “DHS officials now see an immediate $136 million shortfall to pay for detention beds and nondetention monitoring of illegal immigration ... ICE officials attribute the budget crunch in part to an influx of Haitian immigrants entering along the U.S. border with Mexico.” More from the Wall Street Journal here. HARVARD: THE STRIKE GOES ON: Cafeteria workers at the richest university in the world today reach their eighth day of striking over wages and benefits. The protest Tuesday included a visit from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who before she joined the Senate was a Harvard Law professor, and Ben Stiller. The New York Times reports that there’s little chance the strike will end soon. Marilyn Hausammann, Harvard’s vice president for human resources, said Tuesday that the union had refused to engage in “any meaningful dialogue” to end it. Meanwhile, food is being dished out by dining services managers and overtime-exempt university employees such as freshman proctors. UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents the 750 cafeteria workers, is demanding more affordable health care and a minimum salary of $35,000. Read more here. REHEARING SET FOR LGBT DISCRIMINATION CASE: A Chicago federal appeals court agreed Tuesday to reconsider whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation. A hearing date for the case has been set for Nov. 30. BuzzFeed’s Chris Geidner writes that it will be the first time since the Supreme Court’s marriage equality ruling in June 2015 that a full federal appeals court will consider the issue en banc, which means the full-judge panel will be free to overrule prior decisions of the court. There may be ramifications for cases involving access to bathrooms for transgender employees. “Note that this issue is separate but related to the series of cases asking a similar question as to whether gender identity-based discrimination against transgender people also is banned under sex discrimination provisions in existing civil rights laws,” Geidner explains.

ALJ: TRIBE MUST BARGAIN OVER BONUSES: A National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge ruled Tuesday that that the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, who own and operate the Viejas Casino & Resort, violated federal labor law when it paid higher annual bonuses to non-union members than to its unionized workforce. In 2015 the casino had a particularly profitable year, and the tribe was able to pay employees bonuses. The casino’s general manager asserted that because union members (about 490 food and beverage employees at the casino) had recently negotiated a significant raise, “equity demanded” that non-union members get higher bonuses. The NLRB’s general counsel argued that this arrangement violated the National Labor Relations Act in two ways: 1.) The higher nonunion bonuses discouraged union membership; 2.) The tribe did not bargain with the union before it issued the bonuses. The ALJ ruled the first argument meritless because there was no evidence of an anti-union motive. But the ALJ accepted the second argument on the grounds that informing the union of the changes to the bonuses mere moments before announcing them to all employees did not constitute a negotiation. The tribe also argued that it should be excluded from NLRB jurisdiction on sovereignty grounds, but the ALJ disagreed, writing that the board had asserted jurisdiction over tribal-owned casinos repeatedly in the past and that there was “no factual basis for reaching a different conclusion here.” The full decision is here. ARPAIO FACES CONTEMPT CHARGE: The U.S. Department of Justice plans to charge Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio with criminal contempt, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. The charge stems from Arpaio “defying a judge's orders to end his signature immigration patrols in Arizona.” The 84-year-old sheriff — a close Republican ally of Donald Trump who gave a speech praising the presidential nominee at July’s Republican National Convention — could face six months in jail if convicted. Arpaio is in the midst of a reelection campaign against Democrat Paul Penzone (whom Arpaio bested with a little more than 50 percent of the vote in 2012). The prosecution is the latest turn in a legal saga that began in 2007 with racial profiling complaints against Arpaio, known nationally for his hard-line stance against immigration. After years of litigation, U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow ruled in 2013 that Arpaio had violated the constitutional rights of Latinos during traffic stops and raids. A civil contempt charge followed in May of this year when Arpaio didn’t comply with the judge’s orders. “While Arpaio and his cohorts admitted violating three of Snow’s orders, they insisted the missteps were unintentional. By law, intent could mean the difference between civil and criminal contempt,” the Arizona Republic reports. “Snow found cause for both.” More from the Arizona Republic here. AIRLINES AND ORGANIZED LABOR: A ProPublica investigation published Tuesday looked at the role of organized labor during the 2013 merger of U.S. Airways and American Airlines — a move opposed by the Justice Department. Justin Elliott reports: “Organized labor often opposes mergers because the ‘efficiencies’ touted by Wall Street can be a euphemism for job cuts. But in this case, US Airways executives won the backing of the American Airlines pilot, flight attendant, and mechanics’ unions in exchange for promises of better contracts.” “Flight attendants union chief Laura Glading was the most active labor figure campaigning for the deal, crisscrossing the country to meet with editorial boards and state attorneys general who had joined DOJ’s suit.,” Elliot writes. “Appearing at a Capitol Hill rally in her flight attendant uniform, she offered a different perspective and image than the company executives in business suits. Hilary Rosen, one of the Democratic lobbyists working on the deal, later credited the union support with flipping the Justice Department.” More here. POLK COUNTY RAISES MINIMUM WAGE: The Board of Supervisors in Polk County, Iowa, voted Tuesday to raise the hourly minimum wage to $10.75, up from the current $7.25. Under the proposal, the county’s hourly minimum will rise to $8.75 in April 2017; $9.75 in January 2018, and $10.75 in January 2019. It’s the fourth Iowa county to raise its minimum above the federal minimum. More from WQAD. CASE OF THE MUNCHIES: A Nevada union representing culinary workers announced Monday that it will support a state ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults. Via the Las Vegas Sun: “Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents more than 57,000 workers statewide, endorsed the initiative on the basis of taking marijuana out of the black market into tax-paying businesses.” Of course, legal cannabis and cooking can go hand-in-hand, too. By one estimate, marijuana-infused edibles make up roughly half of the $5.4 billion industry. Read more here. DID WARM WINTER SHRINK MAY JOB GROWTH?: When the Labor Department reported that the economy added a mere 38,000 jobs in May (later revised down to 24,000), politicians and economists wondered briefly whether the U.S. economy was in trouble. But an unusually warm winter may account for that dramatic dip, according to a study from San Francisco Fed researchers. The Wall Street Journal’s Eric Morath reports: “Researchers say weather — specifically unseasonably warm winter temperatures — were largely responsible for the surprise figure. When adjusting for weather effects, U.S. employers added 162,000 jobs in May, rather than the 24,000 estimated by the Labor Department, according the report. The weather-adjusted figure is more consistent with the prior trend of steady, if slightly slower, job creation during 2016.” More here from the Wall Street Journal.

Amazon is planning a line of tiny grocery stores Quartz 10/12/2016 Alison Griswold © Provided by Quartz Amazon workers deliver groceries from the Amazon Fresh service in Brooklyn. Grocery delivery is the holy grail of online shopping. Everyone is chasing it—startups like Instacart, traditional retailers like Walmart, and of course e-commerce giant Amazon—but so far no winner has emerged. Amazon has worked on its grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, since 2007. Fresh is a competitor to services like Peapod and FreshDirect, which allow customers to place their orders online and have them dropped off at home. Until recently, Amazon Fresh cost $299 a year, but last week it was rebranded as a $15-a-month add-on to Amazon Prime. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Turns out that was only the beginning of the changes in store for Amazon Fresh. Today the Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is planning a line of tiny grocery shops for Fresh customers, internally dubbed “Project Como.” From the Journal: The Seattle company aims to build small brick-and-mortar stores that would sell produce, milk, meats and other perishable items that customers can take home, these people say. Primarily using their mobile phones or, possibly, touch screens around the store, customers could also order peanut butter, cereal and other goods with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery. A spokeswoman for Amazon said in an email that the company doesn’t comment “on rumors or speculation.” According to the Journal, Amazon will also build designated drive-in pick-up spots for consumers who want to place grocery orders online and have them brought to the car, a move rumored earlier this summer. The online retailer would be following in the footsteps of Walmart, which offers free, same-day curbside grocery pick-up at around 400 locations in the US. The system takes advantage of Walmart’s extensive network of nearly 4,000 US stores, which are already equipped with freezers, fridges, and other things needed to store and distribute fresh food. “Walmart has built probably the world’s best fresh supply chain,” Ravi Jariwala, a company spokesman, told Quartz in August. Online retailers believe that grocery sales are important because everyone needs to buy food. In 2015, the average US consumer went to the grocery store 1.5 times a week. That might not be frequent enough to sustain an entire business (see: Instacart), but it can be a powerful driver of sales for more general businesses. Before Jet.com was purchased for $3.3 billion in August by Walmart, the e-commerce startup said customers who bought groceries were doing so 2.4 times per month, compared to the average customer who made only 1.5 purchases a month.

The Herald Times reports that Saulter admitted making the $620 in purchases at Walmart, Kroger and Marsh, but told a police detective he "accidentally" used the office credit card instead of his personal debit card because he was under a lot of personal stress at the time and the cards were similar in appearance. The suspicious purchases were made between September 5 and October 10 of last year. Police documented 13 transactions at various Kroger stores in Bloomington, two at Walmart and two at a Marsh store. "All of the transactions were caught on video and all of them showed suspect Saulter using the credit card to purchase prescription medications and food for his personal use," the affidavit reads. Saulter's wife had been ill, and she died on February 14 of this year. Lt. Shawn Karr, a detective with the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, compared Saulter's debit card with the county-issued card, and they were "partly the same color," he wrote in a probable-cause affidavit filed in Monroe Circuit Court, but had distinct differences. Attorney Stanley Levco from Evansville, appointed a special prosecutor in the case, filed three counts of fraud and one count of official misconduct. They are Level 6 felonies that carry a possible jail term of six months to 21/2 years and a $10,000 fine. Saulter, 64, was issued a summons to appear in court for an initial hearing on October 25. Saulter had been the county auditor for 7.5 years, then resigned in July as a special prosecutor's investigation continued.

REUTERS Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Trump, unchained Donald Trump says he is now campaigning as a candidate who is unchained. He greeted more than 10,000 in Panama City last night, but said nothing about House Speaker Paul Ryan or other prominent Republicans who have distanced themselves from him. Instead, Trump mused repeatedly about the possibility of losing. Clinton gains A new poll shows Donald Trump recovering some losses after his performance in the second presidential debate. More Republican voters are also saying party lawmakers should keep backing the brash business tycoon’s bid to win the White House, but the overall news from the poll wasn’t necessarily good for the GOP nominee. Clinton camp emails Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, has said there was a “reasonable” chance that Donald Trump’s campaign had “advanced warning” about the latest Wikileaks hack that exposed thousands of Podesta’s emails. Podesta says a close Trump adviser suggested as much himself. Looming battle U.S. commanders who served in Mosul a decade ago are back, preparing Iraq’s own soldiers to retake the city from ISIS. Unlike on earlier tours, the commanders tell CBS News American troops are only there this time to train and advise -- not for combat, and they’re facing a weary enemy. But U.S. forces are out there, and there’s little safety in Iraq. Speaking out Hours after the notorious Trump tape hit the airwaves, author Kelly Oxford launched a Twitter appeal, sharing her own story of sexual assault and asking other women to join her. The response was explosive, offering a window into the scope of the problem in the country today. In light of the national discussion, Anita Hill tells us what she believes must happen next.

The idea is simple: Order groceries through Walmart’s grocery app or on its website, drive to your local Walmart and employees will deliver them to your car, free. But Walmart faces a lot of hurdles -- and some hungry rivals planning similar services.

Wal-Mart raised salaries from $47,476 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.

Rankin PORTSMOUTH, Va. – Former Portsmouth Police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for voluntary manslaughter Wednesday morning. Court started at 9 a.m. The judge denied Rankin bond and ordered him to be locked up immediately after the sentencing. Rankin’s lawyers say they will file an appeal, but they can’t do that until after the formal sentencing. When he was found guilty on August 4, the jury recommended 2 and a half years, however, the judge will make the final determination. There will likely be impact statements made before sentencing. Rankin shot and killed 18-year-old William Chapman II during an incident that occurred around 7:35 a.m. on April 22, 2015 in the parking lot of the Walmart located at 1098 Frederick Blvd. in Portsmouth. Click here for all of our coverage on Chapman's death and Rankin's trial Portsmouth Police were alerted by Walmart security about a suspected shoplifter. Chapman was spotted crossing the parking lot on foot and was approached by Rankin. During the encounter, a struggle ensued that resulted in Chapman being shot by the police officer. The officer immediately requested medics. Chapman died at the scene. Chapman's body was sent to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Norfolk for examination and autopsy. Virginia State Police took the lead role in the investigation. They were asked to investigate the case by Former Portsmouth Police Chief Ed Hargis because it is the second officer-involved shooting in Portsmouth within the last month. The day after the shooting Candy Chapman, Williams’s mother spoke out about her son’s death and made an emotional statement to the public. “That’s my son, I have to speak for him. I have to be his voice. He didn’t deserve this,” says Candy Chapman. “I called 911 myself after I found out it was a boy that was 18. I have not seen my son for hours. I told them my son’s name, detectives came and told me yes, it was your son, and that was about seven something in the morning.” During the press conference in April of 2015, she smiled and recalled happy memories of her son about how he loved the library and books. She described him as a compassionate person who was soft spoken and stayed out of trouble. She says she can’t believe he’d charge at an officer the way that eye witnesses described. “If he was struggling with the officer, it’s because he was afraid. That’s the only reason. Not because he wanted to harm the officer or get some type of attention.” She said she has four other children and William was her oldest son. In August 2015, the Commonwealth's Attorney announced that they had completed their investigation into the shooting death of Chapman and announced that officials were seeking an indictment against Rankin. On September 3, 2015 Rankin was indicted on charges of first degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony by a grand jury. He was then fired by the city. A jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter in August 2015. “People were convinced that he some kind of racist murdering monster that just wants to go out and kill people,” said Dawn Rankin, Stephen’s wife. Immediately after the shooting Dawn said threats began her family and her loved ones. “The day of the indictment came down we had to leave our home and we never lived in again,” said Dawn Rankin “People would gather outside of our house with the media knocking on the door.” He is scheduled to be sentenced October 12th. “There was almost a mob mentality of a rush to judgment,” said Dawn Rankin, “Obviously, we have to have a conversation about this because what's going on in the country just isn't okay, and so we need to have this conversation. People need to hear what this is like.” Please enable Javascript to watch this video Filed in: News Topics: portsmouth, Stephen Rankin, William Chapman Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Southern Bank News 3’s Proud Community Partner!

Amazon is developing license-plate reading technology to reduce wait times. Amazon recently changed Fresh from a $299 per year service to a $15-a-month add-on to Amazon Prime. It's available in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, New York, and Philadelphia areas. Walmart has begun testing grocery pickup, along with other retailers like Kroger and Giant. Walmart has taken its pickup service from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year, according to the Washington Post. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." Amazon is putting competitors in their sites with its vast ecommerce marketplace.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Wal-Mart raised salaries from $47,476 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service.© REUTERS/Daniel Becerril General view shows a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.

News Isle Of Wight County Plastics company among top prospects for industrial park Hillary Smithhismith@dailypress.com Privacy Policy A company that manufactures large plastic storage bins for Wal-Mart and Target may be an answer to Isle of Wight County's quest to fill Shirley T. Holland Intermodal Park to reduce water costs. Tom Elder, the county's director of economic development, told the Economic Development Authority Tuesday that the plastic manufacturing company was the most promising of the four meetings he had on a recent trip to Chicago, where he met with potential business prospects for the park. The plastics company said it would send representatives to visit Isle of Wight within the next couple of months, Elder said. "That's the most you can hope for, when you go on trips like this — to have them take a look at your assets," Elder said. "That's what you're looking for." Elder didn't name any of the companies he met with. The plastics company is seeking a 100,000- to 120,000-square-foot space and would need 35 to 50 employees. The company would like to have a place secured soon, but Elder doesn't yet have a timeline for when the company would give an answer. In June, the county hired Camoin Associates, an economic development firm, to locate companies that use a substantial amount of water. The goal was to alleviate the county's bill for its 2009 water deal with Suffolk and Norfolk. Camoin zeroed in on California and Illinois to source prospects. Caption W.M. Jordan CEO John Lawson W.M.

Social media makes news accessible to its users, but also exposes them to false information. In Chicago, Elder said, he also met with a high-quality milk manufacturer that is mainly considering Pennsylvania as a location, and a dairy factory that works with glass bottles. The bottle factory has about 11,000 customers in Hampton Roads, but is looking to acquire more space in the next four or five years, Elder said. He also mentioned one meeting with a truck parts company that isn't yet completely set on having an East Coast location. The department also had two visits in the last month, one by a tire manufacturer and one by a Spanish ham company, Elder said. The tire manufacturer visited the county Sept. 21, and is looking for a million square feet of space. It would employ 500 people, and invest more than $500 million. The company is touring sites in Virginia and other states, and will provide the county with a short list of sites in which it's interested, Elder said. There is no current time estimate for the list.

Camoin Associates, a New York-based company with an office in Richmond, was hired on June 13 for $20,000, according to... (Reema Amin) The Spanish ham processor visited the county on Oct. 7, and is hoping to build a 65,000-square-foot facility that can expand to 133,000 square feet. The company would bring about 20 new jobs and use 130,000 to 140,000 gallons of water per day, Elder said. The project would be a roughly $25 million capital investment. There is no estimate for when the companies will decide whether to open facilities in the area, Elder said. He is planning a trip to southern California for February 2017 to meet with more potential tenants of the park. Smith can be reached by phone at 757-510-1663.

The new owner, Bemberg Center Partners, LLC, has a listed address of 2926 Foster Creighton Drive, Nashville. Jon Hartman, director of planning and economic development for Elizabethton, said he first became aware there was an interest in purchasing the building when he was in Nashville for an International Council of Shopping Centers idea exchange. In a memorandum to Elizabethton City Manager Jerome Kitchens and Carter County Tomorrow Chairman Richard Tester, Hartman said, “I met with some brokers who had a client interested interested in purchasing the Magic Mart Building.” Since the meeting with Hartman, the building was sold to Bemberg Center Partners by former owner IQ14-Elizabethton Kenosa LLC on July 13. After the purchase, Hartman said he has had many discussions on making improvements to the building and potential retailers who might locate in the building after renovation. While retailers often see Elizabethton as part of Johnson City’s sphere of influence, Hartman said Monday that Elizabethton has its own area of retail influence, which he said includes Carter County, Johnson County and portions of Western North Carolina. While this footprint will help in attracting the attention of a few potential investors, Hartman said some commercial incentives would likely be in order to get the retailers to make an investment and improvements to the site and surrounding area. The purchased property includes 10.41 acres of land. The building contains 100,348 square feet and was built in 1988. The parking lot was last paved in 2001.

The awards were presented during the Thermoforming Division’s annual conference, held in September in Schaumburg, Ill. They were presented in twenty categories. The categories and winners are: “People’s Choice” and Heavy Gauge Pressure Form – Gold. Profile Plastics, Lake Bluff, Ill., for the “Surgical system cover set.” “This cover set is designed to attractively enclose a surgical waste management system used in hospital operating rooms,” SPE said. “The latest generation of these parts made from female pressure form tools results in improved cosmetic appearance, fewer formed parts, faster assembly and lower cost, primarily due to molded in features from complex tools that were not possible with previous generation parts made from male vacuum form tools.” “People’s Choice” and Heavy Gauge Pressure Form – Gold winner: The surgical system cover set. Roll Fed Consumer – Gold.  Jamestown Plastics, Brockton, N.Y., for the “Click it Clam.” “This innovative clamshell design has a patented locking feature which allows it to be easily opened and closed with one hand,” SPE said. “The user simply has to push on the lower part of the flange under the pin, which forces the wall to deflect, releasing the pin and allowing the lid to pop open. Simply snap the lid back down to close and it is secured when you hear the audible ‘click.’” Roll Fed Consumer – Silver.  Transparent Container Company, Addison, Ill., for the “Sharpie Markers tray.” “The Sharpie .022 PVC tray was designed to be easily filled by hand with the 30 markers, yet still meet Walmart’s required external measurements,” SPE said. “This allowed the finished package to be easily stored and displayed onsite. The structural design of the PVC tray for the markers displays them in an orderly fashion and also provides a place for consumers to store them conveniently at home.  In addition, it keeps them secure during shipping and display at Walmart.” Roll Fed Recycled – Gold.  Innovative Plastech Inc., Batavia, Ill., for the “Book and recorder clamshell.” “The book and recorder clamshell is a hanging package, designed to hold both a music book and a musical instrument for sale at retail stores,” SPE said. “The package is made from .020-inch clear recycled PVC. For security of contents while hanging, the clamshell is designed with 6 button snaps around the perimeter of the package. The platform snap loses its effectiveness with such a long package, so the button snaps provide additional consistent and sure closure. Once purchased, it can be repeatedly opened and shut by the customer so that it acts as a protective case for the instrument as well as the music book.” Roll Fed Medical – Gold.  Barger, Placon’s medical specialists, Elkhart, Ind., for the “Medical liner to protect orthopedic implants.” “This thin‐gauge, vacuum formed TPU medical liner offers rugged protection for medical orthopedic implants as well adding impact resistance to the containing PETG sterile blisters,” SPE said. Roll Fed Medical – Silver.  OMG, Via Torino, Italy, for the “Surgical knives sterilization unit.” “A revolutionary thermoforming machine able to produce – starting from roll‐fed or sheet‐fed PS plastic rolls or sheet – a ready‐to‐use surgical knives sterilization container,” SPE said. Heavy Gauge Vacuum Form – Gold.  Associated Thermoforming, Berthoud, Colo., for the “Touch Tower.” “Manufactured for a major soda producer, this is multi‐part beverage dispensing system employs LED touch technology for the dispensing choices,” SPE said. “Vacuum formed from 0.125-inch gauge high gloss metallic silver, black, and red materials, the structure is derived from assembling to the skins vacuum‐formed ribs.” Heavy Gauge Vacuum Form – Silver.  Electro-General Plastics, Grove City, Ohio, for the “Koala assembly.” “The koala ear withholds a metal bracket between the outer and inner koala ears to improve its strength and ease the assembly of on location install,” SPE said. “To construct the koala assembly, MP 55420 structural adhesive metal is used to bond the metal to the ABS and the 1707 Weld‐on adhesive is used to bond the ABS to the ABS. Many different glue brands were tested for the bonding of the koala ear parts. The 1707 ABS substrates (Weld‐on adhesive) changed the outer color to orange where the outer and inner ears had a tight fit. This was resolved by using 100 per cent silicone in these tight areas. This resolution fixates the three parts, inner ear, outer ear, and internal metal bracket, together to create one durable assembly.” Heavy Gauge Pressure Form – Silver.  Providien Thermoforming, San Diego, Calif., for the “Fascia and door front to an automated microbiology system.” “This enclosure assembly serves as the fascia and door front to an automated microbiology system,” SPE said. “The assembly is a mix of single sheet and twin sheet pressure formed parts providing an aesthetic and functional entry point into the system.  Material is custom colour acrylic‐PVC blend and is formed on a mix of textured and smooth multi‐cavity production tools. The tools are built from machined aluminum and include embedded temperature control.” Heavy Gauge TPO – Gold.  Brentwood Industries, Reading, Pa., for the “Dash assembly.” “Dash assembly for low entry heavy truck cabs, made up of twenty components – six thermoformed, two machined, and twelve injection molded louvers,” SPE said. “The show surface of the main dash top is pressure formed while the other thermoformed duct work components are vacuum formed out of TPO. The duct work is assembled to ensure airtightness by using VHB tape and gaskets. The TPO processed is a custom colour matched LyondellBasell E3400.” Heavy Gauge TPO – Silver.  Plastitel, Laval, Que., for the “Bus cargo doors.” “The bus manufacturer has always used FRP for many of its exterior parts,” SPE said. “All of its side skirts and baggage doors were converted from traditional FRP to a TPO using a twin sheet thermoforming process. Combining the TPO and twin sheet process reduced production time, removed the painting process, and improved the aesthetics.” Heavy Gauge Value Add – Gold.  Medallion Plastics, Elkhart, Ind., for the “Motorhome interior dash.” “Using ceramic tooling that is non‐water cooled, Medallion Plastics is able to use innovative design techniques to allow for negative drafts on the tooling to produce high-end-looking automotive parts for the RV industry,” SPE said. Heavy Gauge Value Add – Silver.  Allied Plastics, Twin Lakes, Wis., for the “Propeller case.” “The case had to be built very tough, because it needs to pass UPS shipping drop test standards,” SPE said. “This project started out as a single sheet case, but it was soon realized that a twin sheet design was needed to offer the robustness to protect the prop inside. The propeller is secured in the case by a nylon dowel and receiver.  The prop hub sits snugly on a receiver in the center of the base. High density foam, mounted on the dowel, fits between the propeller hub and top cover. The dowel – secured on the top half – fits within the receiver to interlock the propeller in place. The top and bottom halves of the case are secured by four steel locking clasps.” Heavy Gauge Innovation – Gold.  Profile Plastics, Lake Bluff, Ill., for the “Body protection plates.” “Two twin‐sheet parts are designed to absorb large amounts of energy at a controlled rate for use in personal protection application,” SPE said. “Sophisticated tool and process design was required to achieve strict customer cosmetic and technical requirements, including a challenging multi‐planar pinch geometry.” Heavy Gauge Innovation – Silver.  Hampel, Germantown, Wis., for the “Calf-Tec unit.”  Designed to replace wood hutches that house diary calves, the Calf-Tec hutch is formed on a large (2) up male cast aluminum tool, multiple zoned temperature controlled with a deep draw and curved to match the cover,” SPE said. “The front is formed on a large (2) up twin‐sheet cast aluminum tool, multiple zoned temperature controlled with a deep draw and vertical twin sheet edges. There is a large amount of plastic welding overall, and incorporated features for secondary attachment of other parts: door, pins, pails, etc. The cover is formed on a large (2) up twin‐sheet cast aluminum tool, multiple zone temperature controlled and curved to match the hutch.” Twin Sheet – Gold.  Associated Thermoforming, Berthoud, Colo., for the “Wheel chair shower.”  “The single oven twin-sheet process creates a part that is very strong, withstanding the point‐loading of a person in a wheelchair concentrated on the contact of the two wheels only,” SPE said. “The top surface has features molded in it to facilitate draining and the attachment of the walls and doors. Both parts are formed from 0.187-inch gauge virgin high gloss ABS.” Twin Sheet – Silver.  Corvac, Kentwood, Mich., for the “Underbody shield.” “The panel assembly serves as an underbody engine compartment closeout with an integral service door,” SPE said. “Its function is to protect sensitive components in the engine compartment from infiltration of water and debris, provide enhanced underbody aerodynamic airflow benefitting fuel economy, and assist in overall acoustic performance.” Sheet Fed Recycled – Gold.  Valley Industrial Products, Fort Valley, Ga., for the “front face of a decorative wall protection system.” “This laminated, vacuum formed product is utilized as the front face of decorative wall protection system,” SPE said. “The film is pre‐laminated into extruded 100 per cent post-industrial regrind polyester material, produced on a twin-screw dryer-less extruder. The front face of film is topside printed by UV (solvent-less) screen printing technology. Total assembly is then vacuum formed using a temperature controlled array of frosted, incandescent reflective bulbs.” Print this page Tweet Related SPE announces 2015 Thermoforming Parts Competition winners SPE announces thermoforming parts competition winners SPE wants entries for thermoforming parts competition SPE Antec picks global parts competition winners Have your say: Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Hong Wal-Mart ups entry-level manager salaries ahead of overtime rule By Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose • Reuters Oct 11, 2016 (…) AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Editor's note: Entry-level salaries have been raised from $45,000, not $47,746 as first reported, Wal-Mart says. CHICAGO • Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has raised salaries for entry-level managers before a rule change that extends mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million U.S. workers, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees. Wal-Mart raised salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. Who's hired?

The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.   Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

REUTERS/Daniel BecerrilMore By Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has raised salaries for entry-level managers before a rule change that extends mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million U.S. workers, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees.

Strategy BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. I spent 4 days in Arkansas for the 14,000-person Walmart shareholders meeting, and it's unlike anything else in the corporate world Richard Feloni Jun. 10, 2016, 10:11 AM 208,546 facebook linkedin twitter email print More than 14,000 people from around the world attended this year's meeting.Richard Feloni There is nothing else in the corporate world like the Walmart Shareholders Meeting. On June 3, more than 14,000 Walmart employees, executives, and shareholders poured into the University of Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena. Updates on the past fiscal year's performance as well as the company's latest initiatives were interspersed with comedy from "The Late Late Show" host James Corden and musical performances that included Nick Jonas and Katy Perry. And this was all before noon. Shareholders fly to northwest Arkansas for this four-hour meeting, but most employees arrive earlier in the week, and the media is given a full three-day schedule. I arrived in Bentonville, where Walmart is based, on the Tuesday ahead of the meeting. Here's what I saw during my four days immersed in the culture of the world's biggest retailer. View As: One Page Slides Shortly after arriving in Bentonville, I took a trip to the town's square for a tour of the Walmart Museum. Employees — or "associates," as they're called — were arriving on shuttles. Here are some from Canada. Richard Feloni Employees from each country gave a unique cheer in front of the museum and posed for photos. Team Mexico, the oldest international branch, had a great fiscal year to be proud of. Richard Feloni The museum is the renovated and expanded Walton's Five and Dime, a store that opened in 1950, predating Walmart by 12 years. It was the first store that Walmart founder Sam Walton established in Bentonville. Richard Feloni The museum lobby is a nostalgic throwback to Walton's early years as a small-time merchant, and it has old-time candies and toys for sale. Richard Feloni President George H.W. Bush presented Walton with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on display in the museum, on March 17, 1992, for Walton's contributions to the American economy. He received it two weeks before his death. In his posthumous memoir, "Made in America," Walton called the award ceremony "the greatest day of my life." Richard Feloni After his death, Walton's office was meticulously recreated in the museum. The painting of him and his hunting dogs hangs on a tilt, the way it did in its original location. Richard Feloni Associates coming through the museum that week were encouraged to place a sticker on their places of origin on a map near the exit. Each international store and every other American store (they alternate each year) chose a shareholders meeting representative on merit. Richard Feloni Despite the shrine to 1950s and '60s small-town America in the museum, downtown Bentonville features new hangouts that wouldn't be out of place in a college town. And a mile outside the square is the beautiful Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, largely funded by Walton's daughter, Alice. Richard Feloni Farther out from the square is the Walmart Home Office, what the executives call their headquarters. You'd expect the world's largest retailer to have a high-rise, but Walmart headquarters looks more like a public high school, in keeping with Sam Walton's preferences. Walmart We had an early start Wednesday, heading to the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville to attend the US Associates Meeting in the Bud Walton Arena. An associate sang the national anthem. Richard Feloni "Sam Walton was the ultimate item merchant," Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies told the audience, encouraging them to focus on selling more Walmart exclusives like emoji pillows. Walmart COO Judith McKenna commended exceptional employees with "Happy to Help" awards. She also revealed that Walmart's old mascot, Smiley, was making a comeback in both advertising and employee awards. Richard Feloni TV personality Steve Harvey was the morning's guest host, and he entered to uproarious applause. He moderated a game of "Family Feud" between Walmart executives and employees. (The executives won by a point, but everyone pretended it was a tie to avoid a riot, as Harvey put it.) Richard Feloni The Associate Expo, a sort-of corporate county fair, narrowly missed being rained out. Employees could play games, like a tricycle race. Richard Feloni They could also enjoy free snacks and hang out with mascots, like this waffle guy. Richard Feloni The expo provided free Yarnell's Ice Cream, a small Arkansas brand that Sam Walton used to both sell and eat plenty of. Richard Feloni Aside from the snacks, there was a petting zoo with some goats and a camel — but most people were drawn to its puppies. Richard Feloni We then headed to the first Walmart Academy, in Fayetteville. The company showcased two new initiatives intended to drive recruitment, retainment, and engagement: Pathways and the Academy itself. Walmart All new entry-level employees will be enrolled in Pathways, a map of promotional opportunities and training programs, and all new managers will spend two weeks at the nearest Walmart Academy for a crash course in Walmart leadership. "We want [employees] to really think of retail as a career," said Michelle Knight, vice president of US talent development. Walmart That night I was the only American reporter to attend the concert, also held at the Bud Walton Arena. Daughtry opened, ending their set with a cover of Prince's "Purple Rain." None of the performers or celebrities who make appearances during the shareholders festivities are compensated, but their production companies all have strong distribution relationships with Walmart. Richard Feloni The headliner was 3 Doors Down, which lauded Walmart's ability to sell albums, as well as its dedication to giving employment options to veterans. I don't listen to either of the bands that performed that night, but the high production quality of the show made it entertaining. Richard Feloni Thursday was the day of tours, and our first stop was a 1.2 million-square-foot distribution center in Bentonville. A key reason why Walmart's prices are remarkably low is because the company controls more of its distribution process than other retailers. Richard Feloni Walmart's forklifts are powered by hydrogen fuel stations, which only need three minutes for a full charge. Richard Feloni Employees are stationed throughout the facility to ensure everything's running smoothly. Richard Feloni The distribution center was truly massive. Richard Feloni A key to competing with rivals like Amazon will be staying on top of technologies that keep the distribution process as efficient as possible, like this new high-speed bar code scanner. The tour ended with a look at a drone (we couldn't photograph it), which can handle a warehouse-wide inventory check in a day — a job that takes a month when done manually. That technology will be at a "mature stage" in six to nine months. Richard Feloni Another key to Walmart's competitive advantage is its truck fleet, which is constantly being redeveloped to be as safe, comfortable, and fuel-efficient as possible. Richard Feloni We then headed to a Sam's Club in Bentonville (Walmart owns the chain, named after its founder), which is being developed as a prototype for what the wholesaler will look like across the world by the end of the year. Richard Feloni There is an emphasis on high-end, fresh seafood, meats, and prepared foods — stuff you'd find at Whole Foods, but cheaper. Richard Feloni Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer said that her company is reinventing itself for a higher-income consumer. This is dramatically emphasized at the Bentonville location, where you can buy a $200,000 necklace. Richard Feloni Walmart US President and CEO Greg Foran led a tour of a Walmart Neighborhood Market in Fayetteville. The Neighborhood Markets are 24/7 supermarkets that are also emphasizing fresh, affordable items. Walmart There were common themes between the Neighborhood Market tour and the Supercenter (the model most affiliated with the brand) tour in Rogers that followed, like the focus on stress-free pickup for online orders. Walmart Walmart's leadership was also eager to point out Walmart Pay, its proprietary answer to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay introduced at the end of last year. Walmart Among all of Walmart's entities is a renewed focus on private-label products. We ended the day at the new Culinary and Innovation Center in Bentonville, where many of these products will be developed. Celebrity chef Robert Irvine, who has an upcoming line of food products at Walmart, stopped by to say hello and praise the company. Richard Feloni Friday was the big day. At 7:30 a.m., the Bud Walton Arena was already roaring. Richard Feloni "The Late Late Show" host James Corden was this year's celebrity emcee. He was hilarious, and it was fun watching him fearlessly — but good-naturedly — roast Walmart's leadership. (For chairman Greg Penner, the husband of Sam Walton's granddaughter Carrie Walton Penner: "He worked tirelessly — at marrying Rob Walton's daughter.") Walmart Updates on Walmart's annual performance were punctuated with musical performances, like this one from Nick Jonas. Walmart A shadow was lingering all week outside of Walmart's bubble — the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which supported protests of what it perceives as Walmart's low wages and lack of opportunity. Its side had a moment in the meeting, when employee Margaret Hooton argued during the section for shareholder proposals that she has yet to see positive changes at her store and is still struggling to make ends meet. Richard Feloni Sam Walton's children — Jim, Alice, and Rob — presented Sam's Club Senior Vice President Cindy O'Connor with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for her work in helping transform the company for a higher-income, more tech-savvy consumer. Walmart Wal-Mart Stores Inc. CEO Doug McMillon — the head of the entire company — gave the keynote. He opened with the story of how Sam Walton built Walmart, using a paper book that had animations projected onto it. He said that Walmart was entering an entirely new chapter in its life, and that it would have ramifications across the industry. "We have the opportunity to reimagine retail again," he said. Walmart McMillon pointed to a $2.7 billion investment in wages and new training programs over the next two years for its 2.3 million employees. He picked an Arkansas Supercenter employee named Dwight Blanton out from the crowd as a model employee and gave him a promotion to assistant manager. Walmart The meeting was capped off with a surprise performance from Katy Perry, complete with a light show and smoke machines. In his memoir, Walton said that the carnivalistic shareholders meetings evolved from a desire to have fun with employees and give them a boost of motivation — and the annual spectacle only grew after his death in 1992. "We like to think that this kind of meeting brings us all closer together and creates the feeling that we are a family committed to one common interest," he wrote.

Wal-Mart begins training academy in Batavia By KERRY FELTNER • October 11, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s training academy started Tuesday in Batavia, Genesee County. The academy’s purpose is to train front-line supervisors. One of the ways the company plans to do so is with a new program called Pathways that helps employees learn leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service, officials said. Academies are a dedicated facility located in, or adjacent to, a Walmart Supercenter where hourly supervisors and department managers receive two weeks of hands-on training that combines both the classroom and the sales floor. “Our training academies help provide associates with the skills they need to succeed and advance, while creating a better and more consistent customer experience,” said Keith Wyche, regional general manager for Wal-Mart. “Skills training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge, which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth and helps make working at Walmart a smart career choice.” At each of the 200 academies nationwide associates will be trained from approximately 25 nearby stores, the company said. This will allow Wal-Mart to train over 140,000 associates a year and will help associates have more access to training. Leaders of the training will include a team of roughly 14 associates with retail operations experience at each site. Follow Kerry Feltner on Twitter: @KerryFeltner © 2016 Rochester Business Journal.

InvestorPlace 10/11/2016 Will Ashworth © Spencer Platt/Getty Images Customers check-out at the newly opened J.C. Penney store at the Gateway Center Mall in Brooklyn, the retail company's first Brooklyn store in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images A recent news report from the New York Post suggests that J.C. Penney (JCP) is copying Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) by putting greeters at the front of its stores. The test, which is being conducted at some JCPenney stores in the Northeast region is a bit of twist on Walmart’s use of greeters. Quotes in the article JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▲ 9.16 +0.35 +3.97% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Cowen Group Inc COWN = 3.20 0.00 0.00% Sears Holdings Corp SHLD ▲ 12.67 +0.43 +3.51% Rather than employing full-time employees at the front of the store for the entire day, they’re being asked to greet customers between the hours of noon and 2 p.m. Why these two hours in the middle of the day? While it’s not entirely clear, I would assume it’s because JC Penney considers these two hours, what they term “power hours,” to be the period in the day where greeters can make the greatest difference between mediocre and above-average revenue at a particular store. Greeters have been successful for Walmart since it reintroduced the idea back in 2012. According to a Cowen and Company survey from late in 2015, 75% of 2,506 Walmart customers surveyed said they were happy with their shopping experience, while 60% found the customer service to be satisfactory. That might not seem like a lot but it’s WMT’s best result in two years. Exactly what does this have to do with JCP and JCPenney stock? 10 Hot Stocks That Made Millionaires in 10 Years Well, despite some employees complaining the two-hour customer schmooze fest was increasing lines at the cash registers, the reality is that JCP has figured out that if it’s to survive and even thrive, it has got to do a better job engaging the customer. It’s not enough to have employees sit at the cash register and take the customers’ money, they’ve got to be out in the front of the store welcoming people. What’s Giving JC Penney Stock New Life? While still early in the test, it’s a good example of why I believe JC Penney stock is going in the right direction compared to Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD), whose latest move to sell its Craftsman brand for up to $2 billion is proof positive the once great department store is gradually winding down its retail operations. Everything most go, including its iconic brands such as Craftsmen and Kenmore. Meanwhile, over at JCP, it’s ramping up appliance sales at its stores, something it abandoned 33 years ago to focus on apparel. JC Penney CEO Marvin Ellison just happens to be a veteran in appliances having been in charge of this product category over the 12 years he was at Home Depot Inc (HD). He certainly made a few connections in the appliance industry during his time at Big Orange. Those will come in handy as it takes the fight to Sears. With something like one-third of JC Penney’s customers buying appliances at other stores where it has locations, it’s a natural fit. Even better — Sears currently generates approximately $4 billion in annual appliances revenue. With Lampert’s company reeling, Ellison is wise to strike while the iron’s hot. A decade ago, the company generated 21% of its overall revenue from home goods. Today, thanks to Ron Johnson’s failed changes, that number’s down to 12%. In the incredibly competitive world of department store retail, JCP has to push as many buttons as it can to attract profitable business. It might not get back to its heyday in 2007, when it generated almost $20 billion in annual revenue, but initiatives like appliances can help it take market share from its peers, including Sears. Ellison’s plan is a simple one. He wants to focus on better customer service, growing its private label brands, stronger e-commerce and better communication between employees. The more time employees spend with customers rather than in back-room tasks, the stronger its business will be. Expected to generate more than $1 billion in EBITDA in fiscal 2016, Ellison’s taking all the things that worked at Home Depot and applying them to JC Penney. With just 10 stores losing money out of slightly more than 1,000, JC Penney is in better shape financially than it has been in the past several years. Bottom Line on JCP JC Penney stock once traded near $90. While it has a long way to go to get to that point, I think Ellison’s got it headed in the right direction. In addition, with both Sears and Macy’s Inc (M) closing stores, JCP has found itself the lucky beneficiary of their misfortune, sometimes resulting in it being the only anchor location left in some of its malls. “They’re second movers in things, and being second mover can be turned into a strength,” Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen recently said. “The world’s not really growing, but you have other retailers with problems that give J.C. Penney an opportunity to execute on.” It might not be the vision Ron Johnson had for the company, but the approach Ellison is taking seems certain to ensure long-term success for the 114-year-old retailer and JC Penney stock. By continuing to take market share from Sears and others in the department store space, I believe JCP could be the next great retailer in America. That’s not something you would have said about JC Penney stock when former CEO Mike Ullman returned to the company in 2013. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack October 11 Follow @sarahhalzack Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery. (Reuters/Mike Segar) Rumors have been brewing for about a year now that e-commerce titan Amazon.com wants to open grocery-centric brick-and-mortar locations. In Seattle and Sunnyvale, Calif., there have been reports that outposts are in the works allowing shoppers to drive up and retrieve grocery orders they place online. On Tuesday, the buzz grew louder when the Wall Street Journal reported many such locations are in the works, and they will not only include curbside pickup, but also walk-in convenience stores where you can purchase perishables. The reports suggest Amazon wants to be a more serious player in the grocery business, and to achieve that, it believes it can’t rely on e-commerce alone. And that potentially sets up a kind of retailing showdown we haven’t quite seen before. For so long, we’ve been watching traditional brick-and-mortar retailers try to notch a win on the digital playing field that is Amazon’s home turf. Now, it appears we’re poised to watch the online shopping pioneer try to march into an arena where the likes of Walmart, Kroger and Giant have distinct advantages. (Amazon’s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) To understand what’s at stake for all of these players, let’s start with a lay of the land. Grocery is something of the final frontier of the online shopping revolution, with just 2 percent or less of sales happening online. There are a variety of reasons for that: Customers have been loathe to give up control of selecting their own produce and meat, and retailers have had a hard time figuring out a durable business model, since the grocery world already operates on razor-thin profit margins. Also, about 80 percent of the U.S. population lives within 2.5 miles of a supermarket, according to Jim Hertel, senior vice president at grocery consultancy Willard Bishop. In other words, buying groceries in person simply isn’t that inconvenient, especially compared to the other types of purchases that have moved online in greater proportions.  [What to expect from Whole Foods’ new, low-price grocery chain] That hasn’t stopped Amazon from trying to turn us into online grocery shoppers. For several years now, it has been experimenting with an offering called AmazonFresh, in which Prime members can pay a fee to be able to get fresh groceries brought to their doorsteps. It’s not hard to see why Amazon would want to be the retailer you turn to when it’s time to restock your refrigerator and pantry. Grocery is a loyalty business, one built on frequent trips from repeat shoppers. This fits in well with what it has been trying to do with its Prime membership for years: Get people hooked on a bundle of shopping and services that mean they rarely have to leave the Amazon ecosystem. Amazon declined to comment for this story. If it now opens brick-and-mortar grocery locations, Amazon would appear to be acknowledging that some kinds of purchases just might not be well-suited for the doorstep-delivery model. The problem for Amazon, though, is that other big retailers have already had this revelation — and have assets that might better equip them to pull off curbside pickup models. Take Walmart, for example. The nation’s largest grocer has been investing in expansion of its grocery pickup model, taking it from five markets to more than 80 in about year’s a time. The retailer expects to have this service in 600 individual stores by the end of this year and will add 500 more locations in the year ahead. For Walmart, going big with pickup involves relatively low risk: The big-box store simply has to add four to nine staffers per store and must reconfigure its parking lots. [How Walmart plans to transform the way we buy groceries] Kroger, Giant and other big supermarkets also have existing infrastructure to make pickup relatively easy to get off the ground. But for Amazon, the investment is riskier and more time-consuming: It has to build a real estate portfolio from scratch and must change up its supply chain to get goods to these facilities. Still, brick-and-mortar grocery sellers are likely keeping a close eye on Amazon’s maneuvers in this space. The Seattle company has a track record of elbowing its way into new lines of business, and the Amazon brand is especially strong with U.S. consumers, according to research by YouGov. Other kinds of retailers, too, should be ready for a fight, as much of our grocery budgets these days are spent at convenience stores, drugstores and discounters. And yet, while these moves by Amazon would likely be unsettling for direct competitors, it might bring a strange sense of relief to a wider slate of traditional retailers. For years, legacy players have been arguing that stores will continue to be relevant, with e-commerce and physical retailing helping feed one another. If Amazon — the ultimate in pure-play digital shopping — is pushed to open physical stores, it effectively suggests that this analysis was right. And actually, even if Amazon grocery outposts don’t materialize, Amazon has essentially already conceded that brick-and-mortar locations are valuable. The company has begun opening bookstores. business business true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(Photo by Paul Sakuma, AP) Amazon's stores will sell perishable goods, including milk and meats, the Wall Street Journal reports. (Photo by Paul Sakuma, AP) By BLOOMBERG Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Amazon.com Inc. is planning to build convenience stores and develop curbside pickup locations for food shoppers in its latest move to expand into groceries, The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon’s stores will sell perishable goods including milk and meats, the newspaper said. Customers in the stores can also order other items with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery, the Journal said. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant will also build drive-in locations for consumers in a rush where online grocery orders will be brought to the car. Only subscribers to Amazon’s Fresh service will have access to these stores, known as Project Como. Amazon representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The grocery stores represent Amazon’s latest move to disrupt brick-and-mortar food shopping that’s still dominated by traditional retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. While Amazon has dominated in e-commerce, convincing customers to shop online for everything from toiletries to electronics, it has yet to crack groceries -- which most consumers still buy offline. Previously, Amazon had focused on fresh food deliveries rather than establishing a physical presence but it’s encountering increased competition from Google, Instacart and others. Wal-Mart, whose main selling point has been its physical reach, started a grocery pickup service more than a year ago and has now expanded it to more than 100 markets. Customers can purchase online, drive to the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store and have their orders delivered to their cars. Even as Amazon uses the Fresh grocery service and Prime membership to keep customers loyal, Wal-Mart is trying to create a better online experience.

Erin Peters, 35, was shopping at a Walmart in Post Falls, Idaho last Friday when she says a police officer grabbed her from behind and told her she was under arrest.

According to Peters, officers working with the FBI and the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed her to be 18-year-old Whitley Evenson, wanted in Missouri over allegations she suffocated her six-week-old child in 2015. According to the Associated Press, police had received a tip that Evenson had shaved her head in order to try and evade identification by police. Peters, who underwent a double mastectomy in August, says she started shaving her head while undergoing aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment to battle her breast cancer. “I honestly thought I was being mugged,” Peters told KHQ News in Idaho. “They accused me of murder. I heard them say ‘Whitley Evenson, you are under arrest for murder.’ I said ‘I’m not Whitley, please you’ve got the wrong person.’ I was then called a liar. Tears started rolling.” READ MORE: Ryan Reynolds remembers cancer victim Connor McGrath in 14th birthday tribute Peters said she tried to prove her innocence by showing officers her ID, but it wasn’t enough. “They said flat out, identify theft isn’t that hard,” Peters said. “I couldn’t have been more shocked. They tightened the cuffs.” Peters was detained and questioned for approximately 45 minutes before police realized the error and let her go. While officers apologized to Peters, she says it’s not enough. “The way they went about this was so wrong,” Peters said. However, FBI spokesman Richard Collodi is defending the decision to detain Peters, saying police were acting on a tip that Evenson, along with a male accomplice, was expected to be at the Post Falls Walmark that day. Officers arrested Evenson later that same day, in the same parking lot where Peters was questioned. She will be extradited back to Missouri where she faces second-degree murder charges in the death of her child. Collodi says that while he regrets the inconvenience to Peters, criminals often come up with creative excuses to try and fool law enforcement and the extra caution was warranted. “I’m confident she was treated professionally,” Collodi told the Associated Press. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

(AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Recent Posts: 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy Buffett Should Buy Every Last Share of Nike Inc (NKE) Stock 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Be Knocked Back Down to Earth View All Posts A recent news report from the New York Post suggests that J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) is copying Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) by putting greeters at the front of its stores. The test, which is being conducted at some JCPenney stores in the Northeast region is a bit of twist on Walmart’s use of greeters. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Rather than employing full-time employees at the front of the store for the entire day, they’re being asked to greet customers between the hours of noon and 2 p.m. Why these two hours in the middle of the day? While it’s not entirely clear, I would assume it’s because JCPenney considers these two hours, what they term “power hours,” to be the period in the day where greeters can make the greatest difference between mediocre and above-average revenue at a particular store. Greeters have been successful for Walmart since it reintroduced the idea back in 2012. According to a Cowen and Company survey from late in 2015, 75% of 2,506 Walmart customers surveyed said they were happy with their shopping experience, while 60% found the customer service to be satisfactory. That might not seem like a lot but it’s WMT’s best result in two years. Exactly what does this have to do with JCP and JCPenney stock? 10 Hot Stocks That Made Millionaires in 10 Years Well, despite some employees complaining the two-hour customer schmooze fest was increasing lines at the cash registers, the reality is that JCP has figured out that if it’s to survive and even thrive, it has got to do a better job engaging the customer. It’s not enough to have employees sit at the cash register and take the customers’ money, they’ve got to be out in the front of the store welcoming people. What’s Giving JCPenney Stock New Life? While still early in the test, it’s a good example of why I believe JCPenney stock is going in the right direction compared to Sears Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:SHLD), whose latest move to sell its Craftsman brand for up to $2 billion, is proof positive the once great department store is gradually winding down its retail operations. Everything most go, including its iconic brands such as Craftsmen and Kenmore. Meanwhile, over at JCP, it’s ramping up appliance sales at its stores, something it abandoned 33 years ago to focus on apparel. JCPenney CEO Marvin Ellison just happens to be a veteran in appliances having been in charge of this product category over the 12 years he was at Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD). He certainly made a few connections in the appliance industry during his time at Big Orange. Those will come in handy as it takes the fight to Sears. With something like one-third of JCPenney’s customers buying appliances at other stores where it has locations, it’s a natural fit. Even better — Sears currently generates approximately $4 billion in annual appliances revenue. With Lampert’s company reeling, Ellison is wise to strike while the iron’s hot. A decade ago, the company generated 21% of its overall revenue from home goods. Today, thanks to Ron Johnson’s failed changes, that number’s down to 12%. In the incredibly competitive world of department store retail, JCP has to push as many buttons as it can to attract profitable business. It might not get back to its heyday in 2007, when it generated almost $20 billion in annual revenue, but initiatives like appliances can help it take market share from its peers, including Sears. Ellison’s plan is a simple one. He wants to focus on better customer service, growing its private label brands, stronger e-commerce and better communication between employees. The more time employees spend with customers rather than in back-room tasks, the stronger its business will be. Expected to generate more than $1 billion in EBITDA in fiscal 2016, Ellison’s taking all the things that worked at Home Depot and applying them to JCPenney.

Brokers, travel agents, insurance agents and even bankers are finding there’s an app for that. Source: Simon Cunningham via Flickr (Modified) But while banking apps are great for handling deposits and trades, they may not be great for actually lending money. The whole crowdfunding “thing,” which was a big trend early this decade, may be going the way of the farmer’s market and the gig economy, not because there isn’t supply or demand, but because people lie. That’s the problem facing LendingClub Corp (NYSE:LC), the peer-to-peer lender that came public near the end of 2014 at nearly $24 per share. People aren’t paying back the money, cash flow has flat-lined, the stock is trading at around $6 and Wedbush’s new price target is $3.75. What Went Wrong for LC Stock? Lending Club, founded in 2007, pioneered the peer-to-peer lending idea in the U.S. Consumers seek loans, the company pairs them up with money, and then institutions buy the loans for the interest. The stock crashed in May after an internal review of its CEO and founder, Rene Laplanche, showed problems with $22 million in loans. Laplanche was then ousted when a board investigation found he had undisclosed interests in some big buyers of the company’s loans. Government investigators are now looking into Laplanche’s actions. 10 Hot Stocks That Made Millionaires in 10 Years The scandal led to a loss of $81.4 million, 21 cents per share, for the second quarter, and the company has been fighting to regain its credibility ever since, while the rest of the industry fought to keep the contagion at bay. LC stock has remade its C-suite, promoting Scott Sanborn to CEO, cutting 179 jobs and recruiting hedge funds to buy its loan portfolio. Despite this it posted a negative return in August, and the fight against negative publicity has proven to be problematic. What Might Go Right All the company’s efforts over the last few months have been aimed at putting the actions of the previous few years in its rear-view mirror. New Chief Capital Officer Patrick Dunne, formerly with Blackrock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), has sought to reassure investors that loan buyers are returning to the platform and that a thorough review of the Laplanche era and the loan portfolio has been conducted. Wedbush does not believe it. The company’s latest note on the company calls a turnaround three to five years away, and said it’s now evaluating LC stock as a lender rather than a fintech company. Right now analysts are expecting another loss, 10 cents per share, on revenue of $99.5 million when Lending Club reports its numbers on Nov. 1. That would mean it will have cut its losses in half but cut its revenues by nearly two-thirds. It’s easy to see those results getting Lending Club close to the Wedbush price target. Still, getting loans into the hands of strong buyers and assuring borrowers that the platform works may bring out the bulls. Turning 19% credit card debt into 12% term loans should be a good business for both sides of the transaction, assuming borrowers’ feet can be held to the fire, and increasing those rates to deal with bad loans should improve the bottom line. Back to the Drawing Board for Lending Club The problems of Lending Club have sent many in the crowdfunding space back to the drawing board. There are now specialty platforms in real estate, video games and emerging markets. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) vs. JD.Com (JD) – Which Is the Better Growth Stock? The battle is on to find investors and institutions who will take these loans in bulk, which happens to be what Lending Club has spent the last few months bragging it has. Still, banking scandals take time to clean up. LC stock has boomed, it has busted, and it is now trying to move beyond. History shows that takes time, and only very patient investors should go near it right now.

Scroll down for video  Amazon plans to launch convinces stores and drive-in locations for AmazonFresh members in a bid to become a major player in the competitive grocery business. The brick-and-mortar stores, known internally as Project Como, which will sell perishable items WHAT IS PROJECT COMO?  People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Amazon will be opening convinces stores and drive-in locations in a bid to upend the supermarket industry. The brick-and-mortar stores, known internally as Project Como, will sell fresh produce, milk meats and other perishables. Customers will be able to order items with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery using a mobile app or touch screens placed throughout the stores. Both service are said to only be available to AmazonFresh members.  An Amazon spokeswoman told DailyMail.com: 'We don’t comment on rumors or speculations.' The Seattle firm’s move is a way to show presence in an industry that is still dominated by traditional retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, who owns 17.3 percent of the market share – compared to Amazon’s 1.1 percent. Amazon has been selling groceries since 2013 via the platform with its AmazonFresh, which works similar to FreshDirect, but hasn’t really taken off because of a $299 yearly membership fee – Amazon announced this week that Prime users now pay $15 per month. But people familiar with Project Como told The Wall Street Journal that Amazon has plans to push deeper into the grocery business. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Do YOU own a Samsung Galaxy Note 7?

And the leaked images show a piece of the equipment on the site that says ‘Amazon Ballard’ in two places – ‘designating where it was to be delivered’, Todd Bishop with GeekWire reports. Prior to this citing, the newspaper discovered a permit document that was filed with the city of Seattle that read: ‘storage racks insulation plans on main floor for Amazon’. The work site is near the Ballard Bridge at NW 51st Street and 15th Avenue NW. This storefront could be the first location to allow customers to schedule 15-minute to two-hour delivery times to pick up their goods.  AMAZON OPENING MORE BRICK-AND-MORTAR BOOK STORES  Amazon is planning to launch a brick-and-mortar bookstore in Chicago, Illinois.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Five months after shaking hands with Apple, retailer Kohl's is starting to compete with the tech giant's mobile-payment service Apple Pay. For Apple, the market leader of in-store mobile payments, moves like Kohl's are becoming increasingly familiar. Over the summer, Walmart rolled out its own mobile-payment service nationwide and pharmacy chain CVS introduced CVS Pay. Apple Pay, which turns two years old this month, is facing stiffer competition and needs to find ways to stand out in a crowded field. In the next year, most retailers and fast-food restaurants will start their own mobile-payment services, and some of them will also offer Apple Pay. The service, which expanded into Russia earlier this month, is looking to absorb more functions of people's traditional wallets, such as transit cards and retail loyalty cards. "You want to get into as many use cases as possible," said Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix Marketing International. "The wallet app is ideally suited to self-service types of terminals: gas pumps, vending machines, transit. All of this stuff builds transactions. All of these things build up utility." Related Stories Apple Pay Expands to U.K. as First Market Outside U.S. Samsung Prepares for Olympics With Mobile Payments Rollout in Brazil How the Shift from Swiping to Inserting Cards Will Accelerate Mobile Payments Can Apple Make Mobile Payments Pay in the U.S.? Apple hasn't disclosed terms it's reached for Apple Pay or broken out sales it gets from the service. Assuming it gets a small percentage of every transaction, the revenue is still negligible for the company, which posted total sales of almost $234 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That revenue included $19.9 billion in services, of which transaction fees are a part. The value of in-store transactions by people paying with their mobile phones, known as proximity payments, is expected to reach $210 billion by 2019 in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer. While that may produce a small but growing stream of revenue for the the technology giant, the Apple Pay feature may also make the company's phones more attractive, boosting loyalty among users and helping Apple compete with rivals like Samsung. Apple has spent much of the past two years raising awareness of its payment feature and getting consumers to use it in stores, apps and, most recently, online. Services such as Apple Pay accounted for 9% of in-store credit-card transactions and about 5% of credit-card dollars spent, according to a May survey by Phoenix, which asked some 5,100 adults about their spending over one month. While it's made headway, Apple Pay has a way to go to gain mass adoption, partly because some people don't see it as an improvement over the current way of doing things. To boost usage, Apple needs to show its product is superior than a credit card. According to Pymnts.com and InfoScout, 58% of people in a June survey said Apple Pay is just as easy as a card, while 56% of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users said both methods take about the same time. "They haven't proven their mobile-wallet applications are better than existing payment mechanisms," said Jordan McKee, a senior analyst for payments at 451 Research. Adding value is "the next frontier for this whole space." The company declined to comment for this story. Banks and retailers see a big part of that value addressed by integrating payments more deeply with rewards, coupons and loyalty programs. Capital One Financial has added more transaction analysis and control features, said Tom Poole, a managing vice president at the bank. It lets customers activate and disable their bank-issued cards via its app. Samsung Pay lets users earn gift cards from Dunkin' Donuts as well as earn money with its own rewards prepaid card. Alphabet, the parent of Google, tested its own loyalty program, the Tap 10, earlier this year. Last week, Kohl's unveiled its mobile-payment option, Kohl's Pay, which will integrate its private-label credit card into its mobile app. That will let the more than 25 million Kohl's Charge users to pay for purchases with their mobile phones. The service was announced five months after Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl's added Apple Pay to its mobile app. "We are interested in supporting payments -- whatever payments our customers feel like are important to them," Ratnakar Lavu, Kohl's chief technology officer, said in an interview. Kohl's Pay users will be able to redeem Kohl's Cash, apply a coupon and pay for a transaction with one click -- something they can't do with Apple Pay. Apple is also ramping up its services. This month, commuters in Japan will be able to use Apple Pay to buy railway tickets, which could prove to be a huge opportunity for Apple. Operator East Japan Railway Co. alone served 17.4 million passengers a day in the year that ended in March, and Apple has added special chips to its iPhones to support the service. Apple Pay already works on the London Underground, buses and other forms of transit there. "We've taken away the whole step of people having to buy a ticket," said Shashi Verma, director of customer experience at Transport for London. Apple is looking to serve more transit systems as cities like New York and Boston move toward tap-based mobile payments as an option. Some commuter rail lines servicing both cities currently let customers buy tickets from within an app. While Apple doesn't have its own loyalty program, it is making it easier for consumers to take advantage of merchant reward plans. In June, it began working with Orange Cash, a mobile-payment app for customers of French telecom giant Orange SA. Orange Cash uses geo-location to personalize offers sent to users' phones and rewards them for loyalty to particular brands. Apple Pay is also integrated into the app of Walgreens Boots Alliance. -- Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Digital Financial Services Restaurants Retail Shopper Marketing Technology The CMO Guide Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

For Apple, the market leader of in-store mobile payments, moves like Kohl’s are becoming increasingly familiar. Over the summer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. rolled out its own mobile-payment service  nationwide and pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp.  introduced CVS Pay. Apple Pay, which turns 2 years old this month, is facing stiffer competition and needs to find ways to stand out in a crowded field. In the next year, most retailers and fast-food restaurants will start their own mobile-payment services, and some of them will also offer Apple Pay. The service, which expanded into Russia earlier this month, is looking to absorb more functions of people’s traditional wallets, such as transit cards and retail loyalty cards. “You want to get into as many use cases as possible,” said Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix Marketing International. “The wallet app is ideally suited to self-service types of terminals: gas pumps, vending machines, transit. All of this stuff builds transactions. All of these things build up utility.” Apple hasn’t disclosed terms it’s reached for Apple Pay or broken out sales it gets from the service. Assuming it gets a small percentage of every transaction, the revenue is still negligible for the company, which posted total sales of almost $234 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That revenue included $19.9 billion in services, of which transaction fees are a part. The value of in-store transactions by people paying with their mobile phones, known as proximity payments, is expected to reach $210 billion by 2019 in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer Inc. While that may produce a small but growing stream of revenue for the the technology giant, the Apple Pay feature may also make the company’s phones more attractive, boosting loyalty among users and helping Apple compete with rivals like Samsung Electronics Co.  Apple has spent much of the past two years raising awareness of its payment feature and getting consumers to use it in stores, apps and, most recently, online. Services such as Apple Pay accounted for 9 percent of in-store credit-card transactions and about 5 percent of credit-card dollars spent, according to a May survey by Phoenix, which asked some 5,100 adults about their spending over one month. While it’s made headway, Apple Pay has a way to go to gain mass adoption, partly because some people don’t see it as an improvement over the current way of doing things. To boost usage, Cupertino, California-based Apple needs to show its product is superior than a credit card. According to Pymnts.com and InfoScout, 58 percent of people in a June  survey said Apple Pay is just as easy as a card, while 56 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users said both methods take about the same time. ‘Adding Value’ “They haven’t proven their mobile-wallet applications are better than existing payment mechanisms,” said Jordan McKee, a senior analyst for payments at 451 Research. Adding value is “the next frontier for this whole space.” The company declined to comment for this story. Banks and retailers see a big part of that value addressed by integrating payments more deeply with rewards, coupons and loyalty programs. Capital One Financial Corp. has added more transaction analysis and control features, said Tom Poole, a managing vice president at the bank. It lets customers activate and disable their bank-issued cards via its app. Samsung Pay lets users earn gift cards from Dunkin’ Donuts as well as earn money with its own rewards prepaid card. Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, tested its own loyalty program, the Tap 10, earlier this year. Last week, Kohl’s unveiled its mobile-payment option, Kohl’s Pay, which will integrate its private-label credit card into its mobile app. That will let the more than 25 million Kohl’s Charge users to pay for purchases with their mobile phones. The service was announced five months after Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s added Apple Pay to its mobile app. “We are interested in supporting payments -- whatever payments our customers feel like are important to them,” Ratnakar Lavu, Kohl’s chief technology officer, said in an interview. Kohl’s Pay users will be able to redeem Kohl’s Cash, apply a coupon and pay for a transaction with one click -- something they can’t do with Apple Pay.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) will soon open convenience stores and curbside pickup locations as the retail giant delves deeper into the grocery world. From the Wall Street Journal: The Seattle company aims to build small brick-and-mortar stores that would sell produce, milk, meats and other perishable items that customers can take home, these people say. Primarily using their mobile phones or, possibly, touch screens around the store, customers could also order peanut butter, cereal and other goods with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery. For customers seeking a quicker checkout, Amazon will soon begin rolling out designated drive-in locations where online grocery orders will be brought to the car, the people said. The company is developing license-plate reading technology to speed wait times. The move once again pits Amazon directly up against fellow retail giant Wal-Mart, as many of Wal-Mart’s thousands of retail locations include full or partial grocery stores. Amazon has also been taking a chunk out of Sam’s Club and Costco subscription businesses. Shoppers can expect Amazon’s new grocery service in densely-populated urban areas first. Amazon plans to roll the service out to customers who are already ordering groceries using its existing grocery services: The grocery stores, known internally as Project Como, are for now slated exclusively for customers of its Fresh subscription service, which promises same-day food delivery at set times, the people said. Last week, Amazon dropped its $299 annual price for Fresh and instituted a $15 monthly fee, available to members of its $99 Prime delivery service. For now, Amazon isn’t commenting on the report, but we’ll be sure to follow up on this developing story as the new service gets closer to launch. Amazon shares fell $7.14 (-0.85%) to $834.57 in Tuesday morning trading. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 23.49%, versus a 5.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Already frail and feeling weak from her treatments, she said the process was not only painful but also “humiliating.” “I want an apology,” said Erin Peters. “I felt like I was extremely wronged. They went about it excessively. I was blatantly called a liar.” Peters said she was running a few errands at a Walmart after leaving a radiation appointment. She said law enforcement approached her from behind and put her in handcuffs. “I honestly thought I was being mugged,” she said. “They accused me of murder. I heard them say ‘Whitley Evenson, you are under arrest for murder.’ I said ‘I’m not Whitley, please you’ve got the wrong person.’ I was then called a liar. Tears started rolling.” Peters said she tried to clear up the mess by showing them proof of her identity. She said she was blown off. “They said flat out, identify theft isn’t that hard,” she said. “I couldn’t have been more shocked. They tightened the cuffs.” Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Who Am I Supposed To Call When My Credit Card Info Is Stolen? Image courtesy of frankieleon October 11, 2016 9:00 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk is anyone listening to me walmart sam's club target fbi credit cards debit cards cyber-crime crime fraud fraudulent activity data breaches You just found out your credit or debit card info has been used by someone else to make a fraudulent purchase. There are so many different people you can call, each involved in some aspect of this theft. There’s your bank that issued the card, the credit card network the issuer uses for that card, the retailer or website that processed the payment, the police, the FBI… Do you need to call all of these or just one or two? What if you think your incident might be a sign of a larger breach? Recently, a couple of Consumerist readers wrote in to share experiences with online fraud — an experience familiar to many, but still upsetting every time it happens to you. Cyber Crime Woes In the first case, reader Peter paid a parking meter near his local Target store using a credit card that he’d otherwise used exclusively at the retailer. He also use the card to make a purchase inside the store. Later that day, he noticed fraudulent online purchases pending on this account, including one at Target.com. He alerted his bank, Wells Fargo, and they took care of it on their end, but it made him wonder if Target had been compromised, considering the perpetrators would have needed access to the CVV number (that three-digit number printed on the back of the card) and the billing address on file with the company. Another reader, Ken, had similar concerns about a larger breach when his Walmart-branded card was used to try to purchase two expensive smartphones using the information stored in his Sam’s Club account. Ken only became aware of the issue when he was notified by email that Sam’s Club had canceled the first of two orders because the item was out of stock. His card wasn’t successfully charged as a result. He too, was worried that Sam’s Club had suffered a data breach, possibly exposing his personal information. But when he brought his concerns to the company, he says they would only provide a mailing address to communicate with the corporate office. So Was There A Breach? We spoke with reps for both Target and Sam’s Club, who each claimed that these incidents were not indicative of a larger data breach. A Sam’s Club spokeswoman said that situations like Ken’s “are usually a result a customer’s username and password being acquired by a third party in ways unrelated to Walmart or Sam’s Club, for example through phishing, malware or a breach of another company’s system.” Who Do You Notify First? Peter did the right thing by contacting his bank about the unauthorized transactions, according to Will Bales, a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Cyber Division. He told Consumerist that people with compromised cards should first contact the bank or financial institution that issued their card to ensure they won’t be liable for any fraudulent activity. And do it quickly. While the law limits consumers’ liability on fraudulent credit and debit card transactions, the card issuer must be told immediately. Waiting more than few days to report a fraudulent debit card transaction can significantly increase the amount of the fraud you’re liable for. Target and Sam’s Club agree. “If a guest suspects fraudulent purchases, he or she should immediately report it to the card-issuing bank,” a Target spokeswoman told Consumerist. “It is the responsibility of the credit card company to investigate any case of a potential fraudulent purchase. Target fully cooperates with these types of investigations and provides all requested documentation.” The Sam’s Club spokeswoman also urged members to file a dispute with their financial institution as well, adding, “We can also work with the member to provide a copy of the receipt of any transactional details needed to dispute the charges.” Should I Tell The FBI? After you’ve squared things away with your bank, you can also bring the issue to the attention to any retailers involved, though they will likely point you, again, toward your banking or financial institution, and may offer other advice like changing your password. Bales suggests wronged consumers should also file a complaint with the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center, known as IC3. Once a complaint has been submitted, what happens next depends on what kind of information the FBI receives, Bales explains, but don’t expect to turn on the news in two days and see an FBI strike force knocking down the doors of the ID thieves who used your card info to buy a pizza. “In an ideal world we’d like to hit the ground running as quickly as we can, but due to the statutes and our legal system, we like to get several similar cases that we may believe to be the same subject behind the fraud,” Bales tells Consumerist. “With multiple complaints we develop a better picture and a better understanding, that will further our investigation.” Consumers can also file a police report if they have local law enforcement they’re comfortable working with, Bales suggests. Local police will have information gathered on some of these cases, and the FBI often works with departments on bigger schemes that are out there, “so we can bring down the groups that have been doing this, whether in individual cities or on a nationwide basis,” he says. There’s the option of calling up your local FBI field office as well, so you can speak with a human being on the phone, Bales notes, promising that there are people ready to listen. “We understand the frustration that some people feel whether they’ve lost $30 or $3,000,” he says. “Sometimes they don’t feel that justice is acting quite as quickly as they’d like, but we’re perfectly fine with them inquiring,” and if possible, let them know authorities are conducting a larger investigation. But Will My One Complaint Even Matter? Given the size of some data breaches, affecting more than 100 million people in certain cases, you might think one little complaint against a stranger won’t change anything or identify a larger breach, but you’d be wrong, Bales says. “Sometimes you don’t know something is a problem until you start seeing that bigger picture,” he says. “We start seeing, ‘Wait a second, these are all connected!’ — and by all we’re talking about hundreds or maybe thousands of complaints… That leads us to start asking some different questions.” Oftentimes companies will contact the FBI themselves after they’ve done their due diligence, so when it comes to identifying big breaches, “it’s a little bit of both.” When To Take Extra Steps Christina Tetreault, staff attorney for Consumers Union, says as long as it’s just your payment information that’s been compromised — and not a breach that involves more personally identifying information like your Social Security number or date of birth — you shouldn’t suffer financially in these cases. “Thanks to strong protections under federal law, your financial losses due to fraud on a credit or debit card are limited. Moreover, if just the card number was stolen, your larger exposure to fraud is pretty limited,” she explains. “As long as you take some simple steps to make sure your bank knows, get another card, and watch your other accounts, then you’re pretty much covered.” She warns consumers against paying any company that offers to protect your identity in these situations. “Identity theft protection companies sell the idea that their services will protect you when your payment card info has been compromised,” she points out. “Generally, most identity theft monitoring protects against new account fraud. That’s when crooks open a new account in your name. That’s not a danger if only your payment card numbers were stolen. Your risk then is fraud on your existing accounts. Since it won’t help prevent existing account fraud, it’s probably not a good idea to run out and buy some expensive identity theft protection because you found out your payment card info was comprised.” However, if scamsters have accessed more personally identifying information, that’s when you should take additional steps to protect yourself from identity theft, like initiating a security freeze to prevent fraudsters from opening accounts in your name. To that end, Consumers Union has a great checklist of what to do in those situations. Precaution Is Important Bales emphasizes the role precaution can have in avoiding such situations in the first place, noting that consumers should be suspicious — “don’t just swipe your card at anything that has a card swipe to it,” for example — and update your card if possible. “If there’s a chance you can update your card to a newer technology, update your card — that will help you out,” Bales advises. Tetreault adds that there are some easy ways you can protect your personal information to keep fraudsters from accessing things they shouldn’t. “Crooks are getting more and more sophisticated, so taking steps to secure your information is good practice,” she advises. “That means, always use good data security hygiene: safeguard your computers and mobile devices with passwords, shred documents with your personal information, consider a security freeze for your credit reports, and take whatever additional steps you can to keep your personal information private.” Was this helpful?

Behind the scenes, she dispenses copies of the self-help book “The Untethered Soul” to her contestants, trying to calm them down before live performances. On camera, she showcases an eclectic style — like an outfit covered in paper flowers — meant to counteract any last-minute jitters. This story first appeared in the October 11, 2016 issue of Variety.

Related Laverne Cox Teases Fox’s ‘Rocky Horror’: ‘It’s No Holds Barred’ “I think it makes the contestants feel safer,” says Cyrus of her colorful wardrobe. “When I turn around, people laugh and feel lighthearted. I think they get to see that side of me.” For many years, Cyrus had a different public persona. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” It’s hard to keep a straight face when Cyrus uses that line — she’s only 23. Then again, she’s been on television since grade school. At 11, Cyrus was cast as the squeaky-clean face of Disney Channel’s “Hannah Montana,” which made her the Hayley Mills of her generation. The role brought intense tabloid scrutiny, particularly as she tried to grow up. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” In 2013, the Miley media circus reached a tipping point at the VMAs, where she gyrated alongside a row of teddy bears. She insists that the moment was misunderstood. “That was a joke,” she says. Cyrus has taken a U-turn since then. Her new career path revolves around her foundation: Happy Hippie, dedicated to supporting at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. “I am only doing ‘The Voice’ because that helps Happy Hippie,” Cyrus says about engaging the show’s audience to promote her cause. Cyrus has headlined such films as “The Last Song” and “Bolt,” but she’s ambivalent about making movies now. “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” She almost turned down the Woody Allen TV series “Crisis in Six Scenes” but was eventually won over by the role — playing a 1960s activist. Related Helen Mirren Talks ‘Fast 8,’ Women in Hollywood and Pay Inequality Over a vegan lunch in Los Angeles, Cyrus talked about what drives her, recalled how she struggled with her pansexual identity as a teenager (she’s currently dating Liam Hemsworth), and shared her thoughts on the election. You just filled in as host of Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show. I had to introduce Sarah Jessica Parker, and she asked me if I had any friends that are voting for Donald Trump. I was like, “Do you think I have friends that would vote for Donald Trump. Come on! Who do you think I’m hanging out with?” The country is very polarized. This is not a dig. But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate. Were you always a Hillary Clinton supporter? I was a really big Bernie supporter. What do you say to Bernie supporters who still won’t vote for Hillary? That’s fucking crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally pissing me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place. Where did your sense of activism come from? I think I just felt so stupid. I felt like what I was doing didn’t have value, because being a pop star was really silly when people are homeless and hungry. In 2013, when I did the VMAs, it became the biggest story in the world. I never expected that to happen. I just did my own thing. I went out there dressed as a teddy bear, danced with teddy bears, never thought about the world thinking that was going to be a bad thing. Did the experience make you feel bad about yourself? It was making me feel like I was living a dumb life — like I should just pick another job. I didn’t understand my power at that point. People listen because of who I am, so instead of being embarrassed, I should say: “Fuck yeah, I got the microphone.” Related Scarlett Johansson Fights for Planned Parenthood and Women’s Health How did you become involved with the LGBTQ community? My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word “bisexual,” because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and shit never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand. Did you talk to them about how you felt? Yeah. My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I fucking hated it. My nails look like shit. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” When did you first identity as pansexual? I think when I figured out what it was. I went to the LGBTQ center here in L.A., and I started hearing these stories. I saw one human in particular who didn’t identify as male or female. Looking at them, they were both: beautiful and sexy and tough but vulnerable and feminine but masculine. And I related to that person more than I related to anyone in my life. Even though I may seem very different, people may not see me as neutral as I feel. But I feel very neutral. I think that was the first gender-neutral person I’d ever met. Once I understood my gender more, which was unassigned, then I understood my sexuality more. I was like, “Oh — that’s why I don’t feel straight and I don’t feel gay. It’s because I’m not.” Why do you think inequality still exists for women in Hollywood? A lot of it could be changed if we had a female president. That would give us a subconscious boost. I think people will have to realize they’re looking really dated. For example, there’s a show called “Supergirl.” I think having a show with a gender attached to it is weird. One, it’s a woman on that fucking billboard — it’s not a little girl. Two, what if you’re a little boy who wants to be a girl so bad that this makes you feel bad? I think having a title like “Supergirl” doesn’t give the power that people think it does. Where does your power come from? My empowerment comes from feeling like I have a purpose now. On my tombstone, I didn’t want the “Wrecking Ball” lyrics. I wanted it to be something greater. I’m the only fucking Disney star who would say I’m pro lesbian and gay, before it was OK to say that. Did you get in trouble? I actually didn’t, because a lot of the dudes that work for Disney are gay, so they were very happy to have someone on their side. You’re a mentor on “The Voice.” Do you think you’ll do more seasons? I don’t know. I definitely would like to if it made sense. I haven’t done the live shows yet. I want to see how that feels. They might be a lot more pressure. Do you not like live TV? I don’t mind the live TV as much as I do that America gets to vote when it comes to “The Voice,” and America did vote for Donald Trump to be the candidate. I actually told my team they can be the Bernie Sanders of “The Voice.” Related Miley Cyrus Stands Up for Homeless Youth How often do you cry on the show? When I have to kick them off. It’s a nightmare. For a non-confrontational person, it’s the worst gig ever. How did you get cast in the Woody Allen TV series? Were you a fan of his work? I am. I had moved, and the only thing that I brought into my new house was a picture of Woody Allen. My first night I slept in my new house, [my manager] called and said, “Woody wants you to fly to New York.” I loved working with Woody. You do like two takes. He just wants to go home and have dinner with his wife. One night it was 5:30, and the camera operator wanted to do another take. He goes, “I can’t dedicate my entire life to making movies.” Many people are now having a conversation about whether it’s possible to separate the art from the artist. Were you aware of the sexual-abuse allegations made by Dylan Farrow against her dad, and if so, did that give you pause? I live a similar life to Woody — I live a public life. Until I know someone and I know their story, I never really judge anyone. That’s kind of how I went into it. From the way I saw him with his family, I never saw him be anything but an incredible person and a really great dad. People might slam me for saying that. I’m sure it was a hard time for that family. My family has been through hard things, and I think everyone’s suffering is different. What do your parents think about your work now? On “The Voice,” this young girl started crying when she left, because I’m the reason she came out. My mom started crying. She was like, “I’m so sorry about the way I was when you were that age and coming out.” She never understood me until she saw that girl who couldn’t be herself. It was very cool.

That he’s going to molest children right in front of you? Not that you would mind, right? Money talks. “I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever.” Yeah, with people like you representing the LBGT community, the hope is not that the “P” will be tacked on for “pansexual”, but rather “pedophile”. You call into question whether that community doesn’t just want to see every kink known to man legitimized and protected from prosecution. You really give the movement a bad name(or a more accurate representation?). As for identifying as a “pansexual”, has your generation never heard the term “tomboy”? Both men and women have feminine aspects of their personalities. It doesn’t mean they are transgender or homosexual.

First, Supergirl and Superwoman are two different characters, where Supergirl actually is a girl for crying out loud. Second, she’s the most ignorant imbecile to live. Third, just a few weeks ago, wasn’t Miley the one getting teenagers to grope her. WOW and people are calling her a good role model. Reply Everton Carter (@therealeverton) says: October 12, 2016 at 1:06 am Suprtgirl the TV show stars a woman, playing a woman. They did a whole scene about it and the reason they gave for her accepting the name Supergirl was weak and unconvincing. Reply Patricia Rathbun says: October 11, 2016 at 4:13 pm Wow, I love this interview, she is amazing. So much maturity for one so young. I also love how people are so awesome at judging her lol, it shows you are complete idiots. She has found herself even if it’s not a popular choice, she keeps her real self hidden and shows the one that brings the most attention so that she can then bring that attention to her cause. No one judging her knows about the little girl that she was with till she past away or her Grandma that she lost, the constant pull between worlds of the quiet Tennessee area to the loud bustling Hollywood. I am so happy that she is with Liam because he obviously understands her. Oh and she IS TALENTED, Billy Ray as much as I love his Achy Breaky Heart did not constitute her being born into the life.

This crazy, attention-seeking chick is out of touch w/ reality; is deluded and stupidly living in her own fantasy world. She’s showing her disgusting ignorance and immaturity when she speaks about politics like she has insight, knowledge, or influence. It’s called “Delusions of Grandeur” in Psychology. Cyrus promotes everything that goes AGAINST the stability of a healthy society, especially involving that of a healthy family unit. She strives to demonstrate being different (i.e. no decorum) by using the poor excuse of “being me/myself”. Her lavish use of the “F…king” word is deplorable! She’s going about her desire to be SOMEBODY in a disgusting, deplorable way…such a Misguided, Poor, Lost Soul!

Reply Regina (@Regina33511) says: October 11, 2016 at 6:11 pm It’s so incredibly damaging and irresponsible to state in a post on the internet that a young woman is “horribly damaged” and “likely molested as a child”. What do you know of her personal life? Were you a friend of the family that stood by and saw all this first hand? Of course, you are not.

It’s her Godmother’s song and she did it such justice. She’s an amazingly talented singer. She just distracted people like you from her real talent when she went all teddy bear twerker. Try to forget her teenage mistakes and watch her grow. Wouldn’t you give your own kids a chance? She is only in her only 20’s and she is already amazing in how much she genuinely cares for other people, you can hear that in her interviews. She did some polarizing junk that I hope she regrets, but I doubt she does. She is so young. Give her a chance to grow into her amazing sense of empathy and you are going to see an amazing woman in the future.

Reply Someone else not important says: October 11, 2016 at 10:23 am How could Miley ever support Donald Trump who is clearly a misogynist and does not represent anything that she believes in? What is it about Trump that makes you support him? Last week, he bragged to Billy Bush about grabbing women by the p—- which is sexual assault. He does not represent her values, and he certainly does not represent mine. This is just one example of the terrible things that Trump has said. You don’t have to agree with someone’s political beliefs, and I’m not asking with you to agree with mine. What I’m asking you here is to understand that there is another perspective. There are people who think that what Trump says is wrong and offensive. It’s really hard for people who oppose Trump to tell this to people without being yelled at. I haven’t even been able to hold a nice conversation about my political beliefs without being attacked by a Trump supporter irl. I think Miley feels the same way.

What’s wrong with being a girl and super? A boy who wants to be a girl can be super too. So do two shows. I don’t understand women like her that think she knows better for everyone else. That’s what scares me about Hollywood. They always think they’re better than everyone else. Talk about too much power. And the fact that having a female president is going to help “inequality” is like saying when Obama became president Black people got more.

She is talking about not judging a person based on what other people have said about them, especially when they deny that is who they are. Trump states very clearly who and what he is. He states very clearly what he would like to do and there’ reams of factual evidence to show what he has said and done in the past.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s increasing reliance on e-commerce to fuel sales comes at a time when Amazon.com Inc. is tightening its grip on the American consumer, making it a risky gambit. Wal-Mart recently told investors it would pull back on the number of new stores it was opening and instead invest some of that money into online operations. It’s a key milestone: For the first time, the company expects e-commerce gains to contribute more toward its growth than expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. Analysts and investors are skeptical that Wal-Mart can pull it off. Consumers are rapidly getting ingrained in the habit of turning to Amazon for everything from toilet paper to a new dress. Among U.S. online consumers, 55 percent say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product and about half of American households have a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. U.S. shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com’s website, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. “I get that you have to be in e-commerce, but you are chasing the 800-pound gorilla,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. “You aren’t going to out-Amazon Amazon.” Cannibalizing Stores? Yarbrough worries that Wal-Mart’s growth online will mostly be coming from its existing customers -- and as a result will cannibalize its stores, which are more profitable and where customers are more likely to make an impulse buy. At the same time, Amazon has been increasing its reach into Wal-Mart’s customer base. Forty-two percent of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20 percent in 2013, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. And there are no signs Amazon is slowing down. It is set to add 12 million Prime members this year, on top of the 10 million it added in 2015, Blackledge estimates. With at least 17 times as many items for sale as Walmart.com, Amazon is increasingly expanding its reach into areas once dominated by traditional retailers. This year, Amazon is set to sell more apparel than Wal-Mart, and by 2018 it will be the second-largest seller of consumables, such as cleaning suppliers, paper towels and diapers, Blackledge said.  Speedy Delivery Then there is Amazon’s ever-increasing delivery speed. While Wal-Mart is in the early stages of offering a membership program where customers can get free two-day shipping -- rather than waiting the standard five to seven days -- Amazon is offering free same-day delivery in 27 major cities. In some markets, the e-commerce company delivers millions of products within an hour. “To compete, Wal-Mart would have to replicate the value proposition of Prime,” Blackledge said. “If they could do that at scale, then they would have something, but Amazon has been singularly focused at this for 20 years.” None of that should be news to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. He knows the company has a lofty goal in front of it, but since paying about $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com, McMillon seemed to have a bit more spring in his step when talking to investors about the company’s online strategy. Pieces in Place “A lot of the foundational elements that we’ve been telling you for years that we needed to grow the e-commerce business are now in place,” McMillon said. “It’s time to invest more money. It’s time to really get this going and start growing our e-commerce business in a different way.” That new way will be led by tech-industry darling Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Wal-Mart following the acquisition. McMillon sees him as key to the company’s future. The CEO half-jokingly recalled walking down the street with Lore and instinctively stepping out in front of an oncoming car to protect him. “If Marc can be Marc within this company, great things are going to happen,” McMillon said. Wal-Mart expects online sales to grow 20 percent to 30 percent over the next three years with the addition of Jet. That would be a major acceleration: Online sales grew 7 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the second. But even 20 percent growth on a base of about $13 billion does little to move the needle at a company with nearly $500 billion in annual revenue. Costly Effort In the meantime, the investments are taking a toll on Wal-Mart’s bottom line. The company said profit would be flat next year in part because of the heavy spending online. Wal-Mart shares fell 3.2 percent Thursday when the retailer’s executives made their case to investors, and the stock was down an additional 1.2 percent on Friday. The question is whether Wal-Mart can change the shopping behavior of the tens of millions of Americans already entrenched in Amazon. Is Wal-Mart the retail equivalent of Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, which tried and failed to convince Americans to break their habit of going to Google? Or can Wal-Mart -- with Jet.com -- be a disruptive force in the industry? “If someone is locked into Prime, the chance of you bringing their business over is slim,” Yarbrough said. Store Pickup Wal-Mart’s main selling point has been its physical stores, which let shoppers buy items online and pick them up on the premises. That includes having employees deliver groceries to customers’ cars in the parking lot. Wal-Mart has expanded its grocery pickup service from five test markets a year ago to more than 100 markets now. The service has the potential to drive regular traffic to Wal-Mart’s website, where customers may think to pick up extra nongrocery items. Jet.com may help give it an advantage on price. The startup has developed a system where customers pay less if they are ordering items from the same location or if they opt out of services, like the option to return the item. Lore also said using store pickup and sending items from the store could help cut shipping costs. But adapting to the internet isn’t really a choice -- it’s an imperative. And that’s something Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton would recognize, McMillon said on Thursday. “The Internet and technology are changing the world, they are changing industries, and they’re changing retail,” he said. “Sometimes people ask me what would Sam think about what Wal-Mart is going today, and I don’t know. But the one thing I know for sure is we would be changing and we’d be changing quickly.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Donald Trump describes himself as a businessman. And he says he wants to run the government more like a business. But would any business hire Mr. Trump? It isn’t a trivial question. Given the Republican presidential nominee’s vulgar boasts about sexually assaulting women and trying to coerce a woman to commit adultery with him — among other things — it is hard to believe he could get past the human resources department of a Fortune 500 company. Over the last decade, much of corporate America has put in place strict policies to deal with sexual harassment and other offensive behavior, trying to make amends for an abhorrent history of letting such conduct go unchecked (remember “Mad Men”?). Hiring procedures at large companies, particularly for senior positions, include extensive background checks, which typically include interviewing former colleagues and combing through articles, court records and, yes, social media. Thousands of employees have been fired or pushed out for using far less repugnant language than Mr. Trump’s words about how he gropes women. Walmart, the nation’s largest employer, with some 2.2 million employees, has explicit policies, for example, that prohibit “sexually explicit language, off-color jokes, remarks about a person’s body” as well as “using slurs or negative stereotyping,” “verbal kidding, teasing or joking” and “intimidating acts, such as bullying or threatening.” By those definitions, it is not clear if Mr. Trump would qualify to be hired as a janitor, let alone a senior executive. A spokesman for Walmart, asked whether Mr. Trump’s comments would disqualify him from employment there, said: “We’ve got a policy of not entertaining hypotheticals.” Mr. Trump has apologized for his language, which he described as “locker room talk.” But he used the language while on the job; he was recorded on a live microphone while working to promote “The Apprentice,” his popular reality show.

Privacy Policy Many actors’ and “talent” agreements include a “morality clause” that explicitly makes using such language a fireable offense. Here’s the standard, boilerplate language that’s often included in such agreements, according to a sample published by Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law: “The actor shall not commit any act or do anything which might tend to bring actor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which might tend to reflect unfavorably on the network, any sponsor of a program, any such sponsor’s advertising agency, any stations broadcasting or scheduled to broadcast a program, or any licensee of the network.” By that definition, an employer might be able to use Mr. Trump’s catchphrase: “You’re fired.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Something just short of that happened to Billy Bush, the host who played along with Mr. Trump on the 2005 recording. NBC announced his suspension from the “Today” show after the clip surfaced nationally last week. (I should note here that I co-anchor “Squawk Box” on CNBC, which is another unit of NBCUniversal.) Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric, which owned NBC when Mr. Trump started “The Apprentice,” was an impassioned supporter of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign before the lewd comments were made public. Afterward, he took to Twitter to say, “Party must change nominee now.” Like Republican message on Economy, Security and Supreme Court...Unfortunately, wrong messenger...Party must change nominee now. — Jack Welch (@jack_welch) Oct. 8, 2016 Mr. Trump says the country has become “too politically correct.” His surrogates, like Rudy Giuliani, have defended him by saying he shouldn’t be held accountable because he wasn’t running for president when he made those statements over a decade ago. But times have changed. The days of corporate America and Wall Street as swashbuckling, cigar-chomping, liquor-swilling — and female harassing — playgrounds à la the 1980s and ’90s are long over. Susan Antilla wrote a book, “Tales From the Boom-Boom Room: Women vs. Wall Street,” that chronicled a pattern of horrific behavior at Smith Barney. The tale ended with $150 million in awards and settlements. Mr. Trump’s casual line on the 2005 tape — “When you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything” — reminded me of a passage from an interview Mrs. Antilla conducted earlier this year for The Times, in which she quoted Lisa Mays, a Smith Barney executive involved in the suit, about how she had been cornered by a male co-worker. “Before I knew it, he was lifting my skirt to get into my tights, and I was begging him to stop,” Ms. Mays said, adding that it had quickly ended when another employee arrived. “And then, he just walked away like nothing happened.” Mr. Trump says his words were just words, and that he has never assaulted any women. Still, that’s not the standard to qualify for a job — either in the private sector, or as the highest official in the land. “It would be a significant risk for a Fortune 500 company to bring in someone like this,” said Tom Spiggle, a former prosecutor who is now a discrimination lawyer who has sounded the alarm about Mr. Trump on social media. “It could be a tremendous liability,” he added. Lawyers say that hiring Mr. Trump now could pose huge problems for a company because if an employee were to ever accuse him of harassment, his earlier comments could be used not only to show a pattern, but also that the company was aware of the issue when it signed him on. “We have these statements,” Mr. Spiggle said, adding that if he were litigating such a case, “We’d use them all day long. It doesn’t matter it was 11 years ago.” A version of this article appears in print on October 11, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Were It Any Other Job, H.R.

While working in Japan for many years, I crossed the Japan Sea to visit China's most popular tourist attractions, which included the Great Wall outside Beijing, the West Lake in Hangzhou, the Li River in Guangxi province and the Bund in Shanghai. These tours are what the Japanese describe as 'pack tours': whirlwind 3 or 4 day trips where you see the best of China including outlet shopping to boot. Unlike many tourists who hate to be taken on forced shopping sprees, I love them. Once in Shanghai, I spent so much time and money in a silk outlet shop that the tour bus left without me! I vowed someday to work in China so I could see and shop more. My chance came in late 2012. One of my friends had mistakenly sent me a job advertisement to work at a small university in Loudi City, central Hunan. I inquired and was almost instantly granted the job. Although my adventurous spirit wanted to see a part of China that perhaps no Australian had traversed before, I hesitated to accept. My fears were allayed when my future boss assured me there was a 'Walmart' in the town where you could buy everything you could ever want! My mother and I jumped with glee: I could buy anything I needed at a fraction of the price I'd pay in Australia. On my first visit to the rather grubby Walmart in my new town, I knew I had been seriously misled. It wasn't the shopping mecca I'd been promised! Prices for clothes, stationary and home-wares were more expensive than what I would have paid in Japan or Australia. Selection was also lacking. How is it that China, the source of the world's merchandise, had less on offer at a higher price? I was terribly disappointed! Shops around the university were worse: only basic everyday items for university students. After spending almost two years relying on trips back to Australia to get my most needed items and clothing in my size, a small miracle happened. A Russian teacher, by the name of Sergei, arrived at my university and moved into the apartment next door. Russians, like Europeans and Asians, have an eye for beauty and a bargain. Although he couldn't read Chinese, he'd somehow made a search on Taobao, the biggest online shopping site in China, and asked his students to help buy things for him. I followed suit, and soon I was whiling away the hours searching for stuff online like any Chinese. My apartment started to fill up, yuan flowed out of my bank, but the years of deprivation were over! Don't think for one minute that I am blind to the foibles of Taobao. I have received the wrong item, size or color. I have also received copied goods, which is of no surprise as it is estimated that 40% of products on Taobao are fakes. On the other hand, I've found some cheap, useful household goods and the clothes are better quality and don't fadeif I pay more than 200 yuan per item. Taobao or 淘宝 is exactly as its name implies, 'a search for treasure'. Sometimes you find gemstones and at other times rocks. Still, it is preferable to brick and mortar shops in China these days, which mostly disappoint Chinese and foreign tourists alike with their lack of variety and higher prices. To get more for my yuan and to quell my shopping cravings, I'll stick with Taobao for the moment.

POST FALLS, Idaho — A 35-year-old breast cancer patient says she felt humiliated when she was handcuffed and questioned after being mistaken for a Missouri teen wanted in her infant daughter's death. Erin Peters said she was stopped Friday at an Idaho Walmart and questioned for 45 minutes after being mistaken for 18-year-old Whitley Evenson, of Independence, Mo., who is charged with killing her six-week-old baby in September 2015, The Coeur d'Alene Press newspaper reported. “I felt humiliated in front of Wal-Mart, crying,” Peters said. Peters said members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was the Missouri fugitive because her hair is very short. She says she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments. She said the task force members went through her purse, her phone and her Facebook account. She said they “ransacked everything.” “The way they went about this was so wrong,” Peters said. FBI spokesman Richard Collodi said he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure. He said suspects often come up with creative excuses to avoid arrest. “I'm confident she was treated professionally,” Collodi said. The task force had information Evenson would be at that Wal-Mart, Collodi said, Evenson was arrested later on Friday at the store. She was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Mo., where she is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors accused Evenson of suffocating the infant. She was out on bond when she failed to appear for a court hearing in July.

Democrats seize edge in Florida registering new voters LEDYARD KING , THE NEWS-PRESS Washington bureau 11:17 p.m. EDT October 10, 2016 Clinton volunteer Theresa Darlington (center) tries to register George Almond (right) for the Nov. 8 election. Standing with them outside the Social Security office in St. Petersburg, Fla., is Almond's son, Shawn. (Photo: Ledyard King, USA TODAY) AVALON PARK - It’s a late Monday afternoon as about a dozen Hillary For America volunteers gather at the Starbucks in this planned community of middle-class families just east of downtown Orlando. They’re here for training and a little pep talk before heading out to the Walmart in the nearby strip mall to register voters. This is the first campaign for many of them, and several talk about the enormous stakes of this presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. “We all know from Gore and Bush how a few votes could really turn the tide,” Navy veteran Hollis Porter, 59, says, referring to George W. Bush’s 537-vote win in Florida in 2000 that gave the Republican the presidency over Democrat Al Gore. If Clinton is going to win the Sunshine State, she’ll need activists like Porter to register as many supporters as he can before the upcoming voter registration deadline. On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee granted a request from the Florida Democratic Party to extend the deadline at least one day - from Tuesday to Wednesday - to determine whether a longer extension should be granted due to the displacement of Floridians along the East Coast due to Hurricane Matthew. Once voter registration is completed, Clinton will need Porter and the roughly 90,000 other volunteers the campaign claims in Florida to mobilize Democrats, sympathetic independents and Republicans disaffected with Trump over the coming weeks. Republicans say they have “thousands” of volunteers canvassing Florida as well, though they declined to give specific numbers. And they say the Republican National Committee had staff and a state director in Florida for three years, long before the Clinton campaign had theirs in place. But by almost every metric — volunteers, field offices, ad spending — Democrats appear to be winning the ground game in the nation’s most important swing state, experts and activists say. Take voter registration. Of the approximately 651,000 new voters that have signed up in Florida from Jan. 1 through Aug. 31, about 230,000 (35%) registered as independents, about 221,000 (34%) as Democrats and about 185,000 (28.4%) as Republicans, according to Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida who studies registration activity. The rest registered as third-party voters. “I will guarantee you that number will get bigger in the last month because the Democratic operatives and their allies, the progressive, non-profit community, have been out registering voters leading up to the Oct. 11 deadline,” Smith said, referring to left-of-center groups representing labor, minorities and women that are mobilizing across Florida. Republicans point to impressive registration gains since 2012, when Mitt Romney barely lost to President Obama. Over the past four years, the number of Republicans in the state has grown roughly 195,000, to nearly 4.6 million, while the number of Democrats has shrunk by nearly 89,000, to a little more than 4.7 million, according to the Florida Division of Elections. That roughly 285,000 net gain for Republicans is almost four times the 74,309 margin by which Obama beat Romney in Florida. And, GOP officials say, this is the first time in over a decade that the RNC has invested in voter registration. “The RNC's historic ground game operation has been proactively engaging all communities across the state every day since 2013,” said Ninio Fetalvo, RNC Florida communications director, pointing to GOP Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election in 2014. “These same efforts and resources that have already proven to be effective will pay dividends as we work to elect the entire Republican ticket this November.” But while progressive allies are pushing the virtues of Clinton to voters, conservative groups are not as unanimous in their support of Trump. The Libre Initiative, an organization funded by the Koch Brothers to attract conservative Hispanics by focusing on free market principles, is helping build support for Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio — but steering clear of promoting Trump. And Monday, the South Florida-based Latin Builders Association, a Republican stalwart for decades, announced its board voted to endorse Clinton. Smith said the reach of the Clinton campaign isn’t nearly what it was in the past two elections, when the “Obama machine” basically supplanted local Democratic organizations because they were better registering and mobilizing voters. Also playing in the GOP’s favor is that Democrats are being weaned off the registration rolls at a faster pace than Republicans for “routine list maintenance” such as death, relocation or inactivity. It also includes those who switched their affiliation, although Smith said that accounts for a very small percentage of the Democratic dip. But he said the notion that the GOP is “out-registering” Democrats and their allies is a false one. He points to Hispanic voters as a prime example. Since Jan. 2, 2013, more than 166,000 new Hispanic voters registered as Democrats, compared to about 66,000 new Hispanic Republicans, according to his analysis. Hillary Clinton volunteers gather at a Starbucks in the Avalon Park community of greater Orlando as they get ready to register voters.  (Photo: Ledyard King, USA TODAY) That advantage for Democrats has accelerated since the first of this year, with 42 percent of all new Hispanic voters signing up as Democrats vs. 16 percent as Republicans, he said. About 85 miles from Avalon Park, on the other side of Florida’s politically key I-4 corridor, Republican Brittany Reed, 25, has been trying to mobilize voters in the Tampa area. The University of South Florida student, who hopes to join the U.S. Foreign Service, has spent some recent Saturdays going door-to-door in Hillsborough County trying to register new voters and sell them on the virtues of Trump. “You might hit 300 doors and you might get 10 that answer,” she said. But ‘if I just change one person’s mind or educate one person, then I guess it’s worth it.” Voter registration drives are rarely 100 percent successful. It can take hours to sign up even one new voter, as Reed is discovering. And because volunteers are not supposed to ask a person’s political leanings before they try to register them, it might be someone who's not voting for your candidate. Clinton volunteer Theresa Darlington, 36, found out last week outside the Social Security office in downtown St. Petersburg when she persuaded George Almond to register as a voter. Almond, 62, a retired stevedore, hadn’t been registered for decades but now he said he plans to vote for Trump. He calls the bombastic billionaire “erratic” but thinks Clinton is even worse. “Hillary’s one of the good old boys,” he said. “She ain’t going to change nothing.” Contact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com; Twitter: @ledgeking 64 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/2e1ZxsE TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Hogs And Air Dogs Fly Again 1:09 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 News-Press Election Update: 7pm Florida Polls Close 16:10 News-Press Election Update: 8pm Mailbag Reader Debate 16:42 News-Press Election Update: 9pm Poll Update 14:39 Boca Grande: The Harbor Pilot 2:04 Save Our Water: moderated panel 17:52 Inside SWFL Football: Week 11 6:31 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Dress for Success SWFL focused on inspiring women 1:35 'I will not give up.'

SLIDE SHOW 10 States With the Scariest Death Taxes TOOL What Is My IRA Required Minimum Distribution? BUILDING WEALTH Kiplinger's Wealth Creation Web Conference Series Advertisement Practical Advice from 7 ETFs to Buy for a Christmas Rally Playing the fourth quarter is easy with exchange-traded funds. Thinkstock By Aaron Levitt October 11, 2016 With the air turning crisp and the leaves starting to fall, it’s time to start thinking about the fourth quarter and how to position your portfolio until the end of the year. Considering all the uncertainty, you may want to start thinking about that right away. Despite the continued rise of equities, economic data has been pretty mixed here at home. Everything from employment and housing data to measures of manufacturing to consumer confidence has been trending flat to down in recent weeks. That’s not exactly painting a rosy economic picture here at home. Neither is the global economy. Issues in Europe and Japan are starting to once again bubble-up to the surface. Add in the upcoming tragedy of a presidential election, the Fed’s next pending rate hike meeting and lower estimated third-quarter earnings and we may be in for a bumpy ride. SEE ALSO FROM KIPLINGER: Great Foreign Stocks That Pay Big Dividends But luckily, we can position our portfolios to mitigate any damage while potentially profit from the bright spots. And exchange-traded funds make that sector/country/asset rotation a breeze. There are a whole host of ETFs that allow investors to buckle down for the approaching winter. Advertisement With that in mind, here are seven of the best ETFs to buy for the fourth quarter. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF Expenses: 0.52%, or $52 per $10,000 invested Year-to-Date Gain: 95% The first three-quarters of 2016 have been pretty kind to gold. The precious metal has managed to gain about 25% since the beginning of the year as uncertainty has crept back into the markets. And the fourth quarter could be just as big for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Poor data continues to come in, and that’s helped keep gold prices above the $1,300 per ounce mark. That price point is seen as critical for the miners of the precious metal. All the miners have a price floor called “all-in sustaining costs,” and $1,300 per ounce is well above the major miners costs. That’s helping drive profitability at the recently struggling firms. Meanwhile, the added uncertainty and issues facing the world could send gold prices spiking during the fourth quarter. The miners will directly benefit from that. Advertisement When it comes to ETFs, GDX is really the only play to bet on the gold miners. The ETF tracks 50 of the largest gold producers from across the globe. This includes all the sectors heavyweights like Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). More importantly, GDX is up by 85% year to date on gold’s continued rise. That should spill over into the fourth quarter — making it one of the best ETFs to snag for the next three months. Expenses for GDX run at just 0.52%, or $52 per $10,000 invested. iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF Expenses: 0.15% YTD Gain: 8.5% Volatility has begun to rear its ugly head and we’ve gone back to the days of big swings in the market. Considering how dicey everything is, ratcheting down those large swings could be key. And ETFs can help you do that. Advertisement The iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF (USMV) uses screens to kick out high-volatility stocks and capture the upside of the market. That also limits the downside as well as the “bounciness” associated with market movements. Currently, the $14.5 billion ETF holds 176 different stocks, including Paychex, Inc. (PAYX) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT). SEE ALSO FROM INVESTORPLACE: The 3 Best Vanguard Funds for a Prosperous Fourth Quarter USMV’s underlying index has done a good job of fighting volatility and downside risk. Back in 2008, the ETF managed to perform better and lose less than the broader S&P 500 Index. Meanwhile, during the subsequent up years, USMV managed to beat the market further. At the same time, USMV pays an S&P 500-beating dividend of 2%. While the chance of recession is small, it is building. At just 0.15% in expenses, USMV is a cheap way to fight that potential and is a one of the best ETFs to buy for the fourth quarter of 2016. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF Expenses: 0.35% YTD Gain: 25.4% Advertisement It’s no secret that oil prices have been in the dog house for a few years now. Oversupplies and muted demand have crippled both Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarked crude, but now could be the best time to bet on energy ETFs like the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Production ETF (XOP) for a fourth-quarter rally. Bankruptcies, drilling cuts and dropping production figures have reduced oil inventories over the past few months. That’s helped move prices out of the basement and back toward the $50 per barrel range. What’s more, OPEC is finally realizing that it can’t keep pumping at today’s low prices. The cartel recently decided to step on the gas when it comes to production. With Saudi Arabia, Iran and others now pumping out less crude, oil prices have surged and will continue to rise during the next few months. XOP is a prime way to play that surge. The ETF tracks a basket of energy producers. You’re getting the Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC) of the United States. These are the firms that will directly benefit from higher oil prices as they sell oil. That makes the ETF a great play on oil’s continued surge for the rest of 2016. Expenses for XOP run at just 0.35%. Vanguard REIT ETF Expenses: 0.12% YTD Gain: 10.1% Real estate investment trust ETFs recently got a huge boost. That’s because REITs are now their own separate sector. Most indexing firms use a set of standards to classify what business a firm operates in. It’s called the Global Industry Classifications Standard sector designation and REITs were considered “financial stocks.” Not anymore — REITs are now “real estate.” What that means, is that many institutional managers that tied their performance to various indexes will now move plenty of money into REITs. Considering how underweight they are already because REITs were hidden in financials, that move could be significant. And that will play right into the Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VNQ). VNQ tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, which covers roughly two-thirds of the U.S. REIT market — including retail, office, residential apartment and industrial properties. VNQ holds a total of 150 high-class equity REITs. “Equity” refers to strictly physical buildings and not mortgage or loans tied to a building. As a result, the ETF should be one of the best ways to capture rising REIT interest and money. SEE ALSO FROM INVESTORPLACE: 3 Dividend ETFs You Completely Overlooked As a Vanguard fund, VNQ charges a rock-bottom 0.12% in fees. PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF Expenses: 0.75% YTD Gain: 7.1% The recent hacks of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and DropBox highlight that growing need for more cybersecurity spending. These high-profile hacks and other recent examples are helping push the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) to new 52-week highs. Highs that should continue during the fourth quarter. HACK tracks a basket of software and hardware firms dedicated to stopping cyber threats and recovering lost data/information. It’s a fast growing industry and one that will see higher private sector and government spending in the years ahead. In the meantime, HACK’s basket of 35 stocks is enjoying the limelight of recent cyberattacks. Moreover, M&A activity should continue to boost the firm’s holdings. While there are a few larger firms in the mix — such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) — the bulk are smaller. With many major tech firms — like CSCO — looking to beef-up their cybercrime offerings, HACK’s small caps should see premiums to their current values. The combination of rising buyout activity and big-time spending on cybersecurity should make HACK one of the best ETFs for the next few months. iShares 1-3 Year Credit Bond ETF Expenses: 0.2% YTD Gain: 1.15% “Soar” isn’t exactly the word to use in order to describe the iShares Barclays 1-3 Year Credit Bond Fd (CSJ). But it still could be one of the best ETFs to buy for the fourth quarter. CSJ holds investment grade government and corporate bonds with maturities of one to three years. It bets on the short end of the spectrum and that’s a good place to be for the next 90 days of the year. SEE ALSO FROM INVESTORPLACE: 6 Gigantic Bond Funds That Are Ripping Off Investors For starters, the threat of rising rates. With a duration of less than two, CSJ is less sensitive to rising interest rates as it is able to “roll over” its holding faster than longer bonds. With Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve basically saying they are looking to raise rates before the end of the year, CSJ should be a great place to park some money. Secondly, the market’s uncertainty makes holding some cash a good idea. However, cash is still yielding basically next to nothing. By moving out slightly on the yield curve/maturity spectrum, investors can score a better yield. At 1.3%, CSJ won’t make you rich, but you won’t loss out to inflation. In the end, holding a bit of CSJ could be one of the smartest moves and best ETFs for conservative investors in the fourth quarter. WisdomTree India Earnings Fund Expenses: 0.84% YTD Gain: 7.25% For investors looking for sheer growth, the best opportunity may lie outside the U.S. during the fourth quarter. In this case, we are talking about India and ETFs remain the best way to access the emerging market. The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up nearly 9% so far this year as investors have flooded beaten down emerging markets. India is particularly great as the reforms and major government overhauls under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have actually worked. The economy in India is thriving, inflation is down and stocks within the nation seem poised to keep on growing. And with the Fed keeping rates low for now, there’s no reason why Indian stocks shouldn’t keep up their torrid run. SEE ALSO FROM KIPLINGER: An ETF to Own 6,000 Foreign Stocks At $1.47 billion, the WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI) is one of the largest and easiest ways to add Indian stocks to an investor’s portfolio. The fund holds 250 different Indian stocks — including giants like Tata Motors Limited (TTM) and Infosys Ltd ADR (INFY). The kicker is that EPI is a smart-beta ETF and weights its holdings based on profits. That essentially kicks out firms that consistently fail to produce. It also has allowed EPI to produce as well, beating its market-cap weighted rivals since its inception. With expenses of 0.84%, EPI isn’t dirt cheap. But it could well be worth it as it has the ability to add some real growth during the last chunk of 2016. This article is from Aaron Levitt of InvestorPlace.

Base jumpers are gearing up along with the organizers.  With so many people pouring into the area, traffic will be regulated. Parking lots at Kroger, Midland Trail High School and Walmart will be providing parking for visitors.  From there, there will be transportation to bring people to the bridge. "Shuttle buses are two dollars a person and that's for round trip tickets. Sometimes people want to know if that is both ways, do they need to pay twice? It's just when you get on the bus and it covers them on the way back," says the President of the Bridge Day Committee, Sharon Cruikshank. Many roads will be closed for vendors and the overload of people. Drivers will need to follow the detours out on the roads. With help from State Police, traffic will be directed and running as routine as possible. The fun kicks off this Saturday at 9 in the morning. WeatherMore>> GO / View Larger >> 7 Day Forecast School Closings Predictor WVNS-TV P.O.

By Jim Couper October 12, 2016 Filed under Destinations, Travel     An RVing round trip on Interstate 90 eastbound and Interstate 94 westbound reveals unique roadside attractions “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.” — The Road Not Taken, Robert Frost   Robert Frost’s poem, The Road Not Taken, echoed in my mind as I headed east on Interstate 90 crossing the Idaho-Montana border. Interstate 94 lay ahead and, as the road less traveled, it was surely the one I should take. Lacking Frost’s spirit of adventure, I didn’t take the turn northeast onto 94. I had just visited the little silver-mining town of Wallace, which practically sits on an I-90 off-ramp, and Coeur d’Alene, also in Idaho, and was so enthralled with spectacular vistas that I didn’t dare depart I-90. The northern route could wait until my return trip, despite Frost’s inspiration. The northerly twins — I-90 and I-94 — are probably the cross-country routes least used by RVers who are drawn to southern warmth like iron filings to a magnet. These four-lane, divided freeways travel somewhat parallel, exploring different terrain for the 1,000 miles between Billings, Montana, and Tomah, Wisconsin. Both routes provide safe, big-rig friendly transport with service centers, moderately priced fuel and 75-mph limits to encourage the burning of that fuel. Setting out in mid-March, because of a family commitment near Niagara Falls, meant limited camping options as state parks and private campgrounds remained closed. Fortunately KOAs dot the route at convenient intervals and many stay open year-round. Without them, the pavements of Flying J and Wal-Mart would have become familiar night sights. Montana Grizzly Encounter sanctuary in Bozeman. Decades ago I traveled these highways and recalled that I-90, the southern route, had enough roadside attractions to keep the most somnolent driver alert while I-94 featured powerful vistas and billboard-free travel. My quest was to see if memory matched reality and to compare attractions located within a mile or two of the interstates. I refused to wander country lanes in search of magnetic waterfalls or giant potatoes that look like the head of John Malkovich. However, off ramp tourist attractions draw me like mosquitos to skin. Taking I-90 across the panhandle of Idaho and through Montana provided riveting scenery that my wife, Lian, dubbed the four R’s: rail, road, ridge and river. Recreational trails appeared regularly while our rearview mirror reflected a sky that grew bigger as our wheels progressed into Montana. The author’s wife, Lian, at Cowboys, Cars and Cons in Deer Lodge, Montana. In Missoula, and the three B’s — Butte, Bozeman and Billings — we took advantage of their river locations and drove through each Montana city. When a parking spot popped up, we took riverside walks despite freezing air that got colder as we went east. Unusual attractions soon made appearances. At Deer Lodge, Montana, cost couldn’t keep us from a combo called Cowboys, Cars and Cons. For less than $10 one could spend a day touring Montana State Prison, used for 110 years from the 1870s, four smaller museums, plus the Montana Auto Museum that included a 1933 pop-up camper. Bozeman Hot Springs, with nine pools up to 106 degrees Fahrenheit, quickly relieved the chill from the air and settled us for a good sleep at the KOA, a short walk from the springs. In the morning we learned about local dinosaur finds at Bozeman’s impressive Museum of the Rockies. Barely out of Bozeman, we stopped at Montana Grizzly Encounter and met Brutus and his buddies, all rescued bears. Mount Rushmore viewing area. Our South Dakota visit started with the heads of presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt magnificently chiseled from the rock of Mount Rushmore. Nearby, the unfinished Crazy Horse carving also amazed in terms of magnitude, man-hours and determination. Beside I-90, in South Dakota, stands one of the oddest destination attractions. The settlement known as Wall Drug announces itself, 100 miles ahead, with billboards promoting 5-cent coffee and free entry to the Western-themed settlement. What you’ll find is essentially a collection of shops selling souvenirs. Souvenirs of what? Souvenirs of a town that sells souvenirs. It started in 1931 when a drugstore attracted customers by giving free ice water to thirsty travelers. Today, among blocks of trinket shops, there’s free ice water, pioneer memorabilia, artifacts, paintings, carvings, good 5-cent coffee and tourists by the busload. On the south side of I-90 stands the flip side of Wall Drug — the most desolate, intimidating landscape imaginable at aptly named Badlands National Park. A drive along paved route 240 adds very few miles and provides a chance to see wildlife and rock formations caused by volcanic upheavals. Before departing South Dakota, be sure to stop in at another oddity — the Corn Palace in Mitchell. Since 1892 the town arena has been festooned with 275,000 ears of corn, cut in half lengthwise, plus assorted grains, nailed to the building in artistic patterns to create thematic scenes that change every year. Tree trunk carving at Wall Drug. When we reached Minnesota, we started with a pair of oddball must-sees related to food. At the town of Blue Earth stands the contradictorily colored Jolly Green Giant statue of pea fame. The 55-foot-tall fiberglass monument to canned green peas commemorated, in 1978, not a bumper crop, but rather the linking of east and west sections of I-90. The town gets its name from its blue clay. Just down the highway at Austin we discovered the SPAM Museum. Displays, plus radio and TV advertising, show the 79-year history of Hormel Foods’ favorite brand. Every kind of SPAM on the market is available for purchase. The excitement of I-90 ended in Wisconsin as it joined I-94 and both lost their uniqueness, rolling east into endless development, gouging tollbooths and inevitable jams in the big industrial cities. In late April we headed west on the return trip, looking forward to wide-open spaces and competing attractions along the road less traveled, I-94. With patches of snow still dotting the landscape, the camping situation hadn’t changed. After the “two roads diverged” in Wisconsin, we stayed on I-94 and headed northwest to Bloomington, Minnesota, where Mall of America, the biggest in the country, beaconed. Despite the endless array of stores, we spent most of our time admiring enormous Lego creations, taking rides at Nickelodeon Universe, playing miniature golf and enjoying the tranquility of fish at Sea Life Aquarium. The woodchipper from the movie, Fargo. Fargo, first stop at the eastern edge of North Dakota, gained fame (or notoriety) for the Coen brothers’ movie of the same name. In the tourist info office, the infamous woodchipper from the film is displayed and, of course, a photo of a family member gruesomely pushing a leg (plastic one available) into the chopper is required. Buffalo are huge creatures, but none rates with the colossal 60-ton sculpture at the National Buffalo Museum in Jamestown, 100 miles west of Fargo. A viewing stand provides a panorama of surrounding land that buffalo roam and call home. A rare albino may come into view, but alas, that was not our case as the Plains were empty as a campground in a snowstorm. Big buffalo sculpture in Jamestown, North Dakota. Getting off the highway at Mandan, three hours west of Fargo, enables the traveler to roll along U.S. Highway 10, which, prior to 1925, was the Old Red Trail used by General Custer and countless pioneers. Ten communities between Mandan and Dickinson sport museums, historic sites and recreational facilities. Each posts a phone number that leads to more information and an audio tour. Flying geese sculpture on the Enchanted Highway. A giant roadside sculpture of flying geese, at exit 72, marks the Enchanted Highway with the world’s biggest scrap-metal sculptures. Stretching 32 miles between I-94 and the shrinking town of Regent, artist Gary Greff’s creations are intended to bring tourists to Regent. Before departing North Dakota, the city of Medora offers the Cowboy Hall of Fame, covering rodeos, ranching, rustling and rustic native life. I-94 continues through Theodore Roosevelt National Park with sweeping vistas that continue into Montana and back to Billings where the northern highway unites with I-90. In looking back, my memories were correct. In 15 years a few more attractions have popped up, but basically northern 94 is still for lovers of nature and 90 attracts those with attention deficit and restless kids.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend News Local News The Watchdog Prepaid cards, mobile wallets to get safer Prepaid cards, mobile wallets to get safer The growing number of people who prefer to store their money and shop with prepaid cards and mobile wallets should be better protected from fraud and errors by this time next year. The growing number of people who prefer to store their money and shop with prepaid cards and mobile wallets should be better protected from fraud and errors by this time next year. With prepaid cards and mobile wallets becoming more popular, new protections to be added. The growing number of people who prefer to store their money and shop with prepaid cards and mobile wallets should be better protected from fraud and errors by this time next year. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule last week that limits losses when funds are stolen or cards are lost; requires mistakes to be investigated and resolved; and provides free, easy access to account terms and balances. "This rule closes loopholes and protects prepaid consumers when they swipe their card, shop online or scan their smartphone," bureau Director Richard Cordray said. "And it backs up those protections with important new disclosures to let consumers know before they owe." Prepaid cards, which include brands such as GreenDot, Netspend and Walmart MoneyCard, and electronic prepaid services such as PayPal and Google Wallet, are growing in popularity. Some people use them for convenience. Others use them because they shun traditional banking products. Prepaid cards can be purchased at stores and loaded with money by the cardholder or someone else at the point of sale, or by transferring it online. Cards also may be provided by an employer for payroll purposes, or by a government agency for student financial aid and unemployment and public assistance benefits. The cards can be used to store and receive money, withdraw cash at ATMs, make payments online or in stores, or send money to other people. Mobile wallets can be loaded with funds from bank accounts or credit cards and used to make purchases online and in stores, or to send money to others. While many cards and mobile wallets already offer protections, the level has varied, according to Consumers Union, the public advocacy arm of Consumer Reports that had been lobbying for changes for more than a decade. "Millions of Americans rely on prepaid cards every day to pay their bills and manage their finances," Consumers Union attorney Christina Tetreault said. "But not all prepaid cards are created equal and consumers have lacked the legal safeguards they deserve to protect their money. Now consumers will be able to compare cards more easily to find the most affordable option and have the peace of mind that their money will be safe if their card is lost or stolen." By 2018, the total dollar value loaded to cards is expected to reach $121 billion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2003, it was less than $1 billion. The cards haven't been easy for everyone to use. Last year, I wrote about a Lower Saucon Township man who agreed to accept his tax refund on a prepaid card and then worried he'd exposed himself to being charged fees to access his money. I looked into it and determined he wouldn't have to pay fees, but his card didn't do a good job of explaining that. The term booklet that came with the card didn't explain all of the ways it could be used at no cost. Additional information was available only online. The new rule is designed to resolve those problems. Access to terms has been limited in the past because disclosures often are inside the packaging for cards bought at stores, or may be hard to find on websites, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. The new rule will require commonly charged fees to be disclosed on the outside of packages and more-detailed information to be published online. Prepaid account holders typically don't get mailed statements as they would with a checking account. The rule requires financial institutions to provide account information such as balances and transaction history for free by phone, online or in writing if requested. Some already provide that information. Financial institutions must investigate complaints from account holders about fraudulent charges or errors, just as a bank would. If the investigation would take time, customers must be offered provisional credit for the disputed amount. People who lose a prepaid card or find unauthorized charges will be liable for only up to $50 if they report the problem promptly. Many prepaid services already protect their customers against all losses, such as one I experienced a few years ago when my PayPal account was hacked. "These important new protections fill gaps in the law for consumers," Cordray said. "The rapidly growing ranks of prepaid users deserve a safe place to store their money and a practical way to carry out their financial transactions." If a prepaid card or service allows people to exceed their deposited balance and buy on credit, the new rule requires the service to ensure the customer has the ability to repay before issuing a credit line. During the first year a credit account is open, total fees for credit features cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit. Most provisions of the rule take effect Oct. 1, 2017.

TAKAAKI IWABU 2010 NEWS & OBSERVER FILE PHOTO i By Sarah Nagem snagem@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RALEIGH Triangle Town Center wants you to stay home Thanksgiving Day. CBL & Associates Properties, a joint venture owner of the North Raleigh mall, announced Wednesday afternoon that the mall will not open on Thanksgiving this year. The company also owns Cary Towne Center, which will be closed on Thanksgiving. “We want to bring back the excitement of Black Friday shopping as the true start of the holiday shopping season and allow our employees, retailers, and shoppers to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with their families,” Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of the company, said in a statement. “After evaluating feedback from our mall employees, retail partners, and input from our shoppers we determined that this was the best decision for our properties.” Over the years, many malls and retail stores, including Walmart and Target, have opened on Thanksgiving day, promising shoppers a jump-start on Black Friday deals. But some companies are resisting the trend as some people say Thanksgiving is a day for family and feasts, not bargains on big-screen televisions. Last year, retailers such as Mooresville-based Lowes Home Improvement, Marshalls, T.J. Maxx and Nordstrom did not open on Thanksgiving Day, and outdoor retailer REI was closed on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday. So far this year, Staples, Costco, Crate and Barrel and Ikea have said they will close on Thanksgiving. A survey by PricewaterhouseCooper found that 49 percent of retailers plan to be open on Thanksgiving. Nine percent said they weren’t yet certain what they would do that day. At Triangle Town Center, department stores, movie theaters and retailers with exterior entrances will have the option of opening their stores on Thanksgiving, CBL said. The mall’s major stores include Belk, Dillard’s, Macy’s, Sears and Saks Fifth Avenue. Access to the mall’s common areas will remain closed until 6 a.m. Friday. Representatives of Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh and the Streets at Southpoint in Durham said they expect a decision next week on whether the malls will open on Thanksgiving. “We are still getting feedback from all our stores,” said Amanda Pulley, an office manager for Crabtree. Last year, the Streets at Southpoint gave stores the option of opening from 6 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving.

The ex-officer, Stephen Rankin, 36, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in August for shooting William Chapman II, 18, while investigating a shoplifting report at a Walmart store. Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Johnny Morrison denied a request by Rankin's lawyer that he remain free while his conviction is appealed, the spokesman said in a telephone call. Rankin, who is white, was fired by the Portsmouth police department after his grand jury indictment. Prosecutors argued that Rankin had killed Chapman in April 2015 in what had amounted to little more than a parking lot fistfight in Portsmouth, about 175 miles south of Washington. The sentencing came amid a roiling U.S. debate over police use of deadly force, especially against African-Americans. A Washington Post database showed that 754 people have been fatally shot by police this year, with 24 percent of them black. Rankin is among 26 officers to be convicted of murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting out of 77 charged since 2005, Phillip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Ohio's Bowling Green State University, said in a telephone call. Twenty-nine of the charges were leveled in the last two years alone, but Stinson said the numbers were too small to indicate a trend of officers being charged. Rankin had shot and killed an unarmed man in 2011 while responding to a burglary call. No charges were filed over that shooting, and Rankin won a related civil trial.

Celebrity News 11 0 0 October 12, 2016 Miley Cyrus Brings ‘Weed-Smoking Hippy’ Style To ‘The Voice’ Amid Adam Levine Feud: Will She Quit? Joanne Eglash Miley Cyrus isn’t in Hannah Montana land anymore. The “Wrecking Ball” singer is making it clear that she’s all grown-up, taking her new flower child image to The Voice as a coach along with Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, and Blake Shelton. And while some viewers enjoy it, there’s also been some backlash for Cyrus, including a petition as well as a report about the potential of her quitting the show. Miley Cyrus: Did She Just Admit To Getting High While Filming ‘The Voice?’ https://t.co/mAZcmZPr9F — HollywoodLife (@HollywoodLife) September 29, 2016 Flaunting what Hollywood Life describes as Miley’s “yoga-lovin’, weed-smokin’ hippy” style and open attitude about “her marijuana use,” the singer recently dished on what it’s like to cope with the confrontations that are part of being a coach on The Voice. “When you don’t turn the chair for somebody, it’s so confrontational, and I’m really not confrontational,” confessed Cyrus. “So then I get really embarrassed and I’ll make it my fault—like, “I don’t know! I was high! I forgot to turn my chair!'” Miley has attracted fans of her flower child style, with some turning to Twitter to cheer for the singer. Haters: "Why is Miley on The Voice?" Me: Because she is the voice! ???? pic.twitter.com/hsS2pwOQ77 — Miley Cyrus Source (@MileySourceNews) October 9, 2016 But there are others who aren’t so fond of Miley’s ways, with a petition that has garnered 399 supporters in an attempt to get The Voice and its network NBC to “just say no” to Cyrus as a coach. In addition, there are those who have turned to Twitter to sound off about Miley’s coaching styles. Miley Cyrus is quite possible the worst coach theyve ever had and easily the most annoying #thevoice #MileyCyrus — Brandon Darling (@brandon_darling) October 11, 2016 The term “annoying” was also used by another Twitter user. “Watching #TheVoice for the first time and oh my god #MileyCyrus is so incredibly annoying. It isn’t all about you. Sit down,” pleaded another. But Cyrus has her fans as well. all this yap about how annoying @MileyCyrus is on #TheVoice, but i love her! — Christina Ve'e (@_mrsvee) October 4, 2016 Although all these individuals are judging Miley, Cyrus shared with Variety that she suffers when it comes to having to judge the contestants on her Voice team. And there’s a motive behind her sometimes manically bright style, because she feels it helps to ease anxiety. That doesn’t help, however, when she has to let go of contestants, which causes her to “cry all the time,” she admitted. To help her contestants, Miley even gives them a self-help book, The Untethered Soul, along with choosing a sometimes wacky wardrobe. Miley Cyrus once teamed up with Madonna, showing off her “wild child” ways. [Image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for MTV] “I think it makes the contestants feel safer,” explained Cyrus about her fashion preferences. “When I turn around, people laugh and feel lighthearted.” In addition, Miley joked about her Disney Channel Hannah Montana days, recalling what happened as she grew up. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart…I chose weed.” Now, at 23, Cyrus is focused on her Happy Hippie foundation, which supports at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. And that’s the real motivation to serve as a coach on The Voice, she revealed. “I am only doing The Voice because that helps Happy Hippie,” explained the singer. “The Voice” coaches strike a pose. [Image by Trae Patton/NBC/The Voice] But while Miley has her eyes on the prize of the foundation, Adam Levine allegedly is involved in a feud with her, according to OK, which initially reported about the feud in August, citing a source who revealed the two were “viciously fighting.” And that’s making for some awkwardness when the cameras are turned off, added the insider. “Adam and Miley are at each other’s throats this season and Adam acts like he cannot stand her.” Moreover, the source shared that Levine does not talk to Cyrus when the cameras aren’t rolling, and behaves as if “he really wants nothing to do with her.” In addition, Radar Online unveiled a bigger battle in September, revealing that Miley was trapped in a war involving both Adam and his buddy Blake. But don’t count her out just yet. Team Miley!!!!! ❤️???????????????? #thevoice @happyhippiefdn pic.twitter.com/O8lL4EE30g — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) October 11, 2016 “Miley is saying she refuses to be beat by the old men!” a source told Radar. While the “old men” Levine and Shelton are taking on Cyrus, she’s got a friend. The “Wrecking Ball” singer has “bonded” with Alicia Keys, and the two have spent some time together away from the heat of the set, added the insider. Despite having a pal in her corner, Cyrus is at the point of trying not to quit because of the feud, according to OK. “In tears” due to Adam picking on her, Miley also is involved in constant bickering with Levine, a source told OK. “Adam and Miley were non-stop bickering during their last taping together,” shared the insider. “[Levine] nitpicks almost every single thing she says.” The result of that nit-picking? Cyrus has threatened to exit The Voice, considering quitting after the situation became “so bad,” added the source. Will she quit The Voice or hang in there? What do you think?

HOME MOBILE LOGIN LOGOUT Witt Mill Road will close for culvert replacement By MELISSA CROCKETT MESKE At Tuesday nights Jerseyville City Council meeting, John Miles, the citys street department superintendent, announced that Witt Mill Road will be closed on Oct. 17, 18 and 19. Weather permitting, work will be completed to replace the culvert that runs under a narrow section of that road. Miles stressed the importance of this road closure to facilitate the work needed to complete the project, along with being sure the public was aware of the closure. He indicated he had also notified the school district so that they had adequate time to re-route bus paths. City council members, with the absence of Gary Goetten, unanimously approved a request from Wal-Mart to hold their annual collection drive to benefit the Childrens Miracle Network on Saturday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the intersection of State Highways 67 and 16. The rain date has been set for Oct. 22 if needed. Also approved unanimously by the council members present was a resolution from the Jerseyville Public Library to close State Highway 67 between Highway 16 and Mulberry Street from 11 a.m. to 12 noon on Saturday, Oct. 29 for the annual Halloween Parade. A renewal of the health insurance plan carried through BAS/Healthlink, along with the stop loss carrier Sunlife Assurance Co., was approved unanimously for continued coverage of city employees. Bob Kincade, the citys engineer, noted that cross connection surveys were still coming in with the help of the city clerks office staff encouraging completion by residents when coming to the office to pay their water and sewer bills. Kincade also indicated that the recent press coverage of the survey and its purpose had helped with the increase in returned forms. Jerseyville Parks and Recreation Department Director Angela Sullivan took a moment to thank the council members for their support in allowing Sullivan and her staff to attend a recent conference. Mayor Billy Russell rounded out the meeting by asking once again for extreme caution from drivers in regard to pedestrians. He reminded those in attendance that, when driving, it is the law to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. Russell also stressed the need for extreme caution to be exercised by drivers on streets and routes near schools, such as the path on Liberty Street and County Road near Illini Middle School. The community needs to invoke a commitment to be careful, Russell said, noting that there have been a few close calls already. A brief commentary took place at the end of the meeting regarding any incidents or sightings of the currently trending popularity of mean clowns. One person in attendance at the meeting reported that first a fellow staff member, and later the attendees own son, both had an encounter near the R Acres of Terror venue. The first encounter involved the clown jumping out in front of the attendees co-worker into the line of traffic, causing the co-worker to slam on her brakes to avoid impact. In the second encounter, the attendees son had been temporarily distracted by a clown standing along the side of the road near the venue, dancing and waving frantically, which caused the attendees son to partake in defensive driving maneuvers. Mayor Russell and Police Chief Brad Blackorby agreed to share this with county officials.  submit your comments  Sitemap

Photo by Michael Christianson By Michael Christianson Thanksgiving gives everyone time to reflect and be thankful for what they have. It is also a great opportunity to give back and help out those who are less fortunate. At the Dryden Food Bank they are giving and helping all year round. Thanksgiving is just the start of the busy season at the food bank but they have been very fortunate so far this year with donations from local grocers such as Wal- Mart and Safeway. Wal-Mart is now providing bread, which is baked fresh in the store. Safeway has stepped up with their food drive matching donations and several churches and schools also help to support the food bank. Food bank manager Keith Grant says they have also received over a ton of potatoes and other fresh produce from local farmers. “The fall things pick up you know, Thanksgiving, people are thankful for what they have and so they think of expressing that by helping others and so we normally have a number of food drives that kick in in September and school starts up again and they’re doing class food drives,” said Grant. “It’s October already and usually around mid-November people are thinking of Christmas and we get food drives happening. About one third of our whole year’s supply both financial and food comes in around November, December and even into January a bit and so that’s an important time of year and we’re looking forward to that.” The Dryden Food Bank also accepts cash donations which they can stretch farther because of the deals and generosity they receive from local retailers.

About 100 people attended the event, held inside First United Presbyterian Church’s fellowship hall. The evening began with candidates running for county assessor and county judge before transitioning to the city’s mayoral candidates and City Council hopefuls. Here are our notes from the mayoral candidate portion of the event: Introductions Local developer Tom Terminella began by telling the audience he is a 46-year resident of Fayetteville with four children and a wife of 25 years. He’s 49 years old and owns a real estate company located on Meadow Street. Mayor Lioneld Jordan, 62, said his family has lived in Northwest Arkansas for six generations. He’s a 44-year resident of Fayetteville and has been married to his wife for 40 years. Jordan said his nearly 16 years of experience as mayor and alderman are what qualifies him for another term, and said Fayetteville’s recent ranking as the 3rd best place to live in the U.S. is proof that the city is in good shape. Ron Baucom, 59, said he is a graduate of the University of Arkansas who spent many years working as a manager at Walmart before serving as auditor for a local contractor. He currently cares for his 89-year-old mother and works a part-time job. He said he has conservative values, and would like the city to be more fiscally responsible with taxpayer money. Fayetteville has experienced unprecedented growth in population and diversity. Considering that, what is your vision for Fayetteville? Baucom spoke first and said the city should continue to welcome diversity. “We’ve got a great city with a diverse group of folks here – very intelligent folks,” Baucom said. “We need to continue to work on that and use everyone’s knowledge and input from the entire city to help us further that cause. I think we just need to keep on going.” Mayor Lioneld Jordan / Staff photo Jordan started by saying if elected, he would continue his streak of responsible fiscal management which has included seven balanced annual budgets in a row. “I know how to manage money,” Jordan said, adding that sales tax revenue is up by over 5 percent this year, and that building permits in Fayetteville are also up to 770 on the year. Jordan said his vision for Fayetteville is to become the “Startup City of the South” by leveraging the city’s growing startup community which led to last year’s ranking of Fayetteville as being one of the top three places outside of Silicon Valley and New York to start a business. Terminella said his first vision is to put a stop to special elections and tax increases. “The mayor’s supervision over taxpayers’ dollars bothers me on a daily basis,” said Terminella, adding that he believes there are some municipal infrastructure issues that need to be addressed. He called the police department and the administrative offices for the Parks & Recreation and Transportation divisions “inadequate facilities.” He said he’s heard from people who’ve said Fayetteville is “so hard to do commerce in that we’re just going to steer clear and go to Bentonville.” Terminella said that bothers him. With growth there are always growing pains. Please identify one major challenge as a result of growth and how you would address it. Jordan answered first and said the biggest challenge is adding infrastructure to handle the increased population. He said he’s presided over $81 million worth of infrastructure improvements over the last eight years, and plans to continue with road projects and expansion of the city’s trail and sidewalk systems. Jordan also took a jab at his opponent, saying it was “interesting” to hear Terminella say business owners are skipping over Fayetteville considering the city is currently receiving an average of one new business license application per day. Terminella said the city is “suffering from inadequate infrastructure” and promised to make improvements to municipal facilities a priority if elected. He said he’d like to see a new water tower built in west Fayetteville, and told the crowd he’d do a better job of managing taxpayer dollars than the current administration. Baucom said he’d focus on public safety and work to help low-income families increase their household income. Discuss your strategy for bringing businesses to Fayetteville. What industries would you target? Tom Terminella / Staff photo Baucom said he’d like to see more green technology and industrial-type companies locate to Fayetteville. He said any companies that offer higher living-wage jobs would be welcome. Baucom also said he’d consider changes to the city’s sign ordinance, which he said can be burdensome on some businesses. Jordan pointed to the city’s new five-year economic development plan, which, he said, features a two-pronged approach focusing on both entrepreneurs and business retention. Terminella said the city should work to attract new convention, dining, and retail companies. “Fayetteville has completely lost its hospitality and convention business to Benton County,” he said, adding that he was also frustrated with the Walton Arts Center’s decision to build the AMP in Rogers over Fayetteville. He said he and his wife travel to Bentonville and Rogers multiple times each week to eat and shop, and that he does all his car shopping in Benton County. Terminella also criticized the city’s permitting process and said there are developers who don’t feel welcome in Fayetteville when presenting plans. He said he recently spoke with a homebuilder friend who said the approval process in Bentonville is easier than it is in Fayetteville. “I’m concerned with that,” he said. Closing remarks Ron Baucom / Staff photo Jordan used his closing remarks to respond to Terminella’s comments, and said he’s surprised to hear that anyone feels unwelcome in Fayetteville. He said he instituted an open-door policy when he was first elected and has worked hard to make sure everyone’s voice is heard, including developers, who he has been meeting with for the last four years to help make changes to the city’s permitting process. Baucom said he is running a very low-budget, self-funded campaign and is looking for votes anywhere he can get them. I’m running my campaign with my heart,” he said, adding that he was taught the value of hard work and has tried to teach the same thing to his three children and six grandchildren. Terminella said it’s clear all three candidates care deeply about Fayetteville, but said he wants new leadership and is confident he can provide it. “I think Lioneld is passionate and truly loves this city, but I think it’s time for a change,” Terminella said.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images Miley Cyrus has always been an open book. Whether she's talking about politics or refusing to appear on red carpets, she's always beautifully real. And a recent interview with Variety is no exception. In it, Cyrus discusses everything from her choice to stand with Hillary Clinton, to her decision to prioritize smoking weed over having a clothing line in Walmart. She also talks about what it means to be pansexual. "My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality," Cyrus told Variety. "I always hated the word 'bisexual,' because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl." Cyrus then explained that she went to a Los Angeles LGBTQ center, where she encountered individuals who identified as gender-neutral. This helped her understand and discover her own gender identity. "I related to that person more than I related to anyone in my life," Cyrus said. "People may not see me as neutral as I feel. But I feel very neutral." She explained that learning about her gender—she identifies as "unassigned"—helped her better understand her sexuality. "I was like, 'Oh, that's why I don't feel straight and I don't feel gay,'" she said. "It's because I'm not." Pansexuality, also known as omnisexuality, is the attraction toward people of any sex or gender identity. It's not the same as bisexuality, which means the attraction to more than one gender. Whereas bisexuals are attracted to men and women, pansexuals are attracted to men, women, cisgender people, transgender people, intersex people, and people who identify anywhere else on the continuum. Cyrus revealed that it was initially hard for her to come out to her conservative family. But she's since reached a place of peace and acceptance. One thing she said especially helped her was serving as a role model for a contestant on The Voice, who came out as a result of Cyrus' mentorship. Thank you, Cyrus, for your unending honesty. We're so glad to see you out and thriving.

One of the men threatened to shoot and kill a detective after his arrest, according to a statement from the police department. Authaurio Pauldo and Khalico Francis, both 19 of Macon, Georgia, were arrested at a Wal-Mart on Route 23 on Wednesday. Police believe the men work for a traveling maintenance company that was working in the area. While in custody, Pauldo threatened the life of a detective with a firearm. Police say they seized a 9 mm automatic handgun, a large capacity ammunition magazine, a 30-round polymer magazine and "RIP cartridge-style hollow-point bullets," the statement said. Francis was also found in possession of gold-colored brass knuckles, police allege. Pauldo is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of hollow point bullets, possession of a large capacity ammunition magazine, and terroristic threats. Francis is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of hollow point bullets, possession of a large capacity ammunition magazine, and possession of a weapon other than a firearm, specifically the brass knuckles. Both men were held in the Sussex County Jail.  Pauldo was held on $25,000 bail without a 10-percent option and Francis was held on $35,000 bail also without a 10-percent option. The investigation remains ongoing. Spencer Kent may be reached at skent@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @SpencerMKent. Find the Find NJ.com on Facebook. Most Read N.J.

ASDA recall sausage rolls over allergy fears Birmingham Mail 12/10/2016 By James Rodger One of the biggest supermarket chains in Birmingham is recalling some of its popular food items. Asda, which operates numerous stores across Birmingham and throughout the surrounding West Midlands area, has moved to withdraw packs of its Tiger Sausage Rolls. The packs, which feature six of the popular pastry items, are being recalled because they contain undeclared ingredients. Rubicon drink recalled over fears it could contain alcohol In a statement on the Food Standards Agency website, the Walmart-owned retailer says they contain milk which has not been included on the ingredients list on the exterior packaging of the product. As such, it is feared customers and shoppers from across the country - including Birmingham - with an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents could be at risk. The full details can be seen below: Product: ASDA Tiger Sausage Rolls Pack size: 6pk/ 372g ‘Use By’ date: All date codes. If you have bought the above product and have an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents do not eat it. Instead return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund. The supermarket chain has contacted the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall. © Provided by Birmingham Mail ASDA recalls Rocky Road Bites after 'egg' missed from ingredients The company has also issued a point-of-sale notice to its customers. These notices explain to customers why the product is/products are being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the product.

Wilma Price, from Houston, saw the man holding a sign outside a Wal-Mart store which read: “Dog in pound, need help.” That man was Patrick who was unable to afford the $120 needed to get his canine friend Franklin out of the pound and so Ms Price stepped in to help. Ms Price, who gave Patrick the money he needed to release the dog, admitted she was ‘shocked’ by the positive response to her Facebook post. “He is a wonderful man and Franklin is a wonderful dog,” she explained. “I did this because I would want somebody to do it for me. I've (looked after) homeless animals all my life and dedicated my life to them. “We all could be in his situation in the blink of an eye and you never know somebody’s situation or what's going on in their life.” She added: “I am not a very judgmental person and I never judge somebody by the cover of their book - until you've walked in their shoes you have no idea what somebody [has gone] through. “You should always pay it forward if you're able because like I said, in the blink of an eye you could be in the same situation. “I know how hard I struggle everyday just to make sure that the animals have everything and will never end back up on the street again while they're waiting for their forever home.” Meanwhile,  these shelter dogs were adopted together because they wouldn’t stop cuddling.  While this abandoned dog left 'frozen with fear' won't stop staring at the wall.  Favourite British dogs gallery Follow Telegraph News READ MORE ABOUT: Trending Dogs Show more News latest 14 Nov 2016, 7:00am 11th Duke of Devonshire becomes unlikely fashion icon in new Chatsworth show revealing slogan jumper 'Never Marry a Mitford' 14 Nov 2016, 6:55am Comment: President Trump is not going to be the ogre some fear, but we need to mend fences – I can help with that  Nigel Farage Premium 14 Nov 2016, 6:48am Strictly Come Dancing 2016, week 8 results: Daisy Lowe is eliminated as Ed Balls goes through to Blackpool 14 Nov 2016, 6:47am X Factor 2016 week 5 results: Honey G accused of being "disrespectful" during Remembrance Day song, but Sam Lavery is voted off 02:32 14 Nov 2016, 6:38am What is a 'supermoon' and when can I see the largest moon in 70 years? 14 Nov 2016, 6:30am Comment: Censoring Marine Le Pen damages a free society Robin Aitken Premium 14 Nov 2016, 6:00am Scotland facing up to £1.3 billion extra cuts thanks to Brexit 'growth shock' 14 Nov 2016, 6:00am City watchdogs fear Lifetime Isa could lead to mis-selling scandal Gallery 14 Nov 2016, 6:00am Gallery: Pictures of the Day: 14 November 2016 14 Nov 2016, 5:51am Steve Bannon: Who is the Donald Trump's chief strategist and why is he so feared? 01:01 14 Nov 2016, 5:34am New Zealand earthquake: Powerful aftershocks keep rocking the country after 7.8 magnitude quake kills two in South Island 14 Nov 2016, 4:47am At $800,000 a pop, new Navy destroyer's ammo is in question 14 Nov 2016, 4:00am Westworld episode 7 recap: Bernard conspiracy theorists finally get an answer 14 Nov 2016, 3:25am First woman to fly China's J-10 fighter killed in crash 14 Nov 2016, 2:55am Comment: Walnut's last walk: If you love an animal, you set yourself up for heartbreak Jane Shilling Premium 14 Nov 2016, 12:39am Ivana Trump tells Donald to make her US Ambassador to Czech Republic  01:12 14 Nov 2016, 12:14am Donald Trump's first television interview: deporting illegal immigrants, building the wall and considering locking up Hillary Clinton  14 Nov 2016, 12:01am Theresa May says Donald's Trump's victory shows why Britain needs to control immigration 14 Nov 2016, 12:01am Brexit Britain should lead the way by banning mass antibiotic use in agriculture, says top doctors 14 Nov 2016, 12:01am Chocolate fans paying TWICE as much for small boxes, Which? warns  14 Nov 2016, 12:01am Sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco have cost the Treasury more than £31 billion, analysis finds If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

But did you know that you can find Amazon deals at Black Friday prices every day? Amazon has quickly become the top online retailer and is known for tremendous discounts and cheap prices. If you want to find a great sale, you might want to look online rather than at your local department store. We’ll leave the financial analysts to debate over the long-term impact Amazon has on brick-and-mortar retail businesses and focus on immediate tasks like finding Black Friday sale prices on days that aren’t national shopping events. According to an E-Marketer report, Amazon ranks as the fifth largest worldwide retailer and is expected to see continued growth through 2020. Amazon comes in at the top spot when ranking online sales and retailers, reports Internet Retailer. In fact, Amazon’s rise has meant that brick-and-mortar stores need to make changes to remain viable in the online world. Walmart continues to lead in worldwide sales but is heavily shifting their digital sales strategy to maintain their lead and competency with Amazon. So what is Amazon’s secret to success? There are several reasons why Amazon continues to attract and keep new customers, and these reasons include offering incredible deals, fast shipping times, and even Black Friday prices on certain items every day of the year. The key to finding Amazon Black Friday prices every day is knowing how to navigate the site. Prime members are often presented with the best deals and get free two-day shipping on qualifying items. This alone is time saving and can save consumers money and time that would otherwise be spent on gas driving to and from their local store. Every time you access the official Amazon website, you’ll find there are categories to shop. If you check the top options on the category page, you’ll often find links for sales and deals in that category. This is a great way to find items you are looking for at discount prices. #Save 70% and more with today's daily #deals at #Amazon https://t.co/ucPYMLDyXw pic.twitter.com/81mOB9nPr6 — Mary Turner (@thesaleswhopper) October 12, 2016 Also, when you shop by category, you’ll find many options that you can choose to include in your search on the left-side column. If you’re looking for deals with Black Friday prices, tick the option for items marked down 70 percent off and more. For example, if you were shopping for jewelry deals and sales at Black Friday prices, you can tick the brands, metal types, and discount percentage you’re looking for. There’s no guarantee that what you’re looking for will be available, but if you search on a regular basis, you’re certain to come across some incredible deals. Another method for finding Amazon sales and deals at Black Friday prices is to shop the daily deals. Amazon has a number of daily deals, including lightning deals (time sensitive events), regular deals, and watched deals. Prime members receive early advance access to daily deals. When you browse Amazon’s daily deals, you’ll find the setup is very similar to shopping in other categories. There is a left-side panel that allows consumers to tick category options. You also have the option of browsing daily deals based upon the percentage of the discount. Choose discounts at 70 percent and more and you’ll find incredible, blow out prices on daily deals. One advantage to keeping an eye on Amazon’s daily deals is that one of the options includes browsing missed deals. You’ll find that even if you miss a 70 percent off Amazon daily deal, you can still get the item at a discount. Some daily deals tend to repeat, while others are one-time sales.

Images Courtesy: Orange Police Department ORANGE, Mass. (WWLP) – The man and woman charged in a home invasion murder in the Franklin County town of Orange are expected to be back in Massachusetts and in court by Friday. Joshua Hart and Brittany Smith were arraigned in a Virginia courtroom Tuesday afternoon, three days after their capture in the parking lot of a Walmart in Lexington, VA. They are accused of murdering 95 year-old Thomas Harty and severely injuring Harty’s wife, Joanna Fisher, after breaking into their East River Street home last week. The two allegedly made a getaway in the couple’s Toyota Corolla wagon, and continued to commit crimes while on the run. They are accused of committing a robbery at a mall in Harrisonburg, Virginia two days after Harty’s murder. Hart and Smith waived rendition during their arraignment on fugitive from justice charges in Rockbridge County, Virginia Tuesday. They are scheduled for arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, home invasion, and robbery at Orange District Court late Friday morning. 22News is continuing to cover this story, and will bring you the latest developments as they become available.

Credit WAVY-TV 10. PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — Former Portsmouth police officer Stephen Rankin has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for the shooting death of William Chapman II. A jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter during a trial in August. Rankin was originally charged with first degree murder. Jurors could have recommended up to 10 years for Rankin, but instead recommended two and a half years. Supporters of the Chapman family applauded when the judge affirmed the jury’s recommendation. FULL COVERAGE: Stephen Rankin Trial The former police officer shot and killed Chapman outside of a Walmart on Frederick Boulevard during an April 2015 encounter. The judge heard from several witnesses, including Dawn Rankin, the defendant’s wife. Former Portsmouth police officer Stephen Rankin.

He is not a perfect man, but he works hard to be present, loving, and kind,” she said, through tears. Rankin’s ex-wife Cori Johnson painted a different picture, saying she was concerned that without consequences, Rankin would “become further empowered to do something worse next.” A sergeant with the Portsmouth Police Department testified that Rankin was “a good officer” who was “fun to be around.” Rankin apologized to the Chapman family and addressed William’s mother directly. “Ms. Chapman, I hope that one day you find peace and that one day you’ll be able to forgive me,” he said. “I can’t,” she responded. Defense attorneys James Broccoletti and Nicole Belote are appealing the verdict. Photos: Stephen Rankin Trial “This is not a day to celebrate anything. Their family lost a child. They should be concerned about that and they should be grieving for the child not celebrating the fact that another family has now been torn apart,” Broccoletti said. During a recess in the hearing, Rankin talked to one of the jurors who convicted him. Peggy Thorpe now regrets the role she played. “The wrong decision was made that day. I should have stuck with my gut and my heart and followed that and said not guilty, because he is not guilty,” she said outside court.

A peace rally was organized Wednesday morning outside of the Portsmouth Courthouse, ahead of Rankin’s hearing. Chapman’s mother said she was ready to see Rankin go to prison. “I want the whole world to see that this man is not above the law just because he was an officer. Anybody that takes somebody’s life deserves to be punished,” she said.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share John Hewitt Oct 12th 2016 9:54AM The neediest Americans will be short $100 billion in delayed tax refunds at a time when they're really counting on it. Chaos may ensue, an issue neither presidential candidate is addressing. In June, I sounded the alarm on How Congress is About to Screw Up the Economy in an Unprecedented Way. The more we learn about the PATH Act of 2015, however, the louder this alarm needs to be. I'm now calling it Y2K for the Tax Industry. First, a short primer on what's happening. The PATH Act stands for Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes. As a headline, it sounds commendable and does include legislation for more than $620 billion in tax reductions for families and businesses. Unfortunately, the PATH Act also means a delay in millions of refunds. It is now against the law for the IRS to issue a refund before February 15 to any taxpayer who is claiming the Additional Child Tax or Earned Income Tax Credit. Congress has allowed this delay in order to give the IRS more time to detect possible fraud. More From Inc.com: 10 New Products Under $35 That Will Totally Upgrade Your Mornings The Earned Income Tax Credit is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income and, by our estimate; the new rule could affect 30 million taxpayers by delaying more than $100 billion in refunds. RELATED: Anyone who's filed taxes will relate to these 10 quotes 11 PHOTOS 10 things we've all said while filing our taxes See Gallery 10 things we've all said while filing our taxes "It's only January, I have plenty of time!" You're relaxed, you're casual, what even are taxes anyway? You don't care! It's so far away that filing taxes isn't even remotely on your radar, to be honest. Photo credit: Getty "The imminent act of filing is upon me and I literally have nothing ready..." Tax season is now approaching and that creeping anxiety about getting everything done on time is starting to set in. It's essentially biting at your heels and you know you have to get moving. Photo credit: Getty No words. Just emotional paralysis. You're screwed. You need to start doing your paperwork but you physically do not know where to even begin. It's time. It's happening. Photo credit: Getty "I HAVE A MILLION THINGS I NEED TO DO, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PAPERS AND QUESTIONS, SOMEBODY HELP ME!" That anxiety you felt creeping in earlier? Now it's full-fledged onset. This stage is often accompanied by screaming out loud, pulling hair, crying, etc. Photo credit: Getty "Wait, did I get all of my papers in? Did I check that one box correctly? Does it look like I'm trying to evade some of these taxes? What if I go to jail? Can I go to jail for that? WHO WILL FEED MY DOG WHEN I AM IN JAIL?!" It's like handing in an exam in school and wishing you could grab it back and double check your answers one more time. Who was that celebrity you heard about that went to jail for tax evasion? Because now you're convinced that's totally going to be you. Spoiler alert: as long as you did everything to the best of your knowledge and ability, you probably won't go to jail. And even if you do, you'll find someone to walk your dog. Photo credit: Getty "I got this, I'm almost done, a few more papers and I'm in the clear. I just have to pound through the rest of it. Go me!" "Go you" is right! Now you're on cruise control and you're on track to get everything done well and on time. You're unstoppable in the delight of the world that is tax filing. Photo credit: Getty "Thank god that's over with, now I can relax! What to do with all this stress-free free time!" Finally, relief. Your papers are filed and sent out into the universe. It's off your back at last. Now on to more important things, like Netflix. Photo credit: Getty "When is my return coming? Is this going to be my life for the rest of my life? Yep, it is. So about that return..." Now, you wait. You want that money. And the inevitable truth that your life will now be a neverending cycle of filing taxes and waiting for your return. Photo credit: Getty "SCORE my return was so much better than I expected! I'm buying a new dress. Or five. Probably five, why not?" You're on a total life-high now. The possibilities of what you can spend your return on seem endless and even if you don't, having a nice bonus hunk of cash in your pocket feels pretty good. It made all of that stress completely worth it. Photo credit: Getty "Honestly filing wasn't even that bad this year. And now I don't have to think about it anymore. Well at least not for another year. But no use in worrying about that now!" Alas, acceptance. You know you'll fall victim to the vicious cycle again when next year rolls around. But truthfully, you wouldn't have it any other way. Okay, you obviously would. But you'll never change your procrastinating ways!

While the February 15 date creates a timing problem for our nation's economy, there will be additional problems that Congress clearly hasn't thought through. These checks will need to be cashed. Word on the street will be that taxpayers can get their refunds on the 15th. The fact is, banks don't keep that kind of cash on hand to serve millions of customers all at once. Many clients cash their checks at Walmart or another check-cashing service, especially if they don't have a bank account. These organizations also don't keep that amount of cash available to serve this large number of consumers in one day. In other words, you may be holding a check that you simply can't cash right away. RELATED: Comparing presidential candidate proposed tax plans Computer system overloads could create more delays. This is the other reason I'm calling this Tax Y2K: a potential software glitch and/or system overload that could result when the IRS sends tax preparers a computer file that is at least 6 times larger than normal. This computer file contains information about the refunds due customers of that tax preparer. Think of this as a massive download of information impacting $100 billion in refunds, all on one day. This needs to be processed by the IRS systems, tax preparers and the banks. Additionally, many check cashers use systems that help authenticate the check. These systems may not be capable of handling the massive volume, further slowing the process of customers getting their cash. There's one more factor to add to this perfect storm. Historically, the IRS issues refunds to 85% of the taxpayers right away; 15% of the projected refunds are held for further checking; they may have back taxes or other issues that need to be investigated. Yet another delay to the already delayed tax returns. More From Inc.com: 15 Books These Successful Executives Say Inspired Them the Most Get the picture? If there is a line down the block with 100 people waiting for their money on February 15th, an estimated 15 will go home empty handed. How do you think these people will feel and why does this matter so much? In June, I wrote about the impact on the poorest in this country. We call it Tax-mas. For Congress, we should just call this bad timing. Clearly, our lawmakers haven't considered the economic impact of tax refunds to American citizens. Neither presidential candidate is addressing this problem. Think about it. Or maybe you've lived it. In order to have a better Christmas, many people don't pay their January rent on time; they catch up with their refund. Now they may be late on both January and February rent, creating a domino effect for both renters and landlords. RELATED: Federal taxation over time InsideGov | Graphiq In my experience, more than half of all American citizens rely on their tax refund to catch up on holiday bills or just provide food for their families. This is also the time millions of Americans go shopping. This delay will impact discount stores such as Walmart and Target, cell phone companies and other businesses which usually bring in billions of dollars in revenue in late January because of the tax refunds. February 15th - Y2K for the Tax Industry.

Resend activation e-mail Ministry of Innovation / Business of Technology Amazon to challenge Walmart with new brick-and-mortar grocery stores Like Amazon Fresh, but you can pick food out yourself. by Valentina Palladino - Oct 12, 2016 2:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 88 Rachel Murray / Getty Images Amazon has already infiltrated the grocery business with its Fresh delivery program, and the company now has its sights set on physical stores. A report from The Wall Street Journal claims Amazon is planning to open grocery stores where people can buy items like produce, milk, meat, and other perishable items. Some of those locations are also rumored to have curbside pickup programs where employees will deliver orders directly to consumers' cars. According to the report, these stores will primarily sell perishable items, letting customers pick their own produce—or at least allowing employees to pick things fresh for orders. There are also plans to let customers order other grocery items, like peanut butter and cereal, from a mobile app or devices in the store, for same-day delivery. The project, known internally as Project Como, will first be available to current Amazon Fresh members. Amazon Fresh used to cost $299 per year, but the company recently lowered the price to a $15 per month fee that Prime members can pay in addition to their annual $99 membership fee if they want to take advantage of the grocery delivery program. If and when Project Como gets off the ground, Amazon would be directly competing with numerous grocery chains across the country, not to mention brick-and-mortar behemoth Walmart, which has expanded its curbside pickup efforts recently. Walmart plans to bring that service to a quarter of its stores nationwide by the end of 2017. Amazon would also be competing with startups that specialize in grocery delivery like FreshDirect, Instacart, and Delivery.com. This news comes on the heels of Amazon reportedly trying to amp up its shipping and delivery network, to potentially compete with FedEx and UPS. The two services will be undoubtably linked: Amazon already has to deliver Fresh orders, and it would need an even greater delivery network if it hopes to deliver groceries from brick-and-mortar stores to local customers. But as crucial as groceries are to every household in the country, it's a costly industry for providers. According to The Wall Street Journal report, Americans spend about $107 per week on groceries. That amounts of about $5,500 per year, which is much more than roughly $2,500 Amazon Prime members spend per year using the service. This could mean big bucks for Amazon if it can compete with established grocers and get Prime members to convert, but it would take a solid network of stores and a reliable delivery system to do so. Unlike regular packages, groceries have to be delivered in a narrow window of time, customers typically have to be home to accept the delivery, and the issue of keeping food cold is crucial. Amazon is close to opening its first drive-in grocery store in Seattle. But like many of Amazon's recent big projects, it could take years before we see Amazon grocery stores around the country.

Scott Gamm Oct 12, 2016 8:40 AM EDT Amazon (AMZN) has won online retail, but there's a battle brewing for second place, according to one expert. "They key in our view is to be the second website that people might go to after the Amazon site," said Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's, adding that Walmart's (WMT) recent acquisition of Jet.com bolsters its web presence. He said Target (TGT) has been suffering from its 2013 credit card breach and he doesn't think Target wants to narrow the gap it has with Walmart. "I think Target wants to do what Target has done well in the past and that is to provide a distinct, differentiated shopping experience for its consumers."

News Online Exclusives Sports Opinion Features Relays Edition Fuel Themes 2015 Opinion: There are opportunities to be eco-friendly on campus 0Shares 0 0 0 About Staff Advertising Privacy Policy Virtual Edition NEWS TIP News Online Exclusives Sports Opinion Features Relays Edition Opinion Opinion: There are opportunities to be eco-friendly on campus NATALIE LARIMER 1 month ago 0 0Shares 0 0 0 BY NATALIE LARIMER Here at Drake, we have a strange outlook on environmental issues. We have compost bins at Quad, but since nobody uses them correctly, Sodexo has to put the compost bags into the trash. Every dorm has a recycling bin provided, but the amount of people that I know who just use it as a regular trash can is astronomical. Just in the last two days, I’ve picked up about a trash can full of litter that was within 20 feet of a trash can. So how do we fix this and become more of an environmentally friendly campus? Well, there are simple solutions to those examples above. I should hope you can infer them. But that’s not enough. We have the opportunity to cut back on severe cases of pollution and waste, and here’s what we can do. First, if you have a car on campus and you have a bike/skateboard/any form of non-gasoline vehicle that can transport you a short distance, use it rather than the car. I work at Mars Café and you can bet that I bike there every chance I get, regardless of the forecast. You don’t have to take your car to go to Walgreens. Walmart is close, but not close enough to bike, so take the bus. It will run regardless if you’re on it or not, so you might as well save the gas money and the exhaust fumes and hop on, especially since your ID gets you a free ride on the Dart Bus at all times. Use those reusable water bottles that you keep getting and not using. Drake has given me at least three free water bottles and you can easily get one for like five bucks at Walgreens. We have those nice water bottle fillers on most of our water fountains, and this way you’re not wasting all that plastic that is harmful to the environment and potentially even you. Cut down that shower time and save some water. Yes, it’s nice to have an escape for a while and just soak in the hot water, but that’s not only bad for the Earth, but it can be bad for you too. Speaking as somebody with severely dry skin, taking long showers turns my skin into parchment. All of the necessary moisture and oils get stripped from your skin the longer you stay in there. And as for the Earth, it’s not just wasting water, it’s wasting energy as well. It takes energy to heat the water and filter it back into the system. Even though we live in Iowa where we have a prominent community of windmills that generate clean energy, we are still get 40.11 percent of our energy from coal, according to the Iowa Utilities Board. Speaking of energy, turn off your lights when you leave the room and when you’re on your laptop watching Netflix. Basically any time you don’t need the lights on, turn them off. Even if you aren’t paying for the bill, you’re paying for the side effects on the Earth. Sorry to get all preachy on you guys, I’m just very passionate about this stuff. So learn how to compost. There are posters by each compost bin. Start recycling and just throw away your trash. I’m sick of picking it up for you.

The Fulton Police Department will be participating in the National Take Back Initiative Oct. 22 and collecting old and unwanted medicines for proper disposal. (Photo by Adam Armour) It’s time to crack open the medicine cabinet and check the dates on all those orange bottles because Itawamba County’s drug drop-off program is returning later this moth. Itawamba County residents needing to rid their cabinets of unwanted medicines can drop them off at the Fulton Walmart, Saturday, Oct. 22, from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Participants can either throw the bottle itself away — just make sure all identification is removed — or pour the meds into one of the designated containers at the drop-off point and keep the bottle. The entire process will take only a minute. Once the pills are collected, the DEA will visit and carry them away for disposal. Itawamba County has participated in this nationwide event, held bi-annually, for the past several years. Overall, hundreds of pounds of medicine have been collected locally during that time … medicine organizers believe could have easily wound up in the wrong hands. Typically, around 100 pounds of prescription drugs are collected during each of these events. The goal of the program is to stem the tide of prescription drug abuse. Statistics released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that while illegal narcotic use is on the decline, prescription drug abuse has risen considerably in the past few years. An estimated one-third of the people over the age of 12 who used drugs for the first time in 2009 did so by using a prescription drug non-medically. Prescription drug abuse has been classified as an epidemic by the Center of Disease Control, and Mississippi is certainly not immune. In 2012 alone, an estimated 90 percent of the state’s overdose deaths were a result of prescription drug abuse, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health. In Mississippi, the number of drug overdose deaths, most of which were a result of prescription drugs, has tripled since 1999. Mississippi currently has the 30th highest drug overdose mortality rate in the country. Some of the most commonly abused prescription drugs include opioids (Lortab, Vicodin, OxyContin, Lomotil, Demerol), central nervous system depressants (Valium, Xanax, Nembutal) and stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine) In many cases of prescription drug abuse, the abuser knows the person from whom he or she got the medicine. Since prescription medication isn’t illegal, it’s harder to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands. Law enforcement officials believe having a stockpile of these kinds of medications can be kind of like storing old magazines next to the gas furnace; it’s a disaster just waiting to happen. Itawambians can help curtail the problem by safely disposing of expired prescription medication. For more information on the event, contact Jason Woodward with the Fulton Police Department by calling 662-231-3760 or 862-3441.

This story is part of Enquirer Breaking News Police: Man exposed himself to trick-or-treater Lane closures and sobriety checkpoints Mom, daughter arrested in alleged murder-for-hire Police: Woman stole from Wal-Mart, led chase Jessica Schmidt, Fox19 5:29 p.m. EDT October 12, 2016 Amanda Holinde (Photo: Provided/Hamilton County Sheriff's Office) Evendale police said a 30-year-old woman stole from a retailer, led officers on a car chase, wrecked a car and then tried to escape custody. With almost $1,500 worth of merchandise in tow, police said Amanda Holinde walked out of the Wal-Mart on Cunningham Road in Evendale around 11:55 p.m. Monday. A store loss prevention officer said he tried to stop her because she had not paid for any of the items, but she took off. "It's crazy to me because if you stole something, just say 'yeah I stole it,'" Ashley Scott, a witness, said. Officers said they chased Holinde while dozens of other drivers were also on the road. They said they tried several times to get her to pull over, but she didn't. Investigators reported they were eventually able to use stop sticks, and that's when the chase came to a halt. After the crash, police said Holinde jumped out of the car and took off running towards a parking lot. Police caught up with her there and arrested her. "The cops were screaming 'stop, get down.' Then I saw her in handcuffs," Scott said. Police cleared the scene and took her to the hospital to be checked out. Then they took her to the Hamilton County Jail. Both Evendale Police and Reading Police are still investigating the case. Holinde is facing charges of theft and failure to comply with a police officer. Enquirer media partner Fox19 provided this report.

Whether it be in comfort or comfort food, a great deal of families in the area are looking for outside help, especially as the cold weather seasons approach. In an effort to meet those needs, the Brush United Methodist Church has teamed up with a surplus of community partners to open their hearts and their pantry to serve citizens living in Brush, Hillrose and Snyder. Since the doors opened on September 1, the Brush Community Cupboard has served an average of 250 families per month and welcomes any in need to simply stop by to help fill their own cupboards at home. From food donated from the TEFAP emergency food assistance program provided by the government and the Food Bank of the Rockies, to local donations from area churches, Brush Grocery Kart, JD’s Quik Stop, Walmart and other individual donations of food and money to purchase it, the Brush Community Cupboard is packed with a great deal of community pride, spirit and aid. The local JD’s Quik Stop offers pizza from their Hunt Bros. line and Brush Grocery Kart has started up a donation campaign that invites shoppers at the store to purchase bags whose proceeds go directly to help keep the local Community Cupboard packed with produce and other goodies. Advertisement “We have a great team here who help out,” said organizer Deb Loose during a rainy Thursday that saw the United Methodist Church basement in Brush packed with families in need. She notes that volunteers there have included manager Alyce Carter, coordinator Reverend Phil Vogel, Kathy Wilhite, Rod Schaeffer, Doug Chenowith, Courtney Knight, Bob Smith, Laura Ingmire, Kristi Dillehay, Dawn Knight, Shirley Schilling, Carol Carlson, Rusty Edelan, Gary Branberg, Kathy Smith and others who offer their time and help toward the cause each week. The Brush United Methodist Church also offers a service, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) for senior citizens. The program works to improve the health of low-income elderly persons at least 60 years of age, by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA foods. The Brush Community Cupboard is located at the Brush United Methodist Church at 1705 Edmunds Street and opens its doors each Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., inviting all to simply show up and sign in, with residents from Brush, Hillrose and Snyder being eligible. More information is available by calling the church at (970) 842-2522. Donations are always graciously accepted and can be dropped off during the Thursday hours, or during office hours of Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. For those in Fort Morgan, the food pantry offering is held at the Rising Up Client Choice Food Pantry, located at 527 State Street, which is open Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1  to 4 p.m., on Tuesdays from 3 to 5:30 p.m. and Fridays from 9 a.m. to noon. They can be found online at www.RisingUpMorganCounty.com or by calling (970) 867-5555.

Jose Anthony Mouw, 44, was arraigned Tuesday in Twin Falls County Magistrate Court on felony counts of trafficking in methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance. Prosecutors say Mouw has a long criminal history dating back to the early ‘90s with at least half a dozen convictions for various drug sale crimes. On Friday, police reported finding 1.76 pounds of methamphetamine in Mouw’s trunk, and they said it was wrapped in cedar branches aimed at disguising the smell. Twin Falls Police Officer Bradley Baisch reported that Sgt. Kevin Loosli called him Friday night and told him about a man acting suspiciously, Baisch wrote in a sworn affidavit. The man, later identified as Mouw, approached the off-duty police sergeant in the parking lot of Target and asked him for directions to Wal-Mart. “Loosli found this odd as the male was in the parking lot to Target and Winco, and the three stores all sell similar items,” Baisch said. “Loosli also advised me the male was driving a rental car bearing Arizona license plates … and he was not carrying any luggage.” Loosli followed Mouw to Wal-Mart, where it appeared he purchased a pay-per-minute cellphone, court documents said. Later, after stopping him for a traffic violation, officers found Mouw’s car littered with other items they said hinted at long-distance drug trafficking, like empty energy drink cans, fast food wrappers, a cooler, a butane fuel canister, several knives and three cellphones. Mouw told officers he was driving from San Diego to Nampa to visit a cousin who was recently in a car crash, and he denied being on probation or parole, court documents said. When Baisch’s service dog alerted on the car, officers searched the vehicle and found marijuana and pills. But the biggest discovery was in the trunk, where police found a plastic sack holding two large, black packages wrapped in cedar branches, Baisch said. Both packages were filled with methamphetamine, and the cedar branches were an attempt to mask the smell. Mouw is being held in the Twin Falls County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bond, and a preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 21.
