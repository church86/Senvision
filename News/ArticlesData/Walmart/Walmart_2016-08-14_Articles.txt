Your commitment to excellence has made the nation’s highways a safer place for everyone.” To clinch the prestigious title of 2016 Bendix Grand Champion, White’s driving skills and knowledge of transportation and truck safety surpassed the over 430 other professional truck drivers competing in Indianapolis this week. White, who also took home the 3-axle class title, lives in nearby Nineveh, Indiana and drives professionally for Walmart Transportation. ATA also recognized Richard Merich as the 2016 Rookie of the Year. Merich took home the honor after a strong performance in the flatbed division. The team of drivers from South Carolina produced the best collective score, with an average of 278.13, and were honored as the top state delegation. Professionalism and dedication to the trucking industry were key themes during the National Truck Driving Championships. Charles Woodland was honored during the awards banquet with the Neill Darmstadter Professional Excellence Award and Chris Ignowski, CDS was chosen as the Lifetime Volunteer Award recipient. ACT 1 served as a premier sponsor of the 2016 National Truck Driving Championships and National Step Van Driving Championships, which took place Aug. 10-13 at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis. Since 2011, Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems has been the sole sponsor of the Bendix National Truck Driving Championships Grand Champion. Collectively, this week’s competitors have accumulated more than 600 million safe-driving miles during their careers as professional truck drivers.

By Evan Clark on August 15, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Wal-Mart by 15 million shares. REX/Shutterstock The Oracle of Omaha seems to be leaning away from Bentonville and toward Cupertino. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold off 15 million shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the second quarter, cutting its stake by 27 percent to 40.2 million shares worth $2.94 billion, according to regulatory filings late Monday. Over the same three months ended June 30, Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple Inc., buying 5.4 million shares, bringing its stake in the iPhone maker to 15.2 million shares worth $1.46 billion. The quirky billionaire is famous for buying and holding onto companies based on a simple premise like Wal-Mart, which buys at scale and drives down prices to sell goods to lower-income consumers. Buffett started accumulating his investment in the discount giant in late 2005 and since the end of that year, the retailer’s stock has gained 56.7 percent (the issue dipped 0.4 percent on Monday). While it’s difficult to draw direct conclusions from the portfolio shifts at Berkshire, in part because Buffett has brought on board other managers to handle some of the investing, the move from a seller of general merchandise to a seller of ultrapopular smartphones would seem to indicate broader general trends, from the rise of mobile to the increasing competition retailers of all stripes from Amazon. Buffett has dipped in and out of the retail and fashion sectors over the years. The investment house holds a 315,400 shares of Procter & Gamble Co., worth about $26.7 million. The company’s also bought and sold stakes in companies such as Nike Inc. and Seritage Growth Properties Inc., a real estate spin-off from Sears Holdings Corp. arranged by Buffett-admirer Edward S. Lampert. Berkshire also bought underwear maker Fruit of the Loom out of bankruptcy in 2002 and continues to run the company. Buffett, who has backed Hillary Clinton for president, has generally been bullish on the economy. Late last year, he noted: “The interesting thing about the economy is you can give almost the same report ever since the fall of 2009. It really has been growing, is growing, at a couple percent a year, which is not bad. People have gotten more optimistic at times. They thought about a double-dip at times, then they thought it was accelerating.” You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 16 August 2016 | MYT 6:36 AM Warren Buffet buys more Apple shares; Soros, Icahn sell Billion Warren Buffett's Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. NEW YORK: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co  and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc, and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc. It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing You May Be Interested KLCI slides at midday, ringgit weaker Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Bumi Armada posts nearly RM97m net losses in Q3 Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Kaya Yurieff Aug 15, 2016 5:29 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart Stores (WMT) were declining in after-hours trading on Monday as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) reduced its stake in the retail giant. Berkshire's stake in the Bentonville, AR-based company dropped to 40.2 million shares during the second quarter from 55.2 million three months earlier, Bloomberg reports, citing a regulatory filing. Berkshire also lowered holdings of Deere (DE) and Suncor Energy (SU) during the second period. The Omaha-based company upped its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 55%. About 9.63 million of Walmart's shares changed hands today vs. its average volume of 6.8 million shares per day. Separately, TheStreet Ratings Team has a "Buy" rating with a score of B on the stock. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, increase in stock price during the past year and notable return on equity. The team believes its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat weak growth in earnings per share. Recently, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.

The retail giant coughed up a rumored $90 million after a company driver crashed into a limousine carrying Morgan and several passengers, one of whom was killed. The insurers, which are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, filed documents last week alleging that the chain overpaid in order to avoid bad publicity.   The comedian appeared at the Emmys in September 2015, just over a year after the horrific crash The documents, obtained  by Daily Mail Online, say that the 'exorbitant' settlements should not be covered by them, since there is 'no coverage to the extent which these settlements were paid to avoid adverse publicity'.  They also say that the amount paid out to Morgan and his co-passengers was excessive in comparison to Morgan's actual injuries. They allege that Walmart did not conduct adequate investigations into the 30 Rock star's health before settling.  'Within weeks of Wal-Mart settling with Morgan, Morgan was seen driving one of the most powerful sports cars in midtown Manhattan, driving without any difficulty and clearly showing he was enjoying himself,' the documents state. 'Wal-Mart would have learned that Morgan was capable of doing these things had it done an adequate and reasonable investigation before settling.' Scroll down for video   Morgan was spotted in New York at the wheel of his sports car in November. Insurers are saying Walmart overestimated the extent of his injuries Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the June 2014 accident before he could return home.  The suit that lists some of the work Morgan has been involved with in the past year. 'For example, since mid-June 2015, Morgan has appeared on national TV, presenting an Emmy Award; hosting Saturday Night Live; appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live; appearing on the Tonight Show; filming scenes for an upcoming Hollywood feature; agreeing to start a half-hour comedy pilot on a cable network; and embarking on a multi-date comedy tour in cities throughout the United States and Canada,' reads the suit. The crash took the life of his friend and fellow comic James McNair and injured three others. The 47-year-old 30 Rock star suffered a traumatic brain injury and numerous fractures when a tractor-trailer slammed into the back of his limo van on New Jersey Turnpike in June, 2014. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board said Kevin Roper was driving 65mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the van. The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55mph and was lowered to 45mph that night because of construction. Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. The insurers say that Walmart overpaid the comedian. The 2014 crash killed fellow comic James McNair The insurers claim that Walmart made it seem as though Morgan, 47, would never work again, and point out that this is not the case (Ed Helms, Amanda Seyfriend, Morgan and Leah Remini on the set of their new film in June) Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.' The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Insurers fight Walmart claiming they gave 'exorbitant'...

Published Aug 15th, 2016 3:00 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Despite a hit and miss retail environment, Wall Street analysts expect Wal-Mart Stores will have a decent quarter fueled in part by strong grocery sales. The consensus estimate is for net income to top $3.2 billion in the second quarter, just short of the $3.475 billion reported a year ago. Earnings per share are expected to be $1.02, compared to $1.08 in the year-ago period according to the consensus of 24 analysts who follow the company. Earnings per share are expected to be 5.5% lower than a year ago. Total revenue is expected to be $120.29 billion, flat against last year. Wal-Mart will report second quarter earnings ahead of the market opening on Thursday (Aug. 18). Wal-Mart executives are also expected to give additional financial guidance with this being the earnings report immediately following the recent $3.3 billion announced acquisition of Jet.com. Wal-Mart forecast lower earnings in fiscal 2017 through 2019 as it continued to invest in e-commerce infrastructure and wage growth among its 1.2 million employees. For the first half of Wal-Mart’s fiscal year, revenue is expected to total $236.194 billion, up fractionally from $235.055 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the first half of the fiscal year is expected at $6.279 billion, down 7% year-over-year in part because of the heavy investments in the retailer’s e-commerce division. Daniel Binder, an analyst with global banking giant Jefferies, expects Wal-Mart’s second quarter same-store sales to rise 1.5%, which is modestly ahead of the consensus 1%. Jefferies rates Wal-Mart a “buy” with a target price of $85. Binder believes the U.S. comp sales momentum that Wal-Mart had in the first quarter likely carried over to the second quarter. He also expects a small increase in consumer retail spending over the next few quarters thanks in part to increased wages among lower income consumers. “Our local retail store checks continued to show strong execution with consistency across the market,” Binder noted. Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said discount retailers like Wal-Mart and Dollar Tree are likely to benefit from a “macro backdrop supporting sustained momentum as spending prospects of the ‘low-end’ customer base improves … supported by higher spending power from lower gas prices and strong employment gains.” Raymond James & Associates is also bullish on Wal-Mart’s second quarter results expecting $1.05 per share. They say comp sales will rise 1.1% for U.S. stores, a hair better than the retailer’s 1% forecast. Sam’s Club is expected to report flat comp sales in the quarter, according to Budd Bugatch, the retail analyst with Raymond James. “Last quarter, food deflation adversely impacted Walmart U.S. comps by 60 basis points (.60) We believe food deflation will once again adversely impact comps this quarter. Within our basket we continue to see deflationary pressure in the meat and dairy categories,” Bugatch noted. “Management remains laser focused on boosting growth in e-commerce and the announced Jet.com acquisition underscores this. While in the long term we believe the Jet.com acquisition will allow Walmart to create a more streamlined and robust e-commerce platform, in the near term we believe there will be little impact to the top line with the potential of increased operating costs in the P&L.” Analysts with L&F Capital Management in San Diego, Calif., noted that Walmart’s grocery business, some 55% of the retailer’s total U.S. sales, put up good numbers in the recent quarter, helped by a slowdown in quick-serve restaurants. The L&F Capital analysts believe Wal-Mart will be a beneficiary of the restaurant slowdown in the recent quarter. McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Noodle’s, Sonic and Burger King all reported decelerating comp sales in this recent quarter. “Last quarter, Wal-Mart put an emphasis on expanding its U.S grocery business. Management said the Grocery Pickup service would be available in 40 markets by the end of May (versus 22 at the start of the year) and that expansion only continued throughout the quarter, the analysts noted. “Concurrently, there was a massive slowdown in the QSR space this past quarter. The short of it is that QSR prices are inflating while grocery prices are deflating, and this discrepancy is causing consumers to choose dining-in over eating out.” The nationwide rollout of Walmart Pay also took place in the recent quarter and management said transactions through the mobile payment alternative increased 45% in the last week of June and monthly active users jumped to more than 20 million. “We believe the convenience of Walmart Pay, along with additional perks such as the Savings Catcher, helped drive strong traffic through Walmart’s brick-and-mortar locations throughout the quarter,” L&F Capital Markets noted. Despite food demand, low prices and convenience offerings by Wal-Mart, analysts agree there are still some wildcards with respect to the company’s financial performance in the coming quarters. Deep discounters like Aldi and Lidl continued to expand their reach in the United States. There are continued challenges in the United Kingdom with ASDA, which has completely restructured management and operational game plans in part because of Aldi and Lidl. Wal-Mart continues to go toe-to-toe with Visa over card acceptance, actually dropping the option in three stores in Canada. Analysts say if Walmart continues to break ties with Visa there could be some customer backlash. The retail giant also will see hefty adjustments to income from the lopsided foreign exchange rates amid the higher value of the U.S. dollar with respect to its global operations. Lastly, there is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation that continues to loom over the retail giant costing between $100 million and $120 million this year, for a total of $848 million since 2013. Investors have seen the Wal-Mart share price rise 19.3% this year. Wal-Mart shares (NYSE: WMT) were trading at $73.32 in Monday’s (Aug. 15) afternoon session. Shares were down 57 cents on the day, but Wall Street has a target price of $84 for the retailer in the coming year.

Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple by 55 percent to 15.2 million shares, according to a regulatory filing Monday from the billionaire’s Omaha, Nebraska-based firm. The investment was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30. “Apple’s stock came down substantially in the second quarter,” David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett, said in a phone interview. “Value investors always like the price to go down because it gives them an opportunity to buy more.” QuickTake Apple Apple shares fell shortly after Berkshire took its initial stake, sliding 12 percent in the second quarter. Sales of iPhones have fallen this year as customers upgrade their handsets at a slower pace. That, paired with mounting competition in China, means that the company’s revenue is expected to decline this fiscal year for the first time since 2001.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter Yet with Apple gearing up to introduce a new iPhone this year, the trough of its product cycle may also have presented an opportunity for investors to boost their stakes. The share price averaged less than $100 during the quarter and has rallied 13 percent since July 26, when Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook forecast a sales decline for the fourth fiscal quarter that was less severe than many analysts had expected. Berkshire’s bet stands in contrast to those of other prominent investors. In April, billionaire Carl Icahn said he exited a position in the company because of concern about its relationship with China. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management disclosed in May that it sold its Apple stake in the first quarter. Buffett has previously said that smaller investments, including the Apple stake, were initiated by his deputy money managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Even as Berkshire’s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they’ve become less important to its overall performance. During the past two decades, the billionaire has focused more on acquisitions than stocks to generate growth. Wal-Mart Stores Berkshire also trimmed a number of its holdings in the quarter. Its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- one of Buffett’s picks -- fell to 40.2 million shares from 55.2 million. The retailer rallied 6.6 percent in the second quarter to $73.02 a share. Buffett’s company also cut holdings of Deere & Co. and Suncor Energy Inc. in the three months ended June 30, according to Monday’s filing. “It’s a little bit of fine tuning,” said University of Maryland’s Kass. Buffett and his deputies “do not make many changes to their portfolio.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Police said the father arrived for his shift at a Walmart supermarket at 6.15am on Friday and left his car in the car park outside as temperatures topped 38C (100F). 1 Baby Dillon Martinez died after being left in a hot car outside the Walmart store in Helotes, Texas When he finished work at 3.09pm he was “distraught” to see his son in the back of the vehicle in Helotes, near San Antonio, Texas. The temperature inside the SUV would have climbed to 60C (140F). An ambulance crew rushed to the scene but the tragic infant, identified by authorities as Dillon Martinez, could not be revived. The father, who was not named, told police was meant to leave Dillon with childminders on the way to work but forgot and did not notice he was in the back when he arrived at the store.

Monkey reported loose in Wal-Mart parking lot <!--iframe--> Staff report 6:03 p.m. EDT August 15, 2016 A woman took a video of the monkey she saw in a Walmart parking lot Sunday (Photo: Provided) 1189 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE LANCASTER - A monkey got several minutes of freedom before being retrieved and returned to an RV trailer Sunday night in Lancaster, officials reported. Police call logs indicate the monkey escaped around 7:50 p.m. Sunday from a camper parked in the lot at Wal-Mart, 2687 North Memorial Drive. A woman is said to have opened the camper door when the monkey got free. A video posted online shows the monkey near a Wal-Mart associate. Police did not file an incident report after the monkey reportedly climbed on a Wal-Mart employee. Both police and employees confirmed the associate was not injured and did not require medical attention after the encounter. The caller advised that the monkey was larger than her 2-year-old. Richelle Stewart had just moved to Lancaster and went to Wal-Mart for some paint. She said she saw the monkey running around the parking lot and captured a video. Stewart said she doesn't think the employee was bitten, although she did hear the woman running after the monkey telling the employee not to go near it. Stewart said she's glad no one got hurt and that she posted the video because she thought it was amusing. The monkey was later retrieved and returned to the trailer, according to police. No criminal charges were filed against the owners of the monkey. 1189 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2bjItO0 TOP VIDEOS LHS planetarium celebrates golden anniversary 2:50 Why body cameras fail 0:55 Chipotle opens country's first Tasty Made restaurant in Lancaster 0:22 Man finds, rebuilds car he built in 1963, sold in 1974 2:08 Police video shows response to 'armed' man 1:37 Gears and stones being installed at Rock Mill 0:51 Body found in cornfield near Pleasantville 0:46 Making apple cider the old fashioned way, sorta 1:18 Mount Pleasant rescue training 0:44 Old grandstand demolished after fire 0:42 Fire destroys historic grandstand 0:48 Local farm harvests freshwater prawns 1:00 Inspectors check for card skimmers at gas stations 1:39 Local prawn farm prepares for harvest 1:24 Couple talks about how grief counseling helped their families 3:01 Girl donates birthday presents to dog shelter 1:37 Horse paints way into woman's heart 3:15 Where are the sidewalks on Sheridan Drive? 0:51 Man shot by deputy during domestic dispute 1:13 Pickerington Post 283 battles back to win state title 1:33 Pickerington Post 283 ignites vs Sidney 1:29 Aerial training for OUL's Wizard of Oz 0:23 Lancaster Ghostbuster 1:11 Prosecutor details Bridget Kuhn's crimes 4:21 Special prosecutor speaks after mayor's wife sentenced to prison 3:30 Lancaster native, marine earns promotion 1:39 Lancaster Police SRT Training 1:05 Scenes from Lancaster Soap Box Derby 0:40 RAW VIDEO: Attorneys speak after mayor's felony arraignment 6:40 RAW VIDEO: Lancaster Mayor Brian Kuhn arraigned on felony charges 3:55 Utica Legion breaks loose vs. Lancaster 1:41 Camp Invention 1:00 Bridget Kuhn pleads guilty to 11 felonies 4:14 Tarhe Trails principal bikes into pond 1:09 Buckeye Lake dam stop log installation 2:25 Berne Union vs. Ridgedale district highlights 1:18 Berne Union softball advances to district final 0:59 Pitching, defense highlight Watkins, Lancaster classic 2:09 Students raise money for classmate, cut teachers' hair 1:58 Wagnalls Memorial Library to revamp gardens 1:31 Collapse kills contractor at Anchor Hocking 3:55 Local church continues sweet Easter tradition 0:57 New digital poll books ready for Tuesday's election 1:17 Local company dedicated to keeping old clocks on time 2:46 Teachers hope interactive lessons helps prep students for tests and future 3:02 Special prosecutor speaks after court hearing for mayor's wife 5:33 Dexter reflects on Fairfield Christian's fantastic season 1:11 Lancaster's Deluse secures semifinal victory 0:31 Conley leads Fairfield Christian vs NC 0:33 Couple celebrates 70th anniversary with White Castle, the place they first met 0:10 Pleasant vs. Amanda-Clearcreek highlights 2:05 RAW VIDEO: Law enforcement leaders endorse Witt for prosecutor 50:26 Making pizza at Diamond Jim's 1:11 Lancaster starts fast vs Newark 0:44 Fairfield Christian makes late charge 0:55 Amanda-Clearcreek highlights 0:46 More than 50 dogs seized from Rushville home 2:48 Aerobics is good exercise, even if you can't dance 0:49 Investigator and special prosecutor speak after mayor's wife arraigned 4:03 Family survives house fire, picks through rubble 1:43 Highlights from the Bridget Kuhn press conference 9:57 RAW VIDEO: Bridget Kuhn press conference 27:47 Millersport boys basketball highlights vs Heath 0:35 Fatal Fire 0:55 Berne Union boys basketball highlights vs Lakewood 0:41 Reporter collects trash 1:19 Dog killed after attacking police officer 1:38 Confidence high in quick dam construction timetable 1:25 Reporter takes on line dancing 1:15 Local man creates 'Back to the Future' railroad set 1:55 World's top Halloween destinations will freak you out! 1:49 World's top Halloween destinations will freak you out! 1:49 Calf born at fair draws crowds 0:56 Fairfield County Fair Beef Cook Off 1:19 Budweiser Clydesdales entertain crowds 0:35 Students program robots to travel Twister board 0:29 Students cleanup graffiti, create art 0:40 Students cleanup graffiti, create art 0:40 Mudhouse Mansion 2:24 PAL teaches boxing to community 1:02 Raw video of man being shocked in Fairfield County Courthouse 4:52 Young Professionals of Lancaster 1:52 Bloom-Carroll defeats Bexley 0:38 Bloom-Carroll defeats John Glenn 0:47 Ex-girlfriend of man arrested on federal child porn charges speaks 1:45 Fairfield Union football scrimmage highlights 0:50 Hilltop Haven Community opens in Clearcreek Twp. 1:32 Local WWII pilot talks about flying over "the Hump" 3:00 Rising Park Day 0:49 Agent 99 0:31 Shane Ronan 2:19 Lancaster Post 11 Juniors highlights 0:57 Wrestling Preview 1:39 Man calls 911 call from basement of burning house 4:02 Fire survivors react to being trapped in blaze 1:19 Derby Downs Races 1:48 First same sex couple to get marriage license in county reacts 0:56 Summer Science Fun 0:41 Pickerington Post 283 vs Lancaster Post 11 highlights 0:57 Who's a better grocery shopper men or women?

Two Reasons Target Is Having Trouble Selling Groceries Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Two Reasons Target Is Having Trouble Selling Groceries Image courtesy of Steve August 15, 2016 12:20 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave it's pronounced groce-ray target supermarkets walmart Following the crash of the housing market nearly ten years ago, some big box stores that had previously only dabbled in groceries started to give over more floor space to fresh and frozen foods. Walmart shoppers took to the idea of buying their food in the same store they purchase their TV, cleaning supplies, underwear, sporting goods, and just about anything else. Across the parking lot at Target, things aren’t as rosy. Target sells around $18.5 billion in groceries a year, which may sound huge until you realize that it’s only around one-fifth of the company’s total annual revenue. Meanwhile, more than half of Walmart’s yearly revenue comes from groceries. The Wall Street Journal recently took a look at Target’s fresh food woes and its efforts to course correct. Here are just a couple of the important takeaways: 1. Shoppers Just Don’t Visit That Frequently While Target has many regular shoppers, they may not be regular enough to keep fresh meat and vegetables from spoiling. One Target customer explains to the Journal that she shops at the store once or twice a month to purchase things like cleaning supplies and home décor, and she may pick up an odd food item here or there, but adds that “I don’t go out of my way to do grocery shopping at Target because there are so many other specialty stores.” Data from Nielsen shows that shoppers favor traditional groceries over big box retailers regardless of whether they are buying a week’s worth of groceries or just doing some quick shopping to fill in the gaps. Meanwhile, it appears that Costco and other wholesale clubs are increasingly becoming a destination for shoppers looking to stock up their pantry, fridge, and freezer with food. In 2015, Target’s chief operating officer acknowledged this outsider status: “We’re not really special and we’re not a full grocery. And so we’re sitting in the middle of no man’s land.” 2. Unwillingness To Invest Target actually got into the grocery business more than 20 years ago when it opened its first SuperTarget. However, these mega-format stores with complete supermarkets only account for a fraction of all Target locations. In fact, Target is increasingly looking toward smaller-footprint stores, where you can’t have rows up rows of groceries to choose from. According to the Journal, previous disappointments in groceries have left the Target board of directors gun-shy about investing capital to improve this aspect of the business. Which is problematic because Target’s supply chain has long been set up to handle transportation and distribution of home goods and non-perishable food items. If the company wants to better control the supply chain for fresh food, it will likely need to either go the route of Walmart and invest more money into systemic improvements, or pay more to a third-party provider.

By Josh Kolm August 15, 2016 This year’s back-to-school season has Walmart Canada telling Canadians it can be there for whatever customers need this time of the year – even if it seems like that’s always changing. A new spot for the retailer’s back-to-school campaign, created by J. Walter Thompson Canada, shows a kid, seemingly as prepared as possible to head back to school. But in the time it takes his mom to set up a photo, he seems to age in a blink of an eye. Jennifer Holgate, VP of marketing communications at Walmart Canada, says while last year’s back-to-school campaign focused on how moms know the exact products their kids need, this year’s added in a new insight: that, despite having that knowledge, those needs are changing very quickly. “Mom really feels like their kids are growing up fast,” Holgate says. “A parent feels like part of their role is being able to continuously equip your kids, but you might not realize how much they’ve grown when the end of the summer rolls around. We’re showing that we can be there to help make sure they’re set up to start the new school year right.” The spot is one element of a full omnichannel program for the back-to-school season, which also includes radio, social posts, influencer engagement and in-store signage, with online materials – including its own e-commerce portal – highly targeted at the back-to-school shopper. St. Joseph Communication supported the omnichannel execution, with additional support on the campaign coming from Apex PR, Ruckus Digital and Mindshare on media. Walmart says that value continues to be a major choice driver when it comes to the retailers Canadians choose for their back-to-school shopping, something it capitalized on last year when it’s messaging celebrated “smart shoppers” who were looking for ways to save money and live better, the retailer’s long-standing brand promise. Portions of this year’s campaign also target “back-to-campus” consumers, with online how-to videos – dubbed “Answers to inevitable student questions” – that show lifehack-style solutions to things like cooking cheap meals, folding laundry and fixing devices. Walmart included elements targeted at post-secondary students last year as well, though Holgate says the way it approaches that demo needs to evolve every year as media consumption habits change. While the rest of its back-to-school program primarily target moms, speaking to post-secondary students directly and giving them added value as well is important as they tend to have far more input in back-to-school purchase decisions, if they aren’t doing the shopping themselves. “They’re fun and cute, but also short and poignant and gets our products into a solution that, like anything we do in omnichannel, play well across mobile and desktop and social,” Holgate says. “They also provide utility and extra value to the students. It’s not just about what we sell, it’s about being top of mind by helping them in other ways, like smart, value-driven solutions, as they begin this new journey in life.” Tags: Apex, Apex PR, J Walter Thompson Canada, Jennifer Holgate, JWT, JWT Canada, Mindshare, Ruckus, Ruckus Digital, St. Joseph Communication, Walmart, walmart canada Related Articles Heart & Stroke’s big change Salvation Army’s story behind the holiday card Tim Hortons takes good deeds national Campbell’s brings the Cantina to Montreal Illuminating Audi’s latest advancements Popular Recent Featured Tribal adds to its creative and digital leadership Cossette is the best at CMA Awards Lg2, Leo Burnett take top prizes at ADCC awards Sgsco acquires 5Crowd Why Ikea is playing up its downstairs Careers » Screening Room » Illuminating Audi’s latest advancements SickKids gives it 100% for 100 donors Check it out: CAA calms a temper tantrum Ecobee’s extreme debut Twitter Tweets about "from:StrategyOnline OR @StrategyOnline OR strategyonline.ca" Follow @StrategyOnline Facebook About Strategy strategy™ uncovers and shares the "bold vision, brand new ideas" of Canada’s national marketing community.

About 11:40 p.m., police responded to a call of mace being sprayed at a Wal-Mart at 1300 Desplaines Ave., according to Forest Park police Deputy Chief Mike Keating. A female customer put her keys down while shopping in the sports department and forgot to pick them up, Keating said. When she went back to retrieve the keys, she noticed her pepper spray on her key chain was missing. The mace was soon after sprayed in the store, Keating said. “Somebody sprayed pepper spray throughout the whole building,” an employee told reporters at the scene. “Everybody was coughing…it was dramatic.” Four to five people were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately available, Keating said. Other victims were treated at the scene.

  Subscribe! | Login | Search The Changing Nature of Retail Recent moves by Walmart and Macy’s illustrate the challenges all retailers face. By Mark Roberti Tags: Apparel, Inventory / Warehouse Management, IT/Infrastructure, Retail, RFID Channel, Supply Chain PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Aug 15, 2016— Last week, Macy’s announced it was closing 100 stores, and Walmart announced it was paying $3.3 billion for Jet.com, a one-year-old e-commerce retailer that tried to take on Amazon directly. Both moves show that conventional brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to attract shoppers to stores. But the two retailers are pursuing different solutions to the same problem. Macy’s is one of the first companies to attempt to become a true omnichannel retailer. It is using radio frequency identification technology to improve store inventory to the point at which it has confidence to enable you to buy products online (even from your phone while in the store), and then pick up those products in one of its stores, or have them shipped from the store to your home. This transition, of course, takes some time—not just for Macy’s to execute but for customers to embrace. Let me explain what I mean. In the early years of the Internet, many people were afraid to put their credit card number into a website to buy things. Over time, people got used to doing that, and now very few people think twice about it (even with the database breaches that have occurred). Similarly, customers are not comfortable with, or don’t believe in, omnichannel retailing. This past weekend, it was brutally hot and humid in New York, where I live. My home does not have central air conditioning, so I wanted to buy another room air conditioner. I went to the Lowes website because I have no faith that Home Depot will have the stuff it thinks it has (see Is This What Passes for Retailing?). I found an air conditioner that was right for the room size, and the Lowes website said the item was available for me to buy it online and pick it up in the store. I thought about this for a second and then decided not to buy it online. Here’s what went through my mind. I’ll buy it online and I’ll get to the store and look around for someone who can tell me where my item is. It will take 10 minutes to find the right person, who will then take another 20 minutes to try to locate my purchase, and then come back and tell me that the store doesn't have my item. It will take another 10 minutes to refund my purchase and buy a new air conditioner. So instead, I just drove to the store with the intention of buying that air conditioner. My local Lowes had a number of models but not the one I had picked out online. I wound up buying a different model. It’s possible, of course, that Lowes had the model I wanted somewhere (I didn’t bother to ask because that would have involved a 20-minute search), but I, as a shopper, have no faith in store inventory systems, and I believe most other shoppers are the same. And this is the big problem retailers face. People know if they order an item through an online retailer, they will get that item every time (I recently bought a dehumidifier from Amazon and would have purchased the air conditioner from Amazon, except it was so hot I needed it right away). Walmart, in buying Jet.com, is trying to win customers by having a dual-channel strategy. Some people will shop at stores, and the retail giant hopes to win younger shoppers by offering them an alternative to Amazon. Macy’s, on the other hand, is using RFID to build trust among its shoppers so that they will believe that the retailer does indeed have the merchandise they ordered online. It takes time to change perceptions. Eventually, when all retailers are using RFID (and that day is not as far off as many think), shoppers will have as much faith in store inventory as they do in e-commerce inventory.

'If you don't do that, you grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.'   Photograph By Vancouver Sun Previous Next 'I check every little store, what thery have for me and for what price,' New Westminster pensioner Vera Bottarel says of her approach. 'If you don't do that, you grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.' Vera Bottarel takes her bargain hunting seriously. To make sure she’s getting the best deal on her groceries for her and her husband, the New Westminster pensioner puts on her sturdy walking shoes and makes a day of it. “I go around and I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,” she says. “If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.” Bottarel’s weekly shopping trips got easier recently with the opening of a Walmart Supercentre, which sells groceries as well as general merchandise, at Royal City Centre, right above the Save On Foods. It’s this choice, and the proximity of retail grocery options, that has Bottarel and thousands of other Metro Vancouver consumers blessed with a bounty of outlets. “I check the meat upstairs (at Walmart) and I’m going to check it in there (Save On Foods) and then I check the Buy-Low. I check everything and then I go back and check the better price and I buy it,” says Bottarel, who also periodically looks in at Galloway’s, a specialty independent store across the street, Kin’s Farm Market in the mall and the Safeway several blocks away. “When I get tired, I sit down someplace and then I start again.” Save On may be her favourite, but Bottarel is grateful for Walmart when she’s on the hunt for the best price. 'Walmart effect' That an increasing share of the grocery market going to non-traditional retailers like Walmart Supercentres and Costco Wholesale is causing deflation in food prices after they spiked above inflation in 2014 and 2015. It’s particularly evident in B.C. and Quebec. Still, our smaller grocery bills may be a case of short-term gain but long-term pain if the industry further consolidates to increase margins, leaving consumers with fewer choices and eventually higher prices. Some analysts say Canadians should get ready for a grocery price war, thanks to oversaturation in the market, with the traditional stores beefing up their discount brands to head off the non-traditional discounters. Sylvain Charlebois calls it the “Walmart effect,” and says it’s most pronounced in B.C. and in Quebec. “Quebec and B.C. are where prices are dropping the most and that’s where Walmart and Costco have become more aggressive,” says the professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Food prices dropped in the Consumer Price Index in B.C. by 0.5 per cent from May to June this year, according to Statistics Canada. The overall inflation rate for consumer goods in B.C. in June was 1.5 per cent. Most significantly, the price of beef in Canada dropped 3.3 per cent in June over June 2015, the first year-over-year decrease since August 2010, and dairy products were 2.1 per cent less in the same period. In contrast, consumers were paying hikes of four to five per cent in grocery prices in 2014 and 2015, which outpaced inflation, says Charlebois. At the time Walmart was expanding and adding fresh products to its stores to compete against Target stores, a threat that never materialized when the U.S. chain pulled out of Canada. That left Walmart in a better position to compete against the traditional stores, says Charlebois. “To Loblaw, Walmart is clearly a threat,” he says. Eight of the 13 stores Walmart bought from Target last year were in B.C. and Quebec, and “Costco has opened quite a few new outlets,” he adds. Loblaw Cos. Ltd. this summer sent a letter to its suppliers, requesting they drop their prices by 1.45 per cent in their shipments beginning in September. And United Grocers, the buying group for a number of Loblaw’s competitors (including Overwaitea Food Group and the food division of London Drugs), sent a letter to the same suppliers, insisting the same price cut, if any, that they grant to Loblaw. “We should expect to be treated competitively,” says United Grocers president Denis Gendron. If the suppliers give cuts to Loblaw, he says, they would expect the same because “our goal is to give our customers the best prices available.” Suppliers have told Gendron the issue is “under review.” But, he adds, “we’re not expecting the suppliers to come to us and say we’ve decided to reduce our prices.” The industry is feeling the pressure from Walmart Supercentres and from Costco, says Gendron, but that’s not new. “And if it weren’t them, it would be someone else.” 'More stores than necessary' Food retailing is big business and players want as much of the pie as they can get. The average B.C. household spends about $8,200 a year, or almost $700 a month, on food, according to Statistics Canada. About $5,700 is food purchased from stores, and almost $2,500 from restaurants. Walmart and Costco are having a growing impact on the industry, once comfortably held by traditional grocers. In 2015, the traditional grocery retailers’ share of the Canadian food market had dropped to 78 per cent, down from 84 per cent five years earlier. And between 2004 and 2015, food sales at general merchandisers grew at a rate of almost 12 per cent a year, according to StatsCan, while the grocery stores grew at three per cent a year. Moreover, drug stores’ sales of food jumped in the first quarter of 2106, up 14 per cent over the same quarter last year. London Drugs (owned by the same family that owns IGA) and Shoppers Drug Mart (bought last year by Loblaw) sell food, including limited dairy, which adds to the competition. Walmart Canada has captured seven per cent of the food retail market and Costco has 10 per cent. Rob Gerlsbeck, editor of Canadian Grocer, says the expansion into groceries in 2014 and 2015 by Walmart, Costco and Target resulted in “more stores than was necessary for the population growth.” He says that oversaturation will likely continue to keep pressure on prices because the grocery square footage was growing at three to four per cent while Canada’s population grows at one per cent a year. “I don’t want to call it a price war, but you’ll see the stores try to convince shoppers to spend money at their stores over other stores for their weekly groceries,” he says. “Walmart’s operating procedures has been low prices — that’s what they hammer and they’re very good at it.” Such an approach has recent roots, he adds. Since the 2008 economic crash “consumers have been shopping more at discount stores and they have continued to be more price conscious.” 'Relentless pressure'   The parent companies have responded by opening up more discount brands, Loblaw is expanding No Frills while Sobey’s has plans to convert remaining Price Choppers into FreshCo. discount outlets. “The choices we have as Canadians is incredible,” says food industry analyst Kevin Grier, who publishes the Grocery Trade Review. “We have lots of competition and huge choice and low-cost food because our grocers are good at what they do.” If Walmart’s approach proves successful, he says, “it’s because Canadians have chosen out of their own self-interest where they want to shop.” Like shopper Rebecca Kapsalis, who says recently outside New Westminster’s Walmart Supercentre: “I prefer Walmart because Walmart has the big savings. You get better quality food at a reasonable price, and I love Walmart. I am so happy that we finally got it here.” That’s not a unanimous sentiment. New Westminster resident Scott Pillsbury points out: “I’m not happy to see Walmart moving in, but if it lowers prices, it’s a good thing. “It’s better to support local products, so I would pay a price for that. I’m not saying I would pay any price for that, but I would pay a little bit more to support something local.” David Ian Gray, of Vancouver’s DIG360 Consulting, says demanding lower prices from suppliers isn’t new — “Walmart is known for grinding suppliers” — and he and others say only time will tell if it’s successful. Price wars in the short run are good for consumers, he says, “but in the long run it’s hard to maintain quality and choice in the face of this relentless pressure. The pressure could really squeeze those without scale,” which is why smaller chains like Choices Market need to differentiate with organics and specialty items. “Consumers do want to have some choice,” says Gray. “Over time you start seeing the big guys getting bigger and it starts to be a harder game to play.” B.C.’s grocery shelf: Who owns what • Overwaitea Food Group is Canada’s largest western-based food store chain.

(Captured News) WLS Monday, August 15, 2016 FOREST PARK, Ill. (WLS) -- Wal-Mart customers and workers in west suburban Forest Park were injured after someone attacked them with pepper spray in the store. A person reportedly had a container of the spray attached to a key ring. She set it down and said someone took the spray and started using it on people. The staff and customers were told to leave the building in the 1300-block of Des Plaines Avenue. "People were coughing, a few people got it pretty bad, an ambulance maybe took four or five employees and a few customers," said Wal-Mart employee Chryesse Johnson. "They evacuated the store and they have people in custody but they are not sure they're not sure they have to check the tapes and find out if they were them or not."

Macy’s will close 100 stores, Wal-Mart’s buying Jet.com, and Amazon’s pushing delivery by drone.  We’ll look at where American retailing is headed. In this Nov. 21, 2013, file photo, with the Empire State building in the background, the Macy's logo is illuminated on the front of the department store in New York. (Mark Lennihan, File/AP) It’s a confusing, challenging time for the retail sector. Macy’s is closing 100 stores. Wal-Mart is struggling to grow its online sales. Many traditional malls are dying. Yet TJ Maxx and Marshalls are thriving. So are Home Depot and Lowe’s. And Amazon continues to dominate the online shopping world. What’s a store to do in an era when lots of people shun malls and prefer to shop with an iPad while lounging on the couch? This hour On Point, the changing ways Americans shop, the continuing battle between brick-and-mortar versus online, and how the retail sector is trying to innovate to keep up. — Sacha Pfeiffer  Guests Sarah Halzack, national retail reporter for the Washington Post. (@sarahhalzack) Mark Cohen, director of retail sales at Columbia Business School at Columbia University. Former chairman and CEO of Sears Canada, Bradlees and Lazarus Department Stores. From The Reading List Washington Post: Macy’s to close 100 stores -- "Department store giant Macy’s said Thursday it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, executives say, has too many stores for the online shopping era." The Wall Street Journal: Wal-Mart Deal Could Jeopardize Jet.com’s Sales-Tax Advantage -- "Jet.com Inc. pitches itself as a lower-priced alternative to Amazon.com Inc., partly by not tacking on sales taxes in most states. But tax experts say Jet’s proposed $3.3 billion sale to retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. could jeopardize that price advantage by forcing it to collect taxes nationwide." Bloomberg Business: U.S. Retail Sales Stall as Auto Dealers’ Gain Is Others’ Pain — "Sales at U.S. retailers were little changed in July as Americans flocked to auto dealers at the expense of other merchants. The stalling of purchases followed a 0.8 percent gain in June that was stronger than initially estimated, Commerce Department figures showed Friday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.4 percent rise in July.

Not any longer. Amazon is the new giant that’s making business models obsolete, and Wal-Mart is among the competitors scrambling to keep up. Instead of superstores and smiley faces, retailing’s new disruptive forces are shop-from-home convenience, ruthless efficiency and $99-a-year video subscriptions. If we needed evidence of the pain Amazon is causing in Bentonville, Ark., we got it Monday when Wal-Mart agreed to pay $3.3 billion for e-commerce startupJet.com. That’s a big price for a company that’s barely a year and a half old and, by its own admission, is at least four years from being profitable. Wal-Mart, hoping to get a boost from Jet’s young customer base and innovative technology, will put Jet founder Marc Lore in charge of all online efforts. Jet’s software, which adjusts prices based on shipping costs, may be its best asset. You get a discount if you live close to where an item is being shipped from, and if you combine items that can easily be shipped in one box. It’s a clever way to reward the most profitable customers, and it has the potential to turn the retailer’s 3,500 supercenters into fulfillment locations. Whether that’s the right strategy is another question. “The biggest problem for the supercenters is driving more traffic,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re way too big to just turn them into distribution centers.” Yarbrough has a hard time seeing how Wal-Mart can earn much of a return on its $3.3 billion investment. Wal-Mart had $14 billion of online sales last year, about 3 percent of its total, and Jet will add less than $1 billion initially. “The business is not profitable now, and even if you get to profitability you are going to earn lower returns than the overall retail business,” Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, about half the industrywide rate and a quarter of Amazon’s 28-percent growth. Catching up will require more than a nifty pricing algorithm; Amazon locks in customers by offering free shipping once they’ve paid $99 to watch shows such as “Boardwalk Empire.” “Wal-Mart is in a tough position,” Yarbrough say. “They don’t really have anything to distinguish themselves online.” Maybe an entrepreneurial leader can change that, but $3.3 billion is an expensive “acqui-hire.” Lore stayed with Amazon for two years after it bought his diaper-selling startup, Quidsi, in 2012. “I don’t know if this guy is going to want to do this,” says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates in New York. “When you have billions in your pocket, you may not want to work for a salary.” Besides, Davidowitz points out, Wal-Mart has made 15 previous e-commerce acquisitions. “They’ve spent more than anyone else and they have the worst results,” he said. “No matter what algorithm they have, this stuff is hard to scale. To believe a midget like Jet is going to compete against Amazon is almost hysterical.” Think back a couple of decades to how Wal-Mart brought Sears, Kmart and hundreds of neighborhood stores to their knees. “Wal-Mart used to be the 800-pound gorilla, and everybody reacted to what Wal-Mart did,” Yarbrough says. “Now the tables are turned and Wal-Mart reacts to what Amazon does.” Wal-Mart may have more money to throw at problems than its old-line competitors did, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any more successful at staving off disruption.

This February, after a two-year stint at Wal-Mart Stores in the US, Mediratta returned to India as the managing director and chief executive officer of Metro Cash and Carry India Pvt. Ltd, the local arm of German wholesaler Metro AG, a rival of Wal-Mart. After six months at the helm, Mediratta sat down with the German parent to finalise a five-year strategic plan for India—one of the most important markets for Metro. Arvind Mediratta, 49Mediratta has a B.Tech from IIT Delhi and is an alumnus of IIM Kolkata. He was corporate vice-president (merchandising) at Wal-Mart USA before joining Metro Cash and Carry. He has also worked as chief marketing officer for South Asia at Yum! Foods and at Whirlpool India Ltd. In an interview, Mediratta speaks about how the company is trying to ensure profitable growth so that India can emerge as the largest revenue generator for the German company. Edited excerpts: In March 2015, Metro announced its plan to invest Rs.400 crore to turn India into a focus market and open 50 stores by 2020. What does the new strategic plan entail? There’s a new strategic plan for the next five years for the Indian market. It’s confidential and I will not be able to divulge details. The numbers do not change. We’ll have to deliver the numbers. The revised plan, in a nutshell, is about focusing on maximizing value—how can we get more share of the traders’ wallet, how can we get them more often at our stores. We need to cover more traders with our sales force. It’s about how much more we can get from each store and each customer by enhancing value. We have to open new stores, and get more out of the existing stores. We are standardizing our stores. We have made some changes in our expansion model to make it more viable by making it more cost efficient. The approach for expansion would be cluster based as it is easier to develop and manage the supply chain in a cluster. We may also look at smaller real estate for future stores as one of the options. There will be more focus on people and individual performance. Overall, we need to ensure profitable growth that is sustainable. We’ll be investing in people, stores and technology to ensure our market leadership. Will there be a change in the top level at Metro Cash and Carry India? We are looking at strengthening the team. We’ll get more people on board, essentially at the top level. We’ll have the best talents in the industry in our team. Some of this is likely to happen by end of the year. This business is all about the right people in the right jobs. However, accountability is going to be key. Metro Cash and Carry entered India in 2003, and it had a net loss of Rs.110.72 crore in the fiscal year ended March 2015. Is there a fresh mandate for you to grow faster? Of course. India is one of our priority markets. Priority means growth market. We are right now growing at a very rapid and healthy rate. I can’t share the numbers. We are one of the fastest growing companies. Our base is quite big in terms of revenue. We are going to more than double our business in the next 3-4 years on a big base. Metro has always been very bullish on India. There was never any doubt about the potential that India has. Now we feel it is time to take off. Unlike the initial years, we are now opening stores faster, almost one every two months. Over a period, I think, India can emerge as the largest market for Metro. So, will you open more than 50 stores by 2020? Yes, if we can open more than 50, we will. If we can do 50 by 2019, we’ll do it and we’ll open more stores but as I said earlier, we are not for reckless expansion. We are for profitable expansion. We are talking about thoughtful expansion and it’s going to be aggressive because each store requires Rs.50-60 crore of investment. We want that every store we open is successful. So, we spend a lot of time understanding the trade area. Only then do we enter a city. How many more stores do you think you can open ensuring profitability? Our thumb rule is that we can have one store for every 10 lakh population. At the moment, we are focused on 6-7 big states. The opportunity in existing states is huge, and our expansion is cluster driven. Supply chain is easy to build and manage. We need to saturate a cluster before we open a new one. However, we are also entering new markets. There’s no rocket science in retail or wholesale. What you need is a lot of common sense. Also, we are piloting an online service in Jaipur. In this, traders can order online and get products delivered, typically in 24 hours. The response is good. Over a period, this will contribute significantly to our wallet. Through this, we can actually reach people who may not be within the immediate time zones. So, if you are in one part of the city due to real estate challenges, right now only people near that store—10-15km—can buy. But, once you have people going out and taking orders, delivering and collecting payment, I can expand my catchment to 30-40km. With this, our coverage will intensify. We will also put more sales people on the ground.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Upcoming earnings highlights include the latest results from two leading big-box retailers. Wall Street analysts are looking for earnings declines from both of them. However, one of them is forecast to report a marginal gain on the top line. The retail earnings parade kicked off last week with mixed results from some prominent department store operators offering something for the bulls as well as the bears. Many more retailers are set to share their latest results this week, including big-box store operators Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Target When Target shares its fiscal second-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that its earnings per share will have shrunk by a dime year-over-year to $1.12 per share, on $16.17 billion in revenue, which would be a more than 7 percent decline. Note that this Minneapolis-based retailer has only bested EPS estimates once in the past three quarters, and then by only a penny. Related Link: Retail Earnings Showdown: Wal-Mart Vs. Target The forecast from 31 Estimize respondents sees EPS from the big-box store operator coming in at $1.15, which is above the midpoint of Target's guidance range of $1.00 to $1.20. Also, the consensus revenue estimate for the three months that ended in July is $16.23 billion. However, Estimize, like Wall Street, overestimated the retailer's revenue in the previous two quarters. Wal-Mart Wall Street's consensus forecast for the world's largest retailer is for per-share earnings to have slipped about $0.06 from the same period of last year to $1.02, though that would be up from the $0.98 posted back in the first quarter. The 64 Estimize respondents are a bit more optimistic, with an consensus estimate of $1.04 per share for the fiscal second quarter, which ended in July. Like Wall Street, Estimize handily underestimated Wal-Mart's revenue back in the first quarter, and this time the respondents are looking for $120.37 billion, which would be only fractionally higher than in the year-ago period. Wall Street is in the same ballpark with its consensus forecast set at $120.34 billion. Wall Street also sees marginal top-line growth in the current quarter, as well as for the full fiscal year. Target is scheduled to report its results before the opening bell on Wednesday, while Wal-Mart is expected to share its quarterly numbers first thing on Thursday. Others In Play Other retailers that Wall Street analysts expect to show at least some earnings growth when they report this week include American Eagle Outfitters, Foot Locker, Home Depot, Lowe's, Ross Stores, Stein Mart, TJX Companies and Urban Outfitters. The EPS at Staples, are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. The consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Advance Auto Parts, Buckle, Dick's Sporting Goods, Gap, Hibbett Sports, L Brands and Stage Stores to have shrunk a year ago. A net loss is in the cards for Children's Place, Citi Trends and Tuesday Morning, if the analysts are correct. The following week, keep an eye out for earnings reports from the likes of Best Buy, Dollar General, GameStop and Tiffany.

Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. (Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion). The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability." "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. David McNew/Getty ImagesIn turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster.  "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. (Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion). The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability."© Provided by Business Insider   "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. © Provided by Business Insider Marc Lore Quidsi In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster.  "Walmart .com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart .” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

Updated: November 23, 2016 @ 11:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go! Life Buy/Sell David Nicklaus - Economy Updates on the economy and what's going on in St. Louis businesses. Wal-Mart spends big but is losing online battle with Amazon By David Nicklaus St. Louis Post-Dispatch David Nicklaus Aug 14, 2016 (…) For a long time, Wal-Mart was the biggest disruptor in the retail industry. Not any longer. Amazon is the new giant that’s making business models obsolete, and Wal-Mart is among the competitors scrambling to keep up. Instead of superstores and smiley faces, retailing’s new disruptive forces are shop-from-home convenience, ruthless efficiency and $99-a-year video subscriptions. If we needed evidence of the pain Amazon is causing in Bentonville, Ark., we got it Monday when Wal-Mart agreed to pay $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com. That’s a big price for a company that’s barely a year and a half old and, by its own admission, is at least four years from being profitable. Wal-Mart, hoping to get a boost from Jet’s young customer base and innovative technology, will put Jet founder Marc Lore in charge of all online efforts. Jet’s software, which adjusts prices based on shipping costs, may be its best asset. You get a discount if you live close to where an item is being shipped from, and if you combine items that can easily be shipped in one box. It’s a clever way to reward the most profitable customers, and it has the potential to turn the retailer’s 3,500 supercenters into fulfillment locations. Whether that’s the right strategy is another question. “The biggest problem for the supercenters is driving more traffic,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re way too big to just turn them into distribution centers.” Yarbrough has a hard time seeing how Wal-Mart can earn much of a return on its $3.3 billion investment. Wal-Mart had $14 billion of online sales last year, about 3 percent of its total, and Jet will add less than $1 billion initially. “The business is not profitable now, and even if you get to profitability you are going to earn lower returns than the overall retail business,” Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, about half the industrywide rate and a quarter of Amazon’s 28-percent growth. Catching up will require more than a nifty pricing algorithm; Amazon locks in customers by offering free shipping once they’ve paid $99 to watch shows such as “Boardwalk Empire.” “Wal-Mart is in a tough position,” Yarbrough say. “They don’t really have anything to distinguish themselves online.” Maybe an entrepreneurial leader can change that, but $3.3 billion is an expensive “acqui-hire.” Lore stayed with Amazon for two years after it bought his diaper-selling startup, Quidsi, in 2012.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives “I don’t know if this guy is going to want to do this,” says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates in New York. “When you have billions in your pocket, you may not want to work for a salary.” Besides, Davidowitz points out, Wal-Mart has made 15 previous e-commerce acquisitions. “They’ve spent more than anyone else and they have the worst results,” he said. “No matter what algorithm they have, this stuff is hard to scale. To believe a midget like Jet is going to compete against Amazon is almost hysterical.” Think back a couple of decades to how Wal-Mart brought Sears, Kmart and hundreds of neighborhood stores to their knees. “Wal-Mart used to be the 800-pound gorilla, and everybody reacted to what Wal-Mart did,” Yarbrough says. “Now the tables are turned and Wal-Mart reacts to what Amazon does.” Wal-Mart may have more money to throw at problems than its old-line competitors did, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any more successful at staving off disruption.

NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, began selling packaged deep-fried Twinkies Friday, marking its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack — in vanilla or chocolate — is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. The Twinkies, which are battered and partially fried before being frozen, need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” said Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave months off a product launch, said Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine whether an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the deep-fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. The vanilla flavor of the deep-fried Twinkies has nine grams of fat and 220 calories, compared with 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. When baked, deep-fried Twinkies come out a bit crispy, but they aren't an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It's really good. It's delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn't excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” More Business Dow's latest record high shows investor confidence growing Wells Fargo's 'golden parachutes' shackled GM's air bag recall delayed Federal judge blocks rule expanding OT pay Tips can help maximize veterans' GI Bill benefits Subscribe today!

It was offensive. And it made me feel violated.” She said she is still shaken up after a man approached her inside Walmart on Sunday. “When I tried to move, he grabbed me from behind,” she said. “Then I screamed; that’s what I remember.” The man then took off through the store. Some shoppers chased him while others checked on the victim. “I said, ‘This guy tried to grab me.’” She said several shoppers surrounded the man in the parking lot near a car with two women in the backseat. “He was reaching for something, so the guy that was trying to help me was scared for his life,” the victim said. The man got away, but the victim said things could have been worse. She wants to thank everyone that helped her. “I’d like to thank all of them,” she said. They risked their lives. They came together--solidarity. You never know when you need somebody.” Officers are still investigating the incident. If you know any information that may help, contact Bartlett Police Department.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 5 min read Ecommerce 5 Shipping Trends for Small Ecommerce Businesses To Watch Image credit: Shutterstock Amine Khechfé Contributor Chief Strategy Officer, Stamps.com and Co-Founder, Endicia Big Data 3 Ways Big Data Can Help Small Businesses With Shipping Strategies Amine Khechfé ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 15, 2016 Shipping is the final (and arguably most important) frontier when it comes to satisfying customers. Big box retailers have made shipping a priority by routinely examining and revamping their fulfillment methods, resulting in solutions like Amazon Prime, Walmart’s two-day shipping subscription and eBay’s Fast ‘N Free initiative. Keeping an eye on trends and adopting new, relevant shipping methods will not only help improve customer satisfaction, but it will also help small business owners meet their bottom lines and compete with the big dogs. Here are five logistics trends and strategies that all retail business owners should evaluate. 1. Free shipping is expected. According to a Deloitte survey, free shipping is the top priority for shoppers when it comes to retail policies, and nine in 10 shoppers prioritize free shipping over fast shipping when shopping online. For small businesses to remain competitive, and avoid shopping cart abandonment, they’ll need to strongly consider incorporating free shipping as an option. As all businesses know, shipping is never really free. On a basic level, there are a few strategies to help businesses cover the cost of free shipping. First, increase product prices to cover shipping costs. In this case, the customer pays. Second, the business pays the full price of shipping. Third, the company slightly increases prices of products to cover some shipping costs, so that both pay a portion. Businesses can also get creative, offering free shipping when a customer hits a minimum order value. This strategy can help by increasing an average order size; therefore, increasing profits to help offset shipping costs. 2. Deliver packages at a specific time. Some of consumers’ biggest pet peeves are receiving those “sorry we missed you” postage slips on their front door, or even worse, having a package stolen off their doorstep. According to a Temando survey, 76 percent of consumers want a specified time slot for delivery, and 37 percent are willing to pay a premium for it. The good news is that the major carriers’ tracking information have significantly improved, helping recipients know where their package is on its route and the estimated delivery date. In addition, most consumers know roughly when their mail carrier arrives each day and can oftentimes plan accordingly. For even greater control over delivery times, businesses can consider offering local customers on-demand delivery services, such as UberRUSH or Deliv. With these services, shoppers can specify the exact time of day they would like to have their order arrive. To ship smaller items to out-of-town customers with unusual or difficult schedules, USPS also offers a Hold for Pickup option, allowing the customer to pick up the parcel at a specified post office location. It also offers Package Intercept, which allows customers to reroute their domestic packages if they go on a vacation or business trip. 3. Drones will deliver. Drones will soon be able to deliver small items to local areas quickly and efficiently. Amazon and Google are investing in drone delivery, among countless other tech companies. However, there are still operational limitations standing in the way of drone delivery. The Part 107 drone regulations announced recently that it does not cover a variety of operations crucial to delivering packages, such as flying beyond a pilot’s visual line of sight, at higher altitudes and over laypeople. Related: 3 Ways to Grow a Multi-Million Dollar Drop Shipping Business So while they’re not buzzing overhead quite yet, business owners should keep drone delivery on their radar to make sure their business is ready to adapt quickly once regulations allowing drone deliveries are in place. 4. More options drive customer satisfaction. Traditionally, shoppers are given a few shipping options at checkout: standard, expedited and overnight. However, consumers are looking for more flexibility when it comes to how and when they receive their orders. According to an Accenture study, 66 percent of consumers have chosen a retailer based on the number of available delivery options. Related: 5 Keys to Building Your Ecommerce Site To avoid shopping cart abandonment and upset customers, retailers should think about adding additional delivery choices such as local pickup, carrier-specific options, same-day shipping and more. USPS is generally the most affordable option for smaller, lightweight packages while UPS and FedEx are better suited for larger items. Allowing customers to select specified carriers - UPS, FedEx or USPS -- may create satisfied, repeat customers as it gives them some control over the process. 5. Big data transforms shipping. Business data has been around for a long time, mostly sitting in filing cabinets as an untapped resource. Thanks to new technologies, small businesses can now leverage their data to better serve their customers. With the right tools, businesses can automatically analyze information, such as pricing histories, mobile device usage, website traffic, locations, parcels’ time in transit and shipping destinations to make informed business decisions. This eliminates inefficiencies and bias; therefore, reducing overall business costs and improving practices. Related: The 6 Best Ecommerce Platforms for Small Businesses There are countless ways small businesses can gather, analyze and make sense of all the data at their fingertips. For example, Endicia uses package data and predictive analysis to guide ecommerce business owners’ decisions, ranging from where to plant warehouses to how to improve delivery for the end-consumer through forecasted shipping costs and time in transit. By taking a look at where most products are shipped and how long they take to get there, business owners can determine the optimal location for a warehouse that will save the most time and money. Shipping is a challenging aspect of any ecommerce business and every small business will have different tactics and challenges to create the most efficient shipping strategy possible. Keeping an eye on shipping trends and strategies while implementing and tweaking it as needed, will help businesses determine what works best in order to be successful and competitive with the ecommerce retail giants.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, August 16, 2016 Updated: 12:05 PM, August 16, 2016 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc <AAPL.O> by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, the world's largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co <DE.N> and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc <SU.TO>, and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O>. It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 <PSX.N>. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co <KHC.O> was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>.

Another customer captured part of the scene on video as she was going through the parking lot. In Richelle Stewart's video, posted to Facebook, the monkey can be seen standing on top of a railing to a cart corral, with an employee next to it. A woman walks up, saying "let it go, let it go" then takes the monkey by the hand and walks off. Police say the monkey got out of a camper that was parked in the lot. They say they were called to the store just before 8:00pm Sunday evening, but no report was taken. No word on who owns the monkey, or where he's from. close News In Pictures Gallery: On the red carpet at the American Music Awards 2016 Body of 10-year-old missing girl taken from church found in a Texas water well Cincinnati Zoo's gorilla barrier wasn't in compliance Community mourns students killed by overturned bus crash Trending 1   Caught on camera a foiled police ambush that happened in Lewiston 2   Community Action Partnership is dedicated to helping the community year-round 3   Candidate for N.P.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Retirement Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Best Buy's Stock Slumps After Analyst Cuts Rating, Price Target ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Best Buy's Stock Slumps After Analyst Cuts Rating, Price Target By Tomi Kilgore Published August 15, 2016 Markets MarketWatch Pulse Facebook Twitter Print Shares of Best Buy Co. Inc. dropped 1% in afternoon trade Monday, despite the broad gains seen in the retail sector and the overall stock market, after Jefferies downgraded the consumer electronics retailer on concerns over a weakening 4K TV market. Analyst Daniel Binder cut his rating to hold, after being at buy for at least the last three years. He trimmed his stock price target to $36, which is just 4.3% above current levels, from $39. Binder said he is worried that the 4K TV cycle is maturing as prices fall and competition increases. He said the average selling prices for large screen 4K TVs have dropped 30% on a trailing-12-month basis, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. [: tgt] have "dramatically increased" their product offerings. Wal-Mart increased its shop-keeping-unit (SKU) count on 4K TVs to 9 from a few, while Target has tripled its SKU count to 15 from 5, Binder said. "[Best Buy] has above average market share in 4K TV, but will face stiffer competition this holiday season," Binder wrote in a note to clients. He believes the commoditization of 4K TVs puts same-store sales growth at risk for the rest of the year. Best Buy's stock has soared 13% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has climbed 6.3% and the S&P 500 has run up 7.3%. Continue Reading Below Copyright © 2016 MarketWatch, Inc.

 Text Size: A | A A Walmart truck is stuck under an overpass in Schenectady. The top of the tractor trailer has been sheared off after the driver tried to go under the overpass on Crane Street around 1 p.m. The overpass has a 10-foot, 10-inch clearance, which is labeled with signs. The sign, however, is covered with black graffiti. Photo Gallery Stuck under a bridge Enlarge photos | View thumbnails Schenectady police Lt. Mark McCracken said an investigation into the incident is ongoing. It's unclear why the driver tried to fit under the overpass. McCracken said the driver did not sustain any injuries.

Maybe they're tagged over too. PFS August 16, 2016 12:10 a.m. [ Flag Post ] There needs to be a structural assessment of the overpass. Will Wally-Mart pay for that and any damage caused? Who will pay for the police response? We bill individuals for EMT response, do we not? Signage is usually thorough enough to avoid this type of occurance. With all of the gadgets that Wally-Mart has installed in its fleet, one would expect the equivalent of a depthfinder for its trucks or at least a list of proscribed routing. muggy August 16, 2016 6:17 a.m. [ Flag Post ] Am I the only one who blames government for building bridges too low? I'm open to be corrected on my thoughts but that was my 1st reaction. Aren't the roads and bridges the responsibility of government? Shouldn't they be constructed with ALL vehicles in mind? Milton Friedman once said that the cause of 85% of the problems we experience in our day-to-day lives redound to bad government. cidbil August 16, 2016 8:44 a.m. [ Flag Post ] muggy: When most of these bridges were built, they probably met any height requirements. As time has gone on vehicles have gotten larger (especially Tractor Trailers). The bridges have not. So should we now have governments rebuild all the bridges? Who's going to pay for it? PFS August 16, 2016 10:02 a.m. [ Flag Post ] Vehicles that tall do not belong on roadways so old that the bridges are that low. On the opposite end of that spectrum, when we build new bridges over our rivers and canals we should raise their height to accommodate sailing vessels. It has taken several hundred years to assemble the transport network we now have in this country. The desires of the trucking industry have driven federal highway standards which are then imposed upon the states and local municipalities. We might be better off returning to rail and sail transport. Log-in to post a comment.

Accumulated lead levels can cause serious, sometimes permanent health problems such as brain function in fetuses and young children. Anyone with an affected product should not use it. On Friday, Oriental Packing Co. of Miami, Fla. recalled 377,000 pounds of various curry powders sold under Blue Mountain (Amazon.com), Jamaica Choice, Ocho Rios, Oriental and Grace brands (Walmart). The exact products are shown here: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  And here are the corresponding lot numbers to identify those products in the recall: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  One week earlier, Gel Spice Inc. of Bayonne, N.J. recalled various lots of ground turmeric shipped nationwide, including to larger chains such as Target, and local grocery stores. Those products are identified here: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  Turmeric is seen by many as a health supplement against cancer and other diseases. The contaminations were detected by a New York State Health Department laboratory during routine testing. How lead got into the products has not been announced, although some experts speculate the plants used in the spices can absorb lead from the soil. It can also come from processing or deliberate adulteration to increase yield. Oriental Packing said in an announcement of its voluntary recall that it has ceased production of the curry while the product is being investigated. Consumers are urged to dispose of the affected product or return to place of purchase for a refund. The company answers consumer questions at 1-800-809-9793. Gel Spice turmeric products in the recall should also be thrown out, according to a statement from the company. Questions can be directed to 201-564-0435. Dion Tsevdos, owner of the Urban Herbs stand at West Side Market in Cleveland, and a supplier to many local restaurants, said his inventory is not affected by the recall. "Our supplier is out of New York. They test every lot and had no issues with either of those products." Margie Gibbons of Penzeys in West Milwaukee, WI, said her company is not involved in the recall, either. They import their own product and test shipments themselves. "Religiously," she said.

He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song I Dont Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governors mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their 9-month-old daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. The world changed. There was a tectonic shift, said Thomas F. McLarty III, a friend of Bill Clintons who served as his White House chief of staff. Bill Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Hillary Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelseas college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. It was up to her to just keep holding things up, said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Hillary Clintons who moved to Arkansas to work for Bill Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clintons relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Hillary Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed, and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result  from serving on the corporate board of Wal-Mart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1.35 million mortgage personally secured by a top fundraiser for the familys Chappaqua, New York, home. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them a lot that Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald Trump has called Clinton totally owned by Wall Street. Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but Republicans can say, This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Clintons allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Clintons practicality and the boom-and-bust cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Hillary Clintons shoulders than in the difficult two-year period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job, said James B. Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Hillary Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and get-rich-quick schemes as companies like Tyson and Wal-Mart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy League-educated young people, like Bill Clinton, had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Hillary Clinton, a worrier by nature, Bill Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. He was never interested in money, ever, Blair said. She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college. People close to Hillary Clinton dont begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Hillary Clinton said, I really think its much simpler than that, adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. Thrift store decor It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rocks Hillcrest section, and Hillary Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant mother-in-law. She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway, and chased after the familys cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112,000 home, which was down the hill from the citys old-money mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close that it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons grassy backyard. Friends described the décor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governors mansion. That couch just jumped out at me, said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Bill Clinton, describing a scarlet-colored Victorian chaise that Bill Clintons mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. It was in some bright, violent color. And with no parents or in-laws in Little Rock, Hillary Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governors mansion while Bill Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel J. Lozano, recalled: Hillary was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help. Bill Clinton had turned down out-of-state job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve of counsel for $55,000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey & Jennings law firm, where Bill Clintons longtime adviser Bruce R. Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost, Pietrafesa recalled, and every one of those visits was a two-, three- or four-hour ordeal. Hillary Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Bill Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governors wife. The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat, Jerry C. Jones, Hillary Clintons colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm  an old line practice known for representing the business and political elite in Arkansas  had it not been for her concern about her familys finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Hillary Clinton as an oddity there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and thrown-together clothes. (Hillary Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) Im not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer, said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Hillary Clinton. But she did the work because she had the earning capacity that he didnt have as governor. A frugal father Growing up in the upper-middle-class suburb of Park Ridge, Illinois, Hillary Rodham  whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose Depression-era father preached frugality  babysat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. Her mother came from nothing and her father was self-made, so theres always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living, said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Hugh Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted that his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped out at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. Were searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living, she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and later married Bill Clinton in 1975, the Yale Law-educated couple lived happily earning about $18,000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Bill Clinton planned his run for the governors office and the couple worried about starting a family, Hillary Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision maker, her best friend, Diane D. Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful  and many of the Clintons contemporaries were getting rich. The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful, said William K. Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Hillary Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Blair, the Clintons close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market, and urged Hillary Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1,000, she made nearly $100,000 trading cattle futures in a 10-month period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being crooked. Look at her cattle futures! he called out to the crowd. More stable Also in 1978, another friend, James B. McDougal, persuaded Hillary Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a brush-covered plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Bill Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couples income at the time. In 1978, Bill Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest paid, governors, in the country, earning $33,519.14 his first year in office. Hillary Clintons income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51,173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Hillary Clinton told her broker she wanted out. I couldnt take the stress, she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her familys financial worries. Not long after Bill Clinton won re-election in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governors mansion, where they once again enjoyed free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governors term to four years, and the Clintons finances appeared more stable. Hillary Clinton went on to join the board of Wal-Mart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Bill Clinton was running for president, they reported $297,177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier, but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman, Bill Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Hillary Clinton wrote a book, It Takes a Village, for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks), Diane Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couples earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Bill Clintons relationship with a White House intern, which led to the presidents impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House in 2000  the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years  they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Hillary Clinton described her familys situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: Dead broke. Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign fundraiser, who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home  a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial in the tony suburb of Chappaqua, New York  was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Hillary Clinton did not have to call the Roto-Rooter every time the old pipes clogged, or run to a neighbors house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Hillary Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign.

After several days of record-setting rainfall, devastating floodwaters poured into much of Southeast Louisiana this weekend, including East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Helena, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Ascension and surrounding parishes. Multiple news organizations are reporting the rescue of more than 20,000 people from homes and vehicles as of Sunday. As many New Orleanians know well, flooding robs families of resources large and small: it's not just cars and homes, but day-to-day personal effects, from clothes and blankets to shampoo and toothbrushes.

Certain merchandise priced under $100 is state tax free that weekend in Iowa.  REBECCA S. GRATZ/THE WORLD-HERALD Shawna Reed of Omaha scans the T-shirts while shopping for her three sons at J.C. Penney in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Aug. 5, 2016. Certain merchandise priced under $100 was tax free that weekend in Iowa.  The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and retailers are hoping to capture every dollar they can after an unusually warm winter torpedoed apparel sales. The season — second only to the holidays as retailers’ busiest — might provide a small boost, but some industry watchers say it’s unlikely to turn the ship for many that are struggling to compete with online retailers such as Amazon. Another challenge: luring the ever-savvy post-recession consumer. “It seems like every season people are asking ‘Will this be the shopping season where things go back to the rate of growth we’ve seen in the past?’ And it typically never is,” said Timothy Campbell, an analyst with Kantar Retail, a research firm in Boston. Retailers are facing another challenging year, with some, such as Kmart, Macy’s and Walmart, saying they will close stores, and an index that tracks the stocks of national retailers is down 5.5 percent over the past year when compared with the broader stock market, which is up 7.25 percent over the same period. Still, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, is much more optimistic. The organization predicts total spending for K-12 and college students is expected to reach $75.8 billion, up from last year’s $68 billion. Many parents might be stocking up this year after scraping by last year, when spending remained basically flat, the NRF said. This “stock up” and “make do” cycle is an effect of the last recession, when many people tried to stretch their dollars as much as possible, spokeswoman Ana Serafin Smith said. “That trend just kept on happening, especially when we’re starting to see millennials, most affected during the recession, are now becoming parents,” she said. “They’re using the same practices they basically have lived through over the last several years.” Joanne Farmer of Glenwood, Iowa, said she’s expecting to spend about the same as she did last year for her three kids, ages 10, 5 and 4. But she also tries to make back-to-school items stretch beyond just one year. “If we get a decent backpack it’s, like, ‘If this one is good next year, you’re using it,’ ” Farmer said. NRF’s survey of 6,809 consumers conducted June 30 through July 6 found that, on average, families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade were planning to spend about $675 on apparel and accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies, up from last year’s $630.36. Another survey by consulting firm Deloitte of 1,200 parents from June 22 through June 27 found that families would spend about $488 on back-to-school necessities. “I think we’ll find retailers will have a slight boost. I don’t think it’s going to be the kind of boost that will drive them to a different place from an economic perspective,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman and U.S. retail and distribution practice leader at Deloitte in Charlotte, North Carolina. Retailers — especially teen retailers that might be a focus during back-to-school season — have been in a tough place since the recession. Teen retailers like American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch and Kearney, Nebraska-based the Buckle are expected, as a group, to report an earnings drop of 45 percent in the second quarter of this year when compared with the same period last year, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics in Boston. (The Buckle’s stock is down almost 40 percent over the past year.) Meanwhile, earnings for discount stores like Target and Walmart are expected to dip about 8 percent for the same period. “It’s gonna be difficult for the industry to generate the kind of concentrated buzz for these particular things,” Perkins said of the back-to-school season. Campbell, the Kantar analyst, said that’s because, in a nutshell, consumer behavior has fundamentally changed. The economic downturn trained consumers to pinch pennies. Plus, more shopper dollars are being funneled to other expenses: rising health care, child care, housing and education costs. In turn, retailers must respond with constant sales and promotions to keep traffic flowing to their stores. Sales of 30 to 50 percent off are much more common than they were 10 years ago, Campbell said. “You’re just seeing much more than you would 10 years ago,” he said. “Shoppers have become accustomed to that. They’re not just buying things at full price at the drop of a hat.” The constant sales that shoppers have come to expect eat into stores’ profits. One such sale-focused shopper is Omahan Flora Coan. She has her back-to-school shopping strategy down to a science, and it’s all about saving as much money as possible. She took advantage of Iowa’s sales tax holiday, held the first weekend in August each year. Coan budgets to spend between $900 and $1,100 on clothes for her two sons, Jaden, 13, and Wendell, 10. “From a budget perspective it works better. Boys’ stuff doesn’t go on clearance very often,” she said. That’s why she does all of her shopping — jeans, sweaters, shoes and backpacks — for the year during the back-to-school season, when sales are abundant. “I focus more on winter stuff,” she said, because shorts and short-sleeve shirts last only a few weeks into the school year, she said. Many other parents, retail watchers say, are opting to buy what they need as they go. Because retailers are discounting more than ever, they’re cutting back the sense of urgency that once came with shopping “seasons,” like back to school and the holidays. “There is a loss of urgency,” Campbell said, to shop the season, because of nearly constant sales. “That just led shoppers to think they can shop anytime they want and always be able to find deals.” When buying back-to-school items for her two daughters, ages 11 and 6, Omahan Micki Ortez planned to spend about the same as she did last year. But she wasn’t doing all of her shopping in August. “I don’t stock up. I buy just so much at first,” waiting for colder months to buy cold-weather clothes, Ortez said. “I’m a buy-as-you-go.” Brick-and-mortar retailers may have an edge over those that are only online. Unlike during the holiday shopping season, many parents are on the hunt for new clothes for growing kids, necessitating trying things on before buying. In Deloitte’s survey, about two-thirds of shoppers said they would buy school supplies in a store rather than online. Families were shopping the season earlier this year, however. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed by the NRF said they would begin back-to-school shopping about a month to two months out from the beginning of the school year, up from 62 percent last year. That could give retailers with earlier sales an opportunity, Deloitte’s Sides said. But that strategy can backfire, too. The shopping season creeping earlier and earlier is a common complaint during the holidays, when Christmas items are now on display weeks before Black Friday, which traditionally kicked off the season. Some retailers and shoppers, Campbell said, “have been suffering from a back-to-school burnout. Some of the campaigns we’ve seen are very similar to last year, or relatively uninspired.” Contact the writer: 402-444-1414, paige.yowell@owh.com ****** WAYS TO SAVE ON BACK-TO-SCHOOL BUYING MIX NEW AND OLD ITEMS: If a growth spurt doesn’t necessitate buying everything new, focus on a few items and take advantage of help from retailers. J.C. Penney’s website has a section called “Outfits You Love” that suggests ways to mix eight items to create two weeks of looks. DO THE RESEARCH: It’s easier than ever to check prices to make sure you’re getting the best deal. One site, camelcamelcamel.com, monitors prices on millions of Amazon.com products and sends alerts when prices drop. Apps like RedLaser and PriceJump let shoppers scan an item to see if there’s a better price online. TIME YOUR BUYING: Back-to-school discounts have already started, but the trick is knowing the best time to grab certain items. For summer clothes like short-sleeve tops, wait until the last week of August and the first week of September to reap the biggest discounts, said Benjamin Glaser, editor of DealNews, a deal-comparison website. For fall clothes, try to buy the first week of October. For jeans, he said to buy later in October for the largest savings. In years past, Glaser said, he’s seen brands like Lucky, Levi’s and Nautica cut prices by 40 percent to 60 percent during October, with few restrictions. BUY THE BASICS IN BULK: Stock up on items like socks and hoodies. Target’s new Cat & Jack line for kids has offered $4 tank tops for girls. Gap’s Old Navy has up to 60 percent off with styles starting from $4. Old Navy is offering deep price cuts on hooded sweatshirts, selling for about $12, that Andres Dorronsoro, general manager at Old Navy merchandising, calls “extra cozy.” Walmart has basic T-shirts for boys for just under $3 and leggings for girls for just under $4. SHOP OFF-PRICE: Discounters like T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and others are increasingly offering more items in season and are working to better curate them to the local market, said Ronen Lazar, CEO of Inturn, a technology company that works with off-price retailers to help liquidate merchandise. T.J. Maxx says that now through the beginning of September is the best time to catch trends for kids and teens, such as plaid and athletic-inspired clothing. LEVERAGE STORE REWARDS: Choose one store and do most of your shopping there to get the biggest benefit from its rewards program. The Kohl’s programs offers $5 in rewards for every 100 points, or dollars spent. Shoppers also can sign up for programs like Plenti, which let them earn points in one store and use them in another. — The Associated Press More information Parents who scrimp to pay for child care get a break when the last kid finally heads off to kindergarten The cost, which has become the single-biggest expense for many families, forces parents to do more than just tighten their belts. Cutting everyday luxuries such as cable TV, lattes and dinners out barely scratches the surface. Instead, they put off big purchases, like new cars and homes, that drive the country’s consumer economy.

(KSNW) – The northeast Wichita neighborhood has been without Walmart since the beginning of the year. When it closed, it not only affected where families can get their groceries, but also school supplies. Sunday, a local church stepped in to help those getting ready for school. KSN talked to those who benefited from the event. “I’m just so blessed and thankful,” said Maxine Powell-McClellan. McClellan is one of the nearly 300 families came for help with school supplies.. “To have Delrose and come and provide backpacks for my children, even though we still need to get other school supplies, it’s really helped out tremendously,” McClellan added. “A lot of neighborhood kids come here whom some parents aren’t able to drive or can’t get out of the neighborhood,” said Delrose Rev. Kevass Harding. They handed out backpacks filled with food and offered free haircuts for boys and hairstyles for girls. After running out last year, this time, the church supplied close to 400 backpacks. “I think this a great opportunity for them to come and get all the school supplies whether it be backpacks or even the haircuts we give,” said The Grooming Experience barber, Shannon Brown. “It gives them an opportunity to get everything they need without having to travel far or trying to find transportation.” Church members says they noticed a lot of people who live in the neighborhood are in need of assistance after the neighborhood Walmart store closed earlier this year. “With Walmart not being there, it’s a little bit further to go out to be able to get what you need for the school supplies,” said parent, Brandy Knox. “So with this being here at the church, it makes it a lot easier for people in the neighborhood to be able to come and get what they need for school.” And with school right around the corner, Knox is just thankful someone stepped in to help. “Without Delrose, it really would have been a lot more work for me,” Knox said. The church helped 280 families this afternoon. Next year, they’re hoping to expand that number, saying they’d like to get other churches involved to reach a wider number of people. This is the fourth year Delrose United Methodist Church hosted the event.

It’s about a private Michigan company called Ranir, which makes, among other things, the business end of electric toothbrushes. After spending two years and millions of dollars to re-engineer its toothbrush heads, Ranir brought back fully one-fifth of that production from China to its facility in Grand Rapids. It’s precisely the kind of thing that both Clinton and Trump, with varying degrees of emphasis and policy prescriptions, have pledged to accelerate as a way to cure America’s blue-collar woes. Using tougher trade policies with China and others to restore the nation’s manufacturing sector will bring home jobs, the theory goes. Ranir’s experience appears to back up such assumptions at first blush. After all, now it is American workers who are busy around the clock churning out 13,000 toothbrush heads a day for Wal-Mart, Walgreens and other retailers. There’s just one catch: Thanks to the new robotic manufacturing process that Ranir adopted, it takes only four workers at the American plant to do the same job that almost certainly required dozens more in China. And they spend much of their time watching to make sure the computer-driven machines are working properly. Instead of the clang and bustle of a traditional plant, the four workers go about their chores in a clean-room setting, wearing large white protective hats. So what the Ranir story actually shows is not how easy it would be to bring back manufacturing jobs, but how small the results can be, thanks largely to the very thing that made the return possible: automation. “It sounds appealing. It sounds like an easy solution. You close borders or impose tariffs, and magically you get jobs popping back up,” said Brad Hershbein, economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, referring to protectionist policies such as those proposed by Trump. But that’s just not going to happen, he said. “We’ll probably continue to see flatlining of employment or it declining,” Hershbein said. There are many reasons to question whether tougher trade policies alone will bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs to their past levels. Some manufacturers would respond to tariffs and other protectionist policies by simply moving existing overseas jobs to other countries, rather than back to the U.S. Other powerful forces working against large-scale increases in U.S. manufacturing jobs include regulatory costs and an absence of suppliers in the U.S. But even if manufacturing did return, the jobs may not, thanks to advancing technology. Arnold Kamler, whose family has been in the bicycle business for a century, never thought he would make anything in the U.S. again after he tearfully shut the doors to his New Jersey plant in 1991. Like all onetime domestic bike makers, including better-known firms like Huffy and Schwinn, Kamler’s company, Bicycle Corporation of America, turned entirely to manufacturers abroad or it buys foreign-made bikes to supply to the U.S. market. But two years ago, Kamler brought back a small share of production from China to a rural corner of South Carolina. He was prodded by Wal-Mart’s “Made in America” campaign and the realization that China’s best manufacturing days were over. Annual employee turnover at his factory outside Shanghai today is more than 120 percent. But automation also made it more feasible to return the work to the U.S. This year, Kamler will make almost 300,000 bikes in Manning, S.C., about as many as he produced domestically in 1991. His company operates with about a third fewer employees than it needed back then. With 4,000 feet of overhead conveyors and the latest wheel-building equipment, his 115 employees assemble bikes at a rate that would require twice as many workers in China. Those are indeed new American jobs, but the pay scale is modest — they earn $11 to $12 an hour to start, plus health insurance, 75 percent employer-paid — not quite the renaissance sometimes suggested by the presidential candidates. And Kamler still imports 2.6 million bikes a year from China. Its South Carolina manufacturing won’t be profitable for at least another couple of years. Even as he expands his production volume and capabilities in the U.S., he doesn’t foresee large increases in employment. Next year, Kamler plans to go to 450,000 bikes in South Carolina, a 50 percent increase. But the company may add only 30 workers. He also is investing in a state-of-the-art painting operation and wants to make his own aluminum rims rather than importing them. He recalled how in 1991, bike rims were made completely by hand, first cut, then welded, buffed down and finally holes punched in them before being sent for painting or chrome-plating. Today, he says, a new and expensive Dutch-made system can take 20-foot sections of aluminum and churn out a finished rim in about 90 seconds. For that, the company would need only one operator, just to make sure that the machines don’t jam. “It’s so automated, it’s inspiring,” he said of bike manufacturing today. Some economists think the U.S. could bring back as many as 2 million factory jobs by eliminating the country’s merchandise trade deficit, which hit a record $745 billion last year, half with China. But it is not that simple. “Hiring someone is kind of the last thing you do because it’s a potentially long-term commitment,” said Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organization. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’ ” Tantillo remembers when 1.8 million people worked in textile and apparel manufacturing about 20 years ago. Today, it’s around 600,000, including cotton and fiber industries, with some of the decrease caused by technology and some by cheaper labor overseas. Although U.S. manufacturing employment overall, as a share of all non-farm jobs, has been falling since the end of World War II, there was a particularly severe drop from 2000 to 2009. During that period, factory jobs plunged from more than 17 million to 11.5 million; about half of that came between 2000 and 2003 when the U.S. was in a relatively brief and mild recession. (It since has edged back up to about 12.3 million.) When Trump and Clinton point the finger at China, they aren’t totally off-base. Research suggests that a large chunk of the manufacturing job loss during the 2000s was the result of a surge in Chinese imports and competition, itself the consequence of changing U.S. policy in 2000 that gave permanent normal trade relations status to China and the country’s ascension to the World Trade Organization the following year. That designation removed the uncertainty of annual tariff renewals and spurred large-scale investments and activity from both U.S. and Chinese companies, accelerating what had been gradually shifting trends in global production and trade flows amid China’s rise, said Peter Schott of Yale University, who wrote a paper on the subject with Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve. Part of that shift, though, included large-scale investments in technologies and processes — which boosted productivity but also restrained employment at home. In motor vehicle and parts manufacturing, domestic employment fell by half from 2000 to 2009, to about 650,000. Since the economic recovery in mid-2009, car sales have taken off and the industry’s gross output has more than doubled, to $662.5 billion last year. Another government measure of car-manufacturing value that excludes costs for energy and raw materials shows that the industry tripled between 2009 and 2015. But during that same period, the industry’s employment went up by only about 40 percent and remains far below what it was in 2000. The difference can be seen in the tens of thousands of robots and other streamlining processes, including advances in transportation and information technology, that have reduced the need for human hands at American auto plants. Since 2000, the traditional Big Three domestic automakers — General Motors, Ford and Chrysler — have sliced in half the labor hours needed to assemble a car, to about 22, according to Harbour Reports and the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. And the industry’s not done. Many of the labor hours of car production are in the final assembly stage, where seats, instrument panels and other parts are installed. Though still done largely manually, those tasks eventually will be performed by smaller and more dexterous robots, said Jay Baron, president of the Center for Automotive Research. “That’ll be the next big growth area,” he said.   Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Target, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Gap, and Urban Outfitters are among US retailers releasing their latest quarterly earnings this week. Also scheduled to report are Cisco, Nestle and Deere. Last Friday shares of Nordstrom, the top US luxury department store chain, soared 8 percent. after it posted second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ expectations. Nordstrom was the latest department store to please investors following Macy’s and Kohl’s earlier in the week. Even so, a disappointing report on US retail sales on Friday reminded investors that consumers might be tightening their purse strings, and helped lower expectations the Fed will raise interest rates soon. “Investors aren’t viewing the Fed as an immediate threat, with the economy growing just slow enough to keep them from raising right now,” Terry Morris, Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based managing director of equities at BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors, told Bloomberg. The Atlanta Fed downgraded its forecast for GDP growth in the third quarter of 2016 to 3.5 percent on Friday, from 3.7 percent on Tuesday. To be sure, some questioned the weak retail sales data. "You have had two months of very strong job growth. It just seems very odd that spending would be weak. I will wait for the revisions before declaring July retail spending means anything more than random volatility," Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York, told Reuters. For fresh clues on rates, investors will pour over minutes from the July 26-27 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, set for release this Wednesday. Meanwhile, there are also speeches from Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, as well as from St Louis Fed's James Bullard on Thursday, and San Francisco Fed's John Williams on Friday. The latest economic data will arrive as reports on the Empire State manufacturing survey and the housing market index, due today; consumer price index, housing starts and industrial production, due Tuesday; Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations, due Wednesday; as well as weekly jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, and leading indicators, due Thursday. Wall Street remains near record highs. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent. It was Wall Street’s sixth weekly gain in seven, according to Bloomberg. “A lot of people who were scared out of equities earlier this year think they’re missing the train and want back in, and valuations haven’t necessarily deterred them,” BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors’ Morris told Bloomberg. Another reason for optimism is that corporate results have been better than expected overall. With most S&P 500 members through with reporting quarterly results, 78 percent beat profit forecasts while 56 percent surpassed on sales; even so, the S&P 500’s price relative to future earnings now stands at 18.6, the highest since 2002, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index climbed 1.4 percent for the week. Investors will eye euro-zone data including the trade balance and ZEW economic sentiment, due Tuesday; and the current account and consumer price index, due Thursday.

Family had gathered to help prepare the house for flooding from the Tchefuncte River with sandbags and plastic tarps. The house flooded just a few months ago in the March floods with four feet of water. The tarps aren't intended to keep the water out, but to protect the house from the heavy river current. The house is already flooded with 6 inches of water inside.

The group first put out a call to its membership on Sunday, but will begin accepting donations from the general public on Monday. Specifically, the group is seeking diapers from sizes newborn to 5, as well as women's hygiene products and gift cards in $20 amounts to Target and Wal-Mart. The group also accept cash and check donations made to the Junior League for New Orleans for purchase of gift cards. All donations can be dropped off at the League's headquarters, 4319 Carondelet St. from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 pm., Monday through Friday. The group will deliver the items to Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Junior League of New Orleans president Maria Pardo Huete said the group immediately wanted the help. "The memory of Katrina is still strong with all of us," she said. "And we're women. So we think, what will women need right now? And they'll need diapers for their babies and formula, which they can buy with the gift cards."

Click here to enlarge images Sunday reader Sunday Reader: Stress over family finances propelled Clinton into corporate world How stress over family finances propelled Hillary Clinton into the corporate world By Amy Chozick • New York Times News Service Published Aug 14, 2016 at 12:06AM LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Losing the governor’s race here in 1980 so shattered a young Bill Clinton that he couldn’t face his supporters, so he sent his wife around to thank campaign workers instead. He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song “I Don’t Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling” on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governor’s mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their 9-month-old daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. “The world changed. There was a tectonic shift,” said Thomas McLarty III, a friend of Bill Clinton’s who served as his White House chief of staff. Bill Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters’ rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Hillary Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelsea’s college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. “It was up to her to just keep holding things up,” said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Hillary Clinton’s who moved to Arkansas to work for Bill Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clinton’s relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Hillary Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result — from serving on the corporate board of Wal-Mart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1.35 million mortgage personally secured by a top fundraiser for the family’s Chappaqua, New York, home. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters’ anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them “a lot” that Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald Trump has called Clinton “totally owned by Wall Street.” Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but “Republicans can say, ‘This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance,’” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Clinton’s allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Clinton’s practicality and the boom-and-bust cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Hillary Clinton’s shoulders than in the difficult two-year period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. “Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,” said James Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Hillary Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons’ unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and get-rich-quick schemes as companies like Tyson and Wal-Mart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy League-educated young people, like Bill Clinton, had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Hillary Clinton, a worrier by nature, Bill Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. “He was never interested in money, ever,” Blair said. “She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college.” People close to Hillary Clinton don’t begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Hillary Clinton said, “I really think it’s much simpler than that,” adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. Thrift store decor It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rock’s Hillcrest section, and Hillary Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant mother-in-law. She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway, and chased after the family’s cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112,000 home, which was down the hill from the city’s old-money mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons’ grassy backyard. Friends described the decor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governor’s mansion. “That couch just jumped out at me,” said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Bill Clinton, describing a scarlet-colored Victorian chaise that Bill Clinton’s mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. “It was in some bright, violent color.” And with no parents or in-laws in Little Rock, Hillary Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governor’s mansion while Bill Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel Lozano, recalled: Hillary “was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help.” Bill Clinton had turned down out-of-state job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve “of counsel” for $55,000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey & Jennings law firm, where Bill Clinton’s longtime adviser Bruce Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. “He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost,” Pietrafesa recalled, “and every one of those visits was a two-, three- or four-hour ordeal.” Hillary Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Bill Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governor’s wife. “The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat,” Jerry Jones, Hillary Clinton’s colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm — a practice known for representing the business and political elite — had she not been concerned about her family’s finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Hillary Clinton as an “oddity” there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and thrown-together clothes. (Hillary Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) “I’m not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer,” said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Hillary Clinton. But she did the work because “she had the earning capacity that he didn’t have as governor.” A frugal father Growing up in the upper-middle-class suburb of Park Ridge, Illinois, Hillary Rodham — whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose Depression-era father preached frugality — baby-sat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. “Her mother came from nothing, and her father was self-made, so there’s always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living,” said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Hugh Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped out at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. “We’re searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living,” she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and later married Bill Clinton in 1975, the Yale Law-educated couple lived happily earning about $18,000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Bill Clinton planned his run for the governor’s office and the couple worried about starting a family, Hillary Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. “She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision-maker,” her best friend, Diane Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful — and many of the Clintons’ contemporaries were getting rich. “The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful,” said William Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Hillary Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Blair, the Clintons’ close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market and urged Hillary Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1,000, she made nearly $100,000 trading cattle futures in a 10-month period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being “crooked.” “Look at her cattle futures!” he called out to the crowd. Also in 1978, another friend, James McDougal, persuaded Hillary Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a brush-covered plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Bill Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couple’s income at the time. In 1978, Bill Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest-paid, governors in the country, earning $33,519.14 his first year in office. Hillary Clinton’s income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51,173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Hillary Clinton told her broker she wanted out. “I couldn’t take the stress,” she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her family’s financial worries. Not long after Bill Clinton won re-election in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor’s mansion, where they once again enjoyed free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governor’s term to four years, and the Clintons’ finances appeared more stable. Hillary Clinton went on to join the board of Wal-Mart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Bill Clinton was running for president, they reported $297,177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier, but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. “When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman,” Bill Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Hillary Clinton wrote a book, “It Takes a Village,” for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. “HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks),” Diane Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couple’s earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Bill Clinton’s relationship with a White House intern, which led to the president’s impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House in 2000 — the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years — they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Hillary Clinton described her family’s situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: “Dead broke.” Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign fundraiser, who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home — a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial in the tony suburb of Chappaqua, New York — was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Hillary Clinton did not have to call the Roto-Rooter every time the old pipes clogged, or run to a neighbor’s house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Hillary Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign. 14727442 View next article in Opinion     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Starting Aug. 22, several routes — including the BRITE Bus system and the Blue Ridge Community College shuttles — will be impacted by new revisions and schedule improvements, a release said. THE NEWS LEADER Transit in Waynesboro looking for input The Blue Ridge Community College North and South Shuttles, the Waynesboro Circulator route and the 340 Connector route will be altered in order to increase reliability, add more stops at key destinations and allow for easier connections between routes, a release said. The changes come after recommendations from the commission’s transit development plan.  According to CSPDC, the following routes will be changed: The BRCC North and South Shuttles will eliminate the evening break in service. BRCC North will operate every hour Monday through Thursday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and on Fridays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. The BRCC South will operate every hour Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and on Fridays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.   The Waynesboro Circulator route has added a stop at the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, and several under-utilized stops have been removed from the route. Popular stops will continue to be served including Waynesboro Town Center, Wal-Mart, the community center, social services, the library and other destinations. The Waynesboro Circulator will continue to operate Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and will allow connections to the Route 250 Connector and the Stuarts Draft Link at the Waynesboro HUB located at Wal-Mart. The 340 Connector route has been replaced with a revised route called the Stuarts Draft Link. Additional stops have been added at retail and medical destinations within Stuarts Draft and providing service, without transfer, to Augusta Health. This new route will operate Monday through Friday from 6:50 a.m. to 4:43 p.m., with a two-hour midday break from 10:43 a.m. to 12:50 p.m. and will provide connections to the Waynesboro Circulator and the 250 Connector at the Waynesboro HUB located at Wal-Mart. THE NEWS LEADER Stranded: Depending on public transit in the Valley BRITE Bus offers fixed-route and on-demand transportation in the Staunton-Augusta-Waynesboro area. Services are administered by the Central Shenandoah Planning District Commission with operational recommendations provided by the BRITE Transit Advisory Committee.

The cost was almost $120. At a local Wal-Mart, it took 45 minutes and $56 to buy supplies for a kindergartner.   Susan Sarkauskas Follow @dh_ssarkauskas     Shopping for school supplies is a rite of passage for parents. Mothers kneel on the floors of stores, pawing through bins for the correct-colored notebooks. Fathers urge daughters to quickly choose between "Frozen" or "Dora the Explorer" backpacks. Strangers commiserate as they hunt. I, a childless outsider, entered the fray, shopping online for items required of the average fourth-grader at Willow Bend Elementary School in Palatine and a typical kindergartner at Western Avenue Elementary School in Geneva. Would it take all day? Would I be able to find everything in one stop? Online For the fourth-grader, it took me 52 minutes to load my shopping cart at officedepot.com. A 120-sheet pack of wide-ruled loose-leaf paper? The choices are 110 sheets or 150 sheets. (I went with the 150). There weren't any yellow notebooks or Ziploc bags in anything close to the desired counts. Or the right brand of pencil box. The $4.49 8-pack of paper folders didn't have all the colors I needed, and the plastic ones cost $1.49 each. The online store was out of single low-odor black dry-erase markers. With tax, the bill came to $119.81, for 111 of the 115 items requested (including 60 pencils). In store Finding the two 24-count packs of Crayola crayons was easy at Wal-Mart. They were right by the entrance. At 50 cents a pack, they were a bargain. But "Crayola Thick & Thin Markers"? I searched the three-aisle display of school supplies for such a combination pack. Then I headed back to "office supplies." Then back to the school display. Then it dawned on me the school probably meant one pack of regular markers and one pack of thin-tipped markers. I despaired of ever finding the prongless poly folders. Pronged, pronged, pronged, pronged, pronged read the boxes. Finally found them in the office supplies area. Watercolors: Size not specified. Eight- or 16-color palette? Feeling generous, I went with 16. Four large Elmer's glue sticks. Two problems: 1. No packages marked "Large." 2. "JUMBO" came only in three-packs. Ziploc heavy-duty gallon-size bags: No count. Does "heavy-duty" mean "freezer?" Two containers of Clorox or Lysol wipes. Again: What count? Dry-erase markers: Broad-tipped wanted. I'm hoping they really meant chisel-tipped. Facial tissue: Has to be a rectangular box. Huh? It took 45 minutes and $56 to outfit the imaginary kindergartner.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business By Darrel Rowland The Columbus Dispatch  •  Sunday August 14, 2016 10:10 AM View Slideshow Request to buy this photo AP Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton (L), and Donald Trump (R) The 10 women on the other side of the one-way mirror looked at Robert Blizzard like he’d just set off a stink bomb. In a way, he had. Blizzard asked those Columbus-area “Wal-Mart moms” for a brief description of how they feel about the 2016 presidential campaign. The words poured out quickly: Worried. Frustrated. Messy. Divided. Ridiculous. Disrespectful. Circus show. And the candidates? “I’m not sure either one is 100 percent qualified,” Donna said. Gidget chimed in, “I feel like no matter which way we choose, we lose.” An exasperated Ivania remarked: “I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now.” The 10 swing voters made up a focus group last week assembled by bipartisan national pollsters to gauge sentiments from “real people” about this year’s election. Columbus, often selected as a test market for products and politicians, was chosen for one gathering. Another was held in Phoenix by the organizers, GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and Democratic pollsters Penn Schoen Berland. “What you saw there in that group is a firsthand observation of what we’re seeing in the (polling) numbers in the state and nation,” said Neil Newhouse, longtime head of the Republican firm that has conducted surveys for numerous Ohio GOP candidates. Newhouse said it’s the most hostile electorate he’s seen since at least 1992, which featured the rise of plain-spoken independent Ross Perot. “These voters are more turned off. They are worried, frustrated, anxious because many of them don’t like either one of their choices.” Newhouse’s company identified “Wal-Mart moms” — mothers without a firm presidential choice who have children younger than 18 and have shopped at the ubiquitous retailer in the past month — as a key voting demographic in 2008. The group, which makes up 14 to 17 percent of the electorate, has been tapped every two years since and proven keen indicators of national voting trends. The Dispatch was allowed to personally observe the Columbus focus group, assembled in an Easton office building, but it could only use first names of participants. The rancorous 2016 campaign even has spread into these women’s families, friends and social networks, leading to harsh exchanges with relatives and significant “de-friending” on social media. Mary said she attended her 40th high school class reunion last weekend, and “I can’t believe how many people were going around talking about politics.” Ruth said, “It’s disgusting how everybody has to choose a side. It’s just crazy.” Dana, one of two African-Americans on the panel, said, “On social media, honestly, I’ve seen a lot of racism.” The women not only shared their repulsion with their presidential choices this year but also provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. For example, Trump was complimented for being confident, outspoken and patriotic. “He says what lot of us are thinking, sometimes,” Gidget said. Maria said, “It would be interesting to have a successful businessman to fix our trade deficit." And the negatives? “I think his weakness is his mouth,” Donna said. “To me, he has no filter.” Anita wondered whether he is racist. And Ruth put it even more succinctly: “He’s just a jerk.” Clinton’s strengths revolved around her government experience and her temperament in contrast to Trump’s. But the women really unloaded on the candidate attempting to become the first female president. “She has a really hard shell around her,” Julie said, calling her “emotionless.” Gidget said, “Historically, everything the Clintons have done have been pushed under the rug." Donna said, “Things come out of her mouth and you don’t know what’s the truth and what’s a lie." To that, Dana added, “I don’t know if she can do anything other than lie.” When asked which one they'd rather have over for a cookout, it was Trump, seven to three. After listening to the 90-minute session, Newhouse said he thinks the common characterization this year of "the angry voter" is misdirected. "I think there is frustration with the direction of the country, but this is not anger," he said. "There’s almost bewilderment that these are the two candidates that are the best the parties have to offer." drowland@dispatch.com @darreldrowland Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Chosen were his award- winning collection of short stories, Encounters With Life — Tales of Living, Loving & Laughter, and his popular mystery novel, The Maidstone Conspiracy. The announcement was made recently by Osborne’s publisher, Solstice Publishing Inc., of Farmington, Missouri. “We don’t know how Walmart makes its choices, or when the books might be listed on their Canadian site, but I’m delighted with the added exposure,” Osborne said, adding that both are available locally at Bookland downtown and Coles in the Village Green Centre. In January, Encounters With Life was named Best Short Story Collection of 2015 in an international poll of readers. In that same poll, readers gave The Maidstone Conspiracy second place as the Best Mystery of 2015. “I must say, it was very flattering to have my books chosen by readers from around the world,” Osborne said. “And now to have two selected for sale by Walmart’s huge online store is amazing.” Osborne is also the author of the bestselling novel The Ultimate Threat, a gripping story about the spread of the religious extremists ISIS. It was the top bestselling thriller novel on Amazon for several weeks following its release in June 2015 by his previous publisher, Endeavour Press Ltd. of London, U.K.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

White by John Sommers II for TT White, who lives about 35 miles south of the Indiana Convention Center where the 79th annual competition was held, also took home the 3-axle class title. "I can't wrap my head around this," White said. "I mean, it's my home state, my home turf. I really wanted to be grand champion, but I tell you, there are so many fantastic drivers here." "After an impressive showing throughout the week, Charles White emerged as the most skilled and knowledgeable truck driver in the country,"  ATA President Chris Spear said. "On behalf of ATA and the trucking community, I want to congratulate Charles and thank the entire field of competitors for participating in these championships. Your commitment to excellence has made the nation's highways a safer place for everyone." White's regional safety manager for Wal-Mart, Jennifer Gray, was on hand and said the honor was well-deserved. "I'm going to buy him a truck. He gets a new semi, whatever color he wants," Gray said. "He's been a great driver forever, but he's just a nice person, too. I think that people just don't know that he has a kind heart. He's very business, he's very professional. He's just an awesome individual."

Bright smile: 2-year-old Haleigh Lanphere developed a bond with JSU's football team By Joe Medley, Star Sports Columnist, jmedley@annistonstar.com Joe Medley Aug 13, 2016 (…) Photo by Stephen Gross / The Anniston Star/File In this file photo, Haleigh Lanphere meets Cocky before Gamecock Walk during the second round JSU vs Chattanooga NCAA playoff game at Jacksonville State. JACKSONVILLE — Haleigh Lanphere fell in love with her red No. 1 Jacksonville State jersey from the moment it caught her eye in Wal-Mart. The toddler who doctors said would never walk or talk because of a rare genetic condition walked into the store, saw the jersey and did her best imitation of seagulls from the movie “Finding Nemo.” “She walked in and said, ‘Mine,’” said Cathy Lanphere, Haleigh’s mother. “We put it in the buggy.” That smiling little girl in the buggy had lots of JSU apparel, from onesies to that jersey. She wore them when she went with her parents to JSU sporting events in her short life. Football, basketball or baseball, she found her way into the hearts of JSU athletes ... and lots of pictures with them. She died July 10 at age 2, after the last of a string of seizures that started June 27, and several JSU football players wear pink or blue #HaleighStrong bracelets in her memory. Her jersey might make one more appearance in JSU Stadium … hoisted by JSU players as they take the field for their Sept. 1 season opener against North Alabama. At least, that’s how her dad envisions the moment, and it just might happen. “We’ll probably hold up something for her first game and do something like that for her,” JSU coach John Grass said. “We’ll definitely miss her.” A Gamecock family Cathy Lanphere acknowledged she wasn’t much of a sports fan, and Chris put JSU on her radar. A Saks High graduate, he grew up following JSU and attended the school between 2002-04. +2  Haleigh Lanphere rides her dad Chris Lanphere's shoulders before Gamecock Walk during the second round JSU vs Chattanooga NCAA playoff game at Jacksonville State. Photo by Stephen Gross / The Anniston Star The two married March 9, 2013, and Chris enticed Cathy to her first JSU football game the following football season, against Jacksonville University. “That was Cathy’s first game because she loves dolphins,” Chris said. “I kind of bribed her with, the team JSU is playing’s mascot is a dolphin.” JSU’s 48-13 victory was the first of many campus visits for Cathy, who came with Chris from their home in Pell City. “He’s always wanting me to watch them play, practice and everything,” Cathy said. Haleigh was born at 2 a.m. Nov. 16 that same year, the day JSU lost 52-14 at Eastern Illinois. The Gamecocks lost a game that day but gained a fan. The family attended JSU sporting events year-round. Football, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball … they were more than there. She got her first basketball at a JSU game and seemed to love going to games at Pete Mathews Coliseum. “She would have a field day. We got messages from a couple of the girls’ players about how they used to love seeing her in the stands every time they played. Some of the guys loved watching her grow.” Haleigh wanted to get close to Rudy Abbott Field and get high-fives from players before baseball games. “Any time I’d walk past her, I’d always reach out and give her a high-five,” said JSU senior Gavin Golsan, who just finished his baseball eligibility and came out for football. “She’d be grinning ear to ear and slap my hand.” Haleigh felt just as at home in JSU Stadium for football games. She would take in tailgating, meet Cocky, JSU’s mascot, and watch “Cock Walk,” as JSU players walked to the stadium. Her first JSU exposure was a football game, and she brought her game face. “She was watching the (Marching) Southerners pregame, and I remember trying to play with her,” Chris said. “She would just give me the meanest look, and then she would look back over.” +2  Offensive lineman Blake Burks with 2-year-old Haleigh Lanphere, who died July 10. Courtesy photo Haleigh also collected high-fives. Her father had her stationed along the fence, near where players entered the field for pregame warmups and exited after games. She’d call players whose names she didn’t know “Hey.” She made friends closer to her own age, including Kaydon Jenkins. “Any time my son was around and she was around, they’d play together a lot,” said JSU quarterback Eli Jenkins, who wears a pink #HaleighStrong bracelet on his left wrist. Jenkins took cell-phone pictures of the two playing, and other players posed for pictures with Haleigh. One shows two big linemen, 2015 seniors Blake Burks and Kyron Samuels, posing with her after JSU’s victory over Southeast Missouri State. “You could tell she was a great kid, and her parents loved her to death,” Jenkins said. Wide receiver Josh Barge described Haleigh as “strong.” “You knew something was wrong with her, but she never showed it,” he said. “It was kind of life-changing.” #HaleighStrong Haleigh’s challenges started with 16p13.11 microdeletion, which rarechromo.org describes as “a very rare genetic condition in which a tiny piece is missing from one of the 46 chromosomes — chromosome 16.” Doctors discovered the condition after Haleigh’s newborn screen came back abnormal. “She was the 34th one ever found like that,” Cathy said. Effects can vary, even between family members. Not everyone shows effects. Common features include delay in learning to sit, move and walk; delays in starting to speak and language development; and increased risk of developing seizures. “They told us she’d never walk,” Chris said. “They told us she’d never talk. They told us she would have a learning disability.” Haleigh also had aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the valve in the large blood vessel branching off the heart. “Other than that, they (doctors) really weren’t concerned with anything until she started having her seizures,” Cathy said. Those started June 27, Cathy said, and Haleigh’s parents noticed changes. Their daughter had shortness of breath more easily and didn’t want to play. “She’d just lay around, and she didn’t want to do anything,” Cathy said. “She wasn’t acting like herself. She wasn’t her go-go-go personality. She’d just want to sit there and lay there. She just wanted to be held.” Doctors also found enlargement of the right side of Haleigh’s heart, Cathy said. They were trying to find the cause and had scheduled a heart catheterization for July 15. Haleigh had a seizure July 10, prompting paramedics take her to Children’s Hospital in Birmingham. Cathy rode in the front of the ambulance, and Chris trailed it. “Somewhere, right before the exit for St. Vincent’s East, I don’t know what happened to her,” Cathy said. “He just yelled from the back, ‘Get to the nearest hospital.’ They wouldn’t let me back there. “We don’t know what happened from the time we left the driveway until the time she got to the hospital. They don’t know. They just know that her heart stopped, and she fought for two-and-a-half hours.” Reactions, tributes Haleigh’s death was felt from Pell City to the JSU Gamecock Fieldhouse. “We’ve gotten so many messages from people that go to JSU or people that were on the football team or basketball team,” Chris said, a tear streaming down the right side of his face. “‘Your little girl was such an inspiration. Her smile was just so contagious, her little sassy attitude.’ “They said, most of all, even though she had all of these different problems, she was always smiling. A lot of people would tell us, that’s what gets us through the day now. Whenever we’re having a bad day, we would think about here and all of her smiles, and all the bad days just go away.” The Lanpheres had #HaleighStrong bracelets made in blue and pink, and several JSU players have them. Some have more than one. Grass said he admires how Haleigh “battled.” “She battled hard, and it was good to see a smile on a little girl’s face at that age,” he said. “I think that’s what the game brings. It brings a smile on all kids’ faces, but especially a kid in her situation. “She’s definitely a part of us.” Golsan, who shared high-fives with Haleigh at the backstop, had looked forward to doing the same at the gate to Burgess-Snow Field. “Everybody is still mourning her loss, but we know she’s watching over us,” he said. “Chris and Cathy are great people. I’m sure they’re still going to be here supporting, and Haleigh is going to be watching us.” Sports Columnist Joe Medley: 256-235-3576. On Twitter: @jmedley_star.

Rachel Aldrich Aug 15, 2016 5:18 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up in after-hours trading on Monday as Berkshire Hathaway (BKR.A) upped its stake in the company by 55%, CNBC reports.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held 15.2 million shares of Apple as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Three months earlier, the Omaha-based company held 9.8 million shares. The company's Apple stake was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30, Bloomberg noted. Berkshire also reduced its Walmart (WMT) stake to 40.2 million shares from 55.2 million. (Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of his holdings with a free trial.)  Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings rated this stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of B. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now It's starting.  San Antonio-based H-E-B/Central Market just made another big leap into the Dallas-Fort Worth market with the purchase of six Sun Fresh Market stores. The state's largest independent grocery chain has purchased four Dallas stores in Uptown, Lake Highlands, Lakewood and Northwest Dallas.  Two more stores are in McKinney and Grapevine.  Sun Fresh is in the process of closing these stores. The stores have only been operated as Sun Fresh Markets for about a year.  The transaction will be completed in a few weeks, said H-E-B/Central Market spokeswoman Mabrie Jackson. "We're thrilled to have these properties." The four Dallas stores are former  Albertsons stores. The McKinney and Grapevine stores were Tom Thumb locations. These six stores are among a batch of stores that Albertsons was forced  to sell as part of an antitrust review of its 2015 acquisition of Tom Thumb's parent company Safeway. H-E-B  isn't sure yet how it plans to use the stores.  "At this time, Central Market continues to be the primary format for the Dallas-Fort Worth," said Todd Piland, H-E-B executive vice president of real estate. "We are currently evaluating the feasibility of each site to determine the most effective use of the properties." But still there will be speculation about whether any stores might become H-E-B or Central Market.  It could take several months for these stores to reopen. The stores are located at: -- McKinney  - Hardin Boulevard and El Dorado Parkway -- Grapevine  - State Highway 121 and Hall Johnson Road -- Dallas - McKinney Avenue and Lemmon Avenue -- Dallas - Northwest Highway and Midway Road -- Dallas - Northwest Highway and Ferndale Road -- Dallas - Mockingbird Lane and Abrams Road H-E-B has been buying up land in recent years, but these are the first buildings the retailer has purchased with one exception. A few years ago, Central Market, bought the former Borders Bookstore at the southeast corner of Preston Road and Royal Lane in Preston Hollow and converted it.  H-E-B owns about 20 parcels of land in the North Texas region, including in Allen, Carrollton, Corinth, Dallas, DeSoto, Fort Worth, Frisco, Grand Prairie, Mansfield, McKinney, Murphy and Plano. This acquisition puts H-E-B into more established Dallas neighborhoods in addition to the two fast growing suburbs of McKinney and Grapevine. It operates two Central Market stores in Dallas and one each in Plano, Southlake and Fort Worth.   The H-E-B stores are south of Dallas and Fort Worth in Burleson, Cleburne, Corsicana, Granbury, Ennis and Waxahachie.  "We are evaluating the feasibility of each property acquired in this real estate transaction as part of our long term real estate investment portfolio," Jackson said.  But a move into Dallas with its traditional grocery store is something that competitors have expected for a longtime. Today, H-E-B, which dominates in the state with Wal-Mart, only has a 1.9 percent market share in the Dallas area.  Last year, H-E-B reached the top of the Houston market and this year it widened that lead to a 23.5 percent share. It grew larger than former leaders there, Kroger and Wal-Mart.  H-E-B has taken a different approach to the Dallas market. It first opened in Houston in the 1990s with small 20,000-square-foot Pantry stores. In the 2000s, it started building its larger H-E-B stores there. Ray Schalek, of RLS Supermarkets of Carrollton, approached H-E-B about selling the six stores. In June, RLS sold 11 stores to Houston-based Fiesta Mart. Those stores are in the process of being converted to Fiesta Mart. RLS will still operate the Sun Fresh store at 7007 Arapaho Road in Far North Dallas and two Cash Saver stores in southern Dallas at at 2130 East Ledbetter and 1201 W. Camp Wisdom, Schalek said.  The longtime San Angelo grocer, moved into the Dallas market in 2011 with the purchase of  what was left of the Minyard Food Store chain from a Fort Worth investment firm. He declined to comment on his decision to give up on the Dallas-Fort Worth market at least with the former Minyard, Albertsons and Tom Thumb stores that he converted into Sun Fresh Markets in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth is one of the most competitive markets in the U.S. Not having a big corporate organization behind him likely made it harder to operate here.  Twitter: @MariaHalkias Related links:  Texas' heavyweight food fight: H-E-B vs. Wal-Mart in Lone Star grocery war Can D-FW grocery stores compete with growing 'basket bandits' threat?

Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recent recovery. Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety. Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the economy and corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 59.58 points or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The S&P’s 500 index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The Nasdaq composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02. Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in, with this week’s releases from Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter and investors don’t expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they are starting to expect improvement after that. U.S. crude jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London. After a steep slide for most of June and July, the price of U.S. crude gained 6.4 percent last week. Drilling rig operator Transocean added 53 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $10.43. National Oilwell Varco picked up $1.04, or 3.1 percent, to $34.85 and ConocoPhillips rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $42.18. Utility companies took the largest losses, as Southern Co. declined 86 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.49 and Consolidated Edison sank $1.88, or 2.4 percent, to $76.24. Phone companies and household goods makers also slipped. Real estate investment trust Mid-America Apartment Communities will buy competitor Post Properties for about $3.9 billion in stock. Both companies own large numbers of rental properties, and demand for rentals has boomed in recent years because many people are being priced out of the housing market. The deal values Post Properties at about $72.53 a share based on Friday’s closing prices. The stock rose $5.86, or 9.4 percent, to $68.08 and Mid-America stock lost $5, or 4.9 percent, to $97.15. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil gained 4 cents to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas held steady at $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $4.30 to $1,347.50 an ounce. Silver advanced 14 cents to $19.85 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.15 a pound. The dollar fell to 101.25 yen from 101.27 yen and the euro rose to $1.1183 from $1.1164. Japan’s economy grew at a lower-than-forecast 0.2 percent pace in the April-June quarter, as private demand and exports remained weak. That could push the Bank of Japan to take additional steps to stimulate the national economy. The bank approved a new stimulus package earlier this month, but that wasn’t enough to please investors. Germany’s DAX was up 0.2 percent and the CAC 40 of France dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.7 percent.

News Hain Celestial Crashes On Earnings Delay, Miss On Accounting Woes Hain Celestial tumbled early Tuesday Monday on accounting issues that will delay quarterly results. (Hain Celestial) ED CARSON 8/16/2016 Reprints Hain Celestial (HAIN) lost more than a fourth of its value Tuesday after the organic and natural foods maker late Monday delayed its fiscal Q4 financial results due to accounting concerns. Hain also said it would likely miss its prior fiscal 2016 guidance. Hain Celestial, which supplies Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart (WMT) and other grocers, said revenue recognition was at issue. Hain said in a statement: "During the fourth quarter, the Company identified concessions that were granted to certain distributors in the United States. The Company is currently evaluating whether the revenue associated with those concessions was accounted for in the correct period and is also currently evaluating its internal control over financial reporting." Hain had been set to report fiscal Q4 results on Tuesday. Hain will also delay its annual 10-K SEC filing. And don't expect good news when results are finally released: "The Company does not expect to achieve its previously announced guidance for fiscal year 2016." Hain Celestial fell 26.3% by the closing bell to 39.35 on the stock market today, tumbling to a 5-month low intraday and plunging below the 50-day line. IBD'S TAKE: "Accounting" is rarely a word that investors want to hear. But expect to hear it often as the SEC is set to enact big changes to revenue recognition rules. For due diligence you should learn more about the SEC revenue rule and how everyone from AT&T to Microsoft is bracing for it.   ED CARSON | Facebook | @IBD_ECarson Share this: Related news A federal judge blocked President Obama's new overtime rule, but Wal-Mart already gave managers a raise.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index rose from last month.

That’s more than the next seven countries combined and 10 times the budget of the State Department. Today on Think, Krys Boyd talked with Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks about how the U.S. has blurred the line between war and peace time. She’s the author of “How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything: Tales from the Pentagon.” The KERA Interview Listen Listening... / Rosa Brooks on … … the growth of the military: “There are more members of military marching bands than there are of foreign service officers of the State Department. The State Department cannot compete when the military moves into areas. It’s just too tiny and too underfunded. And the less it does, the more political leaders turn to the military to take on the tasks that state and USAID once would have done. And the more the military does, the less anybody needs those civilian agencies.” … how the military is like Wal-Mart: “Instead of having to go to five different stores, if you’re saying, ‘Gee, what can we do in Afghanistan?’ And you’re thinking well we want to do some agricultural reform and we need to fight these remaining Taliban groups here and there, and we also need to train judges and parliamentarians and so forth, you can go to the military and say, ‘Just get all this stuff done.’ And the military will say, ‘OK, we’ll get all that stuff done.’ They may not do it that well. It may not be the highest quality, not because they’re not smart people, but because this is not what military people have been trained to do.”    … the casualties of drone warfare: “The Obama administration said that in almost eight years there have only been a handful of civilian casualties, 150, something like that. Other groups, journalists and human rights groups, say that number is vastly higher - possibly even in the thousands. In explaining that your either have to think that the government is lying, which I don’t think is what’s going on, or you have to assume that when the Obama administration and journalists and NGOs talk about civilians they mean something that’s very, very different. And I think this is the profound problem with the process: That at the moment we don’t really know what counts as war anymore. We don’t know who counts as any enemy.”   … why it’s difficult to cut military spending: “It sometimes seems like everybody in Congress has either a military base or a weapons manufacturing industry in their district, which in turn means that everybody wants that [military spending] to continue because it’s good for their constituents.

CBS affiliate KENS Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email HELOTES, Texas -- A 7-month-old baby boy died Friday after being left in a hot car outside a Texas WalMart, reports CBS affiliate KENS. The baby's father, who is an employee at the store, apparently left the boy in the car when he arrived at work at 6:15 a.m. on Friday, according to Helotes Police Department Capt. Anthony Burges. The baby was supposed to be taken to a day care in the morning, but the employee told police he forgot. The temperature hovered around 100 degrees for much of the afternoon. A witness noticed the baby in the car at 3:09 p.m. Friday and called 911. When police arrived, they found the father banging on the side of the car, trying to get inside. The baby was already dead, police said. Police have not charged the man in his baby's death. A baby in Pennsylvania survived a similar case, in which she was left inside a car outside a Target store Sunday, reports CBS Philly. In that case, an off-duty Philadelphia police officer rescued the infant after seeing her locked inside the car in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. Authorities say the officer managed to free the baby from the car, which police said reached more than 110 degrees inside. The baby was treated at a hospital and released to her mother. Her aunt and grandmother were each charged with endangering the welfare of a child. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

By Maui Now Posted August 15, 2016, 11:36 AM HST 3 Comments Text Size: A A A Text Size: A A A × Maui Now stock image. August 2016. Mayor Alan Arakawa answers some of the questions submitted to his office staff. Submit your own questions about County of Maui programs, services, operations or policies to Mayor Alan Arakawa via email at AskTheMayor@mauicounty.gov, call 270-7855 or send them by mail to 200 S. High St., 9th Floor, Wailuku, HI 96793. Questions submitted will be considered for inclusion in the “Ask the Mayor” column. Aloha Mr. Arakawa, Q: I have observed couple campaign signs (same candidate) in an odd location—”private property” at the Kahului Walmart Driveway and parking lot driveway to the Panda Express drive-through. I have no problem with the candidate, but it seems unfair that he has monopolized the Walmart driveway and parking lot. Is this allowed or acceptable? ADVERTISEMENT Also, are those signs of approved size? A: I’ve been informed that the sign in question is located on private property and that the candidate received permission from the property owner to post the sign. As long as the signs are on private property and receive permission to be posted, and meet the size limitation of no more than 18 square feet, then they are allowed in any zoning district. > NEXT STORY Ask the Mayor: What's With the Increase in Abandoned Vehicles? < PREVIOUS STORY Ask the Mayor: What Can Be Done About Peahi Forest Trash?

 After 2 years of Amazon Prime, here's why I switched to Jet.com Gus Lubin Aug. 15, 2016, 4:07 PM 25,243 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jet.com Don't think you'd ever quit Amazon Prime? I felt the same way until I tried out its competitor Jet.com. Now, after two years of Prime membership, I'm cutting loose. Prime membership, which costs $99 yearly, gives you free two-day shipping on countless items along with complimentary access to a bunch of streaming content, cloud storage, and more. More than 63 million Americans pay for the service, with 91% of first-year subscribers sticking around for a second year. "We want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders. Jet, a year-old site that was bought by Walmart for $3 billion, doesn't have as many items as Amazon, nor any user reviews, nor any of those bonus features. It does, however, offer competitive and often cheaper prices on a wide array of popular items, with free two-day shipping on orders over $35 — all without any annual fee. It also lets you buy groceries (in some zip codes) — something Amazon members can only with a $299 Prime Fresh membership. How much cheaper is Jet? The upstart beat the giant on 73% of overlapping products, according to a Boomerang Commerce study last fall. Jet discounts increase if you buy related items, as the service determines what products can be shipped from the same place, and if you select options like paying by debit card and declining the right to return. Jet is typically around 5% cheaper than Amazon, founder Marc Lore told Recode. I quit Prime after realizing I could get most items cheaper on Jet, and that I didn't really need Prime's other features. Having to spend $35 to get free shipping didn't deter me, since it's easy to hit that limit when you can buy groceries too. The lack of reviews is annoying, but it's easy enough to look up reviews on Amazon and then buy on Jet. The smaller selection of products isn't the end of the world, as Jet has most things I need, and I can always go over to Amazon when it doesn't. As for the lack of streaming content, I don't love Amazon Prime video enough to pay for it — not when I already have Netflix with my eye on HBO — and I don't use Amazon Cloud Drive, not when I'm already paying Apple and Google for cloud storage. Will many other Prime members realize there's another way? Only time will tell. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Brands, Inc. Preps for China Split, Hikes Dividend (YUM) Recent Posts: McDonald’s Corporation Shakes Up C-Suite to Revive Sales (MCD) Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Has a Chance to Outperform After Earnings Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Bound to Fall Harder View All Posts With FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) stock trading about flat over the past twelve months, against 5% gains for the S&P 500 Index, FDX hasn’t delivered the goods investors expected. FDX stock underperformed, thanks to a challenged industry with muddied prospects as global growth has weakened both the air delivery and freight industry. But that’s all about to change. Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) announced Thursday it will close 100 stores, or about 15% of its 728 locations. Without question, this is a sound move for the embattled retailer since it will help Macy’s become not only leaner, but — at the same time — allow it to focus on the e-commerce side of the business to help lessen the damage done by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). While Macy’s received a standing ovation with 14% rise in its stock price, the market ignored what this decision could mean for FedEx stock. The extinction path of the brick-and-mortar retail model is accelerating. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) acquisition of Jet.com earlier this week was the latest confirmation that e-commerce is the new growth driver. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Pop 10% or More I expect the likes of J.C. Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) to mimic Macy’s decision to rely less on shopping malls and more on higher-margin omni-channel models. And as this shift in retail unfolds, it raises FedEx’s growth capabilities, which in turn makes FDX stock a must-own equity. Why FedEx stock? Aside from the fact that global e-commerce is already growing at double-digit rates, FedEx recently closed on its $4.8 billion acquisition of TNT Express, giving it more scale across the globe, especially in Europe. Plus, adding TNT’s capabilities to will help FedEx distance itself from its competitors since it will have more pricing power from its broaden network. And this should have a boosting effect on FedEx stock, especially from an operating margin perspective. FedEx’s ongoing expansion of the Ground network and its Express fleet’s planned aircraft deliveries is another reason the company is more adequately prepared to capitalize on the e-commerce boom. Thanks to the dominance of Amazon, retailers have no choice but to shutter low-performing stores, meaning more investments in direct-to-consumer. Bottom Line on FDX Stock FedEx is projected to grow earnings at an average rate of about 11% annually for the next five years, which now seems too low. Not to mention, FDX stock is priced at just 12 time fiscal 2017 estimates of $13.47 per share, compared with a forward price-earnings ratio of 17 for the S&P 500. Home Depot Inc: Earnings Will Make HD Stock a Market-Beater This means not only is FDX stock erroneously undervalued, the market is also ignoring the growth potential that exist from the ongoing shift in the retail space. Not to mention the boost FDX stock will get from greater efficiencies from TNT Express. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Skip to main content Research Events Publications Commentary Store Support About Cato Blog Our Experts Our Centers Facebook Twitter Search form Search this site Commentary How Safe Are We? Asking the Right Questions about Terrorism By John Mueller and Mark G. Stewart This article appeared on Foreign Affairs on August 15, 2016. “Are we safer?” might be the most common question asked about terrorism, but it is the wrong one. A better place to begin is with this question: “How safe are we?” In evaluating the threat from terrorism, it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that, although such violence presents a concern for the United States, the scope of the hazard is so limited that it is a considerable stretch to even label it a “threat.” For a time, of course, this perspective was severely challenged by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which inflicted damage that was decidedly not limited. If attacks like that had become common, even routine, everything would have changed. But it didn’t. Although “we can’t have another 9/11” remains a conversation stopper, that event remains an extreme outlier: scarcely any terrorist deed before or since has visited even one-tenth as much destruction, even in war zones where terrorist groups have plenty of space and time to plot and assemble. Much of the public fear about terrorism centers on the possibility that radical groups, particularly al Qaeda, might acquire nuclear weapons — the imminent danger of which we have been warned about for 15 years. However, no terrorist group has gotten anywhere near going atomic, and, even more telling, none seems to have really even tried. In the years since 9/11, Islamist terrorists have managed to kill about seven people a year within the United States. All those deaths are tragic of course, but some comparisons are warranted: lightning kills about 46 people a year, accident-causing deer another 150, and drownings in bathtubs around 300. In the years since 9/11, Islamist terrorists have managed to kill about seven people a year within the United States. During that period, al Qaeda Central’s achievements have been rather meager, even taking into consideration that it has been isolated and under siege. An analysis of the major terrorist plots against the West since 9/11 finds only two — the attempted shoe bombing in 2001 and the effort to blow up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs in 2006 — that could be said to have been under the command and control of al Qaeda Central, and there are questions about how full its control was even in these two instances. What’s more, both plots failed miserably. There have also been a few attempts by al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen. The most notable is the underwear bomber of 2009, who was outfitted by a Yemeni who is constantly called a “master bomb-maker” with a device that was almost impossible to detonate and (like the shoe bomb) far too small to bring down the airliner if it had gone off. Al Qaeda has been quite good, however, at issuing videos threatening violence. Thus, it was over a decade ago that bin Laden denied that the “delay” in carrying out operations in the United States was “due to failure to breach your security measures” and then ominously revealed that “operations are under preparation, and you will see them on your own ground once they are finished, God willing.” God, apparently, has not been willing. It is possible to argue, of course, that there actually is a terrorist threat and that the damage committed by jihadists since 9/11 is so low because “American defensive measures are working,” as the journalist Peter Bergen wrote in his book United States of Jihad. Although these measures should be given some credit, it is not at all clear that they have made a great deal of difference. To begin with, one can look at the dozens of plots by Islamist extremists, many of them inspired by al Qaeda, seeking to commit terrorism in the United States. A few of these have been carried out, but most have been rolled up by authorities. In general, the capacities of the people involved are singularly unimpressive. A summary assessment by RAND’s Brian Jenkins is apt: “their numbers remain small, their determination limp, and their competence poor.” Indeed, most of these plots were at best embryonic or facilitated by infiltrating FBI operatives — as in the case of the Rochester panhandler who planned in the name of ISIS to wreak havoc at a local restaurant (where he had been treated with less than full courtesy) with a machete bought for him at Walmart by one of the three FBI operatives who had formed something of a cell around him. Left on their own, it is certainly possible that a few of the plotters would have been able to get their acts together and actually do something. But it seems unlikely that the total damage would increase by anywhere near enough to suggest that terrorism is something that could justifiably be said to present a threat. In addition to those prosecuted on terrorism charges, authorities have encountered a considerable number of loud-mouthed aspirational terrorists within the United States, and, lacking enough evidence to convict them on terrorism charges, the authorities have levied lesser ones to jail or deport them. For the most part, these plots or aspirations are even less likely to lead to notable violence than the ones that have led to terrorism trials. Further, the bulk of people who are jailed on terrorism-associated prosecutions serve short terms and, accordingly, are soon set free to commit terrorism if they want to do so. Yet, none have attempted to do so. Nor is it likely that much terrorism has been deterred by security measures. Extensive and very costly security measures may have taken some targets — commercial airliners and military bases, for example — off the list for just about all terrorists. However, no dedicated would-be terrorist should have much difficulty finding other potential targets if the goal is to kill people or destroy property to make a statement — the country is filled with these. And, even though billions of foreigners have entered the United States legally since 2001, al Qaeda appears to have been unable to smuggle in any operatives at all. No-fly lists and other security measures have doubtless contributed to that agreeable result, but the perfect success rate rather suggests inadequacy or lack of dedication on the part of the terrorist organization as well. Europe is clearly more accessible to the Middle East, but terrorism there during the al Qaeda period was mostly quite limited, and there were no major attacks for a full decade after 2005. We have now endured a decade and a half in which it has been confidently, authoritatively, and repeatedly proclaimed that al Qaeda presents an existential threat to the United States (or even to the world system or civilization as we know it). It is time that such serial alarmists were questioned about their extravagant proclamations rather than being given ever more air time. This is all the more important given that history may now be repeating itself with the Islamic State (ISIS), the vicious insurgent group in Iraq and Syria. Americans have decided that the group constitutes a major problem. A poll conducted in the spring of 2016 asked the 83 percent of its respondents who said they closely followed news stories about ISIS whether the group presented “a serious threat to the existence or survival of the US.” A full 77 percent agreed — more than two-thirds of them strongly. And over the last year, people apparently inspired by ISIS did kill 63 in attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando — a bit more than lightning during the same period and far more people than other Islamist extremists killed in the United States in the entire decade and a half after 9/11. However, such attacks are unlikely to become common, and the appeal of ISIS is decidedly on the wane. After its heady advances in the Middle East in 2014 and early 2015, ISIS now appears to be in considerable disarray. The flow of foreign fighters may have dropped by 90 percent, and the group has progressively been losing territory. Indeed, there are strong indications that, two years after proclaiming its caliphate and the start of a glorious new epoch, the group is preparing its supporters for the possibility, even likelihood, of total territorial collapse. Meanwhile, continuous failure on the battlefield is having a dampening effect on enthusiasm and recruitment — the group no longer projects jihadist cool. By one count, there were two plots by locals to commit terrorism in the United States in 2014, neither of them ISIS-related. In 2015, the figure rose to 19, of which 14 were ISIS-related — that is, both plots related to and unrelated to ISIS increased very significantly. Thus far in 2016, however, there have been but two (both ISIS-related). In addition, the FBI reports that the trend for Americans seeking to join ISIS is decidedly downward. ISIS has a “genius for making enemies,” Georgetown Professor Daniel Byman noted in a recent essay. In its decline, it has extended its perfect record by encouraging and then celebrating acts that are profoundly mindless (to put it oxymoronically) such as slitting the throat of an 85-year-old French priest. But the damage its inspirees commit is likely to remain limited, if tragic and disgusting. Even if all the terrible outrages committed in Europe in 2015 are taken to be ISIS-related, far more people on that continent perished yearly at the hands of terrorists in most years in the 1970s and 1980s. The continent was scarcely imperiled. However, as with al Qaeda, the incentives are to play to the galleries: if 77 percent of the people appear to be convinced that ISIS presents “a serious threat to the existence or survival of the US,” there is likely to be considerably more purchase in servicing the notion than in seeking to counter it. You’ll get plenty of air time. Tweet Like Submit Plus John Mueller is a political scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute..

Weighing the Options. Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? Weighing the Options. August 15, 2016 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Politics, Weekly Columns 3 Comments Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 21 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Which candidate should progressives support in 2016? It depends a bit on your priorities. If you care more about socialized medicine than you do about peace, honesty, and civil liberties, vote for Hillary. The rest of this essay is not for you. If you long to bring back the blue collar heyday of the 1950s by forming a national picket line, and can live with bringing back some of the racism of the 1950s, vote for Trump. The rest of this essay is not for you either. But if you really care about civil liberties, if you want to end the Drug war, if you want black lives to matter to the government, you need to go third party. The question is which party: Green or Libertarian? Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? Ideologically, I assume most of you reading this are closer to Stein. I will not attempt to change your mind. (I will, however, call attention to the substantial overlap in positions.) Political campaigns are not shopping trips, however. You don’t get exactly what you want. Political campaigns are about building coalitions to affect laws. Some compromise is inevitable. In a typical election year, a third party campaign is mainly about sending a message. The metric of a campaign is thus: (quality of message) * (loudness of megaphone) Dr. Stein is getting plenty of news hits. I assume that she is as good or better a speaker than Governor Johnson (this isn’t hard!). So, for most of you reading this, Jill Stein wins handily by this metric. But this not a typical election year! Both major party candidates are incredibly unlikeable. Hillary Clinton would be in court or in jail if she were a notch or two less powerful. Donald Trump has serious personality issues, and has basically led a Know-Nothing takeover of the Republican Party. A third party candidate could actually win this year. So for this year the metric has an additional term: (quality of platform) * (probability of victory) In a later section, I will make the case that the probability of victory factor is easily an order of magnitude higher for Gary Johnson than for Jill Stein. But first, let us look at the quality of platform. Gary Johnson has been making a big deal over the I Side With quiz. When he took it, he agreed most with himself (Duh!), but next in line was Bernie Sanders! Take the quiz yourself and see how his answers compare to yours. If they are closer to you than the answers of Hillary or The Donald, then the “quality of platform” factor above is likely positive. You will, of course, need to adjust according to your own issue priorities. For those who don’t want to take the quiz, or don’t trust the results, I’ll list areas where Johnson is solidly progressive: For legalizing marijuana (he was for it long before it was cool) Again crony capitalism For marriage equality Against aggressive foreign intervention For civil liberties in general Governor Johnson is greener than the typical Libertarian. (This is important, as Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard were not eco friendly!) He is an avid outdoorsman, into skiing, triathlons, other extreme sports, and has climbed the highest mountain on all seven continents. We are looking at a possible second Teddy Roosevelt here. And yes, he has consciously parted with libertarian orthodoxy to use his executive powers against polluters where citizen torts weren’t up to the task. On the mixed side, Johnson is a fan of the Fair Tax. If you are anti-globalization/anti-WTO, this is something for you to like. The Fair Tax hits imports and locally made products equally. Expect to see Wal Mart lose some business and some shuttered factories to reopen. Since the Fair Tax is brain dead simple, smaller business gain some relative advantage with respect to the big mega-corporations. On the downside, the Fair Tax would allow the rich to compound retained earnings for generations before paying tax. Ouch! There are mitigating factors, however. Johnson is a deficit hawk, and federal deficit spending is a subsidy for the Old Money Rich. Also, a consumption tax acts as a brain dead simple tax deferral for ordinary savers. Working class Americans won’t have to hire expensive financial advisors or go to Wall St. to take advantage of the tax system. They will be able to save tax deferred for anything: college, house down payment, medical emergencies, long vacation, car, sharks with lasers, whatever. And with the income tax gone, people will pay off their homes quicker, giving the investor class one less source of easy income. (I have mixed feelings about the Fair Tax. I like the simplicity and some of the good features above. I also wonder about enforcement issues, and thus I am working on my own tax reform proposals.) This Fair Tax fandom can lead to two hugely important things for progressives: a universal basic income and a carbon tax. The original Fair Tax creators included a small basic income; they call it a “prebate” and mean it to replace the personal exemption, standard deduction and lower tax brackets for the working poor. This could be a foot-in-the-door for something more substantial. A national sales tax would also be a sales tax on fossil fuels. Given the low profit margins of the energy companies, and the high revenue/labor factor, a national sales tax might well act as a carbon tax. (I’ll leave this as a question for the trained economists in the audience.) It would definitely be a tax increase on imported oil. Once again, we have a foot-in-the-door opportunity. As I mentioned above, a high national sales tax has enforcement problems. It’s too easy to just sell in cash and not report it to the government. But it is very hard to hide an oil tanker, a refinery, or a trainload of coal! Excise taxes on fossil fuels are an easy way to tax the economy via a few collection points. Here’s the kicker, Gary Johnson said he was open to a universal basic income to simplify the welfare system, and he’d consider a carbon tax as well. Some support and pressure from enviro-progressives could do interesting things” But you won’t get socialized medicine under a Johnson Administration, so adjust your quality-of-platform factor accordingly. If either Jill Stein or Gary John (or both) get in the debates, many undecided voters will change their minds. Hillary Clinton is shrill, unlikeable, and untrustworthy. Donald Trump is a clownish super villain. Even though Johnson is bashful and not bubbling with charisma, he easily wins votes against this pair. Dr. Stein may have a more winning personality. I admit I haven’t done my homework here. But Johnson has several qualities that give him a factor of ten edge in terms of winnability: 1. Both Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld are former governors. Americans have long considered state governor to be useful experience for becoming President. In terms of resume, the Libertarian ticket beats both the Green and Republican tickets. 2. The Libertarian Party will have more ballot access. The LP has some hardcore activists who are willing to drop everything and travel a thousand miles to stand in front of grocery stores to gather signatures. Nobody else has such a devoted and experienced cadre in this area. 3. The Never Trump movement is for real. National Review ran an entire issue against Trump, and at least least one article endorsing Johnson. Red State has run multiple front page articles endorsing Johnson. Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush are on the record as Never Trump, and Romney came very close to endorsing the LP ticket. (He said he would have if Weld was at the top.) Several Republican state legislators and political consultants have come out for the Johnson/Weld ticket as well as one sitting Congressman to date. This a substantial voting block available to Johnson but not at all available to Jill Stein. The Never Trump Republicans would vote for Hillary before Jill Stein. Successful electoral politics is about building coalitions, not about simply voicing your wish list. Usually it is the Libertarians who fail to make this distinction, but not this year. Let’s compare potential coalitions: Jill Stein: Burned Bernie voters + Not-Hillary Democrats + hardcore Greens + independents disgusted with the major party candidates and charmed by Dr. Stein’s personality. Gary Johnson: Burned Bernie voters + libertarians + Never Trump Republicans + independents disgusted with the major party candidates and impressed with Johnson’s record and/or personality. Even if Johnson wins a smaller portion of the Burned Bernie voters, this is still a much bigger potential coalition. The core of the Democratic Party is behind Hillary. There are few not-Hillary Democrats other than the Burned Bernie voters. It would take a truly colossal scandal, on the order of Hillary Clinton kidnapping Dalmatian puppies to make a fur coat, in order for Dr. Stein to have a winning coalition. Or a major health breakdown might also work. This is possible. Hillary is getting old. Some bloggers claim to see evidence. Whether they are right or engaging in wishful thinking is an exercise I leave to the reader. The Never Trump Republicans, on the other hand are a proven factor in this election. And Johnson has an edge with non-ideological independents. Such independents really, really, really, care about resume issues. I have learned this the hard way trying to sell candidates on ideology alone. Johnson is a successful businessman, governor, and athlete. (On the downside, he has smoked pot — but so have most Americans under 60.) Here’s the big trump card in the Stein vs. Johnson calculation: if Jill Stein wins a few electoral votes — enough to deny either major party candidate a majority — Trump wins. If Johnson wins but a few electoral votes, he may well become the next President of the United States. Here’s why: If no one wins a majority in the Electoral College, the decision goes to the House of Representatives. In this case the House votes by state. The Republicans control an overwhelming majority of state delegations. The odds of the Republicans going for Stein are tiny indeed. Donald Trump is the likely winner, with Hillary Clinton a distant second. If Johnson is the third place winner, he might well win in the House. The Never Trump movement is for real. The Donald has personally insulted many Republican House members including Speaker Ryan. We already have the first Republican Congressman endorsing Gary Johnson. A combination of Never Trump Republicans plus some Democrats could give Johnson a majority. All it takes is some rationalizations about Trump being “temperamentally unfit for office” for Republican Congresscritters to pick Johnson over Trump despite popular vote totals. The odds of a Johnson victory are easily a factor of ten higher than a Jill Stein victory. Take this into consideration when you decide who to support.

Gary will bring the two polarized parties together. (Republican Governor of Blue State – twice)And he has no scandals. He tells the truth even if we don’t like it. And he’s intelligent. Takes no corporate money. He’s against War. He want’s jobs back here, so the low or nonexistent Corporate tax (they don’t pay it anyway with their loopholes and being out of the Country) Jobs will be here and there won’t be such a great need for trade deals. Do you really want a beholden liar or psychotic running the country. And, he liked his healthcare so much as Governor – he offered it to everyone in his State as an option. Larry says: August 15, 2016 at 3:17 pm Excellent article. Both Gary Johnson and Bernie Sanders platform are: Anti-war non-interventionism Anti-Patriot Act Anti-NSA Anti-NDAA Anti-Drug War Anti-Death Penalty Anti-Corporate Bailouts Anti-Crony Capitalism Anti-Discrimination Auditing the Fed Sensible/Compassionate Immigration Reform Pro-Choice Pro-Gay Rights Pro-Marijuana Legalization Pro-Criminal Justice Reform For one looking to support a third party, it is a must to support the one with the best chance to break through the two-party monopoly. This opens things up for the rest of the third parties. Plus the fact that the Libertarian Party will be on the ballot in all 50 states+ DC, unlike the Greens, gives them added viability. This year Americans must unite under a third party or forever lose a most precious opportunity. The Libertarians are that choice. Thank you for this article.

Visit the Straight Dope Message Board Search The Straight Dope A Staff Report from the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board Do Disney movies contain subliminal erotica? July 12, 2000 Dear Straight Dope: I have heard of many perverted things "hidden" in various Disney movies.  Some of these include: the tower on the original cover of The Little Mermaid that bears a stricking resemblance to the male genitalia, a scene in The Little Mermaid where the priest has an erection, a part in The Lion King where the dust rises spelling out SEX, and a scene in Aladdin where Aladdin can be heard saying "good teenagers, take off your clothes." Are these things for real, coincidental, or just little adult antics added in by the animators? Please shed some light on these mysteries and inform me of any that I missed. — Ryan from Castro Valley SDStaff Euty replies: Surprisingly, this is true. Sometime in the mid 70's, Disney discovered a great market value in sabotaging their own work to appeal to the prurient interests of pre-pubescent youth … OK, so I'm being cynical. It's one of the benefits of transitioning into doddering middle age. But it is an interesting pastime to look for the hidden secrets in certain Disney movies, as long as one doesn't look too hard and begin to see and hear things that aren't really there. There's a tradition of Disney artists and storymen trying to sneak stuff onto the screen that goes back to the days of the early shorts. This stemmed from Disney's refusal to share creative credit with anyone. The only credited name on any of the shorts was Walt Disney himself (with an occasional credit to Ub Iwerks in the late 20's).  It wasn't until the mid 40's, as the result of an artists' strike against Disney, that specific credits began showing up on the shorts. But the insult of being uncredited hurt, and the artists tried to get their names inserted into their work in devious ways. Either Disney didn't notice or didn't care at this point, as his attention was taken up with the feature films. Most notably, in the Goofy sports shorts, you'll find that most of the players' names are the names of Disney artists. There is also a history of Disney erotica that precedes the idea of Disney purposely adding erotica to its films. One artist was rumored to have produced a picture of a Snow White and the Seven Dwarves orgy back when the film was still in development, 30 years before Paul Krassner published his satirical "Disney Orgy" cartoon. Fred Moore was another suspect. He became well known at the studio, not just for being a first class animator, but for his drawing of mostly naked, nubile young women which became known as "Freddy Moore girls." These drawings became highly collectible even among Disney insiders but the closest they ever made it to the screen was as the centaurettes in the "Pastoral Symphony" sequence of Fantasia or as the girl in the "All the Cats Join In" sequence of Make Mine Music. (For a more complete listing of the inside jokes in the Disney short subjects, see The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts, a wonderful site.) Most of this was innocent, and the so-called "Disney perversions" never made it to film, unless you buy the ideas of Richard Schickel, a Time magazine movie reviewer who found Freudian elements in pretty much everything Disney did. To hear some tell it, things changed in the mid 70's and 80's after Michael Eisner assumed the reins at Disney. The studio had been floundering under Ron Miller, Disney's son-in-law, who took over after Walt died. Eisner brought Miramax films under the Disney wing, which gave the company an outlet for more profitable R and even X rated films such as Kids and Priest. Right-wing Christian fundamentalists, accustomed to Disney as a purveyor of tradtional family fare, apparently saw this as a betrayal of their trust, and began churning out rumors about secret stuff going on in the animated films. A lot of what they saw rightly belonged with the works of Vance Packard or Wilson Bryan Key. Eventually it became a kind of Rorshach game …  if you want to see it, it's there. Herewith then, the list of what you should be looking for. Note that I've broken them down into three categories : A — things that were intentionally put in, but unauthorized by the producer;  B — things that were intentionally put in by the producer; and C — things that only people who wear tinfoil hats can see. For more detail on some of these, see The Urban Legend Reference Pages--Disney Films. 1. Clock Cleaners (Category C): Fundy activist Donald Wildmon once claimed that Donald Duck could clearly be heard saying "fuck you" in his fight with a clock spring in the 1937 short Clock Cleaners. This short was featured on a small compilation called "Fun on the Job" and for a short time Wildmon got Wal-Mart to pull the tape from their shelves. Apparently Wal-Mart and Wildmon forgot about it later as the tape showed up in the bargain bins once it went out of print. 2. The Rescuers (Category A): All too true — two frames of a topless model can be seen as Bernard and Bianca take off on the albatross and swoop down through the city. You have to be quick to see it, and you have to have a special copy of the video. The shot was done by a layout artist and a scene planner who worked out the camera moves on the shot. Everyone at Disney knew it was there, but it seemed less of a problem, this being before the days of home video. It was in the original theatrical release and was painted over for its first video release. Either someone at Disney forgot it was there or the new version was made from a different print because when the movie was re-released on video last year, the two frames were there. Disney ended up recalling the entire first run and re-releasing it a few months later with the offending frames cut out. I have a copy of the first release. Ha ha. 3. The Little Mermaid (Category A): A couple of points we should cover here. One is the infamous "penis" cover art that was supposedly done by a disgruntled artist the day before he was scheduled to be fired. This is not true — the artist was one of Disney's top layout artists who has worked on and off for Disney since the fifties and still does. To quote my source, "He did intend for the tower to look like a penis, but when he finished it, he realized it was bit too obvious. (Artists often put hidden images in their work … are a lot of classical paintings with subliminal skulls and sexual imagery in them. It isn't a recent thing at all.) The painter was on a deadline to turn it in, so he didn't have time to fix it. He pointed it out to the production person at Disney and offered to paint it out if they wanted him to. The painting was sent up to a committee of marketing execs for approval. The artist never got a call to change it, so he assumed they liked it with the semi-subliminal penis in it." The other question is about the "priests' boner" (Category C). During the scene where Eric and Ursula are about to be married, it appears that the priest is getting an erection. Closer inspection reveals that it is only the priest's knee. Another interesting non-subliminal feature of "The Little Mermaid" to look for: Watch carefully at the beginning when King Triton swoops down over the crowd. After he passes across the screen, below him and to his left Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy can be seen sitting in the crowd. 4. Aladdin (Category C): According to some far-right Christian groups, in a scene where Aladdin is attempting to woo Jasmine and Rajah the tiger is accosting him, Aladin is heard saying, "Good teenagers take off their clothes." It certainly sounds like it if you're told what to listen for. But that's probably not what he's saying. For one thing, it makes no sense to the plot. For another, Disney, who never does anything nowadays without looking at the bottom line, surely doesn't see any market value to their customers in naked teenagers. Never mind. Let's go on. 5. The Lion King (probably Category A): The word SEX is supposedly formed in the clouds above Simba's head after he watches his father die. Once again, this one you can see if you know exactly what to look for. What the meaning is is anyone's guess. Many have said the letters are actually "S-F-X," which stood for Disney's special effects department. This explanation is less than satisfying, but probably true. The lettering is difficult to make out, even when viewing the still frames. It may just be a Rorschach effect in a random cloud. At any rate, if Disney did it on purpose, and it has some subliminal value as some assert, it's difficult to see any market value in movie-goers heading out to the lobby for a quickie in the middle of the movie. 6. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Category C): Because of the nature of the movie and the overtly sexual nature of a few of the characters, this film has attracted more than its share of suspicion. To begin with, supposedly, during the onstage duel between Daffy and Donald Duck, at one point Donald calles Daffy a "goddamn stupid nigger." Once again, you can hear it if you know what to listen for. If you don't it just sounds like Donald's usual gibberish. Another Rorschach test. One possible gag (Category A) was the inclusion of Michael Eisner's home telephone number on a wall in ToonTown in the theatrical release. Supposedly it was erased for the video release. The other issues are with sexuality (Category C). Rumors surfaced at one time that there was a single frame featuring a naked Betty Boop in the original theatrical release that was excised for the video version. The other instance, which is still extant, is the two-frame sequence where viewers claim they can see Jessica Rabbit's vagina during a sequence where she is bounced out of the taxicab. Whether you see it or not depends on how you interpret a small patch of brown ink between her legs in these frames. Could be pantyhose, could be something else. Disney later made three other Roger Rabbit shorts and issued them on a video entitled The Best of Roger Rabbit. A short time later, the laserdisc edition of this was recalled by Disney due to "adhesive" or "packaging" problems. Some suspect, however, that because of the high resolution of the laserdisc format, people would be able to pick out inside jokes that Disney did not want known (and which wouldn't be as clear on the VHS edition). In one case, for instance, there's a poster of a rather buxom woman riding a chainsaw with the logo "Rigid Tools." There's lot of stuff like that — when Steven Speilberg started the ball rolling, he gave the animators carte blanche to put in as many inside and hidden jokes as possible. It's become a game for some to see how many they can find. Kind of like a cartoon Ulysses. A more complete write up on these, and the reason you'll probably never see a Roger Rabbit sequel, can be found at www.mouseplanet.com/jim/mar2800.htm (Editor's Note: Link now defunct.) Like I said, for most of these, if you want to see them you'll see them. But just to be safe, the next time you go to the theater, keep your clothes on, take your saltpeter, and remember, it's just a cartoon. — SDStaff Euty, Straight Dope Science Advisory Board Staff Reports are written by the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board, Cecil's online auxiliary.

HOW TO HIRE THE BEST Why the Office Dress Code Is Slowly Dying Companies competing to attract and retain the best talent are changing their expectations about what employees should wear on the job. By Katherine Reynolds Lewis The Fiscal Times 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Have the great cargo shorts wars of 2016 made it to your office? The passionate internet debate over '90s-era baggy shorts is just the latest example of why summertime has long been the bane of the office fashion police. Clothes get skimpier. Hot weather makes ties and jackets less appealing. The dreaded flip-flops threaten to emerge from the closet. Some traditionally stuffy government offices, law firms, banks, and management consultancies are changing their dress codes, often to help recruit or retain workers in a highly competitive job market--though flip-flops remain a step or three too far. J. P. Morgan Chase is allowing most workers outside its investment bank to trade their suits for business-casual clothing. Last year, Walmart loosened its dress code to allow its associates to wear denim. Accenture and PwC both recently adopted "Dress for Your Day" policies that let employees use their best judgment when it comes to clothing.

If you're in front of a CEO, you wear a suit," says Anne Donovan, PwC's people innovation leader, adding that the change answers the work force's desire to wear more comfortable clothes. "We're competing in a market that's a war for talent. We're listening to people who say: 'This would make it better.'" Accenture doesn't explicitly ban any specific clothes, but asks people to be mindful of factors like T-shirt slogans when dressing for work. The formality of work clothes has been sliding downhill for years, with experts pointing to the rise of tech startup culture--awash in hoodies and fancy sneakers--as leading the way. Now, startup Betabrand designs yoga pants specifically for the office. A survey of more than 300 senior managers released in June by staffing firm OfficeTeam found that half said employees now wear less formal clothing than they did five years ago. Related: Who's Having an Office Romance? The Numbers May Surprise You You can see the casualization of the workplace beginning a century ago but accelerating in recent years, with the emergency of fast fashion and new clothing choices. "It's been happening for the past 100 years with the emergence of a middle class and many social rules and social classes disappearing," says Francois Kress, chief executive officer of fashion label Carolina Herrera. "We have taken into account that people want more comfortable clothes." Carolina Herrera now sees perhaps 30 percent of its ready-to-wear sales in daywear separates, versus 70 percent in occasion or eveningwear. A few years ago the balance would've been 10-90 percent, and in the near future it's likely to be 50-50, Kress says. Increasing sales of activewear, which has been booming for the last three years, feed into the growing informality of work attire. Not only do people buy activewear for exercise, these same stretch fabrics are increasingly finding their way into everyday and work clothes. Customers want more versatile clothes that they can wear to work but keep on into the evening, whether for picking up kids after school or dinner out with friends. As a result, even luxury brands are launching activewear lines, such as the collaboration between Stella McCartney and Adidas or the recently announced partnership between Givenchy and Nike. Or take Burberry's line of lightweight stretch suiting that's easily packable for work travel. At Takeda Pharmaceuticals, many U.S. employees can be found in jeans on a daily basis. The company relaxed its dress code last August based on feedback in a regular survey. "The new dress code was intended to provide an even more comfortable workplace where employees can do their best work, a high priority for Takeda," says spokesman Jim Schwartz, adding that the company respects individual expression in appearance and dress, as well as the variety of work. On days that employees are working with vendors or external partners, they're expected to dress more formally than if they're primarily working alone. Related: The Retirement Revolution That Failed: Why the 401(k) Isn't Working At law firm Hunton & Williams, partner Rori Malech sees an increasing variety of options for men, who often wear just dress pants and shirt, whereas women tend to be a bit dressier, in sleeveless dresses or elegant blouses. "The most dressed down I will see is capri pants, but they're work capris with a dressy fabric--not Banana Republic," says Malech. "There's definitely a movement going more casual." The New York City office tends to be more formal than the Richmond, Virginia office--where the firm was founded--with Washington, D.C. and Texas offices being even more casual and California the most laid back. Related: So Long, Cubicle! How Millennials Will Change the Office Malech appreciates the more versatile work options available from fashion lines like MM.LaFleur, with comfortable dresses, fitted pants, and separates, and even has donned Betabrand "dress yoga pants" when she knew she'd be working an 18-hour day in her office. "Only if I'm going to be under a rock," she explains. "It's not the norm." In winter, women might wear dressy boots with a cute skirt, and you could see the occasional loafer. If Malech puts on jeans for casual Friday, she's sure to dress up the outfit with a jacket, nice heels, and pearls. "I would never not have a suit jacket, sweater, or wrap in my office," she says. "At a white shoe, Southern-founded firm, I don't think things have changed that much." Indeed, the challenge of a more casual and open environment is to strike the balance between comfort and a professional look. "The benefits of a more regulated way of dressing at work is that it was easy to look a certain way. There were only a few options," Kress says. "It's much more challenging for people to dress more casually but also look good." Even with all this change, companies of all stripes still draw the line at flip-flops. "Absolutely not," Malech says. PwC specifically asked employees not to wear flip-flops--or shorts. "We said: 'Use your judgment, and always represent the brand,'" Donovan says.

STRATEGY 9 Strategies for Ignoring Naysayers as an Entrepreneur Don't let anyone's opinions cause you to reconsider your vocation as an entrepreneur. By Young Entrepreneur Council @yec WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Your dream of pursuing an entrepreneurial lifestyle has finally true, and while it may seem great at first, it can be hard to drown out the voices of the "naysayers" who could be deterring you from pursuing your passions. But if you make a conscious effort to stay positive and continue your relentless effort, you'll realize you're achieving the most important goal of all: staying true to you. Nine entrepreneurs offer their best advice for ignoring negative feedback as you pursue the plight of an entrepreneur. 1. Free yourself of others' opinions. It wasn't until I freed myself of caring about what others without buy-in thought of me or my work that I was able to really push forward with my companies. If you're always looking backwards and paying attention to the negative chatter of people who are more interested in spending their energy cutting you down than doing something for themselves, you'll be carrying around a huge ankle weight. - Darrah Brustein, Network Under 40 2. Focus on the worst case scenario. It may sound negative, but I find worst-case thinking is useful for combatting fears. For most people, the worst case scenario of their business failing is going back to a job like the one they're currently in! Most people have irrational fears like being abandoned by friends and family or never being able to start another business. It's useful to sit down and realize that these fears aren't true. - Laura Roeder, MeetEdgar.com 3. It only takes one "yes" to change your life. It doesn't matter how many people tell you "no," because it only takes one "yes" to change your life forever. Dozens of people told me launching ZinePak was a terrible idea, but I kept going until I got the only "yes" that mattered, from a music buyer at Walmart. That "yes" meant more than 1,000 "no"s because it was actionable. Find the actionable "yes" for your dream and ignore the other noise. - Brittany Hodak, ZinePak 4. Talk to other entrepreneurs. The general population is much more likely to be full of naysayers than people who have actually built businesses. Surround yourself with other business owners -- but if they all think your idea doesn't have legs, you should probably listen to them. - John Rood, Next Step Test Preparation 5. If you have a cash runway, you can afford to take risks. The naysayers are most likely worried about the financial burden of starting a company. You can dream big and still be pragmatic about starting your business so that you're not throwing yourself into a mountain of debt and despair if it doesn't work out. Save up six months' worth of living expenses so you can stay calm and confident while you focus on growing your new business. - Allie Siarto, Allie Siarto & Co. Photography 6. Defiance is an integral part of a founder's DNA. In my 20 years' experience as a five-time founder, I've learned that successful founders are innately motivated and even driven by naysaying and rejection, whereas poor founders have a regressive reaction to negativity, and oftentimes too easily surrender to pushback. Great founders want to win all the time, and even more so when they're told that they can't win or shouldn't try. - Philip Ferreira, WebCorp 7. Remember that the 'brick walls' are there for a reason. Naysayers are awesome -- they're a free focus group. You just have to remember (quoting Randy Pausch here) that the brick walls are there for a reason. They let us know how bad we want something. Naysayers are identifying the problems with your idea. Your job as an entrepreneur is to recognize that problems are just opportunities in disguise. Naysayers build the walls; entrepreneurs scale them. - Jeremy Kenisky 8. Stay positive. The naysayers only give you the reasons why your business won't work, but you need to focus on what will work about it and how to make that happen. Staying proactive and positive in your thinking can motivate you to pursue that dream and prove to others that they were wrong about their reasons why not to do it. - Cynthia Johnson, American Addiction Centers 9. Remember your passion. The whole world will be eager to tell you how your idea will fail. Remember why you're passionate about the company you're building. The day I realized I could make a difference to others was the day the company became much bigger than me. I had to push on. Eventually, I met the right people to help me move the company forward. - Ajay Yadav, Roomi The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

X Snapchat strikes Olympic gold in race for viewers App mounts challenge to frontrunners Facebook and Twitter Mon, Aug 15, 2016, 16:31 More than 10 billion videos are now watched on Snapchat every day, compared with 8 billion on Facebook, when the latter last disclosed the metric earlier this year.         Almost 50 million people have watched the Olympic Games on Snapchat so far, as broadcasters including NBC and the BBC use the app to reach a millennial audience. Nearly one in three daily Snapchat users has viewed the clips in Live Stories, showing that the app could challenge other social sites such as Facebook and Twitter for dominance in live events. The LA-based start-up partnered with broadcasters in seven countries including the US, the UK and Brazil to show stories that include footage from the games and from the crowds in the last 24 hours. In the first seven days to last Thursday, 49 million unique visitors viewed Olympics content on Snapchat, almost a third of the 150 million daily active users of the app. Deal Snapchat also signed a deal with NBC, the official US broadcaster of the Olympics, and news site BuzzFeed to create a channel on its Discover platform to produce daily snippets from the games. This includes behind-the-scenes footage shot especially for Snapchat. Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Instagram takes on Snapchat with live, ‘disappearing’ video How to . . . help out your smartphone battery NBC Olympics and Snapchat are sharing advertising revenue from the ads placed in the Discover page. Seven brand partners have signed up to advertise from Walmart, running ads to promote their commitment to selling more goods made in America, to Dick’s Sporting Goods, a US sports retailer that is featuring stories of Olympians and Paralympians going for gold. Snapchat is trying to compete with larger rivals Twitter and Facebook to become the home for social interactions surrounding live events. It is partnering with traditional media companies who have come to value the app for its younger and engaged audience, keen to watch video on mobile. Snapchat reaches 41 per cent of all 18 to 34 year olds in the US every day, according to a survey by research company Nielsen. Videos More than 10 billion videos are now watched on Snapchat every day, compared with 8 billion on Facebook, when the latter last disclosed the metric earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram are also working with NBC Olympics, which is producing a two-minute daily round-up for Facebook’s US users and a daily slow-motion video focusing on inspiration for Instagram. Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 1.6 billion users, is focusing on encouraging the use of its newest format, Facebook Live, creating a landing page to help people find live videos from Olympians including Team Great Britain, Team Brazil and Team Japan. Partners The company has begun to pay some stars and media companies to shoot live streams for Facebook and is reported to have paid US swimmer Michael Phelps. A spokesperson confirmed it had paid a “relatively small” number of partners, but would not say if Mr Phelps was among them. Twitter has long styled itself as the platform for news and following along on a “second screen” while you watch TV. It has created a “Twitter Moment” which allows people to follow the Olympics action with one click of a button for the duration of the games, as well as specific races such as Usain Bolt running for gold in the 100 million.

Sort Notes Newest First Oldest First Show 16 Newer Notes Chris Bodenner 10:45 AM / August 15, 2016 America by Air: The Continental Divide Jimmy Rollison One of our best reader contributors to our series, Jimmy Rollison, sends another great view: Looking north after passing Colorado’s Great Sand Dunes National Monument [captured by an earlier reader photographer], one cannot miss seeing the “Continental Divide” that has been the inspiration for many many artists. [French poet and aviator] Antoine St. Exupery’s famous quote is best applied here on this delivery flight: “I fly because it releases my mind from the tyranny of petty things.” Jimmy adds, “Did you ever wonder why the terminal at Denver Airport looks like it does?” He’s referring to this striking structure, the Jeppesen Terminal: The first commercial flight at the new Denver International Airport lands shortly after 6 a.m. on February 28, 1995. (Reuters) Here’s how the terminal’s creator, Fentress Architects, describes it: The form evokes the majestic snow-capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado’s international signature. Sustainably, the fabric roof provides considerable daylighting, and low heat absorption reduces build-up due to sunlight radiation. A survey by the American Institute of Architects ranked the terminal as #4 on its list of favorite American architectural landmarks, while Business Traveler magazine readers voted DIA the “Best Airport in North America” every year from, 2005-2010. As the largest structurally integrated tensile-membrane roof in the world, DIA is a memorable threshold welcoming all to Colorado and the West. Chris Bodenner 3:00 PM / August 11, 2016 America by Air: Burning Man Below Jimmy Hamilton Jimmy Hamilton, the Reno-based reader who sent the AbA photo over Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada, responds to me mentioning that I’m headed to nearby Black Rock Desert to camp out for a week soon: Hello again, Chris. I just happen to have an aerial photo of Burning Man, taken in the C180 from about a mile away looking down (from about 5500 AGL / 10,000 MSL) on the half circle that is Black Rock City. The scale of it is hard to imagine, but the diameter of the half circle is well over a mile. I hope you have a great time at Burning Man this year, but be prepared for everything—heat, cold, dust storms, rain and mud—all in the same week. Then again, on some occasions it can be clear and mild! If you’ve been out to Black Rock City and have any good advice for a first-timer, or just a good story to share, please drop me an email. As I was reading up on Black Rock Desert just now, I came upon this eerie and captivating sight: Jeremy C. Munns / public domain That vision of a mushroom trip is called Fly Geyser, and it was created by accident more than 50 years ago. From the Atlas Obscura entry on the natural-ish wonder: In 1964 a geothermic energy company drilled a test well at the same site [of a nearby geyser]. The water they struck was that same 200 degrees. Hot, but not hot enough for their purposes. The well was supposedly re-sealed, but apparently it did not hold. The new geyser, a few hundred feet north of the original, robbed the first of its water pressure and the cone now lays dry. This second geyser, known as Fly Geyser, has grown substantially in the last 40 years as minerals from the geothermal water pocket deposit on the desert surface. Because there are multiple geyser spouts, this geyser has not created a cone as large as the first, but an ever growing alien looking mound. The geyser is covered with thermophilic algae, which flourishes in moist, hot environments, resulting in the multiple hues of green and red that add to its out-of-this-world appearance. Here’s a video of the geyser in action: The 3,800-acre Fly Ranch upon which the geyser sits was actually just bought by the Burning Man Project in June. From the group’s news release: Here’s the gist of it: Those who have been deeply affected by a Burning Man event or experience have often asked, “How can we bring this beyond the event?” “How can we make this really matter?” [...] As a year-round site, Fly Ranch has the potential to expand Burning Man Project’s activities and existing programs, as well as amplify Burning Man’s cultural impact into the wider world beyond Black Rock City. Not if Cthulhu gets to them first: Chris Bodenner 6:25 PM / August 10, 2016 America by Air: Pyramid Lake Jimmy Hamilton Another reader with another amazing view adds another state to the series: I see on your site that you don’t have a photo taken in Nevada. This is Pyramid Lake, about 30 miles north of Reno. The lake is out in the middle of the desert.  I took the photo from a 1955 Cessna 180. (Sorry about the reflections in the window.) Coincidentally I’m headed out to that part of the Nevada desert in less than a month, to attend Burning Man for the first time. If you happen to have a good aerial photo above Black Rock City, please send it our way. Another funny coincidence: The only two photos of Pyramid Lake available in the Atlantic archives are this one from 1867 and the one seen to the right, which was captured by an Atlantic reader and posted by a friend I’m going to Burning Man with—in a blog post about the spirituality of shrooms. Here’s a bit more about the lake: Pyramid Lake is fed by the Truckee River, which is mostly the outflow from Lake Tahoe. The Truckee River enters Pyramid Lake at its southern end. Pyramid Lake has no outlet, with water leaving only by evaporation, or sub-surface seepage (an endorheic lake). The lake has about 10% of the area of the Great Salt Lake, but it has about 25% more volume. The salinity is approximately 1/6 that of sea water. … Pyramid Lake was used as a stand-in for the Sea of Galilee in the 1965 biblical film, The Greatest Story Ever Told. Also, in 1961, part of The Misfits was filmed nearby. If you’re one of the misfits who’s attended Burning Man and have any good anecdotes or advice to share, please drop me a note. Update from reader Jim, who has tons of helpful advice: Reserve a cheap bike at the Walmart in Reno and leave it with someone when Burning Man is over. Continue Reading Take some white vinegar to mix with your water to counteract the alkali when washing your feet, or anything that’s covered with the lake bed dust. Take foot cream or you may crack. Wash feet frequently.  Get a medium quality dust mask (one not too hot). I use swim goggles because they seal the best. Wear them around your neck at all times in case a dust storm blows, which happens all the time.  Your vehicle will likely never quite yield the dust no matter how you try to clean.  Alkali sticks to oil, and frankly the entire world seems to be coated with a film of oil even if you don’t notice. I took a tent, and I brought it back to the Ozarks and put it in a clear flowing stream for hours, but it was still coated with dust when it dried. I took a garden sprayer, the kind you pump up to spray. I used that to shower off (you must have a tarp to catch the water or you will violate a rule not to drain water in the desert). Although I sometimes raced naked to the water truck with soap in hand. Your wet feet will cake up like a baked potato when you walk back, but it peels off.  Don’t be ashamed to pee in a wide mouth jug at night and walk it to a porta-potty naked in the morning. No one cares. If you are in the front row during a big temple or “man” burn, it will get hot and you may feel trapped at the front. The spiraling hot white tornadoes that come out of the big burns will not reach you although they seem to be coming out toward the crowd. People swept through and stole bicycles on the last night, so beware there are sociopaths who will take your bike if you don’t lock it.  I felt embarrassed to keep locking my bike the second time I went, but I kept mine while others lost theirs.    If you want to stay in touch with friends, bring walkie talkies. With all the people there, the channels are pretty crowded, but you can always take a radio with different bandwidth than family radio channels. Try buying some cheap marine radios or radios used on industrial worksites with UHF. Hell, CB might work too. Take a hand drum of some sort so you can participate in drum circles. Irish tams are like big tambourines and travel well. Bring gifts—any kind. I took gallons of mixed nuts and little paper bowls which I filled and left (a few) at all the bars from which I drank. All drinks are free, so you want something to give back. Carry a pen and little spiral notebook. You may meet people you want to look up later. You may never see them again at the Burn.  Video cams are frowned up.  You are there to make art, not to collect pics of naked people.  I think of Burning Man as a combo of a circus, Fellini movie, and a gay parade.  You’ll never forget it. I will be at Lake Powell starting Labor Day weekend on a houseboat—the perfect experience after the Burn (although I am not going this year). Diving into deep clean water will never feel so exquisite. Chris Bodenner 4:59 PM / August 9, 2016 America by Air: Fork in the River JP Robinson A reader and pilot, JP, sends a scenic view “from the cockpit of a Bell 206 Jetranger Helicopter, flying southeast bound along Clark Fork River heading back to Missoula, MT.” Here’s a little about the waterway: The largest river by volume in Montana, the Clark Fork drains an extensive region of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and northern Idaho in the watershed of the Columbia River. The river flows northwest through a long valley at the base of the Cabinet Mountains and empties into Lake Pend Oreille in the Idaho Panhandle. The Clark Fork is a Class I river for recreational purposes in Montana from Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border.  The Clark Fork should not be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, which is located in Montana and Wyoming. That striking photo from JP checks another state, Montana, off our list of 50. We still need aerial views from CT, GA, ID, IN, IA, ME, MS, NV, NM, ND, RI, TN, VT, and WV if you can help: hello@theatlantic.com. Chris Bodenner 2:00 PM / August 7, 2016 America by Air: 'Pure Heaven, Accessible Only by Air' Anne Woods Anne Woods, the reader who sent the crisp, cerulean view of Puako Reef, sends a second photo from the air, this time above Northern California’s Sonoma County on an afternoon in late November: It was taken while bundled up in an open-cockpit 1932 Waco UBF-2. Off the wingtip is Tomales Bay, under which runs the San Andreas Fault. Point Reyes National Seashore is just on its other side, under the fog. When the sun swings south in the fall, it bathes the earth and the Waco’s wings in a soft, glowing light. The sky flushes orange, the summer-brown grass greens, the air stills, and on this day, I could smell the gap between the temperature and dew point closing. Pure heaven, accessible only by air. Here’s a heavenly view of Point Reyes under the fog: Wikimedia Chris Bodenner 1:15 PM / August 5, 2016 America by Air: Reef Relief in Hawaii From a newcomer to the series, Anne Woods: I love America by Air! Here’s a submission above Puako Reef, on the Big Island of Hawaii, taken from a Piper PA-18 Super Cub. Anne Woods The healthy and beauty of the reef is precarious right now. From the North Hawaii News early this year: The Puako coral reef has provided food, recreation and beauty for many generations. So when residents began to see the coral degrade — a loss of 50 percent between 1970 and 2010 and several studies showed dangerously high bacteria count — they decided it was time to care for the reef. The community came together and launched the Clean Water for Reefs project in Puako in Sept. 2014. It soon became apparent that the major culprit was outdated waste water treatment such as cesspools, and that upgrading to a septic tank, given the porous volcanic rock and high ground water, was not a viable option.  … [T]he final recommendation was for an on-site waste water treatment plant. A big advantage to the on-site waste water treatment plant is that the water coming out of it would be safe to use for irrigation, making a “community orchard” a real possibility. For an underwater tour of Puako, check out this vivid video: Chris Bodenner 2:55 PM / August 3, 2016 America by Air: A Bleeding River Among the Dinosaurs Jimmy Rollison, the reader who sent the incredible shot over Monument Valley, doubles down with another set of beauties, this time from Dinosaur National Monument. First a bit of background: Lizard petroglyphs at D.N.M. (Wikipedia) This park contains over 800 paleontological sites and has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus, Deinonychus, Abydosaurus ... and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. It was declared a National Monument on October 4, 1915. … Though lesser-known than the fossil beds, the petroglyphs in Dinosaur National Monument are another treasure the monument holds. Due to problems with vandals, many of the sites are not listed on area maps. Here’s Jimmy: An enrollee from California to Denver one should NEVER pass the opportunity to fly over Dinosaur National Monument [located on the border between Colorado and Utah] and especially Jenny Lind Rock [on-the-ground photos here]. Jimmy Rollison This is where the Green River meets the Yampa River to flow west. After a late winter rain, the Green River appears to be bleeding, and this view is only available to those who fly. To those who say, “If God had intended man to fly, he would have given him wings,” I say no; if he didn’t want me to fly, he’d have given me roots. Jimmy Rollison This one is just east of Vernal, Utah, where the Green River exits the Canyon, after a heavy rain. The colors are vividly alive with minerals, displayed only for those looking down. Go Fly! Chris Bodenner 5:09 PM / August 2, 2016 America by Air: A Monumental Scene Just wow: Jimmy Rollison The photographer, Jimmy, also has few words for this spectacular scene over Monument Valley: All I can say about this photo is: As only can be seen from a small airplane. Update: Monument Valley straddles Utah and Arizona, so I asked Jimmy which side he was on: Utah. I had departed Cortez, Colorado, heading for Page, Arizona. He sends another stunning photo from that trip: Jimmy Rollison I always wanted to view Lake Powell from above but not the 36,000’ view of my normal work. Only Lake Powell! [This America by Air series is a] GREAT IDEA!!!  I have never shared a photo, as I thought no one would appreciate what I see. Thank you again for bringing this into the eyes of the public. Our eyes are smiling. Chris Bodenner 10:00 AM / August 1, 2016 America by Air: Passing Through Colorado Pete Howell A fantastic set of photos from reader Pete: Here are a few pics from our recent trip to Colorado in the little airplane I built in my garage 10 years ago! We flew over Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and visited on the ground a few hours later. My wife and I were on vacation from St Paul. Story here. Pete Howell A bit about its past: Mosca Pass was named for Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, whose scouting parties may have reached this area about 1542. He was a Spanish explorer and conquistador credited as the first European to reach Texas. I asked Pete if he could share a good photo of his plane—“a Van’s RV-9A”—and he definitely delivered: 👋 Chris Bodenner 12:45 PM / July 28, 2016 America by Air: Delaware's Cape Daniel Watkins A helpful reader, Daniel, gets us one step closer to 50 states: “I saw in the Notes section that you don’t have a photo from Delaware, so I’m happy to lend a hand with a photo from the first state.” That bit of trivia I didn’t know. Here’s more about Daniel and his photo: I’m a Brit, my wife is a Delawarean. We live abroad but travel back to the States for friends and family about once a year. My wife’s family is in Sussex county, DE, and when I first visited, I was struck by the sheer number of place names stolen from my native land: Sussex, Lewes, Seaford, Dover, Kent, Camden—all places I’ve lived in or near. It’s like a little home from home. Two winters ago, right before one of the major snow storms, we were on our way to see friends and had a connecting flight in Philly. The easiest way for us to get there from Sussex was on a tiny propeller plane from Salisbury, MD. The plane was small enough for either me or my wife to be guaranteed a window seat. She is a better person than me, and so I spent the flight gawking out the window, happily snapping away on my iPhone. This photo is taken from right above Lewes, DE, where we have family (and of the Cape May ferry fame). The sandy part jutting out, and the adjacent woodland, is Cape Henlopen State Park, a piece of land set aside for public use in the 1680s—which has to make it one of the first. I hadn’t visited it at the time I took the photo, but I’ve been belatedly learning to drive there since, so I’ve also taken in the trails and ocean front. It has to rank as one of the most idyllic places I’ve ever seen: beach and forest, sand and soil, shell and pine cone, with a thick salt marsh right in the middle. It’s become an almost-sacred place, and so this photo serves as a reminder while we’re away from homes, old and new. Chris Bodenner 10:26 AM / July 26, 2016 America by Air: River of Mist Katy McDevitt A long-time reader, Paul, checks another state off our list of 50: I mostly grew up in Lexington, Kentucky, so I am very used to the view of mist rising from the water in the early morning. But in all my years of flying, I guess I’d never headed out until later in the day. When my wife, Katy, recently peeled off to Montreal with our daughter really really early in the morning, and she showed me the photos she’d taken after takeoff, I was really amazed to see what my riverine memories looked like from the air. Her iPhone geo-located the photo at Nicholasville—a bit south of Lexington. The source of the mist is the Kentucky River, deep in its gorge at this point, and the shape of the river is recognizable from the map. The river is about 500 feet below the bluegrass plateau and the gorge is a quarter-mile wide or so. That is a lot of water vapor! If you have a great aerial photo of your own to share, especially from one of the states we haven’t covered yet—CT, DE, GA, ID, IN, IA, ME, MS, MT, NV, NM, ND, RI, TN, VT, WV—please send our way, ideally with a part of the plane showing: hello@theatlantic.com.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Felker Ave. Police found four 16-year-old boys. The teens did no damage and they did not plan to commit a crime. » At 11:51 p.m. Saturday, a caller reported a 25-year-old Wausau man was causing a disturbance at a wedding in the 1800 block of South Roddis Avenue because some of the wedding guests prevented the man from drunken driving. When police arrived, the 25-year-old man yelled profanities and told police he would punch them, if he did not go to jail. » At 4:24 p.m. Saturday, a Marshfield man reported his ex-girlfriend was sending him unwanted text messages in an effort to sabotage his current relationship. The Marshfield man said he recently changed his phone number and did not want police to contact his ex-girlfriend because he was afraid it would make matters worse. » At 5 p.m. Friday, a caller asked police to check on two children because their father was using drugs. Police checked on the children, and they were fine. Police arrested the father for three Wisconsin Rapids warrants. The man's roommate took the children to their mother's residence. » At 1:52 p.m. Saturday, an employee at Walmart, 2001 N.

To celebrate the grand opening, the restaurant will offer FREE build-your-own artisanal pizzas on Friday, August 19th from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. to anyone who follows Blaze Pizza on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. The highly anticipated restaurant, which features a 2,300 square foot interior with seating for 69, is located in the Sunwest Village Walmart Shopping Center (1537 Lower Sacramento Road) next to Buffalo Wild Wings. This fall, Blaze will open an additional Central California location in Stockton, at the Weberstown Mall (4950 Pacifica Ave.). Blaze Pizza is a modern day "pizza joint" serving up artisanal pizzas that are both fast and affordable. Since its first restaurant debuted in 2012, Blaze has quickly become one of the nation's hottest restaurant concepts, with fans lining up each day for the custom-built pizzas, freshly made salads, blood orange lemonade and s'more pies. Each restaurant features an interactive open-kitchen format that allows guests to customize one of the menu's signature pizzas or create their own, choosing from a wide selection of fresh, artisanal ingredients -- all for about $8. The generously-sized personal pizzas are then sent to a blazing hot open-flame oven -- the centerpiece of the restaurant -- where dedicated pizzasmiths ensure that the thin-crust pies are fast-fire'd and ready to eat in just 180 seconds. Restaurants make their own dough from scratch using a recipe developed by critically-acclaimed Executive Chef Bradford Kent (the "Pizza Whisperer"), which requires a 24-hour fermentation period to produce his signature light-as-air, crisp crust. Almost all of the pizza and salad ingredients are free of artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and fillers and for pizza fans with specific dietary needs, Blaze Pizza offers gluten-free dough and vegan cheese. The new Lodi restaurant will also feature a selection of wine and craft beer. "Our mission at Blaze is really simple -- we're taking pizza back to its roots," said Jim Mizes, president & COO of Blaze Pizza. "By making dough in-house, carefully sourcing ingredients, and cooking by fire, we're giving guests a great way to enjoy artisanal pizza without the wait. It's changing the way people think about and eat pizza." Blaze's obsessive attention to detail extends well beyond the food, with a carefully considered, modern approach to restaurant design. Driven by its commitment to "Intelligent Choices for Our Pizzas, People & Planet," the restaurant is constructed with recycled and sustainable materials, uses eco-friendly packaging, and features energy-efficient LED lighting. Additionally, many of the restaurant's unconventional design elements were inspired by the company's celebration of individual expression. Blaze Pizza is looking forward to continuing to build strong roots within the community. To that end, the company has developed a turn-key in-restaurant fundraiser program that returns 20% of an event's proceeds back to local organizations, and will be partnering with local schools, sports clubs and other organizations to host fundraising events at the new restaurant. The Lodi Blaze Pizza location will be locally owned and operated by DAMM Fine Pizza LLC, a franchise group developing locations throughout Central California. About Blaze Pizza The first Blaze Pizza® restaurant opened on Aug. 6, 2012, in Irvine, Calif., and quickly gained attention for its chef-driven recipes, thoughtful interior design, and a service culture that celebrates individuality. Now ranked as the leading fast-casual pizza chain in the Technomic Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report, Blaze Pizza is building momentum and developing a cult following as it expands across the country. The company currently operates 151 restaurants in 31 states and Canada, including the major metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Toronto, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Boston Founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel (co-founder of Wetzel's Pretzels), the concept is backed by investors including LeBron James, Maria Shriver, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Boston Red Sox co-owner Tom Werner and movie producer John Davis.

Some enterprising companies, however, are taking their environmental efforts to the next level and setting science based targets: greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals in line with what scientists say is necessary to keep global warming below the 2-degree threshold. “It’s definitely a growing movement in the mindset of many companies,” said Alicia Godlove, FirstCarbon Solutions sustainability project manager. FirstCarbon Solutions is an environmental sustainability consulting services provider and a long-time scoring partner for CDP. An increasing number of its clients are looking for help establishing science based targets, FirstCarbon Sollutions executives say. “Especially with the Paris agreement, science-based targets are quickly becoming the standard,” Godlove added. The Science Based Targets initiative, a joint effort of CDP, the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund, works with companies to set emissions targets and only approves those that meet its strict criteria. The four have said they aim to establish science based target setting as mainstream corporate practice. This year, CDP added science based targets as a component of scoring for companies that disclose emissions each year. At last count 176 companies including Ikea, Unilever, Kellogg, Walmart, Dell and Enel have committed to setting science based targets. Of these, 19 companies have targets in place that have been certified by the initiative’s experts. The initiative’s organizers say companies have been joining at a rate of two per week since its launch last year. “These companies are at the forefront of the global transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy,” CDP CEO Paul Simpson said. “They are showing that all types of companies — including carbon-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals and steel — can get on a low carbon path. Science based targets help drive innovation, reduce costs and enhance profitability. Companies that set them gain long-term competitive advantage and safeguard their future prosperity.” Companies that have had their science based emissions reduction targets approved say setting these emissions goals have benefited their business on several levels, from improving their relationships with regulators to driving innovation. Kellogg, for example, says it has seen reductions in energy use as a direct benefit of setting science based targets. The food company now has a fuel cell at a waffle-making facility in San Jose generating half of the facility’s electricity. This is not to say that setting — or achieving — science based targets is easy. It first requires companies to first collect a comprehensive inventory of their global scope 1 (direct), scope 2 (indirect from purchased electricity) and scope 3 (value chain) emissions. And then they must develop a plan to achieve, and report on, emissions reductions that will bring their company inline with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Because the targets are typically set for 2050, this requires companies to examine several unknowns, like future growth, market share and geographic locations. The Science Based Targets initiative recommends several different methodologies to help companies answer these questions and set GHG emission reduction targets in line with climate science. “It’s a very ambitious undertaking, not to be taken lightly,” Godlove said. “These are usually long-term targets, looking out to 2050 or beyond. Companies need to full appreciate what that means and that they are looking at very large reductions.” “It is not uncommon at all for a company to set their science based target as a reduction in direct and indirect emissions by 70,80, 90 percent,” added Michele Carchman, FirstCarbon Solutions director of sustainability services. “So it’s pretty important to get all stakeholders involved. You don’t want executives or other stakeholders to say ‘that’s utterly impossible.’” In fact, all companies that have set these targets said they faced challenges. Internal buy-in, setting long-term emissions reductions goals and working with suppliers and customer to address scope 3 emissions are common challenges mentioned in a series of case studies on the Science Based Targets website. So why should companies set such targets? In a column on Sustainable Brands, Hugh Jones, managing director of advisory at the Carbon Trust, answers this question and says there are several reasons. These include getting ahead of regulator risk, driving operations savings through reduced energy costs, managing reputational risk and improving access to capital. “The more and more leading companies set science based targets, the easier it will become for others to follow them,” Jones writes. “This will help to normalize the approach and create a critical mass that can help drive forward the move to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.” Carchman says science based targets are the next phase in the “evolution of transparency.” “You can’t manage what you can’t measure,” she said. “And so with science based targets you are measuring what you have and setting a target for a long-term future that gets us where we need to be. If you don’t have that compass of where you are going, you are absolutely going to get lost. Science based targets drive companies to where we need to be 25, 30 years from now.” Kellogg Pledges to Slash Operations Emissions 65% by 2050 Why Climate Business Risk Disclosures are the New Norm COP21: 114 Companies Set ‘Science-Based’ Emissions Targets, Business Climate Tool Launched COP21 Climate Deal: What’s Next for Business Carbon Disclosure Project, FirstCarbon Solutions Partner for Supply Chain Scorecards Reader Comments There are no comments for this story.   Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website Energy Manager News Energy Performance Contracts Facilitate Big Changes for CA School District NextEra, TVA Launch Largest Solar Project in Alabama Trane Introduces Water-Cooled Chiller In Antitrust Filing, Sierra Club Alleges NEXUS Pipeline Would Raise Retail Rates Excessively Public Service Co. of Oklahoma Requests Extra Time for $75M Rate Refund IKEA Builds Sustainability, Energy Savings Naperville, IL, Almost Ready for Consumer Energy Management Miramar FAA Location Taps Solar NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Home Back to School Article Back to School: Shopping tips for parents By Stephanie Buffamonte |  Posted: Mon 8:10 AM, Aug 15, 2016  |  Updated: Mon 12:52 PM, Aug 15, 2016 STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WSAW) Parents have probably been getting Back to School shopping advertisements in their mailboxes and emails. With all of the choices, finding the best deal may seem overwhelming. However, Wisconsin stores are on the consumers side. The Department of Trade and Consumer Protection found that prices are accurate for Wisconsin customers almost every time. For kids and their parents, heading back to school typically means new backpacks, supplies, and clothes for students. Frank Frassetto the Division Administrator for Trade and Consumer Protection advises parents and students to make a list and prepare before heading to the stores. "The shopping season is a very competitive time of year," said Frassetto. "Stores are putting out advertisements that are coming in your local news papers and online. A good idea would be to do a little bit of research." Here's how you can start: 1- Clip those advertisements and check to see if the store has any restrictions like time constraints or quantity. 2- Check to see if the store of your choosing has price matching. This way you can make one trip instead of many. I called the nearby Target, Walmart and Staples. An employee at each store told me the store would match the lowest prices for the same exact product.The Walmart and Staples employee asked me to bring in the advertisement. The Target employee said they would be able to look it up on a tablet, as long as you have the advertisement or product already in mind. Stores like these are helping local customers. "Wisconsin businesses are doing well and the consumers are getting what they are paying for," said Frassetto. The Department of Trade and Consumer Protection checked the prices of 68,000 products in Wisconsin stores. Inspectors found that when people check out at the counter, prices are accurate or in the consumers favor 99% of the time. While the price accuracy is nearly perfect for Wisconsin customers, the products that the department found discrepancies in were sales items. While you're checking out those discount items, take a look at the scanner and make sure the item is the correct price. If you find that you were overcharged, head to the stores customer service with your receipt. According to Wisconsin law, if you don't get the correct price when you check out the store must refund you the money.

Family Escapes flooding in Louisiana Sharon Ko, KENS 7:39 AM. CDT August 15, 2016 Courtesy of Achim Barrow (Photo: Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN ANTONIO -- A San Antonio family left stranded from the flooding in Louisiana is now returning home. Achim Barrow decided to take his wife and son on a road trip to Disney World in Florida. But on Saturday, they got stuck on the highway about 20 miles east of Baton Rouge in a town called Walker. The flooding shut down majority of the roads and the family had to sleep in their car.  Barrow said there were no rooms available in the hotels or shelters. "You're in a strange city. You don't know what's going on. You don't know how desperate people are going to get," Barrow said.   But the next morning, the family realized how lucky they were to have slept in their car. "We noticed that the entire area that we were going to be, including a Walmart parking lot, was 6 to 8 feet under water. Completely. The people that were in the shelter, that we were going to go to, had to be rescued," Barrow said.   Barrow said crews were working non-stop to rescue people from their trapped homes by helicopter and boats. He said residents were using their tractors and rafts to help their neighbors. Despite the devastation, Barrow said the community was generous in Walker. At one of the only gas stations open, that took only cash, a stranger gave him 20 dollars to fill up his tank. "I said no, I can't take that. He said ‘no I want you to get home’," Barrow said. Barrow then, helped the driver behind him with the remaining dollars. "I told him, ‘hey stop, don't go inside. You can use it to put in your car.’ They didn't have money either," Barrow said. Barrow said some of the roads are now starting to open. The family is driving non-stop until they reach San Antonio. "The goal is just to get home. I'm emotional right now and I just, need to get us home," Barrow said. %INLINE% (© 2016 KENS) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Off-duty deputy kills Raising Cane's robbery suspect Freeport PD looking for person of interest in baby's death Suspect dead after chase, shootout Parents look for son's road rage killer Accused cop killer got married during manhunt Wednesday morning forecast - 6:38 a.m. update Father killed by hit-and-run driver Woman in wheelchair shocked with Taser Officials: Driver was speeding before deadly Tenn. school bus crash Driver charged in deadly Tenn. school bus crash More Stories David Temple granted new trial in pregnant wife's murder Nov 23, 2016, 10:40 a.m. Police searching for mom's boyfriend after baby's death Nov 23, 2016, 4:46 a.m. Deputy kills Raising Cane's robbery suspect; 2… Nov 22, 2016, 11:41 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

The father of the boy told police he forgot to drop his son off at daycare before he went to his job Friday at a Walmart in Helotes, Texas. The child was left in the car in the back seat of the father's SUV from the time he arrived at work at 6:15 a.m. until the father returned to the car at 3:09 p.m., Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess said. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office identified the baby as Dillon Martinez. EMTs were not able to resuscitate the boy. The father was hospitalized and was cooperating with police. He is not currently facing charges, Burgess said. Martinez's death is the 27th hot car-related child's death this year, according to a child safety advocacy group. Last year, a total of 25 children died after being left in hot cars.

The six-month-old, identified as Dillon Martinez, was left in the vehicle for nine hours while temperatures outside hit almost 38°C. Inside the car for that length of time, the baby had no chance of survival. Woman who kidnapped baby 20 years ago then raised her as her own is jailed He died at a Wal-Mart in San Antonio and his death means that 27 children have been killed in the US in 2016 so far as a result of being left in hot cars. The total number of child deaths in hot cars from the whole of 2015 was 24. The baby’s father, who works at the Wal-Mart store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work at about 6.15am on Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3pm. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed in the case. The name of the infant’s father has not been released by authorities. This year, on August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex in Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found the girls had had been removed from the car and were in a baby pool behind the duplex where their father was trying to revive them as neighbours attempted to cool them with ice packs. The toddlers were taken to hospital but did not survive. How can we stop children dying in hot cars? The US safety advocacy organisation KidsAndCars say there are two predominant ways a child dies in a hot car. The first is a parent inadvertently leaves the child in the car after forgetting they are there. Second occurs when children climb in on their own and get shut in. A minority die after being left in the car on purpose.  The tragic accident can happen to anyone, they say – no one should think they are immune.  They recommend tips to avoid it happening, like leaving a giant stuffed toy in the child seat that you move to the passenger seat when the baby is in the chair, acting as a visual reminder your child is in the car with you.  Alternatively, get into the habit of leaving something you need for the day in the back with your child – your handbag, briefcase, phone or ID card – to force you to check the back seat before you get out.  Cars should have safety measures, they say, to prevent parents getting out while the child seat is occupied. After all, if we can have alarms for ignition, keys and headlights, why not for child seats, when that could effectively save lives?     More Woman locked 14 cats in house until they got so hungry they ate each other Dad reunited with missing daughter that everyone thought was Madeleine McCann Donald Trump could still be blocked from becoming president Transgender woman called for Domino's boycott after delivery man called her 'sir' Sponsored15 reasons staying in is the new going out Powerful images from HIV epidemic protests in the 1980s and 1990s Comments Must read What's trending nowMore trending stories » Dad reunited with missing daughter that everyone thought was Madeleine McCann Argos is selling the new Apple Macbook for £100 - and we think someone's in trouble Woman locked 14 cats in house until they got so hungry they ate each other Man 'raped partner while she was in labour' Toddler saves dad's life by force-feeding him Muller Crunch CornerMore trending stories » YOU ARE HERE: World Home News Sport Lifestyle Entertainment More Blogs Jobs Search Metro Trending Nutshell MetroUK @MetroUK © 2016 Associated Newspapers Limited Powered by WordPress.com VIP Your ad choices Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite map Back to top Get us in your feed Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter

South Africa’s economy is not expected to grow this year. The listed retailer, majority owned my Walmart, says its pre-tax profit, excluding a once-off gain, will be between 8.4 percent and 15.9 percent higher than the R685.2 million it reported for the 26 weeks to June. Retailers count their periods in full weeks, hence the apparent anomaly between their period end and that of other companies. In a statement issued on Monday, the company said its results for the 26 week period to June 2016 were favourably affected by an insurance gain arising from the excess of the insured replacement value over the net book value of the assets destroyed by the fire at the Jumbo Crown Mines store in February 2016. Read also: No Massmart complaint outcome yet That gain will bolster pre-tax profit by as much as 22.1 percent and earnings by 29.2 percent, it says. The company also added that currency movements across Africa remained volatile and mostly negative and so the likely net foreign exchange loss is slightly higher than that reported for the comparable 2015 period. Despite this, it says it benefited from an improved tax rate. IOL Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news? Sign up for our daily newsletter!

She admits having had to work in an eye mask, breathing mask and thick gloves, out of fear of donors’ hygiene habits. More conventionally, designer Van Tran of Brooklyn, New York, won the 12th annual (wearable) Toilet Paper Wedding Dress design contest in New York City in June, with a $10,000 prize from sponsors Charmin and Ripley’s Believe It or Not. World’s Greatest Lawyers Attorney Chris Dyer convinced a jury in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in June that there was “reasonable doubt” about what his client was doing in a family’s basement when he was discovered, pants down, perched (“doggy style”) over the family’s golden retriever, Cooper. Client Daniel Reinsvold, a stranger in the house, told the jury that he has an “intestinal disorder” that makes him subject to “emergencies.” What Reinsvold was doing was apparently perfectly clear to the resident’s 17-year-old daughter, who discovered the scene and reported Reinsvold “screwing Cooper” (and a vet said later that Cooper showed signs of trauma). Nonetheless, Reinsvold was convicted only of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Attorney Lee Pearlman finally earned an acquittal in June (after two hung-jury trials) for his client Danielle Goeller–one of a seemingly increasing number of drivers who hit pedestrians but claim they were unaware of anybody being hit. Goeller, 28, a trauma-room nurse with no intoxicants in her system, had struck a 60-year-old man on a busy, heavily lighted Tampa street at 11:45 p.m., cracking her windshield–but drove on without stopping. “What does she think she hit?” asked the prosecutor. “A deer? A bear?” Responded Pearlman, “She’s a scared girl in the middle of the night who doesn’t have the life experience other people do.” Bright Ideas Picturesque Torrelodones, Spain (pop. 22,000), has 6,000 pet dogs and apparently few conscientious dog owners, which town leaders say accounts for the nearly half-ton of “litter” that accumulates daily. The town’s latest bright idea: installing a 7-foot-high, 10-by-10-foot brown, inflated plastic “swirly” in the center of town as a reminder to residents to pick up after their dogs. Spain’s The Local reported in June that other towns have begun to tackle the problem as well, such as with DNA testing of dogs and street-scrubbing punishment for guilty owners. British student Joshua Browder, 19, created an easy-to-use computer app to help drivers fight parking tickets they believe unjust – and now reports that users have won 160,000 cases (out of 250,000), all in London and New York City, by following his question-and-answer “chat” interface at DoNotPay.co.uk. Browder said he was motivated to develop the app (which, as of now, is still free of charge) after himself getting about 30 tickets he says he did not deserve. The Passing Parade (1) A bicycle thief was stopped on June 10 when the bike’s owner and several other people chased him from the Wal-Mart parking lot in Eagle Point, Oregon, drawing the attention of a passing rider on horseback, Robert Borba, who joined the chase and moments later (according to a report in Portland’s The Oregonian) lassoed the man and restrained him until police arrived. (2) A kite surfer on a Sussex beach south of London got into trouble on June 26 and was unable to float back to land–until he was rescued by two Good Samaritans in kayaks. The saviors happened to be dressed as Batman and Robin, as they were participating in the Shoreham Beach Superhero Paddle. Wait, What? Not only are almost all federal employees above average, they are nearly all superior workers, according to a June Government Accountability Office review of agencies’ personnel-rating results. Yes, the review included the departments of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. Most agencies use a 1 (“unacceptable”) through 5 (“outstanding”) rating system, and GAO found that 99 percent were rated either 5 or 4 (“exceeds ‘fully acceptable’”). Not many DUI stops result in attempts to locate the suspect’s chastity belt key, but the May 14 sobriety checkpoint stop of Curtis Eidam, 35, in Clinton, Tennessee, did. Eidam was outfitted in “red, mesh, see-through hose,” according to the police report, with a ribbon tied in his goatee and also a “little skirt” (perhaps a tutu), when he told officers he needed his key, which happened to be on a necklace worn by his passenger (a “highly intoxicated” 44-year-old woman). Thus, Eidam was able to unlock and remove the chastity belt, which had been “attached to his penis.” There was also a handgun – illegal in Tennessee for an intoxicated person to carry. Cognitive Failure In a May journal article, biologists from the University of Florida and Oklahoma State University found that more than 80 percent of survey respondents want package labels on all foods that have “DNA” content–even though, yes, all meat and vegetables have DNA. The Oklahoma researcher found earlier that about the same number want such labels to be “mandatory.” Law professor Ilya Somin playfully suggests raising the fright level of those respondents by adding this “alarm” to the label they demand: “Warning: Pregnant women are at very high risk of passing on DNA to their children.” Weird Japan Client Partners is only one of several Japanese agencies that supply rental “friends” to the lonely, for hours or days of companionship tailored to the needs of the socially challenged client (with two rules, however: “no romance,” “no lending money”). A writer for AFAR travel magazine interviewed several “friends” in June, one of whom explained: “Japan is all about face. We don’t know how to talk from the gut. We can’t ask for help.” Said the female “friend” (who offered a good-bye handshake to the interviewer): “There are many people who haven’t been touched for years … who start to cry when we shake hands with them.” But It’s Our “Policy”! Good Samaritan Derrick Deanda is facing a $143 bill from paramedics in Elk Grove, California, after he, passing a car crash, jumped out to pull out a man and his three children (including a 2-year-old) who were trapped in the wreckage. A short time later the paramedics arrived and, noticing that Deanda had a cut on his arm from breaking the car’s window to free the family, bandaged him. Elk Grove has a policy charging “all patients” at a first-responder site $143 for the “rescue,” and Deanda received his bill in June. Least Competent Criminals Not Ready for Prime Time: In May, a 16-year-old boy in Lakewood, Washington, not only used Facebook to set up a marijuana-dealer robbery (one of many people, lately, to incriminate themselves on social media), but during the robbery itself accidentally shot himself in the groin and femoral artery, requiring life-saving seven-hour surgery. A News of the Weird Classic (July 2012) Slaved Over a Hot Stove: Delivering gourmet meals to customers’ doors is a fast-growing business model, but so far, only London’s brand-new (as of 2012) Housebites goes the extra step. According to its press release, cited by Huffington Post, Housebites not only home-delivers “restaurant quality” cuisine (at the equivalent of about $20 per entree), but offers an optional dirty-pans service (about $8 extra), lending out the containers in which the food was prepared – thus allowing clients to trick their dinner guests into believing the client actually prepared the meal.

It’s the ultimate David vs. Goliath story: Rudisha, the reigning Olympic and World champion, the greatest half-miler in history, and Berian, who less than two years ago was a nearly broke college dropout working at a small McDonald’s inside a Walmart in his native Colorado Springs, training on his own, his dreams his only companion. Monday the pair will likely charge toward the lead when runners break from their lanes at the top of the first backstretch, the best half-milers in the world chasing them. In the Olympic final four years, Rudisha took a similar approach, charging off the first turn, launching himself into one of the single greatest Olympic performances ever, his world record of 1 minute, 40.91 seconds comparable to Bob Beamon’s long jump in Mexico City. “That was simply an unbelievable performance,” said Sebastian Coe, owner of the 800 world record from 1979-97, at the time. “David Rudisha showed supreme physical and mental confidence to run like that in an Olympic final. Instead of just doing enough to win the race, he wanted to do something extraordinary and go for the world record as well. “Rudisha’s run will go down in history as one of the greatest Olympic victories.” Berian watched the London final while staying with his college roommate in Fredonia, N.Y., a small town on the southwestern edge of Lake Erie. After advancing to the final in Saturday night’s semifinals, Berian was asked if, as he watched Rudisha, he envisioned himself running in the Olympic final four years later. “I was thinking hopefully I could be up there,” he said. Hope was about all Berian had after he dropped out of Adams State. He was finally rescued in December 2014 by Carlos Handler and his wife Brenda Martinez, herself a World 800 medalist, who invited Berian to train with them with New Balance’s Big Bear Track Club. Sixteen months after moving to the Southern California mountains, Berian was the World Indoor 800 champion. In between Rudisha and Berian first met in a 2015 Diamond League meet in New York, in what was essentially Berian’s coming out party. “He almost took down David Rudisha,” Handler said. Rudisha won in 1:43.58 but Berian was right behind in second at 1:43.84, a time that attracted the track world’s attention, if not Rudisha’s. After the race Berian asked to take a photo with Rudisha. Rudisha blew him off initially before reluctantly agreeing after Handler persisted. “So I took a picture,” Handler recalled. “Boris said ‘I don’t want it anymore. From now on I’m going to kick his (rear end).’” Berian was more diplomatic Saturday night when asked if he could challenge the great Kenyan. “We’ll see,” he said. “He’s the world record-holder. He’s the world’s best. But I’ll give the best.” Contact the writer: sreid@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Teen in coma after getting hit by metal object through car's windshield on 57 freeway Police officer, wife die in possible murder-suicide in Long Beach Gas station employee stabbed in Anaheim, two suspects in custody Congressman Issa declares re-election win in 49th district Judge denies request by Muslim women to drop trespass claims in Urth Caffe case User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Travelers zoom past, never knowing what lies beyond, and locals start patronizing newly accessible superstores. The historic downtown Main Streets wither and fade. This has been small-town America’s fate since the 1950s. But in rural south-central Ohio, communities long hanging by a thread are finding unique ways to weave that thread into a bootstrap and pull themselves back up toward prosperity. In Nelsonville, that bootstrap might be literally attached to a boot. Rocky Shoes and Boots, founded in 1932 and now an international, publicly traded company, never left the area (not completely, anyway) and is one of several key partners in Nelsonville’s fledgling revival. In Logan, some 12 miles west of Nelsonville on U.S. 33 — the highway that hit both towns so hard — Bill Saving and other local entrepreneurs are likewise digging in. What does it take to bring new life to a ghost town? “A few people going out on a limb,” Mr. Saving said. “Logan has been hurting, but it’s slowly coming back.” When tourists amble into Saving Hardware, with its antique counters, quirky items and well-stocked shelves, he said, they tend to remark, “Oh, this is a real hardware store.” Though the sign out front has sported Mr. Saving’s family name for six decades, these days Saving Hardware must compete with the Wal-Mart 2 miles away by “doing the stuff they don’t — customer service, renting tools and repairing windows and glass.” “You gotta find your niche,” Mr. Saving said. Saving the whole region, to this regular visitor’s eyes, is its growing tourist industry. But how individual businesses and towns survive or even thrive is, yes, by finding unique niches that appeal to both locals and tourists. Logan — the bigger city, with just over 7,000 residents — is perfectly situated as the gateway to the Hocking Hills, “Ohio’s Scenic Wonderland.” Geological wonders and year-round activities draw people to abundant state parks, nature preserves and a national forest. People also flock to good restaurants more numerous than either town’s population alone could support. Logan, celebrating its bicentennial with a big fair in September, also draws crowds with oddities like the washboard music festival each June. Why washboards? Because Columbus Washboard Company — the nation’s last — still operates there. Townspeople decorate for the festival by hanging lines of laundry across the streets, but it’s really all about the roots of rock and Appalachian music. The smaller city of Nelsonville is just far enough away from Logan that it doesn’t draw as many nature tourists as it would like, said city manager Gary Edwards, but there are signs that years of fitful reinvestment might finally be reaching the proverbial tipping point. The new “eds and meds” economy is working some magic: A small OhioHealth facility is under construction at the nearby U.S. 33 interchange, and on Nelsonville’s beautiful town square, Hocking College’s hospitality studies department operates an excellent restaurant. The city manager’s favorite new story of progress, though, features the century-old high school. After its abandonment in the 1990s, a group of elderly alumnae kept it going as a multipurpose center, scraping together funds for a few windows or roof repair. In recent months, a specialty developer has bought the stately building and will renovate it with apartments and office space. The first big tenant? Rocky Brands. Manufacturing went overseas years ago, but the company will expand its call center into the repurposed school while its cool, retro-industrial outlet store continues to thrive just a block or two away. There’s one potential draw I’d like to see the city capitalize on. Roadside signs proclaim Nelsonville as “home of the famous Star Brick” but it has been years since the once-plentiful kilns were in business. Longtime homeowners who remove sidewalks and driveways of the beautiful, glazed 11-pound pavers — molded with stars, flowers or bull’s-eyes — find them snapped up for new developments like that OhioHealth facility. Ohio still has plenty of clay — ask any gardener — and Americans increasingly seek out unusual things and experiences. Ralph Boll, a brick dealer and historian, is on a crusade to revive brick-making as an interactive tourist attraction. “We have to give people a reason to visit,” he said. In this tale of two tiny cities, citizens can take heart in remembering that both Rocky Brands and Saving Hardware were founded at the bottom of the Great Depression. Hard times have a way of clarifying our choices and prodding us to take risks. The decades will prove it was worth it.

Carolyn P. Smith News-Democrat i By The Editorial Board LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story If you can get past the sight of St. Clair County Chairman Mark Kern toting a gun, which is only slightly less disturbing than the billboard image of him in a red bikini, then you find yourself reading a recent story about a gun buyback program. They took $10,000 from drug dealers, bought 100 Walmart gift cards worth $100 each and handed out one per gun. One guy was headed out to use his gift cards on a television. “Reducing gun violence is a game of inches and getting these guns off the streets gets us a few inches,” State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly said. Kelly hosted the event along with Sheriff Rick Watson, plus a few politicians who made the event for the photo op. There are arguments against these programs: Weapons often are broken and little is done to reduce actual violence, they are feel-good efforts that fail to get at the root problems and that law enforcement efforts might stop with the buyback and not get to the tougher work of checking felons for weapons. But this program did not use tax dollars and it did raise awareness. The money could have gone to other law enforcement activities, but as Kelly said this is a move in a game of inches. Plus if some guns are not in houses to be stolen or used in a family dispute or even a suicide, maybe there is more value than first meets the eye. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people. But it’s a rare day when a person kills a person with a big-screen TV.

Amazon barely makes dent in DIY stores' sales MarketWatch 8/14/2016 By Paul Ziobro Do-it-yourself chains Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. appear to have built a retail oasis mostly walled off from the reach of online behemoth Amazon.com Inc. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 779.46 -5.87 -0.75% Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▲ 71.85 +0.26 +0.36% Macy's Inc M ▲ 44.94 +0.48 +1.08% Kohl's Corp KSS ▼ 55.52 -0.14 -0.25% Their uniqueness in the retail landscape will be driven home next week as the two chains report second-quarter earnings. Analysts project sales at existing stores will rise 4.8% at Home Depot and 4% at Lowe's, according to data provider FactSet. That would mark the eighth straight quarter of at least 4% year-over-year growth for each company. Such gains are the envy of other retailers. Kohl's Corp., Macy's Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. each recently posted ongoing sales declines amid difficulty getting more people to shop in their stores. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday, is projecting a small same-store sales gain, while Target Corp., whose quarterly earnings are due Wednesday, has projected a sales dip. The retailers that have reported earnings thus far have pointed to slightly improving trends from earlier in the year. But they also have seen their business models upended by the rise of online shopping that reduces the need to visit a store for a sweater or blender. Macy's is responding by closing 100 locations. Executives from the home improvement chains cite a litany of favorable housing trends for their good fortunes. New households are being formed and housing turnover remains steady. Millennials are even willing to buy homes, albeit six years later than normal, according to Home Depot. All that spurs trips to large chains to pick out appliances and paint colors, and plan projects around the home. About two-thirds of U.S. homes are also more than 30 years old, Home Depot says, requiring more spending on upkeep. Low interest rates and rising home values -- which are now just 2% below their July 2006 peak, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices -- make replacing a roof, or even updating a kitchen, more palatable, as homeowners view their homes as investments, not expenses. Such trends have kept the home-improvement sector growing well above the broader retail market. Sales at home-improvement chains and similar stores are up 6.4% through July versus the same period a year ago, according to the Commerce Department. In contrast, overall retail sales are up 2.8% during the same period. Only drugstores and restaurants this year among brick-and-mortar locations are outrunning the home improvement stores. Online sales, of course, are growing much faster, up 10.5% at non-store retailers this year, according to the same federal data. Much of that is coming from Amazon. But the e-commerce giant doesn't have a toehold in large parts of the home improvement space, like lumber, paint and gardening supplies. Home Depot says just 25% of its business -- smaller, easy-to-ship items like power drills and small hand tools -- faces tough online competition. That doesn't mean either chain is immune to Amazon. A UBS survey in June found that 11% of consumers planning a home improvement project themselves planned to buy something from Amazon. That is far behind the 36% who said they planned to shop at Home Depot and the 21% at Lowe's, but up from just 7% a few months back.

It isn’t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise. To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That’s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers. Over the last few years, Amazon has left a trail of clues that suggests it is radically altering how it delivers goods. Among other moves, it has set up its own fleet of trucks; introduced an Uber-like crowdsourced delivery service; built many robot-powered warehouses; and continued to invest in a far-out plan to use drones for delivery. It made another splash last week, when it showed off an Amazon-branded Boeing 767 airplane, one of more than 40 in its planned fleet. These moves have fuelled speculation that Amazon is trying to replace the third-party shipping companies it now relies on — including UPS, FedEx and the US Postal Service — with its homegrown delivery service. Its logistics investments have also fed the general theory that Amazon has become essentially unbeatable in American e-commerce — no doubt one reason Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, felt the need this week to acquire an audacious Amazon rival, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. So what’s Amazon’s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping. First, it’s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency. Amazon’s longer-term goal is more fantastical — and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company’s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Bezos unveiled it on “60 Minutes” in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon. There are hurdles to realising this vision. Drone delivery in the United States faces an uncertain regulatory future, and there are myriad technical and social problems to iron out. Still, experts I consulted said that a future populated with autonomous drones is closer at hand than one populated with self-driving cars. “It’s a vastly easier problem — flying than driving,” said Keller Rinaudo, the co-founder of Zipline, a drone-delivery startup that will begin deploying a system to deliver medical goods in Rwanda this fall. “If we had regulatory permission, we’d be delivering to your house right now,” he added, referring to the San Francisco Bay Area. If Amazon’s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company’s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing — “retail stores would cease to exist,” Deutsche’s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of “The Jetsons” than our own. Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon’s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days. The 2005 introduction of Amazon’s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99 (Rs 6,610), changed Amazon’s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly. That explains why Amazon abandoned its tax-avoidance strategy earlier this decade and began building dozens of warehouses in populous areas. It also ramped up a system called “postal injection,” in which it uses prediction algorithms and complicated network analysis to figure out how to deliver every package to the US postal facility nearest a customer’s house. According to Deutsche, postal injection has allowed Amazon to slash the cost of the most expensive leg of shipping an item, the “last mile” from a warehouse to customers’ homes. So despite shipping most goods faster, between 2010 and 2015 Amazon cut its shipping costs from $5.25 (Rs 351) per box to $4.26 (Rs 267), Deutsche estimates. But that’s still not low enough. Though Amazon has released a string of stellar earnings reports recently, its shipping costs are rising, and it faces capacity constraints. During the holidays two years ago, a surge of online orders overwhelmed UPS, leading to missed deliveries. A more severe problem looms in the long run: The transportation infrastructure in the United States is aging, and the Department of Transportation has warned that unless urgent and expensive fixes are made, roads, waterways, airports and other systems will become alarmingly clogged by the 2040s. For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon’s current investments in shipping — in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars — depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure. All, that is, except for drones — which explains why they are integral to Amazon’s vision of the future of retail. I was first clued in to the importance of Amazon’s drone initiative, called Amazon Prime Air, when I met Gur Kimchi, the head of the program, at an industry conference a few months ago. Though our conversation was off the record, Kimchi’s detailed answers to my questions suggested I had been too quick to dismiss the initiative. When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon’s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space — below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country — they open up a vast new shipping lane. Beyond posting several videos, Amazon has not revealed much publicly about its drone program, but it has been working with regulators worldwide to set up tests of the system. It envisions drones being able to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight, which account for 80 to 90 percent of its deliveries. Amazon also said it has built many different kinds of prototypes for different delivery circumstances. The first rollouts will likely be in low- and medium-density areas like suburbs, where a drone might land in a backyard to drop off shoes. But the company said it was also working on systems to deliver to cities — for instance, drones could deliver packages to smart lockers positioned on rooftops. As it happens, the shipping company DHL has tested just such a drone-to-locker delivery system in Germany; a representative told me that the test was a success and that it plans to expand the technology depending on regulatory approval. Amazon’s patent filings hint at even more fanciful possibilities — drones could ferry packages between tiny depots housed on light poles, for example. Others project even wilder ideas. Ryan Petersen, the founder of the logistics software company Flexport, pointed out that Amazon had filed patents that envision using trucks as mobile shipping warehouses. Such self-driving trucks, prestocked with items Amazon has determined a given neighborhood might need, could roam around towns. When an order comes in, a drone might fly from the truck to a customer’s house, delivering the item in minutes. Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner — we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.

Andrew AbramsonContact Reporter Tim Canova holds his own in debate against Debbie Wasserman Schultz Privacy Policy Tim Canova’s months-long quest to debate Debbie Wasserman Schultz ended before breakfast Sunday morning, frustrating the law professor as much as it empowered him.  Canova finally received equal billing to his established opponent in the Democratic primary, facing her for one hour — minus commercial breaks — on WFOR-4’s Facing South Florida with Jim DeFede. With about 45 minutes of total air time in a debate that began at 8 a.m., DeFede focused on the Democratic National Committee’s e-mail scandal and Wasserman Schultz’ role in it, Canova’s lack of experience, and a few of the hottest topics in South Florida — medical marijuana, minimum wage, social security and Israel.  The time restrictions didn’t provide Canova with much of an opportunity to paint Wasserman Schultz as a shill for Wall Street and U.S. Sugar. He threw in his lobs, and called for more debates that would address issues that impact the black and Hispanic communities. Wasserman Schultz unsurprisingly turned them down, citing limited time before the Aug. 30 primary. She has little to gain from more debates. This was Canova’s one shot and it was all on Wasserman Schultz’s terms. She scheduled the debate with DeFede, forcing Canova to agree to it after he repeatedly said he’d debate anywhere, anytime. The 8 a.m. start time fuels the argument that Wasserman Schultz only wants to hold debates at inconvenient hours with limited viewership. As DNC chair, she negotiated Saturday night presidential primary debates.  Canova held his own against Wasserman Schultz, a skilled debater despite rarely having meaningful competition in her 11-year Congressional career. But there was no game changer, no moment where a soft Wasserman Schultz supporter would likely jump to Canova’s side.  That doesn’t mean that the voters in U.S. House District 23 already suspicious of Wasserman Schultz will feel at ease after Sunday’s debate.  She hardly sounds remorseful about the fallout from the DNC scandal, which forced her to resign as DNC chair on the eve of the Democratic convention. She once again argued that the leaked e-mails, depicting frustration at the Bernie Sanders campaign among DNC staffers, is secondary to the real issue of “Russian espionage.” She’s blaming the Russians for hacking the DNC. Tim Canova, Debbie Wasserman Schultz debate on WFOR-4 (Andrew Abramson) Sanders is a Canova fundraiser and Canova admitted that 90 percent of his contributions — which totaled $2.2 million on the last filing report — comes from outside of Florida. Wasserman Schultz’ last report showed $2.8 million in contributions.   Canova said he wasn’t sure how much of the 10 percent of donations raised in Florida came from District 23, which stretches from Miami Beach north of Dania Beach and as far west as Weston.    “I have not broken it down and analyzed that,” Canova said.  The district, which is heavily Democratic but favors an establishment candidate, voted 68-31 for Clinton over Sanders in the March 15th primary. That remains Canova’s toughest obstacle.  DeFede questioned Canova’s knowledge of the district. In one of the most memorable exchanges, DeFede asked Canova if he knew the name of the mayor of Southwest Ranches.  “No, I do not and I’m not going to play the game,” he balked.  Wasserman Schultz jumped in, telling Canova it’s Jeff Nelson and that “he’s an assistant principal at Cypress Bay High School.”  “I do know who my students are at Nova Southeastern University,” Canova said. “For the last four years I’ve taught hundreds and hundreds of students there. I’ve spent more time in the district in the last four years than the Congresswoman has.”  Score that one to Wasserman Schultz, who was a state representative at age 26 and is deeply embedded in the community.  Canova was also questioned on his decision to leave the Democratic party and register as an independent. He said the Democratic departure was only for one election cycle and that he’s once again a registered Democrat. He used it as an opportunity to attack Wasserman Schultz on her ties to big business.  “It was a feeling that the Democratic party had moved away from me and it had become much more corporate-dominated, quite frankly, under the Congresswoman’s leadership at the DNC,” he said.  That might play well to disillusioned liberals, but it doesn’t help Canova in the party-friendly district.  On the issues, Canova came across as a strong progressive on topics like income inequality, explaining how Wal Mart is so stingy with its workers that a large percentage of them are on food stamps. Wal Mart, in turn, is one of the largest recipients of food stamps.  Canova also favors a smart drug policy, believing that the use of marijuana and some hard drugs should be treated as a “public health issue” instead of overcrowding prisons with drug users.  Wasserman Schultz, who has been slow to embrace medical marijuana in Florida but said she now favors it, fought Canova’s argument that she is not progressive enough for South Florida.  “I have consistently stood up on behalf of the working people and fought side by side working for the people of this district,” she said.  In her district, she’s sufficiently liberal. But there’s no doubt she’s to the right of Canova on some social and economic issues. Canova’s Israel policy, and his inability to articulate a portion of it during Sunday’s debate, won’t help him with more moderate voters.  Canova wrote on his web that “the U.S. must do everything in its power to reverse the militarization of the region, including full diplomatic efforts to negotiate a general disarmament for the entire region that includes nuclear, missile, and conventional arms reductions.” Wasserman Schultz jumped on it.  “What is of the utmost importance is Israel’s security which is why it is disturbing that my opponent has been anything but certain when it comes to his position on Israel,” she said. Canova responded that he “never singled out Israel whatsoever. I would not be talking about Israel as the problem.”  “The last time I checked, Israel is in the Middle East,” Wasserman Schultz countered.  DeFede then responded that “to my knowledge, Israel is the only state in that region who has nuclear weapons.” “I’ll state categorically right now that I was not referring to Israel,” Canova said. “I am a strong defender of the state of Israel.”   Canova supports a two-state solution and said it will require “difficult compromises” by both Israel and Palestine. It’s a popular position to the far left, including many younger progressives, who have embraced pro-Palestinian causes. But in South Florida, which has one of the world’s largest Jewish populations, he didn’t help himself on the Israel question.  Canova pointed out that Wasserman Schultz, who is Jewish, voted for the Iran deal. Many of her Jewish Congressional colleagues, including Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel and Chuck Schumer, were against it.  While that doesn’t help Wasserman Schultz with some of the hard-lined Jewish community, she rightly pointed out that the deal has made Iran less of a nuclear threat, even as the United States repays a $1.7 billion debt to Iran that could potentially be used to support terrorism.  Call it a wash on Israel. Wasserman Schultz may have lost some Jewish support after backing the Iran deal, but Canova’s Israel policy won’t make him more attractive to those voters.  Canova, who filed a Federal Elections Commission complaint against Wasserman Schultz last week, continued to criticize her for using DNC resources to monitor the primary campaign. The e-mail leak showed that DNC staffers were involved in coordinated attacks against Canova.  Wasserman Schultz has denied any wrongdoing. This will continue to embolden voters who don’t trust her.  For the first time in her Congressional career, Wasserman Schultz has a Democratic opponent and he’s no pushover. Voters have two intelligent candidates to choose from and it’s unfortunate that there’s not a series of debates on the wide range of issues impacting South Florida. Fracking, an important topic in Florida, was only briefly discussed at the end of the debate. Wasserman Schultz favors it if it's "strongly regulated." Canova is against it, and his supporters have been outwardly critical of Wasserman Schultz's stance.  Canova simply didn’t and probably couldn’t do enough in the lone debate to drastically change the narrative.  Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 79°

My curiosity is piqued, it’s actually “berry flavoured” green tea, she informs me. The law practitioner is regarded as an “up-and-coming” lawyer in the field of competition law by various international legal publications, including Legal500 and Chambers Global. She was also listed as a recommended competition lawyer in Legal500, in 2015. She is soft-spoken, but her voice commands authority. I am in the presence of a leader. Her passion and enthusiasm for competition law is evident. A pioneer in her field, her work involves investigating the abuse of dominance and cartels, dawn raids and regulatory compliance. Originally from Stellenbosch, she acquired her master’s degree in commercial law at the University of South Africa (Unisa), cum laude. Her eyes light up as she explains how her career in law began. What drew you towards law and more specifically competition law? One of the most daunting things to do is to decide what to study as an 18 year old as you are so young, and you know so little of what is out there in the big wide world. I studied a BCom LLB which initially appealed to me as its broadness would give me the scope to branch out into economics, finance or law. As I really enjoyed the legal side of the degree, I then completed a two-year LLB at Stellenbosch. I also took up economics, which has been invaluable as a competition lawyer. Do you consider yourself a pioneer in the competition law space? Competition is a relatively new industry in law. It has only been around for the last 10 to 15 years, where other areas of law are well developed and have existed for hundreds of years. This presents a great opportunity for competition lawyers to make their mark early on in their careers and carve a niche for themselves within this growing area.  It’s a great area of law for development of young people. I am fortunate in that I got to be one of the people who could really excel in this industry from early on in my career. What do you enjoy most about your job? Dawn raids. I have recently done two of these. The Competition Commission arrives with police at an office, unannounced, to conduct a search and seizure operation. We go with big teams of up to 40 people. Varsity can’t prepare you for this. You need to be able to think on your feet.   I also enjoy the diversity of cases I work on. I have had clients ranging from cement manufacturers and financial institutions to poultry farmers and locksmiths. You learn so much on the job as you need to understand each industry in which you represent a client. You also need to understand your client's business. You quickly become an expert in diverse industries and businesses. You can never get bored in this job and you will never stop learning. What are some of the challenges to South Africa’s global competitiveness? There have been a few instances over the years where international companies have tried to invest in South Africa, examples include Walmart and AB InBev. Some of the issues raised in the competition sphere are related to public interest, such as job security for local workers and protection of local industry. This is a difficult balancing act to get right. On the one hand we want to protect the interests of our people and economy. At the same time we want to be an investor-friendly jurisdiction. If we are overly protective, we may lose out on opportunities. It is important that as a country we avoid uncertainty in the business environment. If we can work at being a jurisdiction of more regulatory certainty I think it would be helpful to position ourselves as a more business friendly international destination. What do you consider some of your greatest achievements? When I started my articles at Deneys Reitz, before the merging with Norton Rose in 2011, my focus was on the South African market. After the merging, we became a global law firm which exposed me to an international platform. The global nature of the firm gave me the opportunity to speak on international panels, meet international lawyers and engage with some of the top regulators in the world.  It is amazing to participate on an international platform from a legal perspective. I am fortunate to be the head of the competition team, at a relatively young age (33). I also head up the life science and healthcare group. It is an exciting place to be, there will always be a need for affordable healthcare on the continent and it is one of the areas that is growing across Africa.  Norton Rose Fulbright provides great leadership opportunities in a supportive environment and gives you freedom to have a vision and influence strategy. How would you describe your leadership style? I believe that law is a people’s business. When you are younger, you think that law is a lot about just reading and arguing, but at the end of the day, your clients are people, with problems, and the team you work with consists of people. So I would describe my style as people focused. I am also direct in the way I approach people and situations. Time is the rarest commodity in the world and I am mindful of the fact that we all have time limitations. What are some challenges you had to deal with? This is a job you have to be passionate about. Lawyers work very hard and they do not always get immediate gratification for their work. The nature of the industry is that if a client has a challenge, they need help immediately, regardless of the time. You really must be passionate and committed. The global economy has also been challenging and the legal industry has not been immune. You have to work smarter, and find more efficient ways of providing value to clients. It is an extremely competitive world and you have to be agile and provide an excellent service to come out on top. What are some major lessons you learnt? You really have to work hard, there are no shortcuts in the industry. Because it’s a people’s business, a lot of your success depends on your attitude, work ethic and ability to get along with others. Lawyers are strong personality types and it is important to not take yourself too seriously. You must learn to enjoy the environment, enjoy what you do and seize opportunities. I also think I have had to learn to be more thick skinned. The legal environment by nature is one where people disagree and take different views. It is not personal. Who inspires you? Thuli Madonsela. We need more people like her in the world. Yasmin Carrim, who is a member on the Competition Tribunal. I think she has done a good job being a regulator in the competition  area. I also admire people who come from difficult backgrounds and who enter the system and make a success of it. How do you maintain a work-life balance? It is impossible to do everything and you need to understand that something is going to have to give. It is a matter of priorities on how you spend your time. Well-being comes in different forms for different people. For me, exercise is important. I am a firm believer in family and spend time as much time as I possibly can with my family. I am fortunate to have a supportive family. Without that support structure, it would be very difficult. * August is Women's Month and Fin24, in collaboration with the Sanlam Enterprise Supplier Development Programme, invites you to help us celebrate and showcase SA's extraordinary women in business.

Published Aug 14th, 2016 8:38 am roby@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas With the wild success of fundraising in Northwest Arkansas for an Arkansas Children’s Hospital campus, CEO Marcy Doderer says there are a number of additional initiatives underway to expand children’s health services in nearly every corner of the state. Appearing on this week’s edition of Talk Business & Politics, Doderer said that the Northwest Arkansas campus is being built with future growth in mind. “We designed the campus thinking not just in the next 5 or 10 years, but really looking out 20 or 30 years,” she said. At last week’s Children’s Hospital fundraising gala in Northwest Arkansas, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said the region is on pace to grow to more than 1 million residents over the next 15 years. “If that is really the pace of growth, we will have to accelerate our plan for expansion,” Doderer said. “The building we’re designing is easily expandable. We’re actually building it such that we can grow, we can build without disrupting services that are open.” Children’s Hospital has successfully secured commitments for $53 million of its $70 million capital campaign for a facility in Springdale. Doderer says community leaders view it as an investment. “Our goal was to be at around $45 million by this time and just the generosity of spirit of the folks up there has been tremendous,” she said. “I would say, they really see it as an investment. It’s not a gift to charity to them. It really is investing in their communities, it’s investing in their families, and it’s investing in their businesses. It’s a great recruitment for the big businesses there.” However, Doderer said there is much more at work in rural parts of the state and in the capital city. “Seventy-five counties, over 75,000 kids. How do we get pediatric care close to home for all of them? The answer is not easy, but there’s a few things that are happening that I think you’ll see play out pretty shortly,” Doderer said. She noted: A USDA grant of more than $600,000 for telemedicine units in 42 rural schools statewide. It will connect school nurses with pediatricians at Children’s Hospital in real time. The program will test this fall in Benton before a larger statewide rollout to school districts with fewer than 5,000 kids. A mobile health unit that will travel in south Arkansas to provide services in rural communities without significant pediatric care, but Doderer said further donations are needed for the project.

Minyanville SPX Earnings Update: Ex-Energy, Q2 '16 Earnings Grew +0.4% By Scutify Aug 14, 2016 9:21 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. With Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) earnings report this coming week, the Q2 '16 earnings season unofficially comes to an end. Ex-Energy, (and per Factset), the S&P 500 grew earnings in Q2 '16 +0.4% and grew revenue +2.5%. Thomson Reuters data (by the numbers): Forward 4-quarter estimate: $125.88 versus $126.12 last week. P.E ratio: 17(x) PEG ratio: 11.83(x) S&P 500 earnings yield: 5.76%. The S&P 500 hasn't been above a 6% earnings yield since June 24th. Year-over-year growth of the forward estimate: +1.47% versus last week's +1.48% and still disappointingly subdued. If you are overweight Tech and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for Q2 '16 earnings, your portfolio saw a nice bounce in July. Financials, the other large market cap weighting in the S&P 500, continues to trade like it has a piano on its back. For nine months now, my own expectation for earnings growth is that the 'forward 4-quarter growth rate" would gradually start to rise, and for nine months that expectation has been wrong, even though the S&P 500 has broken out to new all-time-highs. Talk about being right for the wrong reasons. This article was written by Brian Gilmartin for Investing.com on Aug 13, 2016.

Asda, Britain's number two retailer, is offering customers a chance to be scanned and made into a detailed miniature figurine, using a 3D printer. As Joanna Partridge reports, the trial at its York store in northern England is also being closely watched by Asda's U.S. parent company Wal-Mart. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It's not what you'd usually pick up during your weekly shop - a mini version of yourself. But UK supermarket Asda is offering customers the chance to be scanned - and turned into 3D-printed figurine. They've started trialling the service at their York store in northern England. Victoria Cumberland only popped in for some tights, but decided to buy a model to give to her grandchildren. SOUNDBITE: Victoria Cumberland, Asda shopper, saying (English): "Quite why I would want one of me, but they could always stick pins in it, can't they." Having your whole body scanned takes between 2-3 minutes. The scanner takes around 15 frames a second, or 1000 per scan. The scanner can read colour as well as geometry. That means it reads the contours of the body along with the colour of the clothes you're wearing. After the scan, the image is processed by a computer and then sent to be printed with coloured ceramic fluid. Each 8-inch figure takes around 8 hours to produce and the printer can create several at once. Scanning slots were fully booked on the first trial days - with some customers travelling miles to get one. And they were many different reasons for wanting a figurine, says Phil Stout, Asda's head of Personalisation. SOUNDBITE: Phil Stout, Head of Personalisation, Asda, saying (English): "A gentleman came in, an older gentleman, came in earlier and his wife is in a care home, and he doesn't get to see his wife that often, so he wanted to do a scan to give to his wife as a present. I thought that was very touching." 3D printing is increasingly being used by industry. But Britain's second-biggest retailer believes it's the first supermarket to offer this service on a large scale and relatively cheaply. Each figure costs £40. Mark Ibbotson is Asda's Retail Director. He first saw the techology during a visit to the Innovation lab of Asda's U.S. parent company Wal-Mart. SOUNDBITE: Mark Ibbotson, Retail Director, Asda, saying (English): "Our customers are telling us they like new, they like innovation, and above all they like value. We saw an opportunity to bring a really innovative product to the market very quickly. I think we've tried all sorts of things, we've tried chocolate, we've tried printing phone cases, but this really does excite people." Wal-Mart will also be watching to see how the trial works out in the UK. But shoppers hoping for an unusual Christmas gift might be disappointed. Asda will roll out the service in the new year if it's a success - the response so far suggests it certainly will be.

August 14, 2016 at 9:08 a.m. Interesting that the inside page of today's Opinion section has a detailed and evidence supported look at the damage Voter ID laws are doing to voting rights. Voted ID laws are CAUSING fraudulent elections, disenfranchising thousands upon thousands of voters for every one possible case of voter fraud. Voter ID laws are the real frauds! Come on Greenberg, pull your head out of your backside orifice, and open your eyes to the facts about Voter ID laws and their negative affect on voters and voting. Clean that spit out of your eyes and quit spouting the lies of GOP powermongers. ( permalink | suggest removal ) ARMNAR says...

( permalink | suggest removal ) mrcharles says... August 15, 2016 at 9:51 a.m. After bus loads of kenyans came over last elections to vote for their beloved son born there in kenya, and along with other aliens from beyond our solar system [ perhaps from the realm of barbelo, you know up there that ancients thought the divine council and angels and sons of man and sons of g-d and lesser imps and grandma live] all illegally voted twice and got Obama barely elected. Then after the SCOTUS tells us that there is no effort to impair voting, as the ink dried on the decision red states exploded the integrity voting system to stop so much voting being done which is costly to tabulate. Like the great state of Kansas, government should be inconvenient so that primates will quit using it except to build weapons of peace and allow the homeless 1% have summer homes for all 4 seasons. I remember Pennsylvanian where they had perhaps hundreds of millions of cases of illegal voting and the gop , being proud mericans and christiansnot moved to stop voting by unworthy voters, or as they call it , some who might vote democratic. What is wrong with white 21 males who own property being the voting ones. PG couldn't really hear you for all the one sided as usual mobius strip non lucid attempts to show why only the white aristocrats should run and own this country- just have the guts & integrity to say it instead of making up drunken sailor reasoning. I once saw a member of a deity system be accused in the ADG of sex crime, but after using up all my fingers and toes to count them I can to the conclusion there must be fact here. I find your lack of respect for America appalling as your bully pulpit is used to create a alternate universe to make the tyranny of the elite ,that Slak hates , powerful and trod over the regular USA primate. Just be honest and tell it like it is, you want plantations back as the natural order of things. I guess I missed your column about the industrial-military complex causing deaths to our troops, the prime rib catered lunches to the CEO's who destroy a company & then get a severance package greater than the yearly salary of all teachers in LR. PG you may make Fox seem fair & balanced. ( permalink | suggest removal ) kdc72701 says... August 15, 2016 at 11:24 a.m. Timber: early retirement? The man is sneaking up on 80 yo.

Super delegates voted for Hillary even when Bernie won the popular vote. And they say it isn't rigged. As a convicted felon, I am not allowed to vote. For the first time I'm thinking that's not necessarily a bad thing. I've not been carded at a liquor store in years. Why do I suddenly now have to show my license at Wal-Mart for a beer? Liquor stores got one more jab at grocery stores. Returning Iran's own money a scandal? Google Iran-Contra affair when Reagan and Bush were in office. Please educate yourselves folks before it's too late! As senator, Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York. Her efforts fell flat. Obama vetoed bill to limit past president's spending; staffers didn't have enough time to find jobs. Democrats, Hillary included, didn't worry about mine workers! Trump's expressed adoration of Russian President Putin reminds me of the reported adoration of Hitler by some Americans before World War II. About Clinton's Omaha speech: She finally has told the truth! She would raise taxes on the middle class while Warren Buffet applauds approvingly. Lately Donald Trump keeps stepping in one pile of doo-doo after another. The worst thing about it? It's his own. Haiti still waiting for those Clinton Foundation dollars. Another Clinton bait and switch. Trump Trash is someone who uses disrespect, suggestion, inciting violence and action to promote himself at the expense of others. Losers — his followers. If Corker wants to serve in a Trump cabinet, I suggest he get to Trump's kitchen and pick out a good cabinet. One he can make great. Trump will protect my grandchildren and children. This is my top priority. What is yours? Another week of Trump imploding. Hard to believe anyone's still supporting a racist, narcissistic, and completely incompetent candidate. All over but the crying Republicans! Remember New Orleans, Nice, even Chattanooga. With all the dirty laundry all the politicians talk about each other why should any of them be in office? Shame on us the voters. Free Press, thank you very much for your post-election endorsement of Congressman DesJarlais. It helped Scott's campaign tremendously. Coolidge Park belongs to all. And the area in question is frequently used by residents not tourists. No building, please. Save the people's park! States that vote Republican tend to have the lowest levels of education. Coincidence? Does anyone else think that maybe Donald really wants Hillary to win? His behavior in the last two weeks borders on insane. Wonder what happened to the 92 percent that wanted term limits? You just re-nominated all the same old tired career politicians. Why can't we watch the Olympics without all the verbiage? Why do TVAers think they should have better benefits than the rest of us? What's this I hear about a scheme to create an exclusive school district for the Town of Signal Mountain? The National Medal of Honor Museum is struggling to raise $100 million. What chance does the local museum have to raise a tenth of that? Kudos to Ooltewah High School and HCDE in choosing Coach Williams. He epitomizes honesty, character and decency. *** Got something on your mind? Tell us about it in 25 words or fewer.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Lakeland business celebrating 75 years Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 12:01 AM By John CeballosThe Ledger LAKELAND — What started as a family-owned feed store at the corner of Florida Avenue and Pine Street in 1941 has since grown into a fertilizer business with 18 locations and 320 employees throughout the United States. But despite the nationwide growth, Harrell's LLC — a Lakeland-based producer and distributor of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals — has experienced in the subsequent 75 years, the “family-owned” part has remained consistent. Jack Harrell Jr., 60, officially took the company's reins when his father, Jack, relinquished majority control in 2000 before his death in 2003. However, the duo had already been running Harrell's together for about a decade. “Sometime in the '90s, my dad came in and said, 'I just made you president and CEO,'” Harrell Jr. said. “I said, 'Do I do anything different?' and he said, 'Nope.' I asked, 'Do I get a pay raise?' and he said, 'You already get too much.' “It was a fun time working with him and growing this company together.” Ormond and Lucile Harrell, Jack Jr.'s grandparents, purchased the former Jensen's Feed Store and transformed it into Harrell's Feed Store, which opened Aug. 1, 1941. Ormond had previously worked at Lakeland Cash Feed and he remained at the head of the company until the mid-1950s when his son Jack took over. It was around that time that Harrell's shifted its focus toward fertilizer products. The business was also doing well enough that Harrell's opened five retail garden centers: two were in Lakeland, one was in Winter Haven and two were in Pinellas County. During his commutes to and from the retail locations in Polk and Pinellas, Jack began contacting golf courses as potential clients. “At that time, the golf courses were a hobby and he used the purchasing power from that to help buy better stuff for the stores,” Harrell Jr. said. Circumstances shifted when retailers like Kmart and Wal-Mart took a sizable bite out of their retail operation. “The 'Marts were beating us up on the retail side, so the hobby became a necessity.” Harrell Jr. estimates that 65 percent of the company's current business is related to golf courses, with 25 percent having to do with ornamental nursery producers and 10 percent dedicated to lawn care operators. The company's five retail centers all closed by the end of the '80s and Harrell's Feed Store downtown followed suit in the early '90s. “There was a store manager by the name of Bill Ritter who my grandfather had hired and had been with us for more than 50 years,” Harrell Jr. said. “When he retired, we closed the feed store. It was not our focus anymore, but we kept it going because the property was bought and paid for and it provided four jobs.” In the mid-1980s, Harrell's had built the distribution and production site — 51015 New Tampa Highway, Lakeland — that also serves as its corporate headquarters. Still, Harrell Jr. has fond memories of the feed store and says his father never put pressure on him to join the family business. “Dad never pushed it, but he always told us the opportunity was there,” he said. Harrell Jr., who has been married to wife Tina for 33 years, made a similar pitch to the couple's two sons; both Jack Harrell III, 31, and Will Harrell, 29, work for the family business. “Our deal with the boys was, 'We're not forcing you to come to Harrell's, but if you want to come we'd love to have you,'” Harrell Jr. said. “But there has to be a position, and you have to be qualified.” Harrell III has been with the company for more than seven years and is the director of inventory. He says working for his father has been rewarding on several levels. “On one hand, he's a successful business owner and I've learned a lot from him in that way,” Harrell III said. “Then there's the sentimental part of working alongside my father, which can lead to some interesting father-son/employee-employer discussions. “But he's been fantastic about giving me an opportunity to succeed.” Meanwhile, Will manages corporate compliance and government affairs and has been with Harrell's for about a year. “The reason this is a great place to work is because the people on this team are excellent and the best in the industry,” Will said. Harrell Jr. attributes the company's longevity to his faith and his dedicated workforce. “I have a Christian heritage that I inherited from my father and my grandfather,” said Harell Jr., who attends Trinity Presbyterian Church in Lakeland. “And even though we've got a lot of money tied up in buildings and equipment, our biggest asset is without a doubt our people.” Tim Rice, pastor at Trinity Presbyterian, has known Harrell Jr. since the early '90s. “He's humble, he has grace, and he doesn't believe he's any better than anyone else,” Rice said of Harrell Jr. The pastor also praised Harrell's generous spirit. “You go around this community, and if there's somebody doing good for others, you'll probably see a Harrell's plaque.” Throughout its 75 years, the company has supported organizations like Central Florida Speech and Hearing, Parker Street Ministries and Lakeland Regional Health. Harrell Jr. previously served as board chairman at Lakeland Regional Health. “He remains on our board of directors and leads with others our commitment to provide safe and world-class healthcare to those we serve,” said Elaine Thompson, president and CEO of Lakeland Regional Health, via email. “Jack is a passionate, wise and caring servant for this community.” The company's reach began to expand beyond Lakeland — and Florida — at the turn of the century. In January 2001, the company broke ground on its first out-of-state location in Sylacauga, Ala.. By the start of the following year, Harrell's had also acquired a facility in Norway, S.C. The company serves 10,000 customers from its 18 locations throughout the U.S., and its products are sold throughout the world. Harrell Jr. isn't about to stop innovating or serving his community just because the company has 75 years under its belt. “My philosophy is that you always have to figure out how to grow your business,” he said. “If not, you plateau. And if you plateau, you end up going down.” — John Ceballos can be reached at john.ceballos@theledger.com or 863-802-7515.

School supplies were handed out and vaccines and health screenings were given to children. Lauren Tostenson, KHOU 10:08 PM. CDT August 13, 2016 The Back To School Fest helped thousands of local families get ready for the new school year.  (Photo: KHOU 11 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Houston Independent School District starts school a week from Monday, and many parents are scrambling to check off everything on the supply list. It’s a process that can be stressful and expensive, but on Saturday, the Mayor’s Office worked to ease that burden for underprivileged Houstonians at the Back 2 School Fest. 25,000 low-income kids from across the Houston area made their way to the UH campus Saturday to take advantage of the one-stop-shop for Fall, all for free. “As far as buying supplies like at Walmart, getting it for free is a whole lot better, and we don’t have to worry about going and getting all the supplies we have it all right here,” said father of two, Kenya Bolden. However, it’s about more than just backpacks and pencils for many of these families. HISD alone claims a 76 percent student poverty rate, so the free dental check-ups, vaccines, and vision screenings provided were a big bonus for a lot of parents. The Care Van, one of 65 participating organizations, pitched in by providing immunizations. “Since we’ve been working in Houston, the Care Van has immunized over 250,000 children,” said a Care Van representative. On Saturday, the organization added to that number, getting thousands of students squared away on all the required vaccines. Meanwhile, the city’s Bureau of Oral Health took a look at thousands of teeth. “We have 12 dental chairs set up here, and what we’re doing is screening and providing sealants on molars and other permanent teeth, and fluoride varnish,” said dentist, Johanna DeYoung. 5-year-old Hector Ramirez passed his check-up with flying colors, which was a relief for his mom Diana. “I feel great, I mean he’s ready. He’s ready to go to school.” she said.  The event was a massive effort by the city, but it was worth it, considering it led to a massive burden lifted off thousands of needy families.

Baby found dead after being left all day in hot SUV in Texas Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit HELOTES, Texas – Authorities have released the name of an infant boy who died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot. The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office on Saturday identified the 6-month-old infant as Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police say the baby’s father told officers he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday at the store. When the father returned to his SUV at 3 p.m., he found his child dead. A cause of death had not yet been determined, and no charges have been filed. The death brings the toll of children dying in hot cars this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Other strategies include keeping a stuffed animal in the car seat and placing it in the front seat when the child is strapped in as a reminder that the child is there. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn’t show up, she said.

Walmart’s fault? The Schuette’s Market store in Carlyle is closing. Provided i By Brian Brueggemann bbrueggemann@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A grocery store that has operated in Carlyle for more than 70 years is closing. Schuette’s Markets, which also operates grocery stores in Troy, Highland and Breese, is closing its Carlyle location. Tessa Wiegman, vice president of administration for Schuette’s, said the Carlyle store has begun selling inventory at reduced prices. She expects the store to be closed by the end of August. “It was a tough decision for my family to make,” Wiegman said. “It was not made easily, I can tell you that.” She added, “It was kind of a plethora of reasons. First of all, the traffic in Carlyle has kind of shifted away from downtown. The people who come to Carlyle to utilize the lake, they have no reason to come downtown.” Carlyle has two other grocery stores, including a Super Walmart located closer to the lake. On the Carlyle store’s Facebook page, a number of Facebook users placed the blame squarely on Walmart. “We agree,” the store replied in one post. “It is sad for the community. Soon there will be very few independently-owned, mom-and-pop businesses.” &nbsp; The Carlyle store has been a fixture at the intersection of Illinois 127 and old U.S. 50. Under Schuette ownership, it was a Piggly Wiggly for many years, and then a Super Valu. In the past couple of years, the Schuette company has changed the name of all of its Supervalu stores to Schuette’s Markets. Schuette owns the Carlyle building and will be trying to sell it. “We have been talking with private companies to sell it. We will be putting it up for sale if we’re not able to sell it to these private companies,” Wiegman said. Wiegman said there are no plans to close any of the other Schuette’s locations. “Oh, no, no, no. All of the other stores are doing very well. We’re excited that we can focus on those now,” Wiegman said. She said all of the Carlyle employees have accepted positions at other Schuette’s Market locations, except for one, who was semi-retired and has chosen to fully retire. Several of the employees are going to the Breese store. “We know that a lot of our customers at Carlyle really like the employees there,” Wiegman said. “We’d be happy if those customers transitioned to the Breese store.” We know that a lot of our customers at Carlyle really like the employees there.

Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recent recovery. Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety. Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the health of the economy and a decline in corporate earnings. That hasn’t stopped them from setting records, but it has kept investors wary. “The market has run up in anticipation of better earnings ahead,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for TIAA Investments. “If those earnings don’t come, we have the Wile E. Coyote moment where we’re off the cliff … and we’re gonna fall.” The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 59.58 points or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The Nasdaq composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02. Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in the books, with this week’s releases from retailers Home Depot, Walmart and Target among the last to appear. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter and investors don’t expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they are starting to expect improvement after that. U.S. crude jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed an update with regulators Monday on its roughly $130 billion U.S. stock portfolio. Berkshire said it held 15.2 million Apple Inc. shares at the end of June, up from the 9.8 million share stake it first disclosed in the spring. The Apple investment raises eyebrows because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies. It may have been the work of one of Berkshire’s two other investment managers. The quarterly filings don’t disclose who is managing Berkshire’s Apple investments, and Berkshire officials don’t generally comment on the filings. Buffett tends to handle the larger investments in Berkshire’s portfolio, such as IBM, Wells Fargo and Coca-Cola. He has said that investments of less than $1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each handle about $9 billion for Berkshire. At the end of June, Berkshire held 78.8 million Phillips 66 shares, which represents about 15 percent of the oil refiner’s stock. That’s up from 75.6 million shares three months earlier. Buffett’s company cut its Walmart Stores Inc. stake to 40.2 million shares in June from 55.2 million in the spring. During the second quarter, Berkshire also made several other changes in its portfolio, including: — Increasing its stake in Douglas County-based Liberty Media Corp. to 37.5 million shares from 30 million. — Reducing its Suncor Energy Inc. holdings to 22.3 million shares from 30 million shares. — Increasing its stake in Liberty Global PLC, which has its U.S. headquarters in Denver, to 30.7 million shares from 23.8 million. Besides investments, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies in a variety of industries, including insurance, utilities, BNSF railroad, furniture and jewelry.

Brown Norm Rothery Jason Heath Home News New CCB to boost back-to-school shopping New CCB to boost back-to-school shopping Retailers to see 4.5% increase this year   0 by Peter Goffin, The Canadian Press August 15th, 2016 Online only.   0 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email TORONTO – Retail experts are forecasting an increase in Canadian back-to-school spending this summer thanks in part to the low loonie and the new Canada Child Benefit. Business consulting firm EY, formerly Ernst and Young, predicts that retailers will see a 4.5 per cent increase this year over 2015 sales as students stock up for another year in the classroom. EY’s forecast is based on factors that include province-by-province employment numbers, housing markets and consumer spending habits over the past 12 to 18 months, said EY’s Daniel Baer in a recent interview. EY also asked retailers across the country for their own sales trends and expectations. Back to school is the second-biggest shopping season after Christmas, Baer said. “What we’ve been seeing is stronger retail sales for a few reasons,” said Baer. “The Canadian economy has been relatively strong (and) there’s been some more government spending in terms of child-care benefits … putting money into the hands of families.” Calculate how much Canada Child Benefit you'll get This year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replaced existing child-care benefits with a program that will see the average family get $2,300 per year. The new Canada Child Benefit is expected to push tens of thousands of Canadian children above the poverty line, and could help stimulate the economy. The weak loonie has also encouraged more Canadians to shop on this side of the border instead of going to the U.S. to stock up on supplies or buying from American online retailers, Baer said. And a number of Americans are travelling north to shop in order to take advantage of the exchange rate, too, giving a further shot in the arm to the Canadian economy. EY doesn’t expect all provinces to reap the rewards of increased back-to-school spending. The struggling oil-and-gas industry and rising unemployment in the Prairies point to lower spending, especially in Alberta, said Baer. But Alan Middleton, a marketing professor at York University’s Schulich School of Business, said back-to-school spending is relatively immune to a weak economy. “They may not get the top-of-the-line laptop … if (they are) under economic threat, but there’s still going to be a whole bunch of other stuff they’re (buying),” he said. Electronics stores might see fewer people shopping for new tablets or laptops, but big-box retailers like Walmart will still sell the same number of essential items, said Middleton. “Clothing, uniforms, paper, crayons, the whole caboodle is really quite economy-insensitive,” he said. “People have to buy them.” Federal budget winners and losers: Canada Child Benefit Another factor that fuels back-to-school sales is the constant growth of the length of the season. “If you go back a decade or a decade and a half, you probably didn’t really see anything happen until the last week in August,” said Middleton said. “Now you’re going to see it after the August holiday weekend.” Stores use a marketing pitch of “don’t wait to get it, we have good deals now,” he added. Retailers don’t want everyone to cram into their stores at the last minute because the crowds put off some shoppers, Middleton said. “Whereas if some people buy some stuff early, the observation is they’re still buying even at the end (of the back-to-school season). So the total amount of buying builds up.” Baer agreed that back-to-school promotions are starting earlier and ending later. “You’re seeing a lot of promotions starting in July and going to the middle of September, even after school has started again.” Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Email | 15 Aug 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 15 August 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Tim Cook gives an unusually personal interview to the Washington Post, CVS launches its own mobile payment system, and Microsoft’s Project Murphy creates face mashups you describe. It’s Lonely at the Top of Apple -- Apple CEO Tim Cook sat down with Jena McGregor of the Washington Post to commemorate his fifth anniversary as Apple’s head honcho. The usually private Cook opened up in this wide-ranging interview, discussing his mistakes, who he asks for advice, and what he think Steve Jobs would be up to today. Cook mentioned that the job could be lonely, but he was quick to add, “I’m not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don’t need any sympathy.” Read/post comments CVS Launches Apple Pay Competitor -- Pharmacy chain CVS, a member of the Merchant Customer Exchange consortium behind the failed CurrentC Apple Pay competitor, has launched its own mobile payment platform. CVS Pay is part of the CVS Pharmacy app for iOS that combines access to your debit or credit card, ExtraCare rewards card, and a Health Savings or Flexible Spending account. Like CurrentC and Walmart Pay, CVS Pay uses barcodes to transmit information. Interestingly, since CVS manages Target’s pharmacies, when Target implements Apple Pay support later this year, you won’t be able to use Apple Pay at their pharmacies. Read/post comments Project Murphy Photoshops Faces on Command -- Microsoft has created a new experimental chatbot, called Project Murphy, that you converse with via Facebook Messenger, Skype, or Telegram. The image-morphing technology underlying Project Murphy is impressive, but the results can be wonderfully silly since the bot merges the faces in two images to create hypotheticals of personal scenes you describe. For instance, try “What if Oprah were Miss Piggy,” “What if Tim Cook were Superman,” or “What if Steve Jobs were very old?” You can even upload your photo to use in “What if” questions for 10 minutes. Project Murphy is a lot of fun, especially if (like us) you’re not good at image manipulation apps like Photoshop. Read/post comments   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Photo / AP Wall Street touched intra-day record highs as equities are still considered the best bet for investors as the US Federal Reserve is seen as keeping its interest rates on hold for now. "Stocks have retained a hot pitch and there's a lot of demand for equities," Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income for National Alliance Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. "The question is how you make money in a low interest rate environment, and equities might be expensive, but they're the least dirty shirt." The minutes of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting are scheduled to be released on Wednesday, and might offer fresh clues on the chance of a rate hike this year. The odds of a hike in September stand at 12 per cent, rising to about 38 per cent for December, Reuters reported, citing CME Group's Fedwatch tool. Wall Street rose. In 3.22pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 per cent. In 3.07pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 0.4 per cent. Gains in shares of DuPont and those of Caterpillar, last up 1.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively, propelled the Dow higher. Bucking the trend were shares of Wal-Mart and those of UnitedHealth, down 0.8 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively, for the biggest percentage declines in the Dow in late afternoon trading. Oil also gained, helping energy stocks, amid renewed optimism that the world's key producers might coordinate a lid on output. "While we see very little possibility of an actualisation of curtailed OPEC output, there will likely be enough chatter during the next five to six weeks to deter selling in allowing WTI to gravitate at around the US$45 area, at least through the second half of this month," Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, told Reuters. The question is how you make money in a low interest rate environment, and equities might be expensive, but they're the least dirty shirt. Shares of Twitter jumped, up 7 per cent as of 3.20pm in New York, after a New York Times report that the company was in talks with Apple to bring its app to Apple TV. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session moving almost 0.1 per cent lower from the previous close. France's CAC 40 index slipped 0.1 per cent. Germany's DAX index rose 0.2 per cent, while the UK's FTSE 100 index increased 0.4 per cent. "Now that the Bank of England has joined the European Central Bank in pushing rates lower, stocks will become that much more attractive, whether or not you think they're overvalued," Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets in London, told Bloomberg. - BusinessDesk By Margreet Dietz Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Would You Pay $25 A Pound For Shrimp Raised Locally Indoors? Image courtesy of tjean314 August 15, 2016 3:52 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk to scrimp or to shrimp? shrimp local shrimp seafood seafood production You don’t have to be a shrimp boat captain to bring the crustaceans to market: with concerns over the environmental impact as well as slave labor in the international shrimping industry, some are trying out new methods of shrimp production, including raising them in indoor tanks. NPR’s All Things Considered profiled an indoor shrimp farmer named Jean Claud Frajmund, who set up production in an old mattress factory in New York’s Hudson Valley area. He likens the dim, windowless environment to a spa for the shrimp: there’s plenty to eat, clean water, no predators, and no pollution. He works 13 hours a day testing water quality, temperatures, and checking the filters, along with three employees, and says as such, it’s not a simple process keeping the shrimp swimming happily and healthily. “It’s really delicate,” he told NPR. “We have to be very diligent, watch the temperature, watch the dissolved oxygen, do water tests and correct if needed. And we never had any chemicals. The correction basically – is basically baking soda in order to keep the pH in the right level.” They grow quickly to full size, and are harvested every Saturday by Frajmund. Once he’s fished them out and packed them up in ice, he drives to the Union Square Market in New York City to sell them for $25 a pound (in comparison, a two-pound bag of frozen shrimp at Walmart goes for $14.98, whereas at Whole Foods a pound might of frozen jumbo shrimp was priced at about $19 when Consumerist called a NYC location). That price is worth it, says one of his customers. “It’s local. It’s sustainable, and the flavor is really great. So it’s worth the value,” she told NPR.” To that end, Frajumd says he sells 300 pounds a week, “no problem.” Take Our Poll Indoor Shrimp Production Opens New Possibilities For Food [All Things Considered] August 15, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk to scrimp or to shrimp? shrimp local shrimp seafood seafood production Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related crimes against meat Shrimp Shoplifter Stuffs Shellfish Down Pants, Up Shirt you are what you eat That “Wild Gulf Shrimp” You Bought Might Actually Be Farmed Whiteleg Shrimp shrimp coketail Drug-Sniffing Dogs Find Shipping Container Full Of Cocaine-Stuffed Shrimp of course there's video Man Shoved 5 Bags Of Frozen Shrimp Down His Pants At Family Dollar it never ends Shrimp Mayonnaise Doritos: Yet Another Bewildering Flavor You Won’t Find In The U.S. Previous The FDA Doesn’t Actually Have The Power To Recall Cosmetics That Harm People Next Citi Can’t Stop AT&T From Saying “Thanks”… For Now Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

August 15, 2016 16:15 ET Terra Tech Reports Record Second Quarter 2016 Results Company Sees Revenue Growth of 93% to $9.7 Million NEWPORT BEACH, CA--(Marketwired - August 15, 2016) - Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) ("Terra Tech" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company, today announced its second quarter 2016 financial results for the period ending June 30, 2016. Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech, commented, "We reported record revenues of $9.7 million in the second quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 93% compared to the prior year period. This excellent result was primarily driven by higher cannabis sales from our two new Blum dispensaries in Oakland, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition, our overall gross margins also grew from 5% to 17% year-over-year. This was the first reporting period that our top-line results benefited from our brick-and-mortar retail store locations and we are very pleased with the traction our dispensaries have generated. We expect to experience further benefits from our vertically-integrated, seed-to-sale structure, such as improved margins and better brand recognition in the market, as our retail operations scale. Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, we will open a further three Nevada-based dispensaries by the end of the summer season, including our next location at 3650 South Decatur Boulevard, Suite 6 & 7, Las Vegas, Nevada, which will host its Grand Opening later this week, on August 20th, 2016. "We ramped production of our IVXX Vape Product lines during the second quarter, with the launch of two pre-filled cannabis oil cartridge lines. These are sold in our Blum retail locations, as well as through our wholesale distribution network. We plan to build out our wholesale business and expand our product lineup throughout the second half of 2016 to grow market share," continued Mr. Peterson. "The Edible Garden segment also reported strong growth in the second quarter as our strategic initiatives took hold. We expanded our product lines to include SUPERLEAF™, a nutritionally-enhanced lettuce sold at ShopRite, and various vitamin and dietary supplement lines. We also invested in sales and marketing to drive brand awareness as we build out our operations," concluded Mr. Peterson. Financial Update: Total revenues generated for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $9.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same period in 2015. This is an increase of 93% from the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The increase in second quarter revenues was primarily attributable to sales from the acquisition of the Blüm dispensary in Oakland, California, which closed on April 1, 2016, and sales from the Western, Las Vegas Blum dispensary which opened during the quarter. Second quarter revenues also benefited from higher Edible Garden sales of its produce, herbs and floral products. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 amounted to approximately 17%, compared to a gross margin of approximately 5% for the second quarter of 2015. The improved margins were attributable to better margins at Edible Garden, as the business continues to scale and higher gross profit from the cannabis segments of Blum and IVXX. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2016 amounted to approximately $5.5 million, compared with approximately $3.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in consultants' fees mostly paid in common stock due to the appreciation in the market price and an increase in salaries due to new hires associated with the Blum dispensaries, and other expenses. These increases were offset by a decrease in legal fees and a decrease of $1.15 million for no warrants issued in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 versus the warrants issued in 2015. We realized an operating loss of approximately $3.8 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to an operating loss of approximately $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2015. The net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was approximately $4.9 million or $0.01 per share compared with a loss of approximately $2.8 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The primary reason for the increase in net loss is an approximately $1.2 million loss from the fair market valuation of derivatives during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year's second quarter, and operating cost at our Western, Las Vegas Blum dispensary. Stockholders' equity for the second quarter of 2016 amounted to approximately $41.5 million, compared with approximately $6.3 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to the Blum Oakland acquisition reduced by the current quarters' loss. Short-term debt as of June 30, 2016 amounted to approximately $628,000, a decrease of approximately 32% compared to approximately $917,000 as of December 31, 2015. Long term debt increased from zero to $1.6 million during the first six months of 2016.

The odds of a hike in September stand at 12 percent, rising to about 38 percent for December, Reuters reported, citing CME Group's Fedwatch tool. Wall Street rose. In 3.22pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent. In 3.07pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent. Gains in shares of DuPont and those of Caterpillar, last up 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, propelled the Dow higher. Bucking the trend were shares of Wal-Mart and those of UnitedHealth, down 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent respectively, for the biggest percentage declines in the Dow in late afternoon trading. Oil also gained, helping energy stocks, amid renewed optimism that the world’s key producers might coordinate a lid on output. "While we see very little possibility of an actualisation of curtailed OPEC output, there will likely be enough chatter during the next five to six weeks to deter selling in allowing WTI to gravitate at around the US$45 area, at least through the second half of this month," Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, told Reuters. Shares of Twitter jumped, up 7 percent as of 3.20pm in New York, after a New York Times report that the company was in talks with Apple to bring its app to Apple TV. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session moving almost 0.1 percent lower from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 index slipped 0.1 percent. Germany’s DAX index rose 0.2 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 index increased 0.4 percent. “Now that the Bank of England has joined the European Central Bank in pushing rates lower, stocks will become that much more attractive, whether or not you think they’re overvalued,” Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets in London, told Bloomberg.

As reported by Americans for Tax Reform, the United States Olympic Committee awards monetary prizes to those athletes who medal: $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze. Related: Serena Williams and the 9 Most Successful Entrepreneur Athletes So with five golds and one silver around his neck, doggy paddle specialist Michael Phelps is set to swim home with $140,000 in his pockets. (Speedos have pockets, right?) But don’t go blowing all of that in the arm floaties section of Wal-Mart, Michael. Your pals at the IRS are going to want to take a bite of your historic medal count. Americans for Tax Reform unhappily notes that using a tax rate of 39.6 percent, "victory tax" would be $9,900 for gold, $5,940 for silver and $3,960 for bronze. Those numbers could be smaller for athletes in lower tax brackets, but given Phelps' net worth of $55 million, it looks like the human fish will be on the hook for the full $55,440 tax bill.  Taxes Federal Government News and Trends Michael Phelps Rio Olympics 2016 Get the Magazine Limited-Time Offer: 1 Year Print + Digital Edition and 2 Gifts only $9.99 Subscribe Now Company Advertise Brand Licensing Contact Us Staff Contribute Upcoming Events Entrepreneur 360™ Livestream Growth Strategies On-Demand Event Products Business Books Reprints & Licensing Classifieds Entrepreneur Lending Entrepreneur Coaching Editions United States Middle East India Español Philippines South Africa China Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Flickr Tumblr RSS Feedly Subscribe Now Gift Subscriptions Subscriber Services Digital Editions iOSAndroidKindle Copyright © 2016 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.
