Within weeks of enrolling in the class, Rexford had more advanced knowledge of how rail, air, maritime, warehousing and e-commerce are used to meet key business objectives. He knew the importance of accounting for weather, vibration and other factors when getting a product from one point to another. He started looking at ways to optimize how freight was handled at the distribution center. He began to make plans to complete an Associate of Applied Science degree in logistics and supply chain technology at Lee College, and he convinced his son to sign up for the training course and pursue a degree, too. “You’re not just moving a box,” said Rexford, one of 17 Walmart warehouse managers who will be the first to graduate from the training program in December. “You’re learning how to move a box differently, in the face of different obstacles and to achieve different goals.” It’s the primary lesson that Keith Coleman, director of the Lee College Logistics Program, intended to impart to his students when he designed and launched the Walmart training course: logistics encompasses a broad spectrum of transportation, storage and distribution activities that companies use to move products as cheaply and quickly as possible. With the development and implementation of new technologies, like drones and driverless vehicles, successful logistics professionals will need the vision and understanding to think beyond the traditional. “In the military, the faster and more effectively you can move things, the more lives are saved. In the business world, money is saved – but industry executives are not trained logisticians,” said Coleman, a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer who has overseen steady growth of the logistics program at Lee College and will soon open a full-scale Logistics Training Center on campus. “Logisticians see the whole picture,” Coleman said. “They create the game plan. They are the problem solvers. Being in this program allows these students to get hands-on and see a future for themselves. They’ll remember Lee College as the place where they got the training that made a difference.” In addition to technical knowledge, the logistics training for Walmart managers also aims to help strengthen leadership and communication skills. Coleman frequently assigns role-playing exercises that simulate a wide range of on-the-job scenarios between supervisors and employees, as well as presentations that require students to dress professionally and practice public speaking. Many say their confidence and ability to guide and instruct others have improved as a result. “When you come to work, you know who has been taking the training because you can see that we’re growing and learning,” said Jerry Duarte. “We’re using different terminology, thinking more quickly and being more creative.” For Amanda Erne, getting back into the classroom for logistics training at Lee College made her realize that seeking additional education was long overdue. The encouragement from Walmart and camaraderie she and her colleagues in the program have built made returning to college less intimidating and more rewarding than she expected. “We tend to have a more narrow view of our jobs; we know what we do, but we don’t know why we do it,” said Erne, who now aspires to a life-long career as a logistician – just like all the Baytown Distribution Center managers in the class. “This program has given us a wider perspective and deeper understanding of how logistics works.” Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

News Sports Life Obituaries E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Super construction will lead to summer opening for Barstow Wal-Mart Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 1:10 PM Oct 31, 2016 at 4:54 PM Mike Lamb @mlambdispatch BARSTOW — The Super Wal-Mart under construction next to the present Wal-Mart on Montara Road and East Main Street should be ready to open by next summer, according to a city official. Consulting City Engineer Brad Merrell told the City Planning Commission on Monday the new building should be ready by May or June. He said that would give Wal-Mart a month to transfer everything from the present store to the new building. "Once that is done, they will demolish the old building. That will bring us in compliance," Merrell said. Economic Development and Planning Manager Gaither Loewenstein told the commission the eight retail pads are located where the present store stands. "Although there are letters of intent being signed with retailers now, the actual construction — most of those would occur until after the existing Wal-Mart is demolished. The Super Wal-Mart is opening the summer of 2017 and my suspicion would be the following summer for the additional retailers," Loewenstein said. Merrell said there is a lot of work to be done after the demolition of the old building. "They also have to haul 80,000 (cubic) yards of dirt," he said. "There is a lot of grading that has to go on after the building comes down. So they can lower the pads for the shopping center to where it's more in line to where the new building is. There is about 75 feet of fall across that property. So they are trying to make that up. They brought in a lot of dirt to fill for the new building." Meanwhile, road construction on East Main Street and Montara Road continues. Merrell said Shames Construction will soon start paving of East Main Street from the Super Wal-Mart site toward the Marine Corps Logistics Base. "There is going to be quite a few weeks left of working on East Main and there will be two-way traffic with flagging," he said. Merrell also said work crews will also be cutting into Montara Road in front of the AMPM to put a tie into the sewer. He said that probably won't start until Nov. 7. After that is complete, Merrell said a vault will be installed to replace the fiber optics. "They also have a new traffic signal to put in. That will be at the westbound offramp on the I-40 and Main Street. One of the conditions of Wal-Mart was to place a new traffic signal at that intersection in front of the hotel there," Merrell said.

The Index of Consumer Sentiment hit 87.2 in October, according to the University of Michigan on Friday, the lowest level since October 2014. Economist expected the consumer sentiment index to hit 88.2 in October, down from 91.2 in September final reading, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. The decline was due to "less favorable prospects" for the national economy, with half of all consumers expecting an economic downturn within the next five years, according to the survey. "Objectively, the probability of a downturn during the next five years is far from zero-this would be the longest expansion in 150 years if it lasted just over half of the five year horizon. Nonetheless, the October rise may simply reflect a temporary bout of uncertainty caused by the election," Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement. The report said if interest rates rise in December, it will have a "minimal impact" on spending. It said consumers also expect a small slowdown in job creation that is likely to prevent any more declines in the unemployment rate. "Overall, real personal consumption expenditures can be expected to increase by 2.5 percent through mid 2017," Curtin said. The monthly survey of 500 consumers measures attitudes toward topics like personal finances, inflation, unemployment, government policies and interest rates.

Intel Leads Tech and Telecom Green Power Rankings Related Topics All EL Stories Clean Energy Climate Environmental Policy & Law Feature Solar Energy Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Utilities Wind Energy The corporate community is leading the green energy economy. Today, nearly 1,300 organizations are partnering with the US Environmental Protection Agency to either generate or buy green energy. The result, according to EPA: lowering carbon emissions and greater brand equity, making the proposition a win-win scenario. “By using green, an organization not only can dramatically reduce its carbon footprint but it may be able to save money, stand out from competitors, and meet corporate environmental goals, which is of growing importance to stakeholder groups such as customers, Wall Street analysts, shareholders and employees,” says EPA. Some of the leaders: Intel, Kohl’s Department Stores, Whole Foods Market, the city of Houston and Dell. Take Kohl’s: It is one the world’s largest retail solar hosts, says EPA, with solar panels that are placed in stores in not just on the West Coast in California but also on the East Coast in New Jersey and Connecticut. Wisconsin is another key location. Much of that is through power purchase arrangements, where a third party generates the electricity that is bought over a period of years by Kohl’s. That gives the developer a guaranteed income stream while it allows the retailer to keep its prices in check. Wal-Mart is another big box retailer that is active in the green market. It is purchasing wind power from a Duke Energy wind farm in Texas, which supplies the retailer with 15% of its electricity needs in that state alone. Nationally, Wal-Mart says that it gets 25% of its energy from renewables and that it has a goal of 100%. And according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wal-Mart and Target are the two biggest installers of solar power in the nation. They have installed 145 megawatts and 147 megawatts, respectively, it adds. “Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio,” said Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart. “This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam’s Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business. Being recognized by the SEIA for our efforts is confirmation that we are moving in the right direction with regards to renewable energy, specifically solar.” “At Target, sustainability is a principle that drives the decisions we make across the company – from the products we make to the way we run our business,” adds John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target. “We’re incredibly proud of the progress we’ve made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress.”  More than 860 utilities offer green power programs to their customers, says the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That is giving more than half of the electricity customers nationwide the option to buy renewable energy from a provider. Eco-minded businesses are snatching up the credits. Software manufacturer SAP says that it has a goal of getting to 100% green fuels while Microsoft says that it now gets 80% of its electricity from renewables. As the technologies are getting incorporated by the nation’s bigger companies, they are subsequently becoming more and more accessible to all businesses. And with that trend, the New Energy Economy has taken root and will only sprout higher.

Tami Denny posted a video to Facebook showing the Sunday evening scene at the Walmart parking lot, where hundreds of blackbirds were covering the pavement and parked vehicles like a scene out of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. "Unbelievable! Invasion of the blackbirds," she said in the video. Denny experiments at the end of the video with honking her horn, which predictably causes the birds to fly away from her vehicle. "This is crazy....they were on every car in the parking lot AND on the ground," Denny wrote in the video's description. Denny said she's seen similar gatherings around town. "I have seen this before at Walmart, but I've also seen it at Neiman Marcus, the Galleria and they used to be down in Saks," she told KTRK-TV. Hannah Bailey, head of the bird collection for the Houston Zoo, said blackbirds gather for numerous reasons, including to find food, to search for warmer areas as the temperatures cool, and for safety in numbers. "They are part of our environment and help with insect control throughout our area, so while they might be messing up your car, remember they are eating bugs and mosquitoes, so be happy for that," Bailey said.

And world roamers have taken to an online forum to do just that, sharing their anecdotal reasons as to why certain places left a bad taste in their mouths. Destinations cropped up from every corner, from Egypt - described as being 'smelly with aggressive shop vendors' - to America, where one visitor said people are 'fake' and Walmart shoppers are 'scary'. One tourist wrote of the Russian city of Vladivostok (pictured): 'Most sightseeing consists of numerous soviet monuments, which are as fun as sitting on the couch and observing a wall' Despite its rich culture and the lure of its pyramids, Egypt was one of the destinations that came up most often on the Quora forum thread.  'You get off the plane and immediately everything smells like garbage mixed with soot,' one claimed, adding: 'The local currency I bought at the airport was like dirty grey-pinkish crumpled napkin'.  Another lamented the street vendors, writing: 'They would pretty much grab you off the street into their store and “help” you try on things - a lot of touching involved. Rejection is not exactly understood and they have a strong grip.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Traveller set to become the fastest female to visit EVERY... Doors flying open at 70mph and trains with no timetable:... Share this article Share America, too, attracted its fair share of complaints from visitors. One holidaymaker complained: 'Places I’ve been to (every single one of them) were stained with the smell of weed. It was literally everywhere - in hotel rooms, on the beach, at parking lots.'  She went on: 'Fake friendliness everywhere - they smile as long as you are paying, but talk behind your back. The people freaked me out sometimes. Walking around in Walmart was scary as hell!' Despite its rich culture, Egypt (pictured) was one of the destinations that came up most often, with one writing: 'You get off the plane and immediately everything smells like garbage' Luxembourg, a small European country bordering France and Germany, was another country which was covered a few times. 'What this place lacks is liveliness,' one stated. 'We were bored. The trains were half empty, the restaurants were looking dull and the people were unresponsive.' The people freaked me out sometimes - walking around in Walmart was scary as hell! Another wrote: 'Luxembourg grabs the top spot. Lived there for a year. Dreadful weather, dreadful food, only finance people and banks.' In a similar vein, one remarked of Liechtenstein: 'I’m aware that people [there] have a high income and a great lifestyle. So they can wipe off their tears of boredom with their money.' Another concurred, writing: 'A bunch of empty houses for the rich to keep a residency for tax purposes and a bunch of cruise ships.'  A tourist wrote of Luxembourg (pictured): 'We were bored - the trains were half empty, the restaurants were looking dull and the people were unresponsive' Switzerland also got a look-in, for being perhaps too idyllic. 'It's a lovely country but I constantly feel as if I have an inferiority complex when I'm there,' one remarked. 'Just a little too perfect for my taste.' Further afield, one traveller took a stab at Canada, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one.  Chile bored me to death in spite of its beautiful landscapes  'There weren’t enough overly large meals of predominantly fried foods,' he stated. 'There weren’t enough guns, people were too polite (and kept apologising!!), they insisted on Arabica coffee [and] it got bloody cold.' Chile was mentioned more than once as being a somewhat reserved place to visit. 'Walk through a crowded market in Santiago or a monument - people just murmur, take a metro - its pin drop silence,' one wrote. 'Finally for the last battering, the food and (lack of alcoholic) drinks.  'Just like a very nice but emotionally unreceptive person makes a bad life-partner, Chile bored me to death in spite of its beautiful landscapes and polite people.' Another tourist said the same about the Russian city of Vladivostok, remarking: 'Most sightseeing consists of numerous soviet monuments, which are as fun as sitting on the couch and observing a wall.' Several tourists bemoaned the rude taxi drivers in places including Panama, Jamaica and Paris (stock image) One noted that their trip to Bahrain had been sullied by Ramadan - an Islamic period of fasting during daylight hours. 'I mistakenly believed [this] wouldn’t apply to foreigners. I was wrong,' they wrote. 'I couldn’t eat or drink anything while outside the airport. This eliminated one of the main pleasures of travelling to a new country. '  I mistakenly believed Ramadan wouldn’t apply to foreigners. I was wrong Several tourists bemoaned the rude taxi drivers in places including Panama, Jamaica and Paris. And one wrote of Malaysia: 'We got thrown out of taxi just for closing the trunk too fast.' And last but not least, the case of a traveller with a seemingly indestructible spirit, who said he couldn't name a single place he wouldn't return to.  'I was in Turkey a couple of years ago and got tear-gassed by the police two nights in a row,' he wrote. 'But that was an experience and it didn't put me off going there again.'  Read more: What countries will you not visit ever again? - Quora Share or comment on this article e-mail 5.1k shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

(Jefferson County Jail) Print Email Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com By Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com The Birmingham News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 28, 2016 at 6:00 AM, updated October 28, 2016 at 9:26 AM comments You've heard of Nigerian scammers? Well police believe some are based right here in small-town Alabama. It's a complex investigation of a complex set of cons, but Adamsville authorities say a trio of people in that Jefferson County city helped bilk hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting Americans and wired the cash to criminals – perhaps even terrorists -- in Nigeria. Adamsville police first became aware of wrongdoing in September of 2014 when a man in Chippewa County, Minnesota filed a report with sheriff's deputies there about a potential scam. The victim told investigators he learned he had won a $100,000 lottery, but in order to collect that money he had to fork over $2,462.50. He did so via a Walmart MoneyGram, and the recipient was to a woman named Jacinta Girrado Derby, a 57-year-old Adamsville woman. Det. Rick Whitfield said they looked into the case, but there wasn't immediately anything that could be done. They kept an eye out for any other similar complaints, but there weren't any. That changed in February 2016. This time, Adamsville police received a call from the Washington County Sheriff's Office, also in Minnesota. A woman there reported she was selling a piece of furniture on Craigslist, and that a buyer had offered her asking price. The buyer, Whitfield said, deposited the agreed-upon price into a supposed PayPal account and included $950 for shipping costs. He then asked the victim to send him that $950 shipping money back to him, which she did from her own bank account via a MoneyGram picked up by Derby. "Is she the main culprit? At that point we didn't know,'' Whitfield said. But they were determined to find out. They launched an investigation to figure out if there was a crime, and if so, did that crime happen in Adamsville? Later that same month, another complaint came in – this time from Port Neches, Texas. Whitfield said a man selling a motorcycle on Craiglist found a buyer, who was willing to pay him the full amount plus $950 for shipping. Again, the money was supposed deposited in what appeared to be a legitimate PayPal account and that seller, also, was asked to front the shipping money from his personal bank account to send via a Walmart MoneyGram to a man named Edward Ford, also in Adamsville. The seller, however, became suspicious. "The buyer was in California but they wanted him to send the money to Alabama?" Whitfield said. "He didn't send the money, and he contacted us." In March, a young single mother met with Adamsville detectives and said she feared her life, and her son's life, was in danger. She told authorities she had become involved with a man over Facebook, a man who supposedly worked on an off-shore oil rig and needed her help handling his pay. He would send her money via MoneyGram, which she was instructed to then wire to someone else. Over a period of only about six months, the woman had wired an estimated $500,000 to $600,000, usually to a recipient in Nigeria. "She was a very naïve woman," Whitfield said. Investigators looked to see if there was any connection in that case to the one they were building against Derby and Ford, but didn't find any apparent link. "We interviewed her and she denied any association with them,'' he said. In June, Adamsville police were contacted by a victim in Washington State who was selling a couch on Craigslist. Again, the woman was told the price of the couch plus $650 for shipping was deposited in a PayPal account, and $650 was to be wired to a person in Adamsville – this time a woman named Debra Shields. She sent the money, but was then told that wasn't enough and was asked to send more. Instead, she called Adamsville police who told her to file a report there, and they would handle things from the Alabama end. As the investigation continued, they received yet another call from Bosque County in Texas. A woman was selling a tractor and ended up sending $1,200 via MoneyGram in shipping fees only to realize she had been scammed. The problem, Whitfield said, was that the PayPal accounts were fake but looked eerily legitimate. So the victims, thinking they had that money sitting in the "PayPal" account, used their own money to wire the buyer shipping costs. The "buyer," in all of the cases, ended up asking for even more in shipping costs and that's when the sellers realized they'd been had. Some realized it immediately, he said, but one sent more than $2,000 of his own money before he realized he was being scammed. Adamsville's investigation showed that Derby, Shields, 54, and Ford, 64 – described in transactions as "pickup agents" - all lived within two blocks of each other in Adamsville. Detectives sought, and received, surveillance videotape from the Adamsville Walmart that showed all three sending and receiving MoneyGrams on multiple occasions. The videos show Derby by herself, and with either Ford or Shields. Once subpoenaed and received, Walmart spreadsheets of the transactions by the trio showed that every time a MoneyGram was received by one of them, another was sent the very same day for nearly the same amount – minus their fee which was roughly $20 to $30 per transaction. In all, Whitfield said, Derby sent at least $500,000 to Nigeria, so much that Walmart no longer allowed her to use the money-wiring service. That's when, Whitfield said, she enlisted neighbors Ford and Shields to help her as "pickup agents" to "make a little extra money." Shields also sent money to Nigeria. Ford, Whitfield said, apparently kept most, if not all, of the money without sending it to anyone. Detectives met with the FBI and with Jefferson County District Attorney's Office. He said federal investigators said they would assist in any way possible, but that it was Adamsville's case and that it would be virtually impossible to track the money once it left the U.S. The District Attorney's Office issued felony theft of property warrants for all three. Derby was arrested Sept. 23, and is out of jail on $15,000 bond. Shields was arrested Sept. 24, and is out of jail on $5,000 bond. Ford was arrested Oct. 9, and he is out of jail on $10,000. "We interviewed each one of the separately and one of the main questions I asked them was 'Did you not feel or sense something wasn't right about this?' And in each case, the answer was yes, yet they continued,'' Whitfield said. Derby told investigators she was recruited into the business by another woman, who is now dead. She also gave investigators the names of four people for whom she worked, and each one of them had people in Nigeria to whom they were also sending money. Some of the names she provided matched the names of the "buyers" given to police by the out-of-state victims, Whitfield said. Whitfield and other detectives carried out search warrants at the homes of Derby and Shields, confiscating computers and phones that are undergoing computer forensic analysis. They also have names of other people recruited by Derby, and those investigations are ongoing. Interestingly, he said, Derby, Ford and Shields all said they did not know the young woman that told Adamsville police she feared for her life, which backed up her own story that she wasn't working with that group and didn't know them. It appears to just be a coincidence that she was part of a similar scam and also lives in Adamsville and shows the scope of such cons. "These people are just recruiting people everywhere,'' Whitfield said. "You always see these 'work from home' advertisements. I know it's a cliché, but if seems too good to be true, it probably is." That woman wasn't arrested because police believe she was didn't realize what she was doing was wrong. "We see her as a victim as well,'' Whitfield said. "We just told her to cut ties. They had been bluffing her with threats into continuing." Though the pay for "pickup agents" seems nominal, Whitfield said it adds up when you're talking about millions of dollars. However, it's not likely they were getting rich and, if they were, they weren't living like it. "If you saw where Derby lives, you wouldn't believe a million dollars had passed through there," he said. Adamsville police said their gut tells them this money was going to support terrorist activities. "Can we prove that? Not at this time,'' Whitfield said. "But we can't help but feel like that's a good possibility because of the nature of how the transactions were done, the sophistication behind it, the way people were recruited, where the money was going and the day in which we live." The hardest part of the case has been getting victims to come forward. They all live out of state because that's the only way the scam could work since it deals with delivery fees. He said people need to be more careful when carrying out sales and other transactions online. "Before you send money to somebody, make sure that you have done your research and it's legitimate," he said. "If you are a victim, then report it. Don't be embarrassed, be mad. Because if these few people had not come forward, they would still be out there collecting money and sending it overseas." The investigation is still ongoing and how far up the hierarchy they will go still remains to be seen. Already, however, Adamsville police deem it a major success. "Our goal was to shut down this operation in Adamsville," he said, "and we've done that."

(CBC) David Common Host of CBC's World Report David Common has reported from more than 50 countries, from the beaches of the Seychelles Islands to eight trips to Afghanistan. He helped cover the 2003 invasion of Iraq, toured the Arctic on a Canadian icebreaker and covered the U.S. elections, the Japanese tsunami and the devastating earthquake in Haiti.

More grocery stores encourage 'bring you own container' initiatives 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste Walmart Canada has promised to review its in-store processes related to food waste after a CBC Marketplace and Go Public investigation examined how much food the company throws away.    Over the course of more than 12 visits to two stores in the Toronto area, Marketplace staff repeatedly found produce, baked goods, frozen foods, meat and dairy products in garbage bins out back. Most of the food was still in its packaging, rather than separated for composting. In many cases, the food was well before its best-before date and appeared to be fresh. Also in the bins: bottles of water, frozen cherries that were still cold and tubs of yogurt. Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days "For sure, there are mistakes being made and one thing we need to do is tighten up the execution of our in-store processes for the food that is going into the bins," said Walmart spokesperson Alex Roberton. "We need to be more certain that that is food that needs to be thrown out." Walmart initially declined multiple requests for an on-camera interview from Marketplace, but the retailer agreed to talk this week, following a significant online response. With 407 stores across Canada, Walmart is one of the country's largest grocers. The company says it has set a goal of eliminating food waste being directed to landfills. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) Plans to change Walmart, which is one of Canada's largest grocers, has set a goal of eliminating food waste being directed to landfills, says Roberton. At some of its 407 stores across Canada, some food items are donated to local shelters or food banks, he says. But many of the charities lack trucks or refrigeration of their own to transport and hold donations. Watch the Marketplace investigation on food waste online The company has donated millions of dollars to Food Banks Canada to increase their capacity to collect, prepare and distribute donated food items, he says. Walmart will also roll out a "customer value program" to reduce prices on certain fresh items that are approaching their best-before dates, Roberton says. In an earlier statement, Walmart said it believes the food Marketplace found was unsafe for consumption. (CBC) The company acknowledges that associates will sometimes make mistakes, or throw out items that should be donated or directed to recycling and composting streams. "If we're putting food that's good to eat in the wrong bin, then that's a mistake we need to correct," says Roberton. "And that's one of the areas that we need to focus on improving." Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Food is occasionally thrown out for safety reasons, Roberton says, which could include any item that requires refrigeration leaving the cold chain for even a short period of time. A number of current and former Walmart employees have reached out to Marketplace following coverage of the food found in trash bins. They describe large amounts of food being discarded routinely. Scale of the problem About $31 billion worth of food is wasted in Canada each year, according to a 2014 study from Value Chain Management International. Grocery stores are responsible for about 10 per cent of that waste. "We're very keen on getting that number down," says Roberton. Even more is discarded directly by consumers, with 47 per cent of food waste happening in the home. $31B problem: How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Food waste could be part of Canada's first-ever national food policy, which is currently in the research phase, says Federal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay. France recently introduced legislation barring grocery stores from throwing out food, which has led many stores to change the way they stock their shelves and manage donations. Walmart Canada says it will consider supporting future government initiatives aimed at eliminating food waste in Canada.

City says appeals against building Walmart exhausted BY JILL BARNES NELSON jbnelson@tehachapinews.com jbnelson Oct 27, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendering of a proposed Tehachapi Super Walmart. It looks like a done deal. The City of Tehachapi released a statement that the California Court of Appeals declared Monday that the case against Walmart in Tehachapi is complete and there will be no more appeals. “We believe it was the right thing to do,” City Manager Greg Garrett said Thursday in a phone interview. “On Monday (Oct. 24) at the end of the business day, we received that information. This has been going on for a long time and it seems the appeals process has been exhausted through the legal system, and the EIR (environmental impact statement) has been satisfied.” The decision comes two months after the Fifth District Court of Appeal ruled that the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental issues related to the proposed Walmart. That decision by the three-judge panel on Aug. 24 was unanimous, and followed a hearing on the case held July 26. It was the third attempt for an appeal by a group called Tehachapi First. Tehachapi First questioned the plan to build the Walmart in 2011. It challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco. Efforts to reach representatives from Tehachapi First on Thursday were unsuccessful. Both Garrett and Jay Schlosser, head of development services for Tehachapi, said the city has been in contact with Walmart throughout the process. “Pending encroachment and building permits from the city, Walmart will begin preparation for the physical plans,” Schlosser said. “Walmart is actively working with the development services to begin the preparation of the various plans that have to be produced, the engineering and architectural level drawings that have to be produced to guide the physical construction.” Garrett also reported that the city has been in contact with CalTrans in regard to traffic, since the retail store will be near Highway 58, along Tucker Road. “A lot of time and money (by Walmart) has been spent to reach this goal,” Garrett said. “But on the other side of the coin, this is what makes America great, the checks and balances. We've gone through the process with our eyes open. Residents have said they wanted a Walmart and we believe we've listened to them.” Garrett said there isn't yet a timeline to begin construction. However, once construction begins, he said it probably will take about 18 months to complete the project.

Polymer-type rims with as many as six thicker spokes. An upgraded seat cushion. Foot rests removed. The brand name "Motion Composites" is printed on the rear of the backrest. It is valued at roughly $3,000. "RCMP would like to quickly reunite the victim of this senseless crime with his much needed mobility device," said Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey of the Kelowna RCMP in a statement. "We urge the person who took the chair to drop it off at any RCMP detachment or simply return it to the store." Investigators are in the process of obtaining video surveillance footage from the store.

After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." On service Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. In this Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, photo, a shopper, left, walks with a store associate in the toy section at Wal-Mart in Teterboro, N.J. Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) AP On price  Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan, say about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing. Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders from earlier this week to Jan. 1. Wal-Mart doesn't plan to waive the $50 minimum for free shipping, but noted that online shoppers who spend less than that can opt for store pickup. On merchandise Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products. Wal-Mart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit -- a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup. Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places." The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies.

Walmart is taking steps to address one of the top requests from customers: less time in the checkout lane. The retailer announced Thursday it would be using existing employees as what it's calling "Holiday Helpers" this year to assist with the checkout process. Starting on Nov. 4, Holiday Helpers will be on hand to assist customers in finding the shortest lines, open registers if needed, help with self checkout lanes and even grab items customers might have forgotten. "We are listening to our customers and looking for ways to simplify their busy lives," said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. "Whether our customers are checking items off their grocery lists or their kids' holiday lists, we want to make their shopping experiences easy and fun." Walmart is also expanding the number of items available for same-day pickup and allocating extra staff – including new designated Pickup Managers – to speed up the process. Black Friday 2016: Predictions, store hours, free shipping offers; Walmart, Target, Toys R Us deals The announcement comes as Walmart and other retailers are readying for what they are hoping is a busy holiday shopping season. The nation's largest retailer hasn't announced if it will be open on Thanksgiving Day or join the newer trend of waiting until Black Friday to kick-off in-store sales. Retailers such as Bed, Bath and Beyond, Costco, Burlington, Dillards, Home Depot, Lowe's and Ikea announced they won't open on Thanksgiving Day this year. Walmart's Sam's Club chain will be closed on Thanksgiving. Last year, Walmart opened at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving night.

Published Oct 27th, 2016 12:42 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. ––––––––––––––––– Grocery is big business at Walmart U.S., but a 10-month run of deflationary prices combined with price rollbacks promised by the retail giant threaten supplier margins. Margin pressures will be amplified as retailers like Dollar General, Kroger and Target follow the Walmart U.S. lead, according to UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Lasser said in an investor note that Walmart’s aggressive price cuts could put $35 billion of business in jeopardy at Dollar General, Target and Family Dollar. He said Target is particularly vulnerable because 90% of its stores are within a 20-minute drive to a Walmart U.S. Supercenter. Lesser said the bulk of Walmart price cuts are in grocery, an area where Target is trying to gain share. Lesser said there’s about $21 billion at risk at Target as a direct result of Walmart’s price cuts. He pegs the impact at Dollar General to be $9 billion, while Family Dollar’s risk about $4.5 billion. He said smaller players could be pushed out by the price cuts which would give Walmart U.S. more power with its suppliers. ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ DEFLATION Grocery is 55% of Walmart’s sales and when deflationary food prices persist that’s a direct hit to the retailer’s top line revenue. Walmart has said revenue will grow 3% this year, but food prices in general have dropped almost 2% through the first nine months of 2016. Also, grocery spending likely fell for the third-straight quarter, said Zachary Fadem, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “Near-term headwinds are likely to persist for U.S. grocers, as renewed uncertainty around household finances, heightened promo, competition and food deflation continue to weigh on the industry,” Fadem said, adding that he remains cautious about the sector. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research, who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin said price competition and deflation are taking a toll on margins throughout the supply chain. S&P Equity Analyst Joseph Agnese said meat, poultry, fish and dairy are responsible for about 52% of the more volatile perishable food category sales and about 30% of total grocery sales. These foods are seeing the biggest price declines. Supplier consultants said Walmart already gets the rock bottom prices out of its suppliers but the suppliers often have better margins with other retailers. If everyone is cutting prices to remain competitive, supplier margins will be thinner at Target, Dollar chains and elsewhere. PRODUCTIVITY LOOP Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon told suppliers at the Year Beginning meeting the retailer would be aggressive on absolute best pricing. Greg Foran, CEO of Walmart U.S., recently said price rollbacks do go lower margins, but lower prices often result in more units being sold which will eventually boost total revenue. That’s what Wal-Mart calls its “Productivity Loop.” But some market watchers say persistent deflation can break such a loop. Wal-Mart is no stranger to the problem. Its ASDA grocery business in the United Kingdom continues to struggle because of competition and deflationary prices. It was the only segment within Walmart International to have disappointing sales this entire year. Walmart has revamped ASDA management to focus on improving its supercenter operations there. Small suppliers who already make pennies per unit sold and sell a lower volume than the major consumer packaged goods companies will struggle with the rollbacks and deflationary trends. It’s likely some smaller suppliers will be squeezed out if deflationary pricing pressures continue.

This artist sees the beauty lurking at Walmart By Joe Blevins@joe_a_blevins Oct 27, 2016 12:45 PM Brendan O'Connell Is Blocking The Bread Aisle (Screenshot: YouTube) Brendan O'Connell Is Blocking The Bread Aisle (Screenshot: YouTube) Share Tweet Connecticut-based artist Brendan O’Connell specializes in paintings of “everyday life” and “everyday activities,” and he found plenty of both at Walmart, the nation’s largest grocery retailer as well as the biggest company on the planet. Inspired by what he saw in these big box stores, O’Connell took to capturing Walmart moments on canvas, immortalizing the shoppers, the employees, and the aisles of colorful, discounted merchandise. This painter’s unusual work is the subject of a thoughtful and engaging short film called “Brendan O’Connell Is Blocking The Bread Aisle,” directed by Julien Lasseur. Contrary to viewers’ expectations, O’Connell is not using his paintings to mock Walmart or its customers. Instead, he attempts to find the beauty and humanity inherent in these ubiquitous retail centers. With over 11,000 locations worldwide, the chain certainly provides the artist with plenty of material. These stores are everywhere. Why not paint them? “It became clear to me,” O’Connell says, “that this is probably the most-visited interior space on the planet.” Brendan O’Connell is Blocking The Bread Aisle from Julien Lasseur on Vimeo. But O’Connell’s path to becoming a Walmartist was not always an easy one. Almost immediately, after taking a single photo of an actress he had hired to “pretend to shop,” the artist was summarily thrown out of the building. Since then, he’s probably been ejected from more Walmarts than any human in existence. But the artist and the chain have since made amends, and the film shows O’Connell actually setting up an easel and making one of his paintings right there in the store. The film’s title, then, is extremely literal. Through narration, the painter talks about what he’s trying to capture in his work. Whatever your views are, positive or negative, related to Walmart, it just is. And from an artist’s perspective, the idea of addressing this environment that is an undeniable component to contemporary life is exciting. Besides, O’Connell says, people will be nostalgic for Walmart when it becomes obsolete and disappears from the face of the earth. His paintings are a way of capturing the retail empire in its Rome-like prime.

Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) —  Wal-Mart, long known for emphasizing low prices, wants to be known this holiday season for superior customer service. That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. The world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it’s especially critical for the holiday season. It’s adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it’s designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That’s up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. Heading into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. The company has been benefiting from changes like cleaning up its stores and being sharper on prices. Wal-Mart’s move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has also helped improve service. Target, though, had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. It blamed several factors, such as focusing too much on marketing its stylish merchandise and not enough on bringing in customers looking for deals on basics. Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.” Target’s move to emphasize value actually comes as Wal-Mart itself has made prices a renewed focus. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores, said that just like last year, the company will focus on rollbacks that last 90 days, pulling away from shorter-term promotions. A Roku 32-inch HDTV TV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season long this year. Target knows it’s facing a challenge. “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s senior vice president of marketing. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...

Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) NEW YORK, N.Y. - Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season. After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." ON SERVICE: Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfil more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. ON PRICE: Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan, say about 60 per cent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 per cent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice-president of marketing. Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders from earlier this week to Jan. 1. Wal-Mart doesn't plan to waive the $50 minimum for free shipping, but noted that online shoppers who spend less than that can opt for store pickup. ON MERCHANDISE: Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products. Wal-Mart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup. Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 per cent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places."

 Walmart built a giant tower that acts like a vending machine for online orders Hayley Peterson Oct. 27, 2016, 12:50 PM 15,790 facebook linkedin twitter email print Field Agent Walmart has built a giant tower inside one of its stores that acts as a vending machine for online orders. The tower — or automatic pickup machine, as it's called internally — is being tested in a Walmart store in Bentonville, Arkansas, not far from the company's headquarters, according to a person familiar with the matter. The machine is so big that the company had to remove a chunk of the ceiling to fit it inside the store. It's located right inside the store's entrance. We learned about the machine after the consulting agency Field Agent spotted it in the wild and sent us a tip. Here's how it works: When a customer orders something online for in-store pickup, the customer gets an order number. When the person arrives at the tower, he or she enters the order number into the machine. Then the machine spits out the customer's package the way a vending machine can do with a bottle of Coke. The machine's giant size is due to the fact that it holds tons of packages inside. While it requires a lot of space, it's more versatile than pickup lockers — which Walmart has also tested — because it has the ability to adjust the size of the compartments where packages are kept, our source said. Walmart said it was still gathering feedback from customers while testing the machine. "We know speed and convenience are important to our customers, and we're always looking for new ways to bring it to them," Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said. "We are excited to be one of the first companies to test this new technology and are looking forward to hearing feedback from our customers and associates."

Walmart Says it Will Win on Prices This Holiday Posted on October 27, 2016 Tweet Walmart announced some its plans for holiday 2016 today. These plans include a faster checkout prices, reduced prices and increasing the number of products available through its Pickup service. Walmart is also vowing to "win" on prices this holiday season. Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, Walmart U.S., says in the announcement, "Whether our customers are checking items off their grocery lists or their kids' holiday lists, we want to make their shopping experiences easy and fun. This includes having clean, fast and friendly stores, an easier check out experience and enabling customers to shop seamlessly through services like Pickup." Walmart says it will have Holiday Helpers in stores helping customers get through checkout faster starting Nov. 4. The helpers can open new registers and grab items customers may have forgotten. For holiday deals, Walmart says it has already launched thousands of Rollbacks with new deals planned throughout November and December. They mention one specific deal in the release - a new Roku 32-inch HDTV for $125. This deal will be available in November and December and matches the retailer's 2015 Black Friday offer. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S, says in a statement, "It's not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December."

Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) NEW YORK • Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season. After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has puts new focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season, it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.” On service Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It’s adding staff to help customers who are picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared with a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna said at a store in Teterboro, N.J., on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it’ll have 1,106 stores — double the current number — that will ship directly to online shoppers. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target’s stores. On price Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for about $9 are now $7.88. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan, says about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s senior vice president of marketing. Target is also extending its free shipping promotion, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders from this week to Jan. 1. Wal-Mart doesn’t plan to waive the $50 minimum for free shipping, but noted that online shoppers who spend less than that can opt for store pickup. On merchandise Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products. Wal-Mart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It’s also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup. Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places.” The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies.

Amato-McCoy Knowing frazzled customers are in search of overall value, Walmart is emphasizing customer service this holiday season.    A chain synonymous with the concept of “everyday low prices,” Walmart is taking a new stance this holiday as a means of competing with rivals Target and Amazon, which are focusing on lower prices. While it is not abandoning its signature “Rollbacks” entirely, the discount giant is eager to attract the omnichannel shopper. That said, Walmart is raising the bar by having the broadest assortment of merchandise available at the best price, and focusing on quickly getting it into shoppers’ hands, whether they order online or visit a physical store.   The retail behemoth’s first move was to dramatically expand its online catalog. Knowing that the volume of items ordered online and picked up in stores on the same day increases by five times during the holiday season, Walmart will expand the amount of items available across categories, including apparel, toys and seasonal decor. And the increases will continue to ramp up all season long.   Walmart’s online assortment has already jumped from roughly 8 million items at the start of this year to 20 million today, and “millions of additional items are scheduled to be added in the coming months,” according to a company statement.    The retailer is also making its broader assortment easier to shop. Starting Nov. 1, Walmart.com will feature a Top 20 list of items to help customers discover exclusive offerings, competitive prices and coveted products. This service supports Walmart’s holiday marketing strategy, which will focus more on discounts and offering the lowest prices on items instead of "gimmicky" product deals — a move that responds to their customers’ expectations of more consistent pricing. This is the second year Walmart is using this holiday marketing strategy.   Where Walmart draws the line, however, is on free shipping for online orders. Unlike competitors like Target that are waiving shipping fees for the season, Walmart will still require shoppers to make a minimum online order of $50 to avoid shipping charges, the statement said.   In hopes of providing a little more cheer during store visits, Walmart is also introducing an army of Holiday Helpers to better serve customers in the checkout line. Armed with candy canes, these helpers will assist customers with finding the shortest line, direct shoppers to open registers, and quickly grab items customers might have forgotten, the statement said.   “We are listening to our customers and looking for ways to simplify their busy lives,” said Judith McKenna, COO, Walmart U.S.   Depending on store traffic, Walmart will increase the amount of helpers on hand. The easy-to-find, yellow-vested team will arrive at stores on Nov. 4.   In addition, the chain will feature 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, and Santa also plans to make 23,000 visits chainwide throughout the season, the statement said.   “Whether our customers are checking items off their grocery lists or their kids’ holiday lists, we want to make their shopping experiences easy and fun,” McKenna added. “This includes having clean, fast and friendly stores, an easier check out experience and enabling customers to shop seamlessly through services like ‘pick-up.’” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Macy’s unloads five stores Sears executive jumps ship for party supplies specialty retailer Online fashion retailer files Chapter 11 CEO shakeup at Whole Foods Safeway to acquire 87-year-old specialty grocery Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Target axes kids’ shopping carts Unusual deal gives Aeropostale new lease on life — and it just got better Flip-Flop Shops on the move Target first out of the gate with holiday hiring plans Solutions Spotlight Holiday Uptime: Preparing Your Network for the Holiday Rush Your network connection is more than just a means of connecting your point-of-sale system – it’s a driving force of your online and in-store experiences.

Menu Home Events Library Jobs Topics Newsletter Search Technology Trends Marketing E-commerce Payments Logistics Corporate News Loss Prevention Holidays Feature Why Macy's will open its doors on Thanksgiving Day, but Mall of America won't Black Friday creep has pressured big-box retailers to open earlier and earlier, but some have emphatically announced they will close. Which strategy works best? Author By Corinne Ruff @corinnesusan • Published Oct. 24, 2016 Macy’s made headlines earlier this month after announcing it would push up its opening hours on Thanksgiving Day to 5 p.m — an hour earlier than the year before. But the retailer's decision to open its doors on the holiday is far from radical. Macy's has consistently opened on Thanksgiving Day since 2013, as have many other big-box retailers. Over the last several years, competition between retailers like Wal-Mart, Kohl’s, Best Buy, Target and J.C. Penney has driven doorbuster promotions earlier and earlier — a phenomenon aptly known as “Black Friday creep.” Yet this year, many retailers are reversing course and plan to close on Thanksgiving Day. Mall of America, Office Depot and hhgregg are just a few that threw in the towel after previously opening on the holiday. In public statements, retailers said their motivation to close was to let employees enjoy the day off with their families. While that may be true, the reality is that opening on Thanksgiving may not make financial sense for most retailers anymore: The dilution of Black Friday as a single-day shopping bonanza has spread sales throughout the weekend, meaning that most specialty retailers won't see significant gains from opening on Thanksgiving, according to Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. "We doubt that the majority of specialty retailers benefit from ... this annual Thanksgiving opening arms race." auto image + link "We doubt that the majority of specialty retailers benefit from involvement in this annual Thanksgiving opening arms race,” O'Shea wrote in a note published on Thursday and emailed to Retail Dive. “We believe most retailers would be best served shifting dollars spent on Thanksgiving openings by pulling their web specials forward and picking off some additional sales earlier in the week, and offering heavier in-store promotions over the weekend." Many retailers have been pressured to follow Wal-Mart's lead on early promotions during the week leading up to Black Friday, O'Shea said. While most have been disappointed with the results, department stores may be one of the few retailers to reap the rewards of opening on Thanksgiving itself. Thanksgiving openings don't work for everyone For years, retailers have held special early morning Black Friday hours. In 2011, retailers such as Kohl's, Macy's and Target pushed up those hours to midnight, and a year later, Wal-Mart announced it would open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Since then, the retailer has pushed its opening hours as early as 6 p.m., while others have followed suit. Wal-Mart was the catalyst for Thanksgiving Day openings throughout the retail industry, Moody's O'Shea said. Wal-Mart has historically opened on Thanksgiving Day to pick up food sales from procrastinating grocery shoppers who need a last minute dish. Competitors like Target quickly caught on to the early promotions, and the retailer continues to open on Thanksgiving to keep up competition against Wal-Mart. Specialty retailers like Gamestop, Old Navy, American Girl and others have also latched onto the trend in past years, but haven't seen nearly as much success. "We have seen too many instances of apparel retailers having to promote heavily the week after Thanksgiving, which is an indication that sales were slow over the weekend," O'Shea said.  Even Wal-Mart is pulling back on heavy promotions. Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported Wal-Mart would first offer doorbuster Black Friday discounts online on Thanksgiving night, but they would not stretch the deals over a five-day period as it had done in the past. Instead, the retailer said it would cut prices over the entire holiday season. The reality for most retailers is that staying open on Thursday often means less business for the Friday and Saturday afterward, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, wrote in an email to Retail Dive. "Holiday shoppers continue to shop where and when they want, with value and the perfect gift in mind." auto image + link “Holiday shoppers continue to shop where and when they want, with value and the perfect gift in mind,” he said. “If a store states it will be closed, it only means that if the consumer wants to shop there, they will have to do so another day, or go online that day.” Data from the NPD Group’s Checkout Tracking Total Channel shows that fewer shoppers are turning out to shop on both days — and they are increasingly choosing to go out only on Black Friday. Source: The NPD Group/Checkout Tracking Total Channel   Source: The NPD Group/Checkout Tracking Total Channel   The costs of opening For many retailers, the costs of opening on Thanksgiving may not be worth it.  “First and foremost, when retailers open on Thanksgiving, they have to think about if [last year] they were driving incremental sales and margins,” Joel Alden, a partner in the Consumer Products & Retail Practice at consulting firm A.T. Kearney, told Retail Dive. “I think [last year] they were spreading sales they were getting in a period for one day across two days, and not getting an uptick in margin.” If retailers expect shoppers to take the time to line up before doors open, they should also be able to deliver a unique customer experience, Alden said. "While [shoppers] are first there for price, experience is not a too far distant second,” he said. “I would liken it to free entrance to a nightclub: If they have a lousy time, they won't be coming back. It's more difficult to deliver experience on two high-pressured days.” Retailers should also consider whether they have the ability to sustain inventory throughout the five-day holiday, as well as having enough staff willing to work on the holiday. "Nothing says we care about profitability more than people than making them work a holiday like this one." auto image + link Many employees aren’t willing to work two high-pressured days back-to-back, Lisa Sterling, Chief People Officer at Ceridian, a human capital management technology company, wrote in a note to Retail Dive. Sterling suggested that staying open sends a message to employees and applauded Mall of America for closing for the first time. “While business success is instrumental, so is employee engagement," she wrote. "Nothing says we care about profitability more than people than making them work a holiday like this one.” Closing or opening, it's all about being 'on-brand' Whether retailers open or close on Turkey day also depends on their brand and core customer base. “For some of them to close, like an REI saying they will be closed on Thanksgiving and Black Friday — it's very much on brand, it works for a retailer like that,” A.T. Kearney's Alden said. “I think Nordstrom can play a bit of that as well. They can say on Friday it will be a great experience, they are known for delivering a great experience, they can say their sales staff will be there full of energy — it works for them.” But for retailers like Wal-Mart — which depend much less on assisting customers and providing an experience — Alden said the choice to open is more of a pure operational question. As a retailer with many 24/7 locations, adding Black Friday promotions on Thanksgiving is on-brand for Wal-Mart. “We need lines moving, shelves stocked — those things. I think it differs by retailer,” Alden said. “I think what plays into it is how strong are their digital channels. [A retailer] may be closed down the street, but virtually open and can capture digital sales.” "[The decision to open on Thanksgiving] is a market share game more than anything." auto image + link Retailers with strong digital channels — such as GameStop, which has opted to close on Thanksgiving the last several years — can drive online doorbusters and other unique deals on important days, such as when popular games are released. “I think there are several [retailers] that make it consistent — it's not something they will waver on any time soon. They promote it as developing their brand,” Alden said. But some retailers are certainly finding reason enough to open on the holiday. On Monday, the two largest U.S. mall developers, Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties, announced their shopping centers will be open on Thanksgiving. Although individual retailers aren’t required to open, a Simon representative told Fortune that the majority will not close. For mall developers, department stores and big-box retailers, staying open on Thanksgiving often makes sense if that's what the competition is doing. "It's a market share game more than anything," Alden said. "You may do it for competitive reasons." This story is part of our ongoing coverage of the 2016 holiday shopping season.

TOWN OF CLAYTON Johnston Charter Academy, scheduled to open in Clayton in 2017, will be a two-story, 47,000-square-foot building with room for 772 students in grades K-8. TOWN OF CLAYTON Bob Dunston of National Heritage Academies, a Michigan-based charter school company, presents the plan for Johnston Charter Academy to the Clayton Planning Board. Drew Jackson jdjackson@newsobserver.com 1 of 3 i By Drew Jackson jdjackson@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Johnston County’s second charter school will be next-door neighbor to the Clayton Walmart, according to a site plan endorsed Monday by the town’s planning board. The N.C. Board of Education approved Johnston Charter Academy in August, allowing the school to work toward a 2017 opening. The school will spend the next year hiring staff, including teachers, and building a facility. Johnston Charter Academy will open with kindergarten through sixth grade and expand a grade per year until 2019, when it will top out at eighth grade. The maximum enrollment at that point will be 772 students. The school is essentially a franchise of the National Heritage Academies model, which already has 83 schools across the country, including 10 in North Carolina. The Michigan-based company educates about 56,000 students in nine states. The two-story school building will be about 47,000 square feet and sit on around eight acres of the 67-acre Stephens property in between Walmart and the ABC store on U.S. 70 Business. The campus will have two playgrounds, athletic fields and a long, snaking car-ride queue. “There’s a pretty significant amount of road throughout this school; there’s almost a mile-worth of car queuing for pick up and drop off,” town planner Jay McLeod said. “Charter schools don’t use buses, so they rely on parents to drop off and pick up kids every day, which leads to a pretty impressive drop-off and pick-up process.” The school will stand at the end of Financial Drive, which won’t have a traffic signal at its intersection with U.S. 70 Business. Planning board member Stephen Powers pointed out that the school’s morning and afternoon bells could have an impact on the highway traffic, clogging up intersections as parents pick up or drop off their kids. “You’ve got a 500-foot turning lane, and you’ve got a mile-worth of cars every day, 770 kids, probably not 770 cars, but it’ll be close to it,” Powers said. “What’s the plan for the afternoon when 200, to be conservative, are coming up to the highway and want to go left? That would be my concern.” McLeod said the N.C. Department of Transportation signed off on the school’s traffic-impact plan, and traffic engineer Amy Giachario, who designed the school’s parking lot, said the arrival times of parents are generally spread out. “Mainly I lay it out for the dismissal process,” Giachario said of the queue. “The parents come a half-hour or 45 minutes early, and they don’t come all at one time, so that’s why you don’t need mile-long storage lanes. They sporadically come in, and they all have to wait at dismissal time, so they start coming 45 minutes beforehand and line up through the site, so that’s why you need the whole mile-long queuing.” Giachario described the pick-up procedure to sound something like an assembly line, where 12 cars at a time enter a pick-up zone for their kids to get in the car. When all 12 are loaded, those drive off and 12 more come in. She noted that the school day begins and ends at the same time for all grades. The snake-like route of the parking queue caught the eye of planning board member Bob Ahlert, who worried that the considerable turning radius of a large fire truck might not be able to navigate the hairpin turns of the school’s parking lot. McLeod said the town’s fire marshal reviewed and signed off on the plan. Bob Dunston, who made the school’s presentation to the planning board, said construction should take three to four months. Assuming the Clayton Town Council signs off on the school’s special-use permit later this year, Dunston said the contractor could break ground in January. “If we stay on that schedule, we’ll absolutely meet the August opening date without any problem,” Dunston said. Some members of the planning board expressed enthusiasm for the school coming to Clayton. The county’s only other charter, Neuse Charter in Smithfield, is wrapping up its first decade of existence, and Johnston Charter Academy looks to offer another option in the high-growth western end of Johnston. “I’m excited about you coming,” planning board member James Lipscomb said. “I’m excited about another educational option.” Other than traffic questions, the board found little to fault in the school plan. The planning board has the authority to approve site plans but also recommended the town council approve the school’s special-use permit to open an elementary school in Clayton. “I think you can see that we’re very happy to have another school in the offering here in Clayton,” planning board chairman Frank Price said. “A charter school, it seems like every town needs one in this day and time.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Johnston County Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:43 DNA expert questioned on evidence in Peterson case Pause 0:56 UNC's Roy Williams will 'be damned' if he's going to emulate Duke 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 1:09 68 Seconds of Dadgum Roy 2:38 Meet Judge Mike Morgan, North Carolina's newest Supreme Court justice 5:14 McCrory: 'We're going to check everything' 0:48 Sunday Supper on Fayetteville from the air 11:10 Pulse nightclub shooter calls 911 part 2 of 2 (Warning: explicit language) 1:29 Michael Peterson headed back to court after motion for dismissal fails Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a month ago Matthew flooding collapses Smith Road 1:39 a month ago Matthew flooding collapses Smith Road 2:06 a month ago Matthew floods Johnston County Boys & Girls Club 1:18 a month ago Matthew floods Smithfield councilman's business View more video Johnston County Judge yanks officer’s badge Vinson resigns from Archer Lodge council Benson taking a ‘Christmas Stand’ With Olympians’ help, Portofino aids flooded Boys and Girls Club Johnston voters stick by McCrory Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services Customer Service E-Edition Contact Us About Us Site Map Site Information Triangle.com ArtsNow FansTailgate Mom2Mom Trianglejobs Community News Legal Notices News in Education Newsletters Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Careers at the N&O Advertising Advertise With Us About Our Ads Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping N&O Store N&O Photos Copyright Commenting Policy Report News Privacy Policy Terms of Use Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services Customer Service E-Edition Contact Us About Us Site Map Site Information Triangle.com ArtsNow FansTailgate Mom2Mom Trianglejobs Community News Legal Notices News in Education Newsletters Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Careers at the N&O Advertising Advertise With Us About Our Ads Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping N&O Store N&O Photos More Copyright Commenting Policy Report News Privacy Policy Terms of Use

According to a Walmart representative, “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” But after the removal of this offensive item, others that are equally troubling remain on the website, inviting shoppers to purchase makeup that mimics slashed wrists and slashed throats. And Walmart is not the only retailer marketing such trash: Amazon.com offers (as of this writing, Monday morning) several versions of a “Slashed Wrist Kit” and a “Slashed Wrist Latex Appliance,” as well as several kinds of “Slashed Throat Make-Up.” And there are doubtless other retailers that sell the same items. How much Halloween joy will this bring to the thousands of families that each year lose a loved one to suicide or experience a suicide attempt? What will be their reactions if a trick-or-treater rings their doorbell and greets them with the appearance of slashed wrists or a slashed throat? And it’s not only those affected by suicide, but also individuals for whom cutting is a symptom of mental health conditions not related to suicide. According to The New York Times, “Suicide in the United States has surged to the highest levels in nearly 30 years,” reaching 42,773 in 2014 (April 22, 2016). Put in another perspective, that is 117 suicides each day. These statistics mean that hundreds of thousands of people are affected by suicides: Family members, friends, neighbors, faith communities, coworkers and first responders. And what about attempted suicides and their effects on literally millions of people? According to the American Society for Suicide Prevention, there are 25 attempts for each completed suicide; that translates into more than 1 million suicide attempts each year. See https://afsp.org/?p=811. Here in north central Massachusetts, the 2014 suicide rate was 20.9 per 100,000 population — more than twice the statewide average of 9.0 per 100,000. Walmart, Amazon.com, and other retailers that want to help us celebrate Halloween with graphic reminders of suicide and self harm need to rethink their values. It would be better if they acknowledged the tragic realities of suicide and helped spread the information that help is available for those contemplating suicide and for survivors, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, (800) 273-TALK (8255), press 1 if you are a veteran; Samaritans Statewide, (877) 870-4673; the Men’s Suicide Prevention Project, (978) 630-6455; Statewide Emergency Services, (877) 382-1609, and the Suicide Prevention Task Force, www.suicidepreventiontaskforce.org. Guy Beales of Fitchburg is president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of North Central Massachusetts.

Walmart Tackling Long Checkout Lines This Holiday Season With Troop Of “Helpers” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Tackling Long Checkout Lines This Holiday Season With Troop Of “Helpers” Image courtesy of Walmart October 27, 2016 10:39 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler more helpers on hand walmart retailer holiday plans holiday sales gearing up for holiday season shopping After spending your precious time plodding up and down the aisles of the local big box store, marking off items on your holiday shopping list, the last thing you want to do is wait in the checkout line for an hour. Walmart’s new plan to avoid this annoyance involves specialized teams whose only jobs will be to keep these lines moving. The Washington Post reports that after feedback from customers unhappy with the holiday checkout process of the past, Walmart plans to hire these in-store traffic directors during the busy late-year shopping season. The employees, who will don special yellow vests, might direct customers to available cashiers, open an extra register if things get especially bogged down, or act as gophers for price checks and to grab items you may have forgotten. “That was actually the number one thing that customers told us,” Judith McKenna, Walmart chief operating officer, said during a holiday strategy presentation. “Which is, ‘How can you help us get through the checkouts faster?’ ” McKenna says that the new helpers will begin work at stores on Nov. 4 and the size of the teams will vary based on store location and sales volume. Also new this year, the company plans to focus more on its store pickup program, where customers place orders online and then stop by a store to grab-and-go. Walmart will add department managers to the pickup areas in a bid to make sure things go smoothly, the Post reports. As for any holiday deals, the company was rather mum on what it has up its sleeve, only mentioning it would be similar to its 2015 strategy. Last year, the retailer offered its traditional Black Friday and Cyber Monday (starting on Sunday, because, of course) deals, and then season-long promotions instead of weekend sales.

Published Oct 27th, 2016 9:31 am staff2@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores announced changes to its money transfer service “Walmart-2-Walmart” increasing the transfer limit and lowering service fees while also allowing international transfers to Mexico. Walmart has been transferring money for customers through the Ria network in the United States since 2014. This week the retailer said customers can now send up to $2,500 through its transfer service, expanding from a $900 limit previously. The cost for the transfers are $18. The retailer also has expanded this service into Mexico at more than 1,250 store locations allowing customers to send up to $800 for $6.50 or less from any Walmart store in the U.S. Wal-Mart also lowered the service fees associated with U.S. MoneyGram transfers. MoneyGram allows for transfers between $1,000 and $10,000. Customers pay $20 for transactions under $2,500 and 1.2% on transfers above that, according to the release. “Our customers tell us they are looking for simple and affordable solutions that make their lives easier,” said Kirsty Ward, vice president-services, Walmart U.S. “Millions of our customers use transfers as part of their everyday money management – sending funds regularly to their loved ones and often in times of urgent need. We’re committed to driving down the cost of sending money, which means customers keep more of their hard-earned funds.” A recent report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. found nearly 27% of Americans are unbanked or underbanked relying on services such as wire transfers from non-traditional banks. That report also indicated the national rate of unbanked is the lowest on record at 7%.

They will start working Nov. 4, when the giant retailer begins its relentless focus on holiday shopping, especially for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. “Holiday helpers, ready with candy canes and smiles, will assist customers with finding the shortest line, open registers as needed and will even quickly grab items customers might have forgotten,” Walmart said in a press release Thursday. Walmart usually hires tens of thousands of workers for temporary holiday jobs. Walmart brought back its familiar front door greeters in May after a hiatus. The company has been experimenting with the role after hiring thousands of greeters since then. The job serves a number of roles, including customer service and shoplifting prevention.

Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) TETERBORO, N.J. (AP)  Wal-Mart, long known for emphasizing low prices, wants to be known this holiday season for superior customer service. That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. The world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it’s especially critical for the holiday season. It’s adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it’s designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That’s up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. Heading into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. The company has been benefiting from changes like cleaning up its stores and being sharper on prices. Wal-Mart’s move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has also helped improve service. Target, though, had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. It blamed several factors, such as focusing too much on marketing its stylish merchandise and not enough on bringing in customers looking for deals on basics. Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.” Target’s move to emphasize value actually comes as Wal-Mart itself has made prices a renewed focus. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores, said that just like last year, the company will focus on rollbacks that last 90 days, pulling away from shorter-term promotions. A Roku 32-inch HDTV TV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season long this year. Target knows it’s facing a challenge. “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s senior vice president of marketing. ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) (Julio Cortez) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on October 27, 2016 at 8:24 AM comments TETERBORO, N.J. - This holiday shopping season, you'll see plenty of red and green at Walmart. But you're also going to see a lot of yellow. The big-box chain is investing in specialized teams of store workers known as "holiday helpers," recognizable by their bright yellow vests, Santa hats and festive shoulder bags. These staffers are going to be primarily focused on keeping checkout lines moving as efficiently as possible: They might direct you to an available cashier, open an extra register or run back into the aisles to get an item you forgot to grab. During a holiday strategy presentation at a Walmart store here, the retailer's U.S. chief operating officer, Judith McKenna, said that the holiday helper team was devised in response to shopper feedback. "That was actually the number one thing that customers told us," McKenna said. "Which is, 'How can you help us get through the checkouts faster?' " The holiday helpers are scheduled to start showing up in stores Nov. 4. The number of such workers will vary by location, based on the size and sales volume, but each store will ramp up the number of helpers on weekends and other busy days. Walmart's investment in holiday helpers is evidence that, even in the digital era, retailers are focused on fine-tuning the in-store experience. The world's largest retailer did not offer specifics on what its deals would be this November and December, but executives said the approach would be similar to 2015. Last year, the chain offered special Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals after the Thanksgiving holiday, but otherwise it hewed to season-long promotions instead of such things as weekend-long flash sales. Executives said they thought that consumers would find that strategy less confusing and frustrating. Walmart also said it is expecting a surge in usage of its pickup program, which allows shoppers to order items online and retrieve them at a counter in the store. To make that operation run more smoothly, the retailer is moving this season to add department managers to its pickup areas. A sign that hangs behind the Teterboro store's counter gives you a sense of their mandate: "High five for a less than five-minute wait time." On the e-commerce front, Walmart hopes to deliver a stronger performance this year by relying on an expanded assortment of items. At the beginning of 2016, it had about 8 million items for sale online; today, it has about 20 million, including goods offered by third-party sellers on its marketplace. That's a sharp improvement, and yet it is still far less than the 350 million items that Amazon.com is thought to carry. (Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) As always, Walmart will also be trying to win the holiday shopping wars with its merchandise selection. In the toy aisle, it is counting on a lineup of 400 exclusive toys to distinguish its offering from that of the pack. In particular, executives pointed out a $398 ride-on Disney Princess Carriage that has been selling so quickly that the chain has had ask the supplier to make more of the electric coaches. In the apparel department, Walmart plans to ride the "ugly Christmas sweater" wave. In recent years, theme parties that ask revelers to come decked out in their cheesiest seasonal regalia have abounded. In turn, executives noticed that kitschy sweaters were selling well - and that men were often buying these garments in women's size large, so they've ramped up their offering of festive sweaters this year. -- (c) 2016, The Washington Post. Sarah Halzack wrote this story.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Black Friday 2016 Deal Hunt Kicked Off By Walmart Posted: Oct 27 2016, 6:07am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Oct 28 2016, 11:55am CDT, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Walmart's Holiday Helpers   Walmart surprised today with the release of the first Black Friday 2016 deal. Walmart just changed the game plan of Black Friday 2016 by releasing the first Black Friday 2016 deal on October 27. If you are quick this morning you can pick up the 32-inch TCL 32750 Smart TV for $125. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock TV deals will be again the most popular Black Friday deals this year and Walmart just delivered the first Black Friday 2016 TV deal. Walmart admits that its the same Black Friday deal the retailer offered last year, but it is still better than any deal on a 32-inch Smart TV available now. Walmart announced to offer the $125 Smart TV deal in November and December. The deal is available now online with in store pick-up only. Stock is limited. We assume Walmart will have new stock coming in throughout the Black Friday and Holiday sales season. Also on sale at Walmart are 4K Ultra TV Xbox One S Bundles starting at $479. Walmart is bundling Sceptre and JVC 4K TVs with the new Xbox One S. The problem with the bundled low-end 4K TVs is HDR support. You will not be able to benefit from the full image quality improvement HDR is offering. Refer to this list of 4K HDR TVs that bring out the color and contrast offered by HDR enhanced games and movies. Besides Walmart, Target will soon offer the first Holiday sale. Starting this Sunday, October 30, shoppers can get free video game with the purchase of two video games at Target. It appears retailers try to win some time lost through the Presidential election and early Thanksgiving date by ramping up Holiday sales end of October.

Police: Man head-butts pregnant girlfriend in Wal-Mart Douglas Walker , dwalker@muncie.gannett.com 7:28 a.m. EDT October 27, 2016 Robert Lawson (Photo: Photo provided) 1434 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW CASTLE, Ind.  – A New Castle man is accused of head-butting his pregnant girlfriend as they shopped in the local Wal-Mart, breaking her nose. After that, 21-year-old Robert R. Lawson allegedly tried to “knee, kick, head-butt and bite” New Castle police officers, who then used an electronic stun device to subdue him. City police were called the Wal-Mart, at 3167 S. Ind. 3, about 3:15 p.m. Sunday, after Lawson allegedly attacked his girlfriend in the grocery section of the store. The 19-year-old woman said she and Lawson began arguing during their shopping trip, and that he got “in her face” before breaking her nose with his head. She was taken by ambulance to Henry County Hospital. The incident took place with the woman’s infant son in her shopping cart. She told police she and Lawson “were dating, and she is pregnant with (his) child.” Lawson, found in the store’s parking lot, said he stumbled while inside the store and accidentally fell into his accuser. A breath test measured the New Castle man’s blood-alcohol content at 0.1611. In Indiana, motorists with a reading of 0.08 or higher are considered intoxicated. Lawson allegedly became “verbally combative” and cursed after he was placed in a police car and officers refused his request for a cigarette. After he began to kick items in the car, officers tried to placed shackles on his ankles, leading to his efforts to bite and kick them, a police report said. While being driven to the Henry County jail, Lawson allegedly struck an officer in the side with an elbow. After arriving at the jail, he continued to struggle with authorities, the report said, and was placed in a “restraint chair.” Investigators said they later viewed a Wal-Mart surveillance video that showed the violence in the grocery section. Henry County Prosecutor Joe Bergacs’ office has charged Lawson with domestic battery resulting in serious bodily injury, battery against a public safety official, resisting law enforcement, disorderly conduct and public intoxication. Henry Circuit Court 2 Judge Kit Crane granted a request by prosecutors that Lawson be held without bond for 15 days. Lawson has been convicted of driving while intoxicated (last August and in March 2015) and contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in July 2014).

You're Not Alone DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Walmart's Attack Plan to Steal the Holiday Season from Amazon Is Ridiculously Simple From more bodies in stores to help shoppers checkout to more toy exclusives, Walmart is leaving no stone un-turned in effort to win the holidays. Brian Sozzi Oct 27, 2016 6:56 AM EDT If Wall Street doesn't perceive Walmart ( WMT) as having as great a holiday shopping season as digital foe Amazon ( AMZN) when all is said and done, it won't be for lack of trying by the world's largest retailer. Walmart said Thursday that it will have 400 exclusive toys available this holiday shopping season, roughly in line with last year. The list of toy exclusives will be headlined by a pricey $398 Disney ( DIS) battery powered car for children to ride around in. In electronics, the amount of product exclusives is expected to be up slightly compared to a year ago. The number of price "rollbacks" Walmart will offer during the holidays is forecast to increase by 20% as the discounter continues with its year plus effort to offer lower prices for its economically sensitive consumers. "It will be a a competitive holiday season, if not more competitive," Steve Bratspies, Walmart's U.S. chief merchant told TheStreet in an interview. Meanwhile, Walmart will have about 20 million items for sale online during the holidays, up significantly from 8 million a year ago. Beyond product, Walmart is upping its game in customer service in an attempt to ease some pressure on stressed out holiday shoppers. The company for the first time will have specially marked "holiday helpers" in its stores to guide people to open registers, find products and open closed registers when needed. TheStreet's Brian Sozzi has all the details on Walmart's holiday plans from one of the retailer's stores in Teterboro, NJ.

That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. In this Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, photo, a shopper, left, walks with a store associate in the toy section at Wal-Mart in Teterboro, N.J. Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) The world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it's especially critical for the holiday season. It's adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it's designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. Contaminated site turned shopping center changing tiny N.J. town It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That's up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. Heading into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. The company has been benefiting from changes like cleaning up its stores and being sharper on prices. Wal-Mart's move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has also helped improve service. Target, though, had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. It blamed several factors, such as focusing too much on marketing its stylish merchandise and not enough on bringing in customers looking for deals on basics. Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." Target's move to emphasize value actually comes as Wal-Mart itself has made prices a renewed focus. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart's U.S. stores, said that just like last year, the company will focus on rollbacks that last 90 days, pulling away from shorter-term promotions. A Roku 32-inch HDTV TV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season long this year. Target knows it's facing a challenge. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing.

Walmart and Target Blitz Amazon with Dizzying Number of Holiday Exclusives The Street 10/27/2016 Brian Sozzi © TheStreet Walmart and Target Blitz Amazon with Dizzying Number of Holiday Exclusives Bricks and mortar store kings Target and Walmart have found a clever way to better compete with the likes of digital foe Amazon in several important categories this holiday season: unleash the power of the product exclusive. Minneapolis-based Target will have have 1,800 new and exclusive toys this holiday season alone, Target executives said at an event on Tuesday attended by TheStreet. "Toys are a real big part of the show. We have to win in this category. So we will have a record-setting number of toy exclusives this holiday season," said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell. Target estimates that it gets about 50% of its annual toy sales during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season alone, so stuffing shelves with products unavailable at competing retailers and online is critical to winning the battle for customers. The company has also increased the number of product exclusives in categories such as food and electronics, which were also showcased at the event. The world's largest retailer Walmart has brought its A-game with product exclusives for holiday shoppers, too. Walmart said Thursday that it will have 400 new and exclusive toys available this holiday shopping season, about in line to last year. The list of toy exclusives will be headlined by a pricey $398 Disney battery powered car for children to ride around in. In electronics, the amount of product exclusives is seen up slightly compared to a year ago. "[Product exclusives] gives us a way to compete with online," Steve Bratspies, Walmart's U.S. chief merchant told TheStreet in an interview. Here are the various product exclusives of interest that will be on the shelves at Walmart and Target starting real soon. Target Bets Big On Dolls Target is doubling the number of dolls it offers this holiday season, with a particular emphasis on selling more ethnically diverse dolls with more skin tones, eye colors and so on that can't be found elsewhere. That exclusive brown horse would be a great friend for any doll. Walmart's Massive Disney Car Say hello to Walmart's exclusive battery powered Disney Princess Carriage Ride-On car (in bright pink on right). Priced at $398, Walmart says it took over a year of working with the supplier to get it to market. The retailer is already seeing strong demand for the car despite its lofty sticker price, says Bratspies. The pink car is much bigger than it looks. Target's Superhero Toys With all the hype around the release of Star Wars: Rogue One in theaters in December, Target is once again betting big on the popular franchise with numerous exclusives. And yes, that is an exclusive Wonder Woman toy set in the bottom right-hand corner. A new Wonder Woman movie is scheduled for release in June 2017. Spotted: Star Wars drone. Walmart's Virtual Reality Drone We have no idea how this thing works, but it's a drone that comes with a pair of virtual reality goggles and is priced at a very reasonable $148. Sounds like a potential win for Walmart. Yes, please. Target's Retro Board Games Target is going after families who want to stay home to play board games -- notably retro games -- a trend that has fueled the results for Hasbro this year. Below, Target shows off an exclusive board game based on 1980s computer classic Oregon Trail. What Millennial didn't play any of these board games while a kid? Everyone Wants to Sell Food For Your Holiday Table Walmart will have numerous holiday food exclusives, none more popular than its Patti Labelle cakes. It will also feature new private label cheeses and breads, which are technically product exclusives. Walmart employee shows off exclusive holiday cake. Food is also getting attention at Target. From an exclusive bag of Hershey's chocolate, using Target's red and white colors, to holiday themed coffee cups, the retailer has it covered for the dinner table. Here comes a food review of these Hershey's Kisses.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Sam Dean October 26, 2016 Enterprise Open Source Programs Flourish -- In Tech and Elsewhere open-business.jpeg Here is a brief overview of open source programs at companies that may surprise you. Creative Commons Attribution unsplash.com/@mikepetrucci If you cycled the clock back about 15 years and surveyed the prevailing beliefs about open source technology at the time, you would find nowhere near the volume of welcome for it that we see today. As a classic example, The Register reported all the way back in 2001 that former CEO of Microsoft Steve Ballmer made the following famous statement in a Chicago Sun-Times interview: "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches." Fast-forward to today, though, and not only has Microsoft been actively contributing to and advancing Linux, but countless organizations have rolled out professional, in-house programs focused on advancing open source and encouraging its adoption. Some of the companies doing so may surprise you. Here is a brief overview of these programs at companies that are all household names. Netflix Tests, Netflix Contributes. Lots of people tune in to watch Netflix on a regular basis, but how often do they visit the company’s Open Source Software Center? Netflix has contributed a slew of very useful tools and applications to the open source community, ranging from machine learning and orchestration applications to utilities that run on its platform. Engineers at the company announce when new tools are open sourced, and many of them have been tested and hardened at scale by Netflix for years. Don’t Count Out Telecoms. In the telecom arena, Ericsson regularly contributes projects to the open source community and is a champion of several key open source initiatives. You can browse through the company’s open source hub here. The company is also one of the most active telecom-focused participants in the effort to advance open NFV and other open technologies that can eliminate historically proprietary components in telecom technology stacks. Ericsson works directly with The Linux Foundation on these efforts, and engineers and developers are encouraged to interface with the open source community. Microsoft Radically Changes Its Tune. Once viewed as an enemy of open source, Microsoft has completely reversed course, partly because embracing open source paves the way to a brighter future for key Microsoft platforms such as Azure. CEO Satya Nadella, has said that nearly a third of the Azure cloud platform is Linux-based. The company has also announced support for the container-friendly CoreOS Linux distribution, and Microsoft's Azure cloud supports CentOS, Oracle Linux, SUSE, Ubuntu, and other flavors of Linux. Microsoft has a growing partnership with Red Hat, and developers at the company are encouraged to participate actively in open initiatives, a number of which you can peruse here. Walmart Speaks Open Source? As a matter of fact, Walmart does. The company's Walmart Labs division, located in San Bruno, right down the road from Silicon Valley, has released a slew of open source projects, and now there is a significant new one arriving. Electrode is a product of Walmart's migration to a React/Node.js platform. It gives developers templated code to build universal React apps that incorporate modules that developers can leverage to add functionality to Node apps. It's also a key part of how Walmart's site runs, and you can believe that that site runs at scale. Walmart's site has 80 million monthly visitors, loads up to 10,000 requests per second, and includes 15 million items, adding more than one million new items each month -- nothing to shake a stick at. Read about some of the company’s open source contributions and programs here. Mozilla’s Open Mojo. You can always count on Mozilla for an interesting spin on open source. Last year, Mozilla launched the Mozilla Open Source Support Program (MOSS) – an award program specifically focused on supporting open source and free software. As The VAR Guy notes: "The Mozilla Foundation has long injected money into the open source ecosystem through partnerships with other projects and grants. But it formalized that mission last year by launching MOSS, which originally focused on supporting open source projects that directly complement or help form the basis for Mozilla's own products." Now, the company has announced that in the third quarter of this year, MOSS awarded over $300,000 to four projects which it either already supported, or which were in line with the Mozilla mission. The MOSS project is ongoing, and if you have a project that you think might qualify, you can take it to Mozilla. Facebook and Google Play Leapfrog. Facebook and Google have such active internal open source programs, with developers and engineers regularly contributing their inventions to the community, that they frequently leapfrog each other. For example, just as Facebook announced that it open sourced its machine learning system designed for artificial intelligence computing at large scale, Google announced that it open sourced new AI tools. The Google Open Source Programs site is worth checking in on regularly, as is Facebook Open Source.  In 2016 alone, Facebook has already open sourced more than 50 projects, many proven and tested internally. Many more organizations have active internal open source programs, and we will follow up with additional coverage of the most notable examples.

(AP) — Wal-Mart, long known for emphasizing low prices, wants to be known this holiday season for superior customer service. That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. The world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it’s especially critical for the holiday season. It’s adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it’s designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That’s up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store.

Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." Target's move to emphasize value actually comes as Wal-Mart itself has made prices a renewed focus. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart's U.S. stores, said that just like last year, the company will focus on rollbacks that last 90 days, pulling away from shorter-term promotions. A Roku 32-inch HDTV TV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season long this year. Target knows it's facing a challenge. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing. ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Flex2 - Morning Mail - Horizontal for Articles Tags Business General News Consumer Services Consumer Products And Services Financial Performance Corporate News Locations New Jersey United States North America More Headlines Entrepreneur: 'Patient success stories inspire me,' chiropractor says Minnesota-based manufacturer grows from humble beginnings How to choose the right amount for your FSA in 2017 Figuring out car’s high-tech dashboard no easy task Multimedia Editorial cartoons week of Nov. 14 Photos: The Reading Center Bright Stars Event Photos: Rochester Feed & Country Store's Paws with Santa Claus event Photos: Gasshuku at Eagle Bluff top right promo - flex2 What do you think?

Wal-Mart pushes service for holiday; Target stresses value Associated Press | 0 comments TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) — Wal-Mart, long known for emphasizing low prices, wants to be known this holiday season for superior customer service. That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. The world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it's especially critical for the holiday season. It's adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it's designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That's up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. Heading into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. The company has been benefiting from changes like cleaning up its stores and being sharper on prices. Wal-Mart's move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has also helped improve service. Target, though, had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. It blamed several factors, such as focusing too much on marketing its stylish merchandise and not enough on bringing in customers looking for deals on basics. Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC.

(AP) — Wal-Mart, long known for emphasizing low prices, wants to be known this holiday season for superior customer service. That comes after its main rival Target, which has a better image in that regard, stressed a focus on offering deals. The world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item a customer forgot. The ways in which Target and Wal-Mart are each trying to be more like the other underscore how traditional retailers have to raise their game in every aspect as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. Now, they have to be good at everything. Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, but it’s especially critical for the holiday season. It’s adding additional staff to handle the pickup of online orders at the stores, and for the first time, it’s designating a manager for that area for the holiday season. It also is dramatically adding more items that will be available for pickup. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also plans to have 150,000 product demonstrations across its more than 4,600 U.S. stores, in departments from toys to food. That’s up from last year. And Santas who used to remain stationary in one area of the store will roam around for more customer interaction. It expects about 23,000 appearances across its stores throughout the season. “We want to serve the customer as they want to be served,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Target, meanwhile, said Tuesday that about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year’s promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. Heading into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. The company has been benefiting from changes like cleaning up its stores and being sharper on prices. Wal-Mart’s move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has also helped improve service. Target, though, had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. It blamed several factors, such as focusing too much on marketing its stylish merchandise and not enough on bringing in customers looking for deals on basics. Both retailers are slated to report third-quarter results next month. “Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service, and for this holiday season it should be a boon,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. “I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle.” Target’s move to emphasize value actually comes as Wal-Mart itself has made prices a renewed focus. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores, said that just like last year, the company will focus on rollbacks that last 90 days, pulling away from shorter-term promotions. A Roku 32-inch HDTV TV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season long this year. Target knows it’s facing a challenge. “Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s senior vice president of marketing. ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season. After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." ON SERVICE: Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. ON PRICE: Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan, say about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing. Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders from earlier this week to Jan. 1. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Wal-Mart doesn't plan to waive the $50 minimum for free shipping, but noted that online shoppers who spend less than that can opt for store pickup. ON MERCHANDISE: Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products. Wal-Mart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup. Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places." The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Following three solid years of sales for tacky Christmas sweaters, the world's largest retailer this season increased its selection of holiday and novelty items by 40 percent. That includes a more robust offering in ugly sweaters, featuring out-of-this-world felines and a DJ Santa spinning records. "Customers just can't get enough of it, and the tackier the better," said Deanah Baker, a senior vice president who oversees Wal-Mart's apparel. "The more you can put on it the better it sells." Wal-Mart shared details on its holiday merchandising strategy at an event in its Teterboro, New Jersey, store on Wednesday. Along with a focus on novelty items, the big-box retailer will be offering more exclusive items than it ever has, including a $398 Disney Princess carriage. Despite a tough environment for clothing, which is being bogged down by deflation and disinterested consumers, Wal-Mart cited strength in its apparel business during the first half of the year. And while Baker doesn't predict the category will get any easier over the holidays, "we continue to get better," she said, speaking about the quality of Wal-Mart's product. Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer ramping up its selection of unsightly yuletide gear. Target on Tuesday said that it had bought enough matching holiday pajama sets to dress half a million families.

Wal-Mart is putting its stores center stage this holiday. In an effort to make its supercenters easier and more festive to shop, the world's largest retailer is calling on designated "holiday helpers," a better-staffed in-store pickup desk, and two times the number of product demonstrations. There also will be more exclusive merchandise than it ever has had, and it's keeping its distance from one-off promotions in favor of 90-day rollbacks. Wal-Mart outlined these holiday strategies from its Teterboro, New Jersey, store on Wednesday, following eight straight quarters of comparable sales gains for its U.S. division. But while the mass merchant is entering the season with some wind at its back, the overall retail industry is grappling with an ongoing shift toward online shopping, which is seen continuing throughout the critical fourth quarter. "We want to make it as easy as possible for them no matter how they want to shop," said Judith McKenna, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer. To do that, Wal-Mart has added designated "holiday helpers" to direct shoppers to the shortest checkout lines, open additional registers during busy hours and run back to fetch forgotten items. The number of helpers will vary by store volume and time of week, with extra workers being added on the weekends and in the final days before Christmas. Wal-Mart has not disclosed how many seasonal workers it's hired this year, but said recent investments into its workforce have in some cases allowed it to simply provide additional hours to existing employees. Holiday helpers are part of Wal-Mart's investment to beef up staffing at the front of its stores, McKenna said. The company is also adding extra support for in-store pickup of online orders, including a dedicated manager in every store. It's repainted these services counters a bright orange, to make them easier to locate. Making this service run smoothly will be critical for Wal-Mart this season, as it's added tens of thousands of items for same-day pickup. That could create a bottleneck if orders aren't filled when customers arrive. Added demand for the service will likely come from Wal-Mart's decision to maintain its minimum $50 spending requirement to receive free shipping. The world's largest retailer sat out this promotion last year, despite competitors Target and Best Buy offering it throughout the season. Wal-Mart says that most of its online orders meet the $50 minimum spending requirement, so maintaining that threshold doesn't put it at a disadvantage. Analysts last year credited Target's decision to provide free shipping on all orders as one reason its digital sales rose 34 percent. Wal-Mart's online revenue climbed 8 percent during the same quarter, albeit from a larger base. Target and Best Buy are both repeating their free shipping promotion this holiday. For its part, Wal-Mart has expanded the number of items on its website from roughly 8 million at the beginning of the year, to some 20 million. Its online operations will not yet include any influence from Jet.com, which it acquired in September. Another essential part of Wal-Mart's holiday strategy is ramping up the in-store experience. That means doubling the number of product demonstrations to 150,000, bringing in visits from Santa Claus and setting up new selfie booths. "It just engages people in a different way," Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies said. "It creates that little bit of extra excitement." Like Target, which at 1,800 is offering the most exclusive toys it ever has, Wal-Mart this year is selling a larger number of items that can't be found anywhere else. That includes 400 toys, such as its $398 motorized Disney Princess Carriage. That item has been so popular that the retailer has already had to order more, Bratspies said.

(Sarah Halzack/The Washington Post) TETERBORO, N.J. — This holiday shopping season, you’ll see plenty of red and green at Walmart. But you’re also going to see a lot of yellow. The big-box chain is investing in specialized teams of store workers known as “holiday helpers,” recognizable by their bright yellow vests, Santa hats and their festive shoulder bags. These staffers are going to be primarily focused on keeping checkout lines moving as efficiently as possible: They might direct you to an available cashier, open up an extra register, or run back into the aisles to get an item you forgot to grab. During a holiday strategy presentation at a Walmart store here, U.S. chief operating officer Judith McKenna said the holiday helper team was devised in response to shopper feedback. “That was actually the number one thing that customers told us,” McKenna said. “Which is, ‘how can you help us get through the checkouts faster?’” The holiday helpers are scheduled start showing up in stores on Nov. 4.  The number of such workers will vary by location, based on the size and sales volume, but each store will ramp up the number of helpers on weekends and other busy days. Walmart’s investment in holiday helpers is evidence that, even in the digital era, retailers are focused on fine-tuning the in-store experience. This is especially essential for a retailer such as Walmart, which still draws the vast majority of its sales from brick-and-mortar stores. The world’s largest retailer did not offer specifics on what its deals would be this November and December, but executives said the approach would be similar to 2015. Last year, the chain offered special Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals after the Thanksgiving Day holiday, but otherwise hewed to season-long promotions instead of things like weekend-long flash sales. Executives said they thought consumers would find that strategy less confusing and frustrating. Walmart also said it is expecting a surge in usage of its pickup program, which allows shoppers to order items online and retrieve them at a counter in the store. To make that operation run more smoothly, the retailer is moving this season to add department managers to its pickup areas. A sign that hangs behind the Teterboro store’s counter gives you a sense of their mandate: “High five for a less than five-minute wait time.” On the e-commerce front, Walmart hopes to deliver a stronger performance this year by relying on an expanded assortment of items. At the beginning of 2016, it had about 8 million items for sale online; today, it has about 20 million, including goods sold by third-party sellers on its marketplace. That’s a sharp improvement, and yet it is still far less than 350 million items Amazon.com is thought to carry. (Amazon’s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) And not all of Walmart’s 20 million items are available for same-day store pickup. As always, Walmart will also be trying to win the holiday shopping wars with its merchandise selection. In the toy aisle, it is counting on a lineup of 400 exclusive toys to distinguish its offering from the pack. In particular, executives pointed out a $398 ride-on Disney Princess Carriage that has been selling so fast that the chain has had to go back to the supplier to ask it to make more. In the apparel department, Walmart plans to ride the “ugly Christmas sweater” wave. In recent years, theme parties have abounded that ask revelers to come decked out in their cheesiest seasonal regalia. In turn, executives noticed that kitschy sweaters were selling well — and that men were often buying these garments in women’s size large. So they’ve ramped up their festive sweater offering this year, and also have gone big with other quirky pieces such as a slippers bedecked with emoji. Chief merchandising officer Steve Bratspies said Walmart has bought 40 percent more of these novelty-type items this holiday season compared with last year. business business true Please provide a valid email address.

(Photo: Brian Ach, for Walmart) TETERBORO, N.J. — Santa won’t be the only one with helpers this holiday season. Walmart is staffing its stores with associates who can steer customers to the quickest checkout station, and even run to grab a forgotten item so customers don’t lose their place in line. That’s just one element of Walmart’s plans to simplify this year’s holiday shopping experience, revealed Wednesday at the Walmart store here. Walmart employees will help customers in self-checkout kiosks, donning yellow vests that make them easy to spot, chain officials say. And like its big-box peers Target and Toys R Us, the world’s biggest retailer is also bolstering the option to buy online, then pick up the purchase at the store. "We're focusing now on an easy checkout experience, and we're also focusing on a seamless online and in-store experience,'' says Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. "The bottom line for this holiday is that we want to serve customers as they want to be served.'' A speedier checkout has been the top request of Walmart customers, McKenna says. A new holiday helper program will allow the opening of extra cash registers, if needed. They'll even have candy canes and stickers in hand. This year, for the first time, each of the retailer’s stores will also have a pick-up department manager to assist customers who order online and come to the store to get their goods. Staffers in the pick-up area will also be equipped with handheld devices to more quickly get packages into customers hands and out the door. "We recognize at the stores in particular that pickup is a key part of that experience,'' said McKenna, noting that the number of same day pickup orders during the holiday season is roughly five times the volume seen in a normal week.   "What customers tell us is it's great to have things delivered to their door. ... but sometimes it's more convenient for them to choose the time that they're going to pick up and they don't have to worry about a parcel being left on their door step." The hybrid approach — ordering online and picking up at the store — is a key way for more traditional retailers to capitalize on their network of stores and better compete with online behemoth Amazon. Customers still have the convenience of shopping online, but don’t have to wait for a delivery or worry about shipping costs. It also can keep customers from wasting a trip to the store to buy an item, only to find that it's not there,   Scott Bauer of consultancy PwC says. "The buy online and pick up in-store model matches confidence that a product is in stock, with convenience of getting it quickly," he says. This holiday season, Walmart will continue to increase the number of items available online, offer thousands of roll backs — reduced prices available for 90 days — and feature an array of exclusives including a Disney Princess Carriage and 3D Virtual Reality Drone. 54 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eOk85x

After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. In this Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, photo, a man playing the role of Santa Claus, center, and Karyn Ochiuzzo, right, of Wood-Ridge, N.J., pose for a photo taken by Bill Ochiuzzo at Wal-Mart in Teterboro, N.J. Wal-Mart may be known for its every low prices but this holiday season it wants to be known for service too. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." ON SERVICE: Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. ON PRICE: Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. Target, which has acknowledged that it failed to deliver on the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan, say about 60 percent of its marketing message this holiday season will be about value, up about 20 percent from last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer is repeating some of last year's promotions but also adding new ones aimed at getting shoppers to more areas of the store. "Value is the No. 1 determiner of where a guest will shop," said Rick Gomez, Target's senior vice president of marketing. Target is also extending its free shipping promotion by a week, waiving the shipping fee for all digital orders from earlier this week to Jan. 1. Wal-Mart doesn't plan to waive the $50 minimum for free shipping, but noted that online shoppers who spend less than that can opt for store pickup. ON MERCHANDISE: Both Target and Wal-Mart are offering even more exclusive products. Wal-Mart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup. Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places." The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Wal-Mart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Mark Tritton, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for Target, discusses some of the holiday products to be offered by the retailer, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, in New York.

Change at Walmart (MCAW) Oct 26, 2016, 21:34 ET Share this article BUENA PARK, Calif., Oct. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As part of a nationwide week of action that is calling on Walmart to stop selling Trump products, Making Change at Walmart (MCAW) and UFCW Local 324 will join with California Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva; Susan Sonne, candidate for Buena Park City Council; labor leaders and faith leaders at the Buena Park Walmart (8450 La Palma Avenue) at 4:30pm PT to demonstrate how America's largest retailer, Walmart, shares many of the same values as Donald Trump. WHAT: A rally organized by MCAW and UFCW Local 324 WHO: Hosted by Making Change at Walmart and UFCW Local 324; speakers will include: Rabbi Jonathan Klein, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice (CLUE) Rev. Arturo Ferreras-Querijero, St. Matthew Ecumenical Catholic Church Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva Susan Sonne, candidate for Buena Park City Council UFCW Local 324 President Greg Conger WHEN:  Thursday, October 27, 2016, at 4:30pm PT WHERE: Buena Park Walmart, 8450 La Palma Avenue, Buena Park CA 90620 BACKGROUND: A Match made in Hell just in time for Halloween Companies such as Macy's, NBC Universal, NASCAR, Serta and others have already distanced themselves from Trump's misogynistic, racist and offensive rhetoric. Walmart has not, and in fact still sells products that promote his campaign on Walmart.com. Officials from MCAW say that Walmart's silence equates to an endorsement of the controversial candidate. Rally organizers plan to show how Donald Trump's behavior bares an eerie resemblance to the behavior of America's largest corporation. Making Change at Walmart made the following comparison in a statement issued Wednesday: Both Trump and Walmart have taken advantage of tax loopholes to avoid paying millions in taxes. Both have vocally trumpeted their patriotic roots publicly while quietly relying on foreign imports to provide billions in revenue to their bottom line.  Both have been at the receiving end of sexual misconduct allegations. Trump's ongoing feud with 10 women who have publicly accused him of sexual misconduct will eventually find its way to court if Trump follows through with promises to sue, according to multiple press reports, including the New York Times. Walmart was the subject of the largest Class Action lawsuit ever in 2010, when current and former female employees charged the company with discriminating against them by paying them less than men. The week of action includes similar events in Washington, DC; Cincinnati, OH; Minneapolis, MN; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and New York City.  Call Jenny Divish, 424-625-6037; jdivish@ufcw.org Or Todd Conger (714) 920-0918 for more information.   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/making-change-at-walmart-anti-walmart-and-anti-trump-rally-in-buena-park-300352260.html SOURCE Making Change at Walmart (MCAW) My News Release contains wide tables.

The store reversed that decision this week and carts are once again deposit-free. File photo. Shoppers who frequent the Walmart in New Sudbury no longer have to fish for a loonie in order to use a shopping cart. The store decided this week that customers will no longer have to insert $1 into the carts in order to use them. Back in April, New Sudbury Walmart announced that shoppers would be required to deposit $1 to use the carts, and their dollar would be returned once the cart was returned. The reasoning behind the decision was to attempt to curb theft of the carts, as well as deter customers from leaving them scattered about the parking lot. The announcement of the $1 deposit was met with an outpouring of disapproval from shoppers, with some commenters on Sudbury.com saying they would no longer shop at the New Sudbury Walmart. Shopping carts at New Sudbury Walmart still have the coin slot, but they are no longer needed to use the carts. "The coin slots are still on there, but they've just been moved over so that people don't have to lock them together," said a manager at New Sudbury Walmart who didn't wish to have their name on the record. Sudbury.com received letters from readers who condemned the idea, and others who didn't see the $1 deposit as a big deal.

(WDRB) -- Walmart has backed out of plans to build a supercenter at 18th Street and Broadway in west Louisville. Walmart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said the company has decided not to pursue developing the store "after much deliberation and consideration of various business factors and extensive delays to the project." Announced in March 2014, the store had been touted as a boost for economic development in west Louisville, though its suburban-style layout also sparked a lawsuit. Steve Porter, the attorney who filed the suit against Walmart, says one of the main points of the lawsuit was the proposed design and how the parking lot was positioned.  "There was never any push from the city administration to help reach a a compromise," he said.  Porter said that his side had agreed on a deal earlier this year with the land developer, Teresa Bridgewater of New Bridge Development. He added that the lawsuit would be pulled as long as New Bridge Development built other businesses around the Walmart.   Walmart's announced pull-out Friday comes despite subsidies the city had committed for the development -- deals it normally would not offer for a big-box store. Metro government contributed $1.8 million to the property's developer to assemble land and offered Walmart a $500,000 "grant" for building the store. Earlier this month, Walmart said it would open only about half as many supercenters next year as it did last fiscal year, allowing more investments in e-commerce, technology and customer service, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Our project at 18th and Broadway was a casualty of their changing business strategy," Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press conference Friday. "It is a testament to some people's insistence that progress must only be made on their terms, even if it is a small group of citizens."

I’m referring to your article about Walmart now charging customers five cents each for plastic shopping bags. Walmart says it’s doing it to save the environment. Give me a break. They’re simply the king of nickel and diming (ask any of their suppliers) and are passing yet another cost of doing business on to the customer. If they really cared about the environment, they would ask, or tell, their suppliers to back off the overabundance of plastic packaging on the merchandise. I think what bothers me most about the article, as it’s just another example of Islander apathy. Look at all the dirty deeds going on behind the Liberal government doors and a recent poll shows Islanders falling all over themselves saying they would re-elect this bunch tomorrow. Just my five cents’ worth.   Lloyd Kerry, Charlottetown E-Edition Do not miss your latest complete newspaper edition.

City Transportation Department Director Fabrizia Rodriguez has developed two fixed routes, named "purple" and "gold," with 22 bus stops overall between the two loops. Each route would have a total of 15 stops before going back to its first stop, with the approximate maximum wait for a bus stop on the "purple" route at 15 minutes and the "gold" route at 20 minutes. Rodriguez is planning to implement the new system on Dec. 1, with the standard fare remaining unchanged at $2. Riders will also begin to utilize the ropes inside buses, which they will pull on to signal they want to get off at the next bus stop, according to Rodriguez. She said this would help bus runs operate more efficiently and avoid unnecessary stops. "If nobody needs to stop at the next stop and the driver is approaching the next stop and he doesn't see anybody standing at the corner waiting for a bus, he's going to keep on going," Rodriguez said. The proposed gold route stops in order from first to last include the Riverfront Center, Stewart's Shop on East Main Street, Creative Connections Clubhouse, Church and Willow streets, Virginia Lane, Woodrow Road and Clizbe Avenue, Isabel's Field, Target at Amsterdam Commons, behind Wal-Mart along Tessiero Square, St. Mary's Amsterdam Memorial building off Route 30, Northampton Road and Guy Park Avenue, Henrietta Street and Guy Park Avenue, St. Mary's Hospital, Amsterdam Amtrak Station and Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook. The proposed purple route stops include Rite Aid, Walgreens, behind Wal-Mart along Tessiero Square, Isabel's Field, Emerald Cinemas, St. Mary's Amsterdam Memorial building, Lincoln Avenue and Market Street, Montgomery County Office for Aging office, Northampton Road and Guy Park Avenue, Henrietta Street and Guy Park Avenue, St. Mary's Hospital, Amsterdam Housing Authority, Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook and the Riverfront Center. The proposed purple route is planned to operate on Saturday, so people can travel to the commercial corridor along Route 30. There were 25 bus stop signs purchased in 2010, but never installed. Rodriguez said she is planning to install the signs after implementing the new route style system. She said the current bus system acts more like a taxi service, which she believes is not the most efficient method to operate the transportation service. If someone wants to utilize the bus service now, they must call the dispatcher at the transportation office and request to be picked up. The bus will only pick people up within the city limits and travel within the city limits or just outside the limits along the Route 30 corridor. There are some runs in the morning traveling to certain major employers in the area, along with a bus run to Albany. After a person requests a pick-up, they are given an approximate time the bus will arrive at their location to pick them up. There are two buses operating in different zones within the city, but depending on where the rider wants to travel the bus could end up driving outside of its zone. Generally, there is a bus covering east to west along Route 5 and another bus covering north to south along Route 30. The bus drivers at the beginning of their shift are given a list of pre-scheduled pick ups, with some riders calling on a weekly basis to schedule their appointments to be picked up. There are around 15 regular riders daily taking a bus to work and around another 20 riders daily traveling for healthcare services. Then riders will call in throughout the day to schedule a pick up. The current system does not have any designated bus stops, but there is a bus run to Fonda where riders would be picked up at Stewart's stores, according to Rodriguez. This run is planned to be terminated under the new route system. "We had three riders last month take that bus and we send it three days a week," Rodriguez said. Mayor Michael Villa hired Rodriguez as the director of the transportation department about a month ago after Cheryl Scott retired from the position this past summer. The position was also changed from full to part time, with Amsterdam officials amending the city charter to allow for it. Villa had worked with the former transportation director to craft more of a loop style service, with the proposal unveiled in April. The new system had been in the process of being implemented before Scott retired, but then was stalled until Rodriguez was hired. Rodriguez then made some additional tweaks to what had been in development prior to her joining the department. There is currently an Albany commuter route from Amsterdam to the Department of Transportation and state campus offices, but Rodriguez is planning to have that bus make a couple new stops in Schenectady. She is looking for one stop to be at the Rivers Casino and Resort, which is still being constructed. First Ward Alderman Edward Russo said the additional stops in Schenectady could help the department generate more revenue. "Now with the casino coming in Schenectady that might be something that can bring in some revenue," Russo said. She is also looking to add routes to the Target Distribution Center, Beech-Nut and Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook pedestrian bridge. Adding four to five more routes directly to major employers she said would allow the department to qualify for a minimum $50,000 stipend in addition to what the state already provides the city. Rodriguez has also begun conversations about cost sharing through partnerships with major employers and the Greater Amsterdam School District. This would allow for an organization to purchase a large quantity of vouchers at a discounted price, which would then be provided to employees or parents and students. She said the cost sharing partnerships could help offset the cost of the service for riders. Her first day on the job, Rodriguez said she followed up with grant funds previously awarded and approved by prior city council members. There were funds awarded to replace an aging bus for $131,000, install video cameras and a GPS surveillance system in buses for $35,000, purchase around $16,5000 of equipment for bus mechanics, and purchase new two-way radios for $10,000. The grant funding was awarded through the federal Department of Transportation and the overall costs for the purchases would require the city to cover 10 percent of the expense, with 80 percent coming through federal funds and 10 percent through state funds. Rodriguez said she plans to periodically audit the video footage from buses and footage could also be reviewed if there were any issues or complaints reported. While resolutions were approved by a prior administration for the various expenditures, there were never bids sought to purchase equipment, according to Rodriguez. Russo said city officials had not followed through with grant funding because there had been uncertainty over the future of the department and whether the city would continue to operate the service in-house. "The biggest thing was we weren't really sure what we were going to do with transportation, whether we were going to keep it," Russo said. "The money is still there and we need to go forward with it and see what happens." There was also $26,000 of capital funding allocated for the transportation department, split evenly between last fiscal year and this fiscal year, which Rodriguez has proposed to use towards purchasing some shelters and benches for riders waiting at bus stops. She said there are not shelters in place to date. The new benches and shelters would also have space to accommodate advertising. Rodriguez is also in the process of trying to attract advertisers for space inside of buses and on the benches and shelters proposed to be purchased. "All of those sponsors for ads kind of just fell through because of all the commotion about whether or not we were going to close," Rodriguez said. "That's something I want to make sure everybody who used to help sponsor ads understands that we're not going away. The council and leadership we have now are definitely trying to make improvements to keep it going and provide more services." Russo agreed the uncertainty over the department had affected the city's ability to attract advertisers. The department had been projected to operate at a $140,000 revenue shortfall this year, which would be a slight reduction from last year at a $150,000. The deficit for the department in 2014 was about $350,000. Rodriguez said she is confident the change in routes to designated bus stops would help riders better understand what services are available and increase ridership, which would boost revenues for the department. "The clarity of the bus stops, where we go and how much we charge is just going to increase ridership," Rodriguez said. "I think it's really going to increase the ridership so much that the amount of fares we have will drastically improve. At the same time business are going to see more riders on ... and they're going to want to advertise with us more."       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/14/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Party chairs hope for good turnout at Montgomery polls Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Wheeler, Pepe and Stark vie for District 7 legislature seat Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Tuesday, November 08, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 GASD students choose Clinton Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Mattice case adjourned for pre-plea investigation (2) Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Mead selected to replace Clayburn as county DPW head (1) Food Network stuffs lineup with Turkey Day shows (0) Side dishes for a perfect Thanksgiving dinner (0) Trump told folks they mattered (0) Rocker Leon Russell dies in Nashville (0) Moviegoers rush to 'Doctor Strange,' 'Arrival' post-election (0) Supermoon to light up the sky (0) New Zealand plans rescue of tourists stranded by earthquake (0) Facts and figures for the opening of deer hunting season (4) B-P considers joining forces to reduce its solar farm fee(4) DEC officers have been hard at work during deer season (2) LaPortes celebrate 60th anniversary (2) Taking part in an unforgettable deer hunt was an honor (2) Schools consider options for taxing solar farm projects(2) Amsterdam's Fedullo signs with Saint Rose(1) Joyce A.

Murray Illustration Marc Nipp When I ask retail CEOs what differentiates their stores from the competition, they inevitably talk about customer service and the in-store experience. Yet, when I speak to consumers about their shopping experiences, I commonly hear about disinterested employees, out-of-stock products, awkward return processes, restocking fees, messy shelves and a general struggle to find the products that they want. Clearly, there is a gap between what retailers would like to offer to every customer every day and what they are actually able to provide. That is probably not surprising. If you are Walmart or Starbucks or Zara, you have tens of thousands of employees working in thousands of stores, serving millions of customers, all around the world. Canadian retail giants from Loblaws to Indigo Books to Canadian Tire face a similar problem of scale and scope. The advantage of being big can easily become a liability. Ensuring that every employee in each of those stores is passionate about customer service and the products they sell may be an impossible task. At the same time, corporate giants are under constant pressure to grow their revenue and increase their profitability, which is not always consistent with a good customer experience. As a result, small independent retailers have a tremendous opportunity to succeed in today’s marketplace. The path to success, however, is not what it used to be. Small companies will struggle to compete based on store locations, selection of national brands and product pricing. The big guys have many stores and tremendous power in the supply chain to negotiate and push down prices. Instead, small retailers have an advantage in their ability to deliver personal service, curate unique proprietary products and, increasingly, custom build products. A few successful small retailers have been following this approach for years. For more than 40 years, Calgary’s Owl’s Nest Books, for example, has built its business and reputation on personalized reading recommendations. The employees at Owl’s Nest are passionate about what they do and genuinely interested in their products and their customers. More recently, we have seen Albertan entrepreneurs – like Rocky Mountain Soap Company and Lux Beauty Boutique – leverage small product selections and exceptional service to crack the ultra-competitive cosmetics market. Others have contributed to the growth and expansion of new markets, such as Carbon Environmental Boutique in Edmonton and Reworks in Calgary. I have been especially impressed with small retailers that are taking a chance and bringing their own unique tastes to market. The Uncommons in Calgary is known for sourcing innovative products directly from designers. In Edmonton, The Prints and The Paper recently opened on 124 Street and brings a carefully selected assortment of products that wouldn’t look out of place in the trendiest shops in New York or London. These small companies, and many others, are leading the evolution of independent retail in Alberta. They are not trying to undercut Walmart’s prices, offer Zara’s product selection or be more convenient than Starbucks. Instead, they are passionately serving a segment of customers that they understand with a level of service and a carefully selected assortment of products that larger chains cannot match. While that evolution continues, other small businesses are leveraging technology to revolutionize traditional retail markets. Edmonton’s Poppy Barley has been celebrated for their custom-made footwear with an international reputation for innovation and quality. Less well known, but potentially more revolutionary, is Suits by Curtis Eliot, also based in Edmonton. This fast-growing company is an exciting combination of old-world tailoring and modern tech company that designs and fits suits to its individual customer’s tastes and style. The service is one-on-one, the product is custom built and the quality is world class. They don’t have the flashy locations many of their competitors pay top dollar to maintain, nor do they tie up capital in inventory that may or may not sell. Instead, they focus on a personalized customer experience and a sophisticated supply chain that connects raw materials to the craftspeople that build the final product. As large retailers struggle to evolve their own businesses to give customers a reason to come into the store rather than buying online, many small retailers are leading the way with truly exceptional shopping experiences. Ultimately, customers will vote with their wallets, but this approach to small retail presents a substantial challenge to big retailers. It is not, however, a guarantee of success. Starting a small business and keeping it afloat is as tough as it has ever been. Yet, because consumers are becoming more diverse and more demanding, new opportunities are opening up to meet their needs with superior service and a unique selection of products. In many ways, there has never been a more exciting and promising time to open your own store.

In what is perhaps an effort to continue improving its chronically weak customer satisfaction scores, Walmart is inviting employees to be “holiday helpers” by wearing yellow vests, Santa hats, and red sashes and assist consumers in reducing check out time. Their responsibilities will include helping patrons find the shortest lines, unload shopping carts, working the cash registers, and retrieving items customers may have intended to buy but forgot to pick up. “The Holiday Helpers are actually a great combination of a little bit of retail-tainment to bring fun back into the store, and it serves an incredibly practical purpose,” said Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to Fortune during a press briefing on Wednesday in Teterboro, New Jersey. “That’s the #1 thing that customers told us; they want faster checkout.” Walmart has had considerable business success by improving its customer service. After learning that shoppers complained about slow checkouts, Walmart decided to add more cashiers. When that resulted in a rise in sales (which has now lasted for eight consecutive quarters), they doubled down on emphasizing customer service, from bringing back its door-greeters to spending $3 billion on raising store workers’ paychecks. Despite its recent successes, Walmart still has an unsavory reputation among progressive communities. It has been particularly criticized for pushing out local businesses and mistreating its own employees, particularly through inadequate pay and unsafe working conditions.  Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Prison time in Walmart fire case SC Police Robert Rogers, shown here in a surveillance image, set fire to the Southridge Walmart March 2. Share Article By Jeff Jenkins in News | October 27, 2016 at 1:11PM CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A Kentucky man who set fire to the Southridge Walmart in South Charleston earlier this year was sentenced Thursday to prison time. Robert Rogers, 41, was ordered to spend three years and seven months in prison after September guilty pleas to third degree arson and grand larceny charges. Rogers was arrested March 2 in Logan County hours after he set fire in the sporting goods section of the store to draw attention away from the jewelry counter where he was stealing items worth $2,600. Surveillance video put Rogers in several parts of the store before the fire. The fire closed a section of the store and impacted everyone who worked there, Southridge Walmart Manager George Skinner said. “It negatively effected the “My Share Bonus” of the 450 associates financially, including myself, that we didn’t make up that money on.  You know we’re never going to get that back.  And, you know, given some of those associates, basically a week’s worth of pay they weren’t able to get,” Skinner said Thursday. South Charleston Police Sgt. Pat Rader previously said the fire was significant. “It was luck our fire department got there as quickly as they did and put it out as quickly as they did,” he said. “It could have been much, much worse.” Kanawha County Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman handed down Thursday’s sentence.

Photographer: Xinhua/Polaris Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp In April 2013, when the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh crumbled and killed more than a thousand garment workers, Western clothing executives were chastened. They were the ones, after all, who’d been pressuring Bangladesh’s apparel factories to cheaply reproduce runway trends for consumers in the U.S. and Europe who’d grown used to $10 dresses. Following the accident, H&M, Zara, Walmart, Gap, and other major brands announced they’d fund and oversee factory inspections in Bangladesh, demanding improvements from facilities that fell short and cutting off business with those that didn’t get better. Bangladesh, with the help of the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO), created its own inspection program and vowed to shut down unsafe facilities. Better vigilance, everyone figured, would be central to preventing similar accidents from happening again. Three years have passed, and an uncomfortable truth is emerging: Vigilance isn’t enough. Factories in Bangladesh have improved, completing more than 60 percent of fixes required by the inspectors sent by clothing brands. Still, of some 1,600 factories covered by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, a major inspection program run by the brands, more than 80 percent are behind schedule on improvements. Factories in a smaller brand-organized program, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, have also lagged. The government, too, has made limited progress: It’s shut down just 39 facilities that posed an “immediate” danger to workers. Meanwhile, the corporate and government investigators, along with outside organizations, keep finding defects: faulty sprinklers, exit stairwells used for storage, missing fire doors. On Oct. 27 a California-based company called LaborVoices, which surveys garment workers by phone, will release a report finding that, among dozens of Bangladesh garment factories where its respondents were employed, nearly half had a high risk of experiencing safety issues in case of a fire. “There’s been so much attention put on this, it’s kind of surprising so little progress has been made,” says Kohl Gill, the chief executive officer of LaborVoices. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising. The craze for cheap, on-trend clothing that helped turn Bangladesh into the world’s second-biggest apparel exporter, after China, has actually intensified since the disaster. Low-priced brands keep undercutting one another, and that keeps squeezing the factories that produce their clothes. This is the backdrop against which factory owners are expected to make time-consuming, expensive improvements. Edward Hertzman, the founder of the Sourcing Journal, a trade publication, describes a bind: Owners get pressed by brands’ inspectors to upgrade factories as the same brands’ businesspeople are haggling with them to work faster and charge less. “You can’t on the one hand have lower prices and on the other hand have rising standards,” says Sarah Labowitz, a co-director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. To start, there’s a basic math problem. The ILO estimated in June that the upgrades mandated for factories would cost $929 million. Of that, $635 million in renovations hadn’t been made. Factory owners have two main options for funding renovations: either cover the cost themselves or take out loans. Both approaches are problematic. Garment factories’ profit margins are thin, leaving them with little cash sitting around to reinvest. At the same time, financial institutions have limited credit to dole out and can be reluctant to lend to garment factories because of the risk of not being repaid; available loans have interest rates running upwards of 10 percent. Factories have trouble meeting the expensive and time-consuming safety requirements Through the Accord and Alliance groups, clothing brands offer some financial help, but it’s limited. Some brands are guaranteeing loans to factories, which can increase banks’ willingness to lend. But experts say an indirect approach is more typical: A brand will commit to ordering garments well into the future, sometimes paying for them in advance, which can provide factory owners with funds for some renovations or help them prove to loan officers that they’re financially secure and can be trusted to repay a loan. However, brands tend to be most helpful to their most important suppliers, and the rest can be reluctant to press for aid because they’re worried about the consequences. “They wonder, ‘Am I going to lose orders down the road because I asked for help?’ ” says Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a labor-rights organization. All this helps explain why the ILO report identified a financing gap of $448 million for improvements. The challenges go beyond the financial. Rubana Huq, the managing director of a company that supplies H&M and other major brands, says her customers promised to do business with her over a period of several years as long as she made sure her factories were safe. She was able to take out a loan, albeit at a 12 percent interest rate, to buy equipment. Still, it took months to find and acquire what she needed, some of which had to be imported. The time-consuming and expensive work of meeting safety standards came just as brands were pressing her to be more efficient—shorthand for doing more work in less time and at a lower cost. While she’s now made the most significant fixes, she says her progress is still considered delayed because she hasn’t yet installed some small items. Huq expects to finish the work by the end of October, knowing how important that is to her customers. When I ask her about the slow progress across Bangladesh’s factories, she says, “I think there could be more empathy. I don’t know how we’re expected to remediate so quickly.” So far, the government has shut down only those factories that posed an imminent risk to employees. If it lets imperfect, if not immediately dangerous, factories continue to operate, that could endanger garment workers. At the same time, the garment industry is a major employer, credited with helping to cut the country’s poverty rate almost in half since the 1990s, to just over 31 percent; if a lot of factories are closed just because they haven’t addressed every detail on an inspector’s checklist, that could leave a significant portion of the population without a job. Also, Bangladesh’s garment industry is facing serious competition from other countries, and if it becomes costlier to source clothing from Bangladesh—if there are fewer factories competing for their business, for instance—Western brands could migrate elsewhere. “Bangladesh looks nervously at Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma, Ethiopia,” NYU’s Labowitz says. Still, Bangladesh’s garment industry is still growing, with factories opening all the time; closing down bad ones, then, wouldn’t necessarily lead to overall job losses. Tuomo Poutiainen, an ILO program manager helping with the government’s efforts, says he believes factories should be given the opportunity to address defects but that he expects the government will “use a stronger hand” as time goes on. Huq tells me that, based on her experience, she believes most factories will make the appropriate improvements within a couple of years. But her experience might not be typical. Huq, who was traveling in Europe when we spoke, has close relationships with Western brands. Most factories, though, are smallish operations whose ties to brands are tenuous. These are the likeliest to lack financing. The good news is all this suggests the delays aren’t inevitable. Some adjustments to the brand-and government-run programs could, at least, speed progress. The ILO report, for example, recommended that the government help lower interest rates on loans and that more organizations chip in with capital for banks to lend out. More radically, brands could pay for some improvements themselves, and the government could close more of the factories that are behind on repairs while helping entrepreneurs open higher-quality facilities, perhaps with some aid from brands. But the Accord and Alliance programs are only in place till 2018. That leaves little time for change to happen. Vara also contributes to the Atlantic, Harper’s, and Fast Company.

(WMT) is gearing up for the upcoming holiday season by deploying an army of Holiday Helpers to help customers get through the checkout process faster during the busy period. The retailer has also increased the amount of products available through its Pickup service, lowered the price on thousand of items, and plans to expand the online assortment in the coming months. Starting November 4, Walmart's 'holiday helpers' will be in stores dedicated to helping customers in the checkout line. The holiday helpers, clad in yellow vests and wearing festive Santa hats, will assist customers with finding the shortest line, open registers as needed, and will even quickly fetch items that customers might have forgotten. During peak times, Walmart will ramp up the number of holiday helpers serving customers at its stores. The retailer noted that during busy holiday shopping weeks, it receives up to five times as many same-day pickup orders as compared to a normal week. To cope with the busy season, Walmart has expanded the assortment available for pickup overall and has added thousands of items in categories such as apparel, seasonal décor, toys, and electronics for same-day Pickup. In order to ensure that the operations run smoothly, the retailer will deploy additional Pickup staff, including dedicated Pickup managers in every store for the first time. To kick off the season, the retailer has launched thousands of new rollbacks combined with tens of thousands of items available at low prices every day. For example, Walmart will offer a new Roku 32-inch HDTV for $125 in November and December, which is the same price as the retailer's Black Friday offer last year. On the e-commerce front, Walmart has grown its online assortment from roughly 8 million at the start of 2016 to 20 million at present, with plans to add millions of items in the coming months. The company is also making its broader assortment easier to shop. Starting November 1, Walmart.com will feature a top 20 list of items to help customers discover exclusive offerings as well as great prices and products.

The company is making good progress. By the end of last year, Walmart US had achieved 82 percent diversion of materials from landfill and diverted an average of 71 percent in international markets. Earlier this year the retail giant extended its zero-waste goal to include the entire supply chain, “from farming and manufacturing, consumption to end of life.” Zero waste is a smart business move. Eliminating waste avoids landfill fees and grows revenue from resale of reusable materials. It’s also a lofty aspiration and one that requires Walmart — and any other corporation that wants to fully eliminate waste — to collaborate with suppliers, customers and communities. This includes taking back some products from consumers and returning these materials to the production stream, encouraging communities to invest in recycling infrastructure through the Closed Loop Fund and working with suppliers to improve the recyclability of their packaging. On Tuesday, Walmart hosted a Sustainable Packaging Summit, attended by hundreds of Walmart suppliers and merchants. At the event, Walmart launched its Sustainable Packaging Playbook, a guide to best-practices such as maximizing recycled and sustainably sources renewable content, reducing materials used through better packaging design and designing for recyclability. This, in turn, will help the retailer achieve zero waste, said Walmart’s Zach Freeze, director, strategic initiatives – sustainability, in an interview. “Packaging is an essential part of the products that we sell,” Freeze said. “In the playbook, we talk about recyclability and making sure that messaging is clear to the customer. For us, it’s all about clear guidance. We want to provide clear guidance to our suppliers about optimizing design and supporting recycling and we want to make it easier for our customers to recycle packaging.” Using the playbook can also help suppliers cut costs, by using fewer resources in packaging and choosing recycled materials, which cost less than virgin materials. The Sustainable Packaging Playbook provides tips for suppliers, including working with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and the Association of Plastic Recyclers to design for recycling. It also suggests suppliers avoid using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or biodegradable additives in petroleum based plastics. It highlights several suppliers that are already ahead of the curve in these areas such as Coca-Cola’s Simply Lemonade brand, which now uses polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers with pressure sensitive labels compatible with recycling. About 30 percent of PET packaging collected for recycling in the US is not recycled, largely because of labels with adhesives, the playbook says. “Simply Lemonade is one example of how to encourage design changes,” Freeze said. “We also want to encourage recycled content.” An example of this is L’Oréal, which redesigned one of its shampoo bottles to include 30 percent to 50 percent, which reduced the amount of PET used by 10 percent. The playbook also asks Walmart suppliers to clearly communicate recyclability by using consumer-friendly labels, such as the Sustainable Packaging Coalition’s How2Recycle label, a standardized label that clearly communicates recycling instructions to the public. “Customers want to be able to recycle, but some are confused” about whether a package is recyclable if it doesn’t have a recycling symbol or language on it, Freeze said. “Clear language and a clear symbol make this easier for consumers.” As the company recognizes in its most recent corporate sustainability report, reducing waste makes it a more profitable and competitive company as well. “Moving toward a zero waste future benefits business as well as society,” the 2016 report says. “Eliminating operational waste avoids landfill fees and increases revenue from resale of salvaged materials. Reducing waste upstream, increasing recycled content and repurposing products can lower cost of goods and generate innovative products for customers.” This also extends to the retailers’ suppliers, which can realize similar benefits by cutting their waste through sustainable packaging initiatives. And with a boost from companies like Walmart that have major purchasing power, we expect to see more innovative waste management and packing efforts taking hold.

(WMT) is gearing up for the upcoming holiday season by deploying an army of Holiday Helpers to help customers get through the checkout process faster during the busy period. The retailer has also increased the amount of products available through its Pickup service, lowered the price on thousand of items, and plans to expand the online assortment in the coming months. Starting November 4, Walmart's "holiday helpers" will be in stores dedicated to helping customers in the checkout line. The holiday helpers, clad in yellow vests and wearing festive Santa hats, will assist customers with finding the shortest line, open registers as needed, and will even quickly fetch items that customers might have forgotten. During peak times, Walmart will ramp up the number of holiday helpers serving customers at its stores. The retailer noted that during busy holiday shopping weeks, it receives up to five times as many same-day pickup orders as compared to a normal week. To cope with the busy season, Walmart has expanded the assortment available for pickup overall and has added thousands of items in categories such as apparel, seasonal décor, toys, and electronics for same-day Pickup. In order to ensure that the operations run smoothly, the retailer will deploy additional Pickup staff, including dedicated Pickup managers in every store for the first time. To kick off the season, the retailer has launched thousands of new rollbacks combined with tens of thousands of items available at low prices every day. For example, Walmart will offer a new Roku 32-inch HDTV for $125 in November and December, which is the same price as the retailer's Black Friday offer last year. On the e-commerce front, Walmart has grown its online assortment from roughly 8 million at the start of 2016 to 20 million at present, with plans to add millions of items in the coming months. The company is also making its broader assortment easier to shop. Starting November 1, Walmart.com will feature a top 20 list of items to help customers discover exclusive offerings as well as great prices and products. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories Nasdaq Names Adena Friedman CEO Cedar Crest Cookie Dough Ice Cream Recalled Naughty Dating Site Adult Friendfinder Users Exposed By Hack Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Stocks Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary McDonald's Trying Sriracha Big Mac IPO Watch: WildHorse Wants To Fund Acquisition Stocks Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Major Averages Turning In Mixed Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Trump To Take Only $1 As Salary; No Vacations Trump Names Priebus As Chief Of Staff; Stephen Bannon As Chief Strategist Diabetes Grows In Alarming Pace <<Previous        45 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Wal-Mart Pulls Controversial Suicide Scar Makeup Kit Walmart To Invest $50 Mln In Logistics & O2O Grocery Platform New Dada, China Walmart's Vudu Offers HD Movies, TV Shows With Limited Ads For Free Wal-Mart Stores Investment Community Meeting At 9:00 AM ET Trade WMT now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise ARWR's Hepatitis B Drug On Clinical Hold, GMED Disappoints, A First For MYL AdvancePierre Foods Appoints Christopher Sliva As President ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Facebook Taking Aim At LinkedIn Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Rio Tinto Suspends Unit CEO Alan Davies Amid Guinea Payments Investigation Alstom Turns To Profit In H1; Sales, Orders Up; Backs 2020 View - Quick Facts Kuka Group Q3 Profit Surges; Lowers FY16 Sales Outlook - Quick Facts HeidelbergCement Q3 Profit Down;says Confident To Exceed €400 Mln Synergy Target Osram Licht Q4 Profit Declines; Sees Growth In 2017 - Quick Facts Heidelberg Reports Positive Net Result In Q2; Affirms Fiscal Year Targets Carlsberg Q3 Revenues Decline; But Lifts FY16 Profit Outlook - Quick Facts E.ON 9-month Loss Narrows; Confirms 2016 Profit Outlook Munich Re Lifts FY View, Q3 Profit Rises - Quick Facts Swiss Life 9-month Fee Income Rises; Premiums Down; On Track For FY16 Targets Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 27 October 2016 | MYT 3:40 PM Wal-Mart focuses on online order pickup in stores, lower prices Increased focus: Wal-Mart said the volume of items ordered online and then picked up in stores the same day increases by five times during the holiday season, so it plans to make more items across categories including apparel, toys and seasonal décor available in that manner. — Reuters NEW YORK: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it will make tens of thousands more items from its online assortment available for same-day store pickup, and will offer more lower-priced items instead of deals as part of efforts to attract shoppers this holiday season.  Wal-Mart said the volume of items ordered online and then picked up in stores the same day increases by five times during the holiday season, so it plans to make more items across categories including apparel, toys and seasonal décor available in that manner.  Buy online and pick up in store has been a key offering from brick-and-mortar retailers, which use their store inventory to fulfil online orders the same day and compete with rival Amazon.com Inc's fast delivery times.  Wal-Mart also said it will focus more on discounts and offering the lowest prices on items instead of "gimmicky" product deals, for a second year in a row, as it said their customers expect more consistent pricing.  The moves were announced at a media briefing to outline its strategy for the November and December holiday shopping season, a crucial time for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales.  "We want to lead on price and win the season on price," Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart's US operations, told reporters.  Relentless price competition from Amazon.com, supermarkets and dollar stores has made it crucial for Wal-Mart to compete on price and highlight its low-price offerings.  Wal-Mart will, however, not follow its competitors in offering free shipping. It will continue to require a minimum online order of US$50 (RM209) to qualify for no shipping charges. Rival Target Corp on Oct 25 extended its free shipping offer from Dec 26 to Jan 1.  The retailer will also focus on making its store checkouts faster, Wal-Mart chief operating officer Judith McKenna said. Dedicated staff wearing yellow vests will help shoppers find open registers and the shortest lines, as well as grabbing items customers may have forgotten. — Reuters You May Be Interested Rynet Malaysia offers training for PHP certification Facebook glitch turns user profiles into memorial pages Bangladesh retrieves a fifth of US$81mil stolen in cyber heist Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

This week, Walmart pulled ‘suicide scars’ after mental health advocates voiced concerns. Local psychiatrists want to remind trick-or-treaters and parents to be sensitive to what others may be experiencing. Dr. Neal Dunsieth says mental illness is a health condition, not Halloween entertainment. “The industry has a lot of these costumes out there. Bloody nurse or straight-jacket costumes,” said Dunsieth, chief clinical officer with the Montgomery County Alcohol Drug and Mental Health Services board. The ‘psych ward’ themed costumes are at almost every Halloween store and can be found in bulk online. Dunsieth says the costumes can trigger people with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder to act out or hurt their feelings. “Some of the costumes really stigmatize mental illness,” he said. Dunsieth believes terms like ‘nuts’, ‘psycho’ and ‘crazy’ are used too loosely in society. “They’re are hurtful words. They are charged enough that when a person with mental issues hears them, it really does have an effect.” When it comes to choosing a Halloween costume, Dunsieth says if you can’t talk your kid out of a ‘psych ward’ outfit talk to them about it. “At least make it a conversation. Make them think about what they are doing and what they are representing,” he said. Tips on how to talk to your kids about mental illness: Cover the basics. It’s often helpful to start with simple facts about mental illnesses and dispel some of the common myths surrounding them. Keep the child’s age and maturity level in mind. Make sure your kids feel safe and secure.

This time, it’s ranked No. 24 on Forbes Magazine’s 2016 Best Places for Business and Careers. According to a new article released Oct. 19, Forbes looked at the 200 largest metro areas by population in the U.S., and rated them based on 14 metrics related to job growth, costs (business and living), income growth, quality of life and the education of the labor force. Fayetteville came in at No. 24, the top market in the state of Arkansas and the highest ranking city among SEC college towns on the list. Other Arkansas cities ranked included Little Rock at No. 84, and Fort Smith at No. 192. According to statistics gathered by Forbes, the Fayetteville metro area has a median household income of $51,369, a median home price of $140,700, and a gross metro product of over $23 billion. Unemployment is low at just 2.9%, job growth is ranked 11th in the nation at 5%, and cost of living is 8.2% below the national average. The University of Arkansas, and proximity to Walmart, Tyson, and J.B. Hunt were likely factors in Fayetteville’s high ranking. The charm of the downtown area was also mentioned in Fayetteville’s profile. “Some of Fayetteville’s highlights include the town square, where a farmer’s market is held seasonally, and Dickson Street, a narrow street lined with shops and restaurants that runs through the center of the city to the University of Arkansas,” the article states. “The Walton Arts Center is also located in this popular district and is a performing arts center that presents plays, concerts and other cultural events.” For the first time this year, Forbes incorporated a new metric in their data as well, measuring the amount of “highly educated millennials” in each metro areas’ workforces. “In addition to being an excellent source of trainable labor, highly educated millennials provide cities with the type of vibrancy and creativity that companies are increasingly looking for,” said Jeff Lessard, a consultant for Cushman & Wakefield who helps companies decide where to relocate. Fayetteville’s newly enacted civil rights ordinance also likely helped in the rankings. According to the article, the study this year “also factored in laws that protect people from employment discrimination based on sexual and/or gender identity in light the controversies and corporate backlash regarding recent legislation in Arizona, Indiana and North Carolina.” Denver, Colorado topped the list for the second straight year, followed by: Provo, Utah; Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; and Portland, Oregon.   Discussion Fayetteville Flyer has specific guidelines for commenting.

With a presence in over 30 countries and manufacturing facilities around the world, SML delivers best-in-class products and solutions built on a great technology and thorough understanding of their customers and the retail market. The extensive SML offerings include product branding and labeling, RAIN RFID tag solutions, retail RFID software solutions and data management services, anti-counterfeit and product packaging design and engineering. SML has an enviable customer list that includes such leading fashion brands and retailers as Levi’s®, American Eagle, American Apparel®, Ann Taylor, GAP, Tesco, Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Adidas®. Retailers frequently struggle with inaccurate inventory and that inaccuracy has significant negative impacts to their business such as: lost sales, excess shrink, ineffective omnichannel processes, poor employee productivity and bloated inventories. As retailers work to improve efficiency they are entering a new era of retailing (Retail 3.0) by using RFID technology and solutions which is enabling retailers to achieve over 98% inventory accuracy and thus more efficiently manage their inventory and deliver new levels of customers service. This Retail 3.0 retail world includes: dramatically reducing out of stocks, creating better instore experiences and enabling more effective omnichannel delivery models. And likewise, in supply chains, RFID technology and solutions from SML are being used to improve inventory accuracy through the lifecycle of a product. Based on the IDTechEx forecast for 2016, the number of tags used in 2017 is expected to reach over 5 billion. SML, as a market leader in traditional clothing labels and packaging, is already serving the needs of the apparel retail industry. As a result of adding RFID technology and solutions to its existing programs, SML is in an excellent position to benefit from the shift towards comprehensive retail inventory management and the Internet of Things. The aim of the investment is to establish optimal synergy between Invengo and SML in areas such as products, marketing, sales and innovative RFID solutions. Blending the extensive RFID product and solution depth of Invengo with the proven retail technology and global reach of SML will strengthen the global leadership position of both companies in apparel inventory management solutions for the retail sector. “We have admired SML for years as they built a world-class data management system to support the global expansion of their locally based service bureaus. Coupled with an excellent track record in on time delivery and price efficiency, an experienced and highly-valued management team and in-company know-how, we are in an excellent position to benefit in this fast-moving growth market,” comments, Jiann Hsieh, CEO of Invengo International.

Let’s clear up some misconceptions now, and give you a bit of conversation fodder to drop at your next dinner party or date. Who invented Girl Scout Cookies? Girl Scouts, obviously. The very first cookie sale was held in 1917 by a troop in Oklahoma, and it quickly caught on: A few years later the Girl Scouts magazine published a cookie recipe, encouraging troops to bake for fundraisers. In the beginning, the Scouts baked their own sugar cookies and sold them door-to-door; it wasn’t until the late 1930s that they began contracting commercial bakers to produce the cookies en masse. When is Girl Scout Cookie season? The exact timing depends on where you live, but generally speaking it occurs for only six to eight weeks each year. The majority of cookie sales are held between January and April, but some troops begin slinging cookies as early as September. The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York will start selling this year’s cookie supply a couple weeks before Christmas, while the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas will launch their sale in mid-January, just to name a couple examples. (Find out when they go on sale in your area here.) Where can I buy them? Good question. The Girl Scouts website has a handy cookie locator that will help you track them down by entering your zipcode. In general, Girl Scouts tend to set up shop outside high-traffic areas frequented by people who probably like cookies — think grocery stores and big-box stores such as Target and Walmart. Even better, in 2014 the Scouts launched online ordering, though it’s not quite as simple as say, using Amazon Prime; they’re still only available during the six-to-eight week cookie season, and in order to purchase cookies you’ve first got to get an email invite from an actual Girl Scout (meaning late-night impulse cookie purchases are basically impossible). Tom Simpson/Flickr Who makes Girl Scout Cookies? Sadly, they are no longer personally baked by the Girl Scouts themselves. Every Girl Scout Cookie sold in America is produced by one of two big bakeries: Little Brownie Bakers (which is actually a subsidiary of Keebler), or ABC Smart Cookies. Troops choose which baker they purchase from, and each baker makes them using slightly different recipes and different names. That’s right, Peanut Butter Patties and Tagalongs are basically the same thing from different companies, as are Caramel DeLites and Samoas, and Peanut Butter Sandwiches and Do-Si-Dos. (Thin Mints are Thin Mints no matter where you are in the country, though.) What flavors do they come in? The current lineup of flavors is as follows: Thin Mints: a crispy chocolate-mint wafer coated in chocolate Samoas: crispy coconut and caramel-coated ring-shaped cookies with chocolatey stripes Tagalongs: crunchy cookies topped with a layer of peanut butter and dipped in chocolate Trefoils: shortbread cookies Do-Si-Dos: a peanut butter sandwich cookie Lemonades: lemon-iced shortbread cookies Savannah Smiles: another lemon cookie coated in powdered sugar Thanks-a-Lots: shortbread cookies with a layer of fudge on one side Trios: a gluten-free chocolate chip-peanut butter-oatmeal cookie Toffee-tastics: a gluten-free buttery toffee cookie This year to celebrate the Girl Scouts’ centennial, two different varieties of cookies inspired by the classic campfire treat the s’more are also being introduced: a graham cookie coated in creme icing and coated in chocolate, and a graham sandwich cookie with a chocolate-marshmallow filling. brianpdx/Flickr Which Girl Scout Cookie flavor is the best? While many will argue that the top Girl Scout cookie is the cool, chocolatey Thin Mint, the crispy, creamy, sweet and just-a-little-bit-salty peanut butter and chocolate Tagalongs may actually be the queen of all cookies, Girl Scout or otherwise. The caramel and coconut Samoas also have hordes of devoted fans. Those are easily the top three flavors, and after that there’s a sharp drop-off: Trefoils are boring old shortbread; Savannah Smiles are lemon and really, who gets excited about lemon cookies? The peanut butter sandwiches known as Do-Si-Dos are weirdly dry and crumbly and a little bit bland; and many of the others aren’t even worth mentioning. Stick with the top three and you won’t go wrong. (Pro tip: Thin Mints and Tagalongs are fantastic straight from the freezer.) Where does all the cookie money go? Proceeds from cookie sales are distributed amongst the Girl Scouts at three different levels. Only around 20 percent or less of the cost of that box of Samoas actually goes to the troop you purchase them from, and they might use it for community service projects or troop activities. The bulk of it goes to the regional council, which uses the cookie money to support its local troops by funding programming or supporting summer camps. None of the profits from cookie sales go to the national Girl Scouts organization, but they still get their cut: They earn royalties from the bakers who produce the cookies, and also make money off partnerships with big food brands who want to use the Girl Scouts name (more on that below). How can I get Girl Scout Cookies out of season? You can’t, unless maybe you find some scalper on Craigslist who keeps stock in their freezer year-round. If you’re really jonesing for a GSC fix, knockoffs can be found in the cookie aisle from both Keebler’s and Walmart’s Great Value brand that approximate Thin Mints, Samoas, and Tagalongs — but they’re not as tasty as the real thing, and perhaps more importantly, they lack the charitable aspect that comes along with buying direct from the Girl Scouts. The Girl Scouts have collaborated with a number of food companies on GSC-inspired products, however, including Breyers ice cream, Coffeemate coffee creamer, and Friendly’s ice cream cakes, and in January, General Mills will launch a limited edition line of Girl Scout Cookie cereals in Thin Mint and Samoa flavors. (There’s also a strain of marijuana called Girl Scout Cookies, but that’s a decidedly unauthorized use of the GSC name.) Like many wonderful things in life, Girl Scout Cookies are fleeting — and really, waiting 10 months for them to come back in season makes them taste all the better. • All Sweets Week Coverage [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Read Restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Post-Election Letter to Employees My Cast-Iron Conversion This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Are Festive AF Internet Crazies Think This DC Pizzeria Is the Center of a Clinton Sex Ring There Is Now a Store Just for Taco Bell Merch Newsletter By signing up you agree to our terms of use.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | October 28, 2016 -- 22:05 GMT (15:05 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Amazon Prime officially launched in China on Friday, as CNET reports, where it will give Amazon another shot at taking on Alibaba and JD.com. For for 388 yuan (about $57), Prime members in China can sign up for sign up for a year's worth of unlimited deliveries of a selection of US-shipped and domestic items. For the first four months, Amazon is offering memberships at a promotional price of just 188 yuan (about $28). While the price is lower than a Prime membership in the US, Chinese customers won't have access to video and music streaming services. So far, Amazon hasn't gained much traction in China, and its competition is stiff. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart announced a strategic partnership with JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce company. Amazon has had better traction in India. In June, after seeing its market share in India grow in a year from 14 percent to 21 percent, the company invested another $3 billion there. However, Amazon's spending abroad -- including its expansion in India and investments in Prime services overseas -- took a toll on the company's third quarter financial results. Amazon reported on Thursday that its international segment had a Q3 net sales of $10.6 billion but even higher operating expenses of $10.9 billion. The $541 million operating loss dragged down Amazon's notably overall operating income. The company also noted Thursday that it to invest more in its AWS infrastructure in China, with a second infrastructure region opening in China in the coming months.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next FORT COLLINS, Colo. – A Fort Collins woman nearly fell victim to what police are saying was likely another case of a “virtual kidnapping” scam Friday morning. Gina Scott received a phone call Friday morning from someone purporting to be an EMT that her daughter had been involved in a crash with a motorcyclist. The “EMT” handed the phone over to another man, who said he was the father of the motorcyclist and that Scott needed to wire him money for his “son’s” medical expenses or she “wouldn’t see [her] daughter again.” The person on the phone asked Scott to meet him at a local Walmart, so Scott called her friend to follow her there. Scott’s friend called police. Shortly afterward, Scott found out her daughter was actually safe and sound in school, and that she had almost fallen victim to the scam, which police in Denver, Arvada and Boulder have warned about in recent months. “I’m so angry they played on my emotions,” Scott told Denver7. “The minute that you hear your daughter is in trouble, all of your sense go and all you can think about is helping her and getting her back safe.” Fort Collins police say they have yet to determine the origin or the identity of the caller. The department advises people not to answer calls from unknown or blocked numbers, as was the case for the person who called Scott. The police department also advises people not to wire anyone money or send them gift cards if they contact you over the phone. Anyone who suspects they are receiving calls from scammers should report the calls here. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Last week, beneath a sky Wal-Mart blue,                                            in a clearing full of bottles, sneakers,                                                                                                                                                   TP rolls, I found a body. Legs                                            gnawed to the knees, barbed wire tight                                                                                                                     around the throat.                                           I remembered graffiti                                                                                                   on a boulder: God is always hungry.              Sometimes, with binoculars,                                                                                                              I watch wild horses hurry through the heat. Once                                           a yearling stopped mid-gallop, then collapsed                                           into a bed of coals the rain could not extinguish.                                                                                                                      The radio is always crackling:                                           six wets sighted on infrared,                                                                                         need a spic speaker stat. . .

But Jeff Bezos’s company apparently still sees enough present opportunity in China to invest in new big projects there today. Amazon on Friday unveiled its popular Amazon Prime membership program in China, a market where it has long struggled to crack the dominance of Alibaba or the rise of another competitor, JD.com. Amazon Prime will cost Chinese shoppers 388 yuan a year, or about $57, according to Bloomberg. That’s cheaper than the $99 U.S. shoppers pay for Prime, but the program perks aren’t the same in both markets. China’s version of Prime does not include any digital content — video and music streaming — the way it does in the U.S. Instead, the program focuses on giving free shipping to consumers who place orders of more than 200 yuan — or around $29 — from a catalogue of millions of overseas products. There is strong demand in China for products from Western brands. Still, the launch of Prime in China is somewhat surprising considering how long Amazon has already been in the market and how much it has struggled there to date. Research firms estimate that Amazon only owns 1 percent to 3 percent of China’s e-commerce market, more than a decade into its efforts there. That’s because the Chinese e-commerce market has long been dominated by Alibaba, which operates the Taobao shopping site where cheap, no-name brands are popular, as well as the Tmall site where many big Western brands have set up shop. In recent years, another e-commerce site, JD.com, has also risen in popularity. JD has a market cap of more than $36 billion and recently acquired Walmart’s e-commerce business in China. Walmart now owns nearly 11 percent of JD.com. As Amazon has struggled in China, it has vowed to invest $5 billion in India, the world’s second-most populous nation where there is not yet a dominant e-commerce power. At the Code Conference in May, Jeff Bezos said Amazon has passed along some high-level learnings from its stumbles in China to help inform its India strategy. "We mostly tried to roll out what worked well for us in Japan, Germany, the U.K., Spain, France, Italy, the U.S., etc., and it needed more local market customization," he said of the company's approach in China. "If you want me to give one meta-lesson, it's that one." recode_divider More From Recode All the news from Code Enterprise in San Francisco Skilled service providers are less vulnerable to automation, says Thumbtack's economist Here’s how to watch our live interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tonight Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?

Cases of the flu will peak from December to March, circulating at their highest levels throughout the United States. Here's why you should get a flu shot.  1. It's free. If you have insurance, you can get a flu shot free of charge at your doctor's office, your local health department, or other various locations. If you don't have insurance, it's still cheap. Vaccines are available at large companies including Walmart and CVS. Costco has the cheapest available version for $15 per shot. 2. You can still spread the flu even if you don't feel sick. Some people who get the flu will have minor symptoms or none at all. Even so, you can still pass it on to someone who may experience much more severe or life-threatening symptoms from it. Related Stories Flu Season Means Uptick In Flu Shots Will There Ever Be A Cure For The Common Cold? 3. You'll save your sick days. Even if you do end up contracting the flu after getting a shot, the vaccine will likely make your illness much milder, reducing the amount of work you'll miss. The flu accounts for 11 million lost workdays and $7 billion in lost productivity each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 4. You won't get the flu just from getting the shot. It's a myth that you can contract the flu just by getting a flu shot. While the vaccine does contain flu viruses, these viruses have been inactivated so you won't contract it from the injection alone. The worst symptoms you're likely to experience are some aches, swelling at the injection site, or a low-grade fever. 5. You can save someone a trip to the hospital. Many people are at high risk for complications from the flu, including very young children, people over 65, and those with pre-existing conditions like heart disease or asthma. These people are at a much greater risk of developing serious complications like pneumonia or infection that can potentially be deadly.  While you might not fall into any of these categories yourself, you could pass it on to someone for whom it may be life threatening.

Retale Retale, The App That Puts Weekly Store Circulars On Your Smartphone, Raises $12 Million Browse more... Needed’s smarter shopping app will find you the best nearby deals Posted Oct 28, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Why Apple’s MacBook Touch Bar was the right thing to do A new app called Needed, now officially launching, wants to upgrade your mobile shopping list. Instead of turning to a simple note-taking app or to-do list, Needed aims to help you save on groceries by automatically searching for deals and sales that match the items on your list. The idea is to help you shop smarter locally, however – Needed doesn’t focus on online stores, or on-demand grocery delivery services. Instead, Needed looks at the local circulars for stores like CVS, Sam’s Club, Walmart, Kmart, Winn-Dixie, Big Lots, Sears, Best Buy, Macy’s, Haverty’s Crate & Barrel, Save-a-Lot, for example, some of which carry groceries, while others only carry household items that may also match things on your list. To use the app, you can either enter in products manually or just general descriptions like “cereal,” or you can scroll through a tappable list of the most commonly shopped-for goods. These are organized into color-coded sections like Bakery, Dairy, Fruits & Vegetables, Health & Beauty, Meat & Seafood, Snacks, and many more. screen696x696-7 screen696x696-8 screen696x696-9 screen696x696-10  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit And while Needed is primarily focused on grocery shopping, there’s also a section for Electronics where you can enter in a custom item in order to get updates about matching deals. Once your list is complete, each items will indicate how many nearby deals are available, and you can tap to view the store’s ad. For serious value-hunters, the app could help you more easily access the paper circulars that many of us no longer receive since we cancelled our newspaper subscriptions years prior. The app emerged from location-based mobile ad platform Retale, as part of its “App Lab” initiative, which is a new unit at the company focused on creating standalone mobile shopping experiences. This is the group’s first product, says Retale, whose flagship shopping app has seen over 40 million downloads to date worldwide. Essentially, Needed is repurposing Retale’s technology, which also delivers the weekly ads to your smartphone or tablet in a digital format. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see relying on Needed alone to make shopping trips productive. While the Retale platform is used by 5,200 of the world’s top retailers, the company says, when I tested the app it failed to load up deals from two top local stores, Target and Publix. This is odd, given that Target is one of the retailers that supposedly works with Retale – but its ad isn’t showing in the Needed app or on Retale’s website. Regardless as to why that’s the case, the end result is that there’s a weekly ad out there – and maybe several  – that aren’t popping up in Needed. That means you’re not seeing all the deals. However, if you primarily shop at one of the supported stores, like Walmart, Needed could be an easier way to shop for savings without having to plow through the paper ad. According to the app stores, the app has actually been live for some time, but the company is only now making its debut public following testing. Needed is a free download on iOS and Android. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Needed Description Needed is a mobile shopping management platform that allows users to create and manage a shopping list and automatically shows local sales.

Her co-workers allegedly used them to terrorize her. By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. / The Washington Post Friday, October 28th, 2016 at 9:31am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Angry Trump kept coming back. Alexandra Avila’s work computer usually displayed a smiling picture of her daughter. But when she logged in one morning last summer, she was greeted by a “belligerent looking picture of Donald Trump,” a lawsuit says. Again and again, she switched the desktop back to her daughter’s photo. But two co-workers got an IT employee to break into Avila’s computer to re-upload a sneering, pointing picture of Trump, according to the lawsuit. “One co-worker told Alexandra that Mr. Trump was saying ‘(Expletive) you!’ specifically to her,” the lawsuit says. Advertisement Continue reading The harassment only got worse for Avila, who was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent. The people Avila worked with at Sedgwick Claims Management Services in Iowa bombarded her with racist memes, embarrassing her on group chats of more than a dozen people, the suit says. One pictured a Hispanic man in an oversized sombrero. “No books,” it said. “Only Manuels.” Avila’s co-workers signed her up to volunteer for Trump’s campaign, according to her lawsuit. Once, a supervisor asked the team to vote on what food they wanted for a congratulatory potluck. “Alex can’t vote,” a co-worker replied. “She’s an illegal immigrant.” Avila started working in 2012 for Sedgwick Claims Management Services, which administers employee benefit programs for other companies. “At Sedgwick,” the Memphis-based company likes to note, “caring counts.” Sedgwick employs 14,000 people in about 275 offices in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Ireland, according to company literature. Advertisement Continue reading Avila worked in Sedgwick’s Iowa office, in Johnson County, where less than 6 percent of people identify as Hispanic, according to census data. Every day, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Avila handled family leave requests for Walmart employees. She was fired by the company last November. Her harassment and discrimination lawsuit was filed Monday and names her company and two former supervisors as defendants. The supervisors did not respond to requests for comment. Sedgwick Claims Management Services said in a statement sent to The Washington Post that “we are aware that a suit has been filed by Alexandra Avila, a former colleague in our Coralville, Iowa, office. Prior to her dismissal for cause in 2015, Ms. Avila never reported any such activity to management or our colleague resource team. Sedgwick consistently maintains fair employment and workplace harassment practices, and we are confident the facts will prove Ms. Avila’s case has no merit. “Our company fosters a diverse, inclusive workplace in which all colleagues are encouraged to achieve their full potential; this is the foundation of our success.” Avila’s alleged workplace troubles paralleled Donald Trump’s political rise: According to the lawsuit, the harassment started in earnest after Trump announced he was running for president in June 2015. During a speech declaring his candidacy, he made incendiary comments about Mexicans and immigration. Advertisement Continue reading “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” the man who would become the Republican nominee for president said. ” … They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” As the Associated Press noted, Trump’s rhetoric has contributed to racial tensions across the country. “Build a wall” chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana, the AP noted. “With the political climate the way that it is, it’s a little more charged,” said the principal of the Iowa school whose players were taunted. Dan Marburger, the principal at Perry High, told CNN that some of his students, at a school with an usually high percentage of minorities for that part of the state, feel that “this inflamed rhetoric is happening and it’s okay. No one is stopping it. They see it in a presidential campaign and now it’s okay for everyone to say this. It’s almost a sense that you feel that you don’t belong in your own country.” The only Hispanic person on her team of about a dozen, Avila was born in California and moved to Iowa as a child, her attorney said. Trump’s comments about Mexicans bothered Avila, and she confided in her co-workers, according to the lawsuit. “Alexandra’s coworkers knew she was upset by Mr. Trump’s bigoted remarks, so they needled her about them,” the lawsuit says. The ensuing harassment took all forms – a snide illegal immigrant comment here, a dancing Trump GIF there, according to the lawsuit. Advertisement Continue reading Avila told supervisors about the comments and messages, but they did not take action, the lawsuit says. Sometimes, they laughed too. “It just kept getting worse and worse,” Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler, told The Washington Post. “She tried to pretend that these things weren’t bothering her for a while because she had to work with these people. She’s not someone who likes to make waves. . . . Until she got fired, I don’t think she ever would have gone and complained outside the company.” The lawsuit says Avila was fired after a supervisor claimed she lied on timecards, although the suit says her supervisors’ attitudes toward Hispanics factored into Avila’s termination. The lawsuit claims that she and other employees often worked overtime or through their unpaid lunch break and that a supervisor told them “to find a way to get all their work done and that they were not allowed to write down any overtime hours.” The 2015 meeting where Avila was fired marked the first time she had heard about the timecard issue, the lawsuit says. She was terminated and escorted out of the building; her now-former employers said they would send her personal property to her home, the lawsuit says. Even though she was fired, the harassment did not stop, Avila claims. When the company mailed her a box with some of her belongings, a piece of paper was included that read: “Just call me La Trumpa.” Advertisement Continue reading On the back of the paper, someone had written: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” In January, the lawsuit alleges, Sedgwick employees “continued to harass Alexandra on her Facebook page – greeting her with ‘Hola Alex’ and inviting her to a rally to see Donald Trump, ‘the next president of the United States.'” In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday, Avila is suing for harassment and discrimination based on race and national origin. Her attorney said she is also entitled to damages for wage theft and emotional distress. Fiedler said Avila sobbed as she recounted how she had to replace her daughter’s picture on her computer’s desktop over and over again: “The fact that they went into her computer and they replaced this beautiful, beautiful picture of her child and they replaced it with a photo of Donald Trump yelling and shaking a finger at her, really struck her and makes her feel violated,” the lawsuit says. iowa-lawsuit Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Scandal? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report Why Is Nobody Talking About the Latest N.F.L. Scandal? Seeing is believing. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgOctober 28, 2016 11:00 am Email Facebook Twitter By Michael Loccisano/Getty Images. We all remember the Ray Rice domestic violence story. But an arguably worse case of abuse, and National Football League complicity, inspires far less national attention. And Christine Brennan, stellar sports columnist for USA Today, thinks that her colleagues are partly to blame. For sure, Rice was a big star, at least far bigger than Josh Brown, an end-of-career New York Giants kicker who was arrested for domestic violence in 2015 and whose then-wife, we now learn, told the cops she'd endured “more than 20 incidents” of abuse by Brown. Brown was only given the boot last week when tawdry details leaked out, including word that this had all been known previously to Giants owner John Mara. He's a respected member of what Brennan calls “the boys-will-be-boys club” of league owners. Mara did zilch. The NFL did zilch. Mara said after the Rice mess that there's no place in the league for domestic violence. Unless, of course, you need a kicker and re-sign a guy whom you know allegedly beat his wife. So it was wrong to buy the NFL's belated contrition about its handling of the Rice case and the vow to get tough on domestic abuse matters. Shame (again) on the NFL and Roger Goodell, the toady $34 million-a-year commissioner. (USA Today) As for the media, Brennan tells me, “Clearly because there is no tape to go to, the story isn't as intriguing to our culture and to people in sports media.” “Let's be honest. Seeing it makes all the difference in the world, and that is a huge problem since this such an important issue. To think that video somehow makes it more real. Yes, of course, I realize the importance of seeing it. But in these kinds of awful stories, you would think that power of the written word would still carry a lot of weight.” But, she says, look at Donald Trump. His reputation for crude dealings with women was known. But it wasn't until we saw—over and over —that “Access Hollywood” tape that we were moved to outrage. “It is disappointing that we apparently have to see it on video for anybody to get really riled up about it.” Twitter shuts Vine “While Vine’s growth had slowed in the past year and a half, it was once one of the most vibrant and creative factories of culture on the internet." (The Atlantic) “From 2012 to 2015, there was simply nowhere online like Vine. You could get lost in Vine like it was Wikipedia, and you could laugh on Vine like it was YouTube. It welded the old internet’s spontaneity and 'randomness' to the new social web’s scale and diversity.” “As the web continues to expand and corporatize, as more companies merge an Apple-like aesthetic with Walmart-like scale, it’s hard to imagine anything like Vine happening again.” Big picture Amid the incessant references to a supposedly narrowly Clinton lead in some states, it was helpful to have CNN's John King, master of election maps, underscoring yesterday that a Trump win still looks like a total long-shot. Behind a Snapchat IPO Why might Snapchat's parent raise a desired $4 billion in an IPO? From Cooper Smith at Cheddar.com, the new site and digital newscast for business-minded millennials: “Approximately 150 million people use the Snapchat app daily. For perspective, that’s more than Twitter but fewer than Facebook. That said, Snapchat is acquiring active users at a far faster clip than competing platforms. Snapchat’s daily active user base grew 68 percent between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, whereas Facebook’s grew just 17 percent.” Nearly 75 percent of Americans “aged 12 to 24 have used the app, whereas only 23 percent of all age groups have used it.” There are expected ad revenues of $370 million this year, and an expectation it can get to $1 billion very soon. Bill Clinton's clamps on the press We now all know, thanks to Julian Assange in London's Ecuadorian embassy, about howBill Clinton aides strong-armed combo donations for his foundation and himself. But while he desisted with the giant speaking fees about six months after his wife started her campaign, he did demand significant expenses and private jet travel, even from public universities. He also, it turns out, insisted on “prepublication review of news releases, social-media posts and website materials. Mr. Clinton’s aides often imposed strict prohibitions on media interviews and other limits but asked public-affairs officials to keep the no-interview policy out of news releases.” (The Wall Street Journal) In case you missed that New York Times story on the Clintons... “The CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley” last night gave us “New Ammunition for Trump” and “The First Lady Embraces Clinton.” Its two-part opening was largely a regurgitation of a New York Times story that detailed double-dealing of Clinton via Doug Band, a foundation bigshot-turned-consultant. On “NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt” it was “Money Trail: A hacked memo raises new questions about how the Clintons struck it rich as Hillary Clinton hits the trail with her not-so-secret weapon.” The opening tale was initially about the First Lady embracing Clinton, then largely a recap of a New York Times story that detailed double-dealing of a foundation bigshot-turned-consultant (“not verified by NBC News,” Andrea Mitchell said, as if the qualifier maintained journalistic purity). On ABC's “World News Tonight” with David Muir, there was his hyperbolic opening: “Tonight, breaking news. The new polls just out as Michelle Obama joins Hillary Clinton for the first time on the trail. What they reveal about each other, just as WikiLeaks reveals major questions about millions made by Bill Clinton.” I took a pass on Diane Sawyer's “PREDATOR ON CAMPUS?” segment. But not before seeing the newscast's first commercial, for Otezla, which helps psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Yes, “it increases the risk of depression,” as the ad made clear. But so can the sameness of the evening news some nights. The morning babble “Fox & Friends” started as usual with Trump reporter John Roberts and “PLANE PANIC,” namely the the Mike Pence plane that skidded off a runway. a Fox producer, who was on board, described the scare. It was the same on CNN's “New Day,” at least with the Pence plane, since there was a CNN producer aboard, too. But it also delved into, would you believe this early, actual policy as it checked out Trump and Clinton tax plans (as it's done before). MSNBC's “Morning Joe'” John Heilemann didn't buy the notion of a “tightening” race but sees signs of Clinton's lead accelerating. Like CNN's John King yesterday afternoon Sam Stein rattled off all the big states he could win, like Florida and Ohio, and still get wiped out. Rolling Stone trial There was evidence that University of Virginia administrators were convinced of the article's potential bias the weeks before it actually came out. The dean of students' wariness, articulated in an email, “proved prescient.” (The Washington Post) There was also evidence that the university, in what could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, had the alumni magazine commission a piece on how it handled sexual assaults. Top officials who didn't want to deal with Rolling Stone let themselves be interviewed but, ultimately, there were qualms about the draft and it never saw the light of day. And somewhere at Wrigley Field tonight... Mark Kipnis was a top legal aide to newspaper magnate Conrad Black, and there was collateral damage when Black was convicted and wound up in prison for defrauding investors. Black's Chicago trial showed him and some confederates, one in particular, to be slimeballs. But not Kipnis, who didn't make one penny off the deals and signed various documents as told. A federal judge realized that and, despite the jury's guilty verdict, sentenced him to probation and a $200 fine. Many people thought it was justice at work. You can bet there'll be a similar sense of vindication when he surely shows at Wrigley Field tonight for the first World Series game there in 71 years. His son, Jason, who grew up in the Chicago burbs and was a huge Cubs fan, is the Indians second basemen. He gave his parents his $575,000 signing bonus out of college to assist with the dad's legal expenses, their mortgage payments and his siblings' education. Mike Miner of The Chicago Reader, an alternative weekly I briefly ran, covered the Black prosecution and writes, “If I'm going to root for one player above all others during the World Series, it won't be one of the Cubs. And I mean no disrespect to the Cubs.” (Chicago Reader) Well, I have four soccer games to get to this weekend and no World Series tickets. But I'm not bitter. Yes, nitwit local politicians and radio ad sales reps scored tickets but not me. Again, I'm not bitter. Have a good weekend. Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org.

         ABOUT JOIN CONTACT ADVERTISE READ THE PRINT ISSUE News Sports Opinion Arts & Culture Multimedia FUN News Sports Opinion Arts & Culture Multimedia Fun About Advertise Contact Lifestyles Plan the spookiest pregame with these tips By Odeya Pinkus - October 28, 2016 Kevin Sussy/ Photography Editor Close It’s the end of October and you just pulled your rabbit ears out of the closet. Or maybe you finally tried on that bro tank and realized that this costume was your true form. One way or another, State Street will literally be bursting at the seams with Harley Quinns and Harambes by 1 a.m. But before all that madness starts, before the spilled beer awkwardly ruined your chances with that girl in The Rat, and before you sent that text you shouldn’t have, there was the pregame. Ah yes, the pregame, the precursor to all the weekend madness. At every other pregame, you’re probably listening to Flo Rida and throwing back shots. But not this pregame. This one is different. This is Halloween. 1) Decorations — You don’t need to turn your dorm into a haunted house, and you definitely don’t need to spend a lot of money to make your suite seem festive. When it comes to decorations, it doesn’t have to be fancy. You can use anything that might be scary and hang it up. If you’re a sophomore, try taping up a printed version of your empty Degree Works on the wall. If you’re a senior, then hang up your most recent GRE result. Nothing is scarier than the future looming over your head. But if that doesn’t do it for you, then check out the Halloween section of Wal-Mart for orange lights and fake cobwebs. 2) Music — OK, so now your suite is spooky, but what about the vibes? No Halloween party is complete without some good old tunes, so check out Pipe Dream’s Halloween playlist for all your musical needs. If you need some more ideas, try playing some famous movie scores. Even without the threat of the Dark Lord, John Williams’ score to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” will get you in a creepy mood. If “Harry Potter” makes you more happy than it does scared, then check out the music from movies like “Jaws” or “Carrie.” 3) Drinks — So, now the mood is properly set, but what is there to drink? Frankly, what you’re drinking doesn’t matter as much as what you are chasing it down with. It might be Halloween, but it’s also still fall, so be festive. For an incredibly seasonal drink, mix Fireball and apple cider. It can be served both hot and cold, so if your mood is “I need to prepare for State Street’s freezing chill,” then sip this warm drink before you trek into the cold. Regardless of your drink, remember that it’s the Solo cup that counts. Get black and orange Solo cups for just the right aesthetic. Now when you wake up in the morning and need to clean your whole suite, you’ll still feel in the holiday spirit. 4) Games — Sure, you have drinks and vibes, but what about games and activities? Halloween is the perfect time to show off your knowledge of fortune telling. If you don’t have that knowledge, then it’s a good time to start learning. Try reading your friends’ fortunes with tarot cards, or pull out a Ouija board to connect with the spirits of Binghamton’s past. If those games don’t satisfy you, then go for something simple, like “pin the tail on the donkey.” For a scarier version, get political and try pinning the candidate in the Oval Office.

(Mark Quinn) Related Stories Costco store proposed for Thunder Bay Walmart to stop taking Visa in Canadian stores Goliath vs. Goliath: consumers caught in middle of high-stakes fee fight between Visa and Walmart City officials in Thunder Bay, Ont. say work continues behind the scenes to try to bring a Costco location to the Lakehead. The city has been in discussions with the developer for the big box retailer for some time now, and mayor Keith Hobbs told CBC News more talks are planned. Costco store proposed for Thunder Bay "We're talking about pricing, pricing of buildings," he said, adding that remediating land set aside for the project is also on the slate. "The city of Thunder Bay is really fixated on Costco. They want it more than an event centre I'd think." Hobbs said he's been working to get the retailer to build a location in the city for the past five years. "I think a Costco would be great for this community," he continued. "It's frustratingly slow." According to Hobbs, city manager Norm Gale is scheduled to speak with the developer soon, where he's slated to receive another update. "The municipality has done everything that we can do to bring Costco here, and work with the developer," Hobbs said. "It's basically in their hands."

Posted: Friday, October 28, 2016 2:00 am Sharing the love Jessica Else - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 0 comments LIHUE — Receiving a $25 gift card in 2012 is a memory that will forever stick with Aaliyah Keala Nero. She and her family spent two months at the YWCA women’s shelter that year and when they needed it most, someone gave them that card. Now Keala, who turns 11 on December 20, honors that day with a gift card giveaway on her birthday and she administers that giveaway through a foundation she started last year: Keala’s Big Sister Club. She collects the gift cards from donors in the community. “I want to give back because it felt good to get that $25 gift card,” Keala said. “The cards go to kids in need and they can get things like school supplies or food, too.” Last year was the debut gift card giveaway and Keala gave away seven cards. This year, her goal is to distribute 50 in a ceremony that will be held at Kukui Grove on Dec. 18. “The gift cards can come from anywhere on Kauai,” Keala said. “They can come from Times, Walmart, Kmart — a lot of stores.” Originally, Keala targeted girls as recipients of the gift cards and as the focus of her foundation. “I don’t have any sisters and my mom suggested starting a foundation so I can be a sister to other girls,” Keala said. Her mother, Stephanie Shinno, said Keala, who has two brothers, kept asking for a sister, so she suggested starting a foundation. “She really wanted a sister but that wasn’t going to be happening,” Shinno said. “So, the foundation was a way for her to get that.” “It was supposed to be just girls, but then I thought about my brothers and I thought it’d be good to have boys too,” Keala said. The idea behind the gift card giveaway is to help people and Keala said she’d like to do that for the rest of her life. “I want to be a kid’s doctor when I grow up because I want to help them be healthier,” Keala said. In her down time, Keala likes to play sports and run, she models for Maile Taylor Models and she’s running for Miss Kauai Pre-Teen USA 2017.

Charlena Poole had learned on Oct. 18 that police in Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque, found her 17-year-old daughter wandering near a Walmart close to a busy intersection. Jones was last seen by her mother on Dec. 17, 2015. Missing Saginaw teen found in New Mexico But on Oct. 19, Poole had landed in Albuquerque, and Jones was relieved to see her mother. "Yes!" was what she said when Jones saw her mother. Relieved to be finally going home, Jones said that she was happy. And thanks to the generosity of Saginaw businessman Gil Johnson, president of Saginaw Valley Ford Lincoln, Poole was able to get her daughter home faster than if she would have had to raise money herself. Johnson read about Jones being found by police in New Mexico, and how Poole was trying to raise money to bring her home. Johnson decided to purchase plane tickets for them. Businessman pays for plane tickets for found missing girl It was Jones' first time on an airplane. "I got like, kind of light headed," Jones said. Jones doesn't speak a lot. Usually giving one-word answers to questions. She also avoids eye contact by looking down or gazing at the wall when she does speak. It took a minute for her to remember her first meal when she came home. "Taco Bell," she said before taking a long pause. "Oh yeah, the 5-layer burrito." Poole said her daughter has been through a lot, much of which she still hasn't disclosed to her, just giving her bits and pieces. "My goal is to get her therapy and someone to talk to a few times a week," Poole said. Poole said her daughter now sees a counselor at Solutions Behavioral Health, 1010 N. Niagara St. A spokesperson for the company said, "We are here to serve anyone who needs it and is dealing with any kind of trauma." Poole said that she is also going to focus on getting her daughter back in school for her senior year and prepare her for college. "I'm glad this is over," Poole said through tears. "I wouldn't have wished this on nobody. What I felt and me not knowing. It's beautiful to have her here." They hugged.

Smaller players too have left no stone unturned to maximize gain from loosened customer purse strings for this period, investing heavily in technology back-end platforms and front-end improvements, starting as early as February in some cases. Backend technologies such as warehouse management and demand forecasting systems were the focus for Bengaluru-based CampusSutrra, a collegiate-fashion brand. Dhiraj Agarwal, co-founder, CampusSutra said, “We have invested close to Rs 8-10 lakh to build a customized backend model that works specifically for our needs, focusing only on technology upgrades that have given us maximum returns, including a demand forecasting capability to enable our supply chain to service orders from platforms like Myntra and Amazon.” CampusSutra has also created a real-time software for replenishable goods, along the lines of Walmart’s Retail Link tool that acts as a decision support system. At online fashion retailer Myntra, Products chief, Ambarish Kenghe adds, “We have assisted our brand partners with demand forecasting tools that help them manage demand from our platform.” Delivering on end-user experience A number of initiatives, both ongoing and specific, helped Flipkart-owned Myntra that recently acquired Jabong manage a seamless user experience. “The Myntra mobile app, at 15MB, is much smaller than competition, and does not take up valuable data space on phones. In terms of data usage too, the app takes uses little data according to customers,” says Kenghe. Keeping the patchy Indian cellular network in mind, Myntra has allowed for apps to adapt image resolution depending on the strength of the network. The retailer has also strengthened the payments wallet, with an improved service record of 20% over the previous year, delisting payment wallets that haven’t added value. Kenghe adds, “We also have a full-fledged user experience team at Myntra, comprising actual users, who test all UI/UX customisations and improvements done across our platform. This allows us relevant insight and feedback that translates into significant improvements in terms of user experience.” Adds Ajit Narayanan, SVP and Head-Engineering at Myntra, “To anticipate and manage the spike in demand during the promotion, we run continuous simulations that mimic actual user traffic patterns on the app. We also had admission control systems in place to manage a surge of traffic. This allowed us to queue users, and allow systematic access while also manage on-the-spot fixes as and when needed without diluting the end user experience.” Myntra’s microservice architecture was also built to scale out particular services on the app to manage the spikes in Diwali demand. The Diwali demand for Myntra is similar to 25 times the usual BAU (business as usual) figure as seen in Myntra’s EORS (End of Reason sale) in July, adds Kenghe. A focus on scalable solutions has also helped the retailer manage the system of return and exchanges by and large without issue, during this period. Manoj Manalparambil, a designer at a Bengaluru based advertising agency said, “I had placed orders on Myntra during the Diwali promotion. They were delivered the same day, and I not only tried on the clothes but also returned them the same day! It was all on COD and there was no hassle at all.” Myntra had introduced the concept of ‘Try and Buy’, allowing users to try on clothes at home before paying through COD. Logistics and supply chain were a key focus for CampusSutra as well. What the future might look like At Myntra, another feature rolled out during the festive period was the ‘Personalised Store’. Based on machine learning, and leveraging its extensive data centres, Myntra has translated information on customer browsing patterns, understanding price points and brand preferences, to show customers a store front on the app and desktop that is customised to their tastes. Kenghe said, “We can customise the store for everyone, based on both individual preference, and also by location. So for example, someone in Kolkata would have seen a different selection during Durga Pujo than a user elsewhere in the country at the same time.” Even allied sectors such as jewelry and furniture have seen tech innovations being brought in, to differentiate brands in a crowded market. Online jewellery retailer BlueStone introduced Gold ATMs in Bengaluru and Delhi, where customers can purchase certified 24 carat gold coins between one to twenty grams in weight. Taking innovation in technology offline, the brand hopes to mimic the touch and feel aspect of the sector through these ATMs, while also providing customers both convenience of avoiding crowded stores and having to wait for products to be delivered home. With a firm eye on retaining customer loyalty and growing revenues, e-commerce firms are now looking at technology to create brand differentiation that will prove hard to replicate for competition, giving customers reason for celebrations all year round!

The company, based in the capital, Nairobi, is in discussions with foreign and domestic investors that are expected to be concluded within weeks, Chief Executive Officer Atul Shah said by phone Friday. The company grew its number of stores to more than 60 across Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania that resulted in debt ballooning to 15 billion shillings ($148 million) from 4 billion shillings in 2010, he said. “We are negotiating on the price of the stake, so we cannot comment on the value of the business,” Shah said. “We hope to conclude talks soon, in the next one month.” Kenya has sub-Saharan Africa’s fastest-growing retail market, with consumer spending having surged 67 percent over the past five years, according to the London-based Oxford Business Group. That’s attracted new entrants including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Game chain, Carrefour SA of France and Gaborone, Botswana-based Choppies Enterprises Ltd. Formal retailers account for as much as 40 percent of sales in East Africa’s biggest economy, second only to South Africa and double that of Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy. Nakumatt, which begun as a mattress store half a century ago, targets mostly middle- and upper-income customers. Indigenous competitors include Tusker Mattresses Ltd., or Tuskys, Naivas Ltd. and Chandarana Foodplus. Expansion Program Nakumatt announced plans in 2015 to add 14 new branches over two years as it sought to boost annual revenue to more than $1 billion. Last year, it concluded the purchase of Yako Supermarkets Ltd., a closely held retailer. “They could have expanded too quickly,” Eric Musau, a senior research analyst at Standard Investment Bank, said by phone. “It is a surprise because it does not seem like they invested too heavily.” Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., Nakumatt’s smaller rival and Kenya’s only publicly listed chain store, is battling to repay creditors as much as 3.6 billion shillings. The company emerged from a four-year receivership in 2010 after a government bailout. “Like any other business operating in this market, Nakumatt Holdings has faced a number of unforeseen business challenges,” the company said in a statement on its Twitter account Thursday. Challenges include higher operating costs and extraneous factors such as risk management against security threats. Kenya has faced a series of attacks by Islamist militant group al-Shabaab over the past five years that targeted an upmarket shopping mall in Nairobi, where Nakumatt had a flagship store, and a university in the northeast of the country. Nakumatt is also renegotiating terms with suppliers and is “undertaking a management enhancement program that involves recruiting and retaining qualified personnel,” according to the statement.

(AP / Paul Sakuma) Mae Anderson, The Associated Press Published Friday, October 28, 2016 1:49AM EDT NEW YORK -- Amazon wants you to order your turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce online this Thanksgiving - its latest effort to make its Prime subscription service a central part of food shopping, much the way it's done for other consumer goods. Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon - which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 - is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program - $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program - started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." EVER-EXPANDING PRIME Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. On Thursday, Amazon said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 per cent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion. The third quarter is a seasonally light one compared to the bustling holiday quarter coming up.

Next Article China Puts the Brakes on Additional Free Trade Zones » Trends in China’s E-Commerce Market Posted on June 4, 2014 by China Briefing By Harun Rauf SHANGHAI – China is currently experiencing huge growth in e-commerce. It is estimated that e-commerce in China will be worth US$540 billion by 2015, and by 2020 worth more than e-commerce in the U.S., the UK, Japan, Germany and France combined. This is linked with the number of people connected to the Internet in China, be it via computers or smartphones – there are over 600 million internet users and over 500 million mobile internet users in the country. The Chinese government has a target to connect 1.2 billion people (85 percent of the population) to 3G or 4G mobile internet by 2020. To date, several foreign firms attempting to break into this lucrative market have met with failure: eBay has withdrawn from China, while Wal-Mart and Best Buy are still struggling to compete with local firms. Alternatively, some success may be found through joint operations with a Chinese firm. Shoprunner, a U.S. rival to Amazon.com, recently struck a deal with Alibaba Group Ltd. in which Alibaba Group purchased a 39 percent stake in Shoprunner for an investment of US$202 million. Under the terms of the deal, Alibaba Group will assist Shoprunner’s expansion into China in exchange for allowing Alibaba to supply U.S. goods to Chinese consumers hungry for foreign luxury items. While there are plenty of physical shopping options in China’s larger cities, lower-tier cities cater less to international luxury brands. In light of this demand, the internet has allowed many retailers to offer goods to consumers in lower-tier cities and further afield without the need and cost of setting up a physical outlet. China’s economic rise coinciding with the dawn of the information age means its consumers are web savvy and are thus increasingly going online to make many of their purchases. The internet serves as an information source for digital consumers who regularly log on to review sites and use social media to make consumption choices. Furthermore, Chinese consumer trust in online shops is stronger than previously imagined and people are more willing to buy luxury items online. KPMG recently surveyed 10,200 people on their online spending habits on luxury goods. One of the most striking pieces of information discovered by the report was that the last item purchased online by respondents cost on average RMB 1,515 (US$243). The average price paid for items increased according to customer age. The average amount spent by those in the under-20 age group was RMB726. This jumped to RMB1,657 for 25-29 year olds and continued to climb for the oldest age group surveyed, 45-49 year olds, who spent an average of RMB2,108 on luxury goods purchased online. RELATED: Increasing Smartphone and Tablet Sales Fuel Popularity of Mobile E-Commerce in Asia Additionally, men were found to spend significantly more on individual items than women; on average men spent RMB2,163 versus RMB1,314 for women. However, women buy more luxury items online and spend more overall than men. This plainly demonstrates the significant sums of money now being spent online by Chinese consumers. The primary motivation for consumers to shop online is price, and digital consumers were found to be more sensitive to price changes. This is primarily due to the ease of making comparisons online, but also because social networking and review sites allow consumers to make more informed choices. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed felt that when buying online they felt more assured of the item’s country of origin. Convenience and a greater range of available products were also found to be important consumer motivators. Twenty-eight percent of respondents opted for online shopping to find something unique, and this proportion rose to 41 percent for those aged 25 or under. There were some common concerns expressed by digital consumers. Seventy-eight percent of respondents were concerned with the authenticity of items sold online. Digital consumers were also concerned about not being able to test out products before buying them (70 percent) and sizing (55 percent). Reliability of sellers was also a worry: forty-eight percent reported concerns that the product shown online would differ from that delivered, 41 percent doubted online sellers’ guarantee of after-sales services, and 37 percent raised concerns about complicated return procedures. Alibaba has gone some distance to address these concerns. Its Tmall site guarantees genuine products and gives users a more direct route to connect with sellers. Tmall has become so popular that international high fashion brands such as Burberry have established their own shops on the site. The survey also addressed buying trends such as which categories of products consumers tend to buy online. Cosmetics were found to be the most popular type of luxury product bought online—with 51 percent of respondents having used the Internet to make purchases in this category. The next most popular categories were women’s shoes (39 percent), women’s apparel (36 percent), and accessories and bags (both at 34 percent). RELATED: E-Commerce Trends and Developments in Asia-Pacific The survey found that 70 percent of online shoppers use their home computers to shop online, 60 percent use their smartphones and 30 percent use tablet computers, with a trend toward greater smartphone use. With faster mobile internet speeds and websites increasingly catering to mobile users, it is becoming more and more convenient to use smartphones wherever and whenever one desires. In time, with further innovation, drawbacks such as small screen sizes and poor connections will be remedied by improvements to user interfaces and investment into mobile internet infrastructure.  Despite these challenges, using phones to shop online is already very popular in China; around 55 percent of China’s smartphone users have made a mobile payment, while the equivalent figure in the U.S. is just 12 percent. This underlines the importance of facilitating access to online shops for smartphone users. The primary payment method for online purchases in China has changed over time. Previously cash-on-delivery was the favored method of payment, but this has since changed to automated online payments. Around 70 percent of payments are now electronic, a reversal of five years ago when around 70 percent of payments were cash-on-delivery. The Chinese government has granted over 200 licenses allowing firms to set up electronic payment systems but the market remains dominated by four main players — AliPay, TenPay, Union Pay and 99bill combined account for 85.5 percent of the electronic wallet market in China. Overall, the survey found that consumers in China are more partial to shopping online, especially through their smartphones. All age groups displayed high confidence in online platforms.The survey found that as people get older their average per-item online spending increases. While men were found to spend more on individual purchases, women spend more overall in their online purchases. Finally, the report found a shift away from cash-on-delivery payments toward the use of online payments. Asia Briefing Ltd. is a subsidiary of Dezan Shira & Associates.

Candidates Speak at Forum Hannah Pope� There were about 25 members of the public at the old Hillsboro School House last Thursday for a community forum for candidates vying for District 3 Board of Commissioners (BOC) seat. Incumbent Gene Trammell was present along with challenger Ross Hays. Of those 25 persons in attendance, only two of those signed up to ask the candidates questions, although many in attendance, voiced opinions of their own. For introductions Mr. Trammell started stating that �I just completed my first term. I am a retired 21 year school superintendent, prior to that I was a vocational Ag teacher and even earlier than that, I was in the dairy business for 13-14 years.� Mr. Hays began by saying, �I care about y�all. I believe that we need more �folks� voices heard. I believe that the BOC does some good stuff. There is also some things done that I disagree with.� He also stated that he was from Turtle Cove when prompted from an audience member. Of the requests to ask questions, Andrew Boyd asked Mr. Trammell �I see articles in the newspaper and hear buzz about growth. My question is who is looking for growth?� Mr. Trammel responded by stating, �A majority of people in Jasper County like the rural environment � the country flavor. But growth can be done properly. I would like to see industrial growth.� Mr. Trammell then stated that every home provides $1 in tax revenue to $3 in costs for services. Industries generate $2 for every $1 in costs for services. He also stressed that he was interested, primarily in �green industry,� as in �industry that fits our folks.� These industries, he said, have no waste and employ our people. He said that he is in favor of improving the quality of life for the people in the county and is an advocate for those things such as recreation and the public library. Mr. Hays replied by saying, �I don�t want industrial growth. When I think of industrial growth I think of steel mills. I am in favor of small businesses. I work in a small business, I see what good a small business in this community does. I think of my co-workers more as family than of actual co-workers.� �And I don�t mind having to go out of town for things. I don�t want a Walmart in Jasper County I like it just the way it is.� He concluded by saying that he believes that the county should maintain and preserve the Jasper County that �we have.� Mr. Trammell retorted with �No growth equals no jobs. Costs continue to increase and we�re going to have to change somewhat to absorb those costs. We�ve cut the budget � but citizens want services. I believe that change � it�s inevitable, and if we guide it and plan for that change that we can preserve what people love about the county.� There was some discussion amongst the audience and the candidates chimed in, as to road conditions. Mr. Trammell stated that District 3 has 43 percent of the roads in Jasper County. He also stated that it costs $350,000-$500,000 a mile to pave those roads. �We received just over $700,000 this year from the state. Mr. Trammell stated that there were more roads than money to repair them and that the BOC had been triple surfacing some, using LMIG money on others and �doing the best we can with what we have. It�s not the best, but it�s what we can afford.� Preston Wynens asked about putting down soil instead of rock on the roads. He said that he knows that it has worked well in Jones County. Mr. Hays stated, �We�re not maintaining what we have now. I�ve been riding roads over the last few days, a lot of them, and the public works are good people, but I drove the triple surfaced roads and they�re not good. There are still pot holes. How are we going to sustain growth and maintain what we have?� After a few minutes, Mr. Boyd asked about the math for roads. He asked/asserted that �we will never catch up,� on road repairs and paving based on the number of roads and the cost to maintain them. A random attendee asked the question, �Is the autopen for signing checks acceptable?� Mr. Hays replied that he didn�t want a machine to sign the county�s checks. He said, �I need to see what�s going on. I know that checks sent out have been done so prior to approval at the commission meetings. Mr. Trammell informed the audience that there was a process in place that included the CFO and invoices are reviewed by the department head and if need be, Mike [Benton], the county manager. Mr. Hays stated that �it�s not the county employee�s job to do the county�s business.� There was some discussion and an impromptu comment from Ken Tillman to Mr. Trammell, as to having five commissioners, surely they could sign checks. Mr. Trammell informed a comment/question from another citizen as to how many invoices the BOC may have a month for which he replied 1,000-2,000. Mary Patrick stated that the county was buying a crack sealer for the roads, but Public Works had no supervision, and asked who can use it? Mr. Trammell advised that even he could use a crack sealer. Mr. Trammell followed up by saying, �The room for improvement is the biggest room in the house. None of us are doing our best. Yes there are better things that we can be doing, but we�re doing the best that we can with what we have.� There were comments as to the citizen�s comments being at the end of the meetings. Someone asked if those running would push for comments to be moved. Mr. Hays said that, �this was a rough subject and I don�t care for comments at the end of meetings.� He stated that he wanted 10 minutes after each business item for discussion and presentation (two minutes per person). He stated that �this is a simple courtesy to let the people paying taxes inform the BOC of what they want.� �I am only one of five,� Mr. Trammell stated. �We have found that having the comments at the end works best. We encourage the people to come to us with any issues that they are having. They usually do so at least three days before the meeting. If you let 10 people talk, there will be 11 ways to resolve the issue. When do you have time to evaluate?� After this there was much discussion about the BOC signing non-disclosure agreements. Mr. Hays said that he would not sign one unless there was a law that stated he must. Mr. Trammell said that at times you can�t avoid signing one. Mr. Trammell explained that companies today will not do business with the county unless an agreement is signed. Mr. Trammell explained that there are some industries that do not want publicity when looking to relocate as they may not have decided or told the current location that they were moving. He also explained that there was one instance where a company wanted to bring a process here with a pending patent. He stated that a non-disclosure agreement was signed that pertained to the patent. He also noted that a non-disclosure was just to get it through to voting time. He said that it will still be voted on in a meeting before final approval. �You�re not going to see a time without non-disclosure agreements,� Mr. Trammell ended.  submit your comments  Sitemap { Magazine Template by bulletlink.com }

But at what point does our kindness become our downfall? And how do we assert ourselves while coming off with confidence and not uncertainty? I set out to find the answers after a lot of the stories we air here on 7News made me question how I would react. In surveillance tapes from September at the Moundsville Walmart, a man is seen walking to a self checkout line with a woman. She pays for his item, then gives him cash back. According to police the man, who was eventually arrested in Belmont County, approaches mostly females, is insistent, invades space, and intimidates. Now imagine yourself in that woman's shoes. What would you have done if he asked you to pay for his item and for cash back? Many of us don't prepare ourselves for a moment like that.  Former police officer Michelle Molnar has seen plenty of crimes committed against women in her days patrolling the streets in Ohio.  I set out to find out how women can protect themselves, and learned some valuable information along the way.  First, I took a mini self-defense course with Lieutenant Kevin Kettler with the Wheeling Police Department. He's been teaching rape prevention and defense for about four years. He showed me a basic move, using your toe area or the inside of the foot to strike an attacker in the nerve cluster that runs down the front of the foot. He demonstrated the move, where an attacker may grab a woman by the shoulders. If she grabs on to him, she can take her toe or the inside of her foot to strike the nerve, then deliver a knee strike to the gut. It's true that an attack can happen anywhere, but Kettler says a majority of the time, women know the suspect. Bars are one of the most common places that a predator can get to know their victim. Kettler calls it a "target rich environment" - a place where people are intoxicated and can easily let their defenses down.  Statistics show that six out of ten rapes take place in someone's home or residence, and only about one in 12 attacks would happen in 'darker' place like a parking garage. Another thing that makes women vulnerable is a lack of attention to her surroundings. "Perpetrators are now getting lazier. They don't want to fight. They just want to do their damage and go," Molnar said.  "Perpetrators are now getting lazier. They don't want to fight. They just want to do their damage and go," Kettler added. Confidence also plays a big role in how a predator may view a woman. Michelle said walking around with your head up and looking someone in the eye can send them walking away, when you could have been a victim. Michelle's salon, Five Star Spray Tan in Elm Grove, hosts something called "Safe and Sassy Saturday" on the first weekend each month. Women are invited to come in between noon and 4 p.m. to check out the Damsel in Defense products she sells and test them out to feel their power.  "You can't wait for your husband to come home and take care of you, you can't wait for the guy walking down the street to take care of you, because most people, they don't want to be bothered. They don't want to get involved," she said.  Lieutenant Kettler offers a number of tips to women, most importantly: pay attention to your surroundings. If you're walking to your car, have your keys and pepper spray (if you use it) handy. Carry yourself with your head high, and always listen to your intuition.  "If you start getting clues or something starts telling you 'I shouldn't do this' you should probably listen to it. That inner voice that tells you that you're being put in a dangerous situation," Kettler said.  Kettler is willing to teach free classes to any groups of women who want to learn self-defense. He has a 45 minute power point presentation, then does a hands-on demonstration. If you are interested, call the Wheeling Police Department at 304-234-3664.  Michelle's salon is located at 40 Junior Avenue in Wheeling, and her next Safe and Sassy Saturday will be held on November 5.

Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon — which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 — is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon's near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program — $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program — started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." EVER-EXPANDING PRIME Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. fell in after-market trading on Thursday after the online retailer reported third-quarter net income that missed analyst expectations. The Seattle-based company said it had profit of $252 million, or 52 cents per share. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 85 cents per share. The online retailer posted revenue of $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion.

The crazy clown phenomenon has been a Halloween staple for decades but the trend really took off after the release of “American Horror Story: Freakshow.” In “Freakshow,” there is a murderous clown that terrorizes a town by luring women and children into the woods and then either killing or torturing them. The character is depicted with a sinister smile, uncontrollable hair, and dead, constantly staring eyes. Being the freaks that we are in America, this quickly became a Halloween costume that you could buy at popular stores such as Walmart and PartyCity. People have been scared of clowns since long before this, as clowns went from happy, silly entertainers to beings that make us uncomfortable and fearful the minute that they smile. The adoption of kill clowns in media and costumes to look the part have caused unforeseen consequences. When “American Horror Story” creator, Ryan Murphy created Clown, he probably never expected people to mimic that look and go out and terrorize real living people. There have been countless reports in over 10 states of clowns scaring unsuspecting citizens at night and even robbing or assaulting them in the process. Many women and children have reported instances in which clowns attempted to lure them into the woods at knifepoint. College campuses have been put on lockdown because of these incidents and even some places in South Carolina have even begun instituting curfews to protect their residents, according to Heavy.com. The “trend,” as some news circulations have been referring to it as, has even spread to other countries such as Germany where two teenage girls were assaulted with baseball bats and knives, each on a separate occasion, according to the Morgenpost. One woman in Germany was threatened with a chain saw by a clown jumping out of a bush, also according to Morgenpost. This problem is not just an American one. Thousands of tweets have surfaced in which people state that if they see a clown lurking in their neighborhood they would not hesitate to assault the clown first. Police departments in Utah have urged residents to not harm the clowns as they did not want “innocent people” getting hurt. Many people saw the irony in this as stories flash across our televisions far too frequently of actually innocent black people being gunned down by police without robbing anyone or threatening anyone at knifepoint. Since more and more citizens have thought to react violently to clown sightings, a new, ridiculous movement, “Clown Lives Matter” has popped up in some states with some of these bozos actually forming protests to demand equal rights to terrorize others around the country. Unfortunately, clowns will not be arrested just for lurking around town and being creepy as that is not a crime in the U.S., and as a result, many police forces will not investigate any creepy clown sightings unless a crime is actively being committed. So standing on the side of the road yelling at people, trying to lure unsuspecting victims into a wooded area and in general causing a disturbance are rights that clowns get but not anyone else? These actions, that we cannot protect ourselves from as many police have given up, can have an extremely negative effect on our quality of life. If you have to start looking around at night to avoid getting mugged by a creepy clown or your children cannot play outside without the threat of being nabbed by a knife wielding lunatic, your rights are being infringed upon. It seems as though clown lives do matter more than anyone else’s. This raises some serious concerns about American priorities. When we have so many other things to be worrying about, clowns should not be one of them. In trying to better understand how to combat the creepy killer clown craze, psychologists and researchers in both Germany and the U.S. have tried to pinpoint what makes the clowns want to go out and do this in the first place. Some experts have said that it has something to do with wanting to exert power over another person by scaring them and once you do that, you can either assault or rob them. These theories make sense, but ignore the fact that people would not do this if they knew they would get caught. The lack of police enforcement around this issue has only fed into the problem rather than addressing it. It is now a crazy clown free-for-all until someone steps up and puts an end to this madness. With Halloween quickly approaching and children becoming more and more eager to go trick or treating, this issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible. It is time for creepy clowns to stay in our dreams and “Scooby Doo” episodes where they truly belong. Tagged: 2016 clowns creepy run!

What are you Afraid Of? Thu, 10/27/2016 - 7:36pm -- Hannah J. Moore I wanted to write something Halloween themed for this column but had a hard time solidifying a topic. One idea was about how people should just enjoy the holiday despite its “pagan” origins, because even Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter have “pagan” references. I thought about describing why some types of costumes are insensitive, like Native American headdresses or the latex suicide wounds Walmart was selling on their online store until they were removed. Another idea I had was talking about how a pair of animal ears and lingerie aren’t a real costume, not trying to police what women wear, but commenting on the hypersexualization of a holiday based on death. Gross.  Instead, I’m going to talk about fear, something as ubiquitous to Halloween as sticky pumpkin seeds or a white bed sheet with two holes cut out for eyes.  Fear is an unpleasant emotion that develops in response to a perceived danger of the present or future that can produce both physical and behavioral effects … at least that’s what the expert psychologists say. Halloween is the only holiday where we willingly subject ourselves to horror films and out-of-the-ordinary situations just for the sake of being afraid. I used to consider Halloween my favorite holiday, mainly because I like free candy and the sound of crunching leaves under my feet, but nobody told me that when you get older you have to buy your own candy and that Arkansas’ trees don’t shed their leaves fully until November. I’ll never understand intentionally frightening yourself in celebration of a holiday, because, quite frankly, the experts were right in saying that fear is unpleasant.  That being said, I’ve been afraid of a lot of things in my short lifetime. As a kid, I was afraid of talking to anyone outside my family. I used to be afraid to march in the end-of-the-school-year parade in elementary school. In middle school, I was afraid of making new friends after moving. In high school, I was afraid of dating and graduating. As a senior in college, I’m still afraid of dating and graduating. To be honest, I’m still afraid of a lot of things. And it’s not even the things themselves that I’m afraid of, but the potential for failure. I was afraid that people wouldn’t like me, that I’d get my heart broken again, that I wouldn’t amount to anything.  The only good advice I’ve heard lately dealing with overcoming fear came from my favorite TV show, “Game of  Thrones:” “The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords.” This is the nerdy, less cliche version of “the only thing to fear is fear itself.”  If I wanted to make friends but sat quietly at my desk and didn’t talk to anyone, I wouldn’t have made any friends. If I want to date someone but I don’t ask them out or tell them that I’m interested, I’m never going to date them. If there’s an open position at my dream company but I don’t apply, I’m definitely not going to get the job. Fear hinders you from accomplishing your goals, and that can be more harmful than trying and failing. You can’t predict the future, unless you’ve read “The Walking Dead” comic books before the TV show airs like my roommate has. If you at least try, there’s still a chance that you’ll succeed, make that friend, date that person or get that job, but if you don’t try, you’ll automatically fail. Isn’t that what we feared in the first place?  I take my previous statement back; subjecting ourselves to fear isn’t as exclusive to Halloween as I once thought.  I now ask the rhetorical question: what are you afraid of? Take a second to think about it. What are you really afraid of? Now go do it. It’s better to have tried and failed than to have failed automatically by never trying. Call this my own version of “it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.” Halloween is the holiday for appropriation, after all.    280 reads The Bison Multimedia See interviews, features, and more from the Bison's multimedia team.

That’s the claim of the so-called “Citizens Against Food Tax Injustice.” Advertisement Food Tax Injustice? “Hmm,” citizens of Massachusetts may say, “we don’t tax food sold in stores here.” Ah, but you see, that’s a reference to the supposed costs Question 3 would impose. The principal argument has been about eggs. Proponents say any increase will be minimal, maybe a penny or two per egg. They note that restaurants like McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Denny’s, and grocery chains and food suppliers like Albertsons, BJ’s, Costco, Price Chopper, Target, and Walmart wouldn’t otherwise have agreed to phase out cages in their egg-supply chain. Get Today's Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here When I did a recent two-store survey, one of the best deals I found was on Nellie’s Free Range Eggs, on special at Roche Bros., at $2.99 a dozen, and cheaper than any eggs except the supermarket’s own brand, at $2.79. Several cage-free brands were price competitive with non-cage-free offerings. View Story Should Mass. require cage-free eggs? Question 3 limits the sale and production of food from animals kept in tight enclosures. Free range like Nellie’s is a long way from what Question 3 proposes. The ballot question would simply end the extreme confinement of laying hens, veal calves, and pigs, little of which takes places in Massachusetts. It would also ban the sale here of products from animals confined that way, and in the case of pigs, born to sows kept in those conditions. The initiative petition stipulates that those animals can’t be kept in a way that prevents them from lying down or standing up, from fully extending their limbs, or from turning freely around. So who, exactly, are the “citizens” funding the opposition’s ads? One is the National Pork Producers Council, a $220,000 donor to the cause. A second is eccentric multimillionaire Forrest Lucas, a rags-to-riches oil-products magnate, cattle rancher, and all-around right-winger from Indiana, who has given $195,000. Lucas is a man who seems dead set against any and all legislation to improve the treatment of animals. Advertisement He believes animal-rights activists have destroyed farming in Europe — which might come as news to several of Europe’s 12 million farmers. He and his organization, Protect the Harvest, disdain those who “see animals living in close proximity and . . . view that as a negative.” Imagine looking askance at a factory farmer who has generously allotted a caged chicken the floor space an iPad would occupy. The temerity of those damn meddlers! “In reality,” writes Protect the Harvest, “these measures are taken to ensure greater health of the animals. . . . Farmers and ranchers have a vested interest in keeping their animals as healthy as possible in order to make a better product for consumers.” After all, if a hen has room to stretch her wings and turn around, who knows what she’ll do next? Why, she might just start dancing the tango. But then, mirabile dictu, I spotted a third donor, a real, live Massachusetts citizen: attorney Thomas Kiley, who gave $100. Now, Kiley, a former assistant attorney general, is an oft-hired legal gun on ballot questions. But he also opposes Question 3. Why? “If I am going to eat you, it doesn’t matter whether I have patted you nicely on the head,” he told me. Mind you, Citizen Kiley is not Hannibal Lecter; he was speaking here of farm animals. But does it really make sense that, just because we eventually use an animal for food, we have no obligation to afford it a basic level of decent treatment until then? Or, in the case of hens, while it is producing eggs for us? That we shouldn’t care at all about its living conditions? Not to me. Not when Question 3 lets us do better, at minimal cost.

News Public Safety DMV uncovers fake ID ring on Craigslist Kristina DavisContact Reporter You can buy a lot of things on Craigslist: an apartment, a used coffee table, a date … and even a fake ID. Investigators from the California DMV found out how easy it was to get a fraudulent driver’s license in a sting that ended with at least one arrest. The investigation began earlier this year when the DMV was tipped to Craigslist ads for “Fake IDs and DL for CA,” according to a search warrant affidavit filed in San Diego federal court this month. A search of the phone number on the ad quickly linked investigators to a U.S. passport that appeared to be fraudulently using someone else’s identity. In February, a DMV investigator assistant answered an ad and asked to have a fake driver’s license. She was told to make the $240 payment via PayPal or Walmart transfer and to email her photo. A few weeks later, the investigator assistant picked up the ID. The driver’s license number on it belonged to a real person from Visalia, the DMV later learned. Three must-see headlines <h1>Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat</h1> <h1>'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever</h1> <h1>Five beers that made San Diego famous</h1> Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat 'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever Five beers that made San Diego famous See more videos Investigators did a facial recognition search of the man who made the in-person handoff and learned it was Vuong “Mike” Ton. Further digging revealed Ton had been using the identity of another man himself, court records state. That man, who is referred to by the initials C.L., told investigators he had asked Ton to help him consolidate his student loans, and sent Ton his picture and Social Security number as part of that effort. He said he soon found out that his loans were not consolidated and began to get warnings that his credit was being damaged. A search of Ton’s Clairemont apartment in July found seven counterfeit driver’s licenses, as well as 45 blank and printed cards with magnetic strips and card embossing equipment. Many of the strips included information under various names. Ton was arrested on a charge of making a false statement in applying for a passport. Ton told authorities that he would give the fake ID work orders to a man and then pick up the finished fake IDs from him at the Irvine Spectrum shopping mall in Orange County.

Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers blame pharmaceutical companies. Drugmakers blame insurers. And have you seen how much money the hospitals spend? Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Nov. 8, most of the players are betting that something will get done on the cost of prescription drugs. They're laying defensive and offensive groundwork for when new laws are drawn up by a Congress that has spent the last year holding hearings on the issue. A prime example is a new ad out Wednesday from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the Washington lobby group, making the case that high list prices don't represent what drugmakers really get and that middlemen take a big cut. “While the list price is often used in stories about prescription drug costs, it's not what the drug company makes,” says a narrator. “Most of the control over the final cost to you, the patient, rests with your insurance company, or employer, or the PBM.” The ad push began last month and the group has plans for more, said Matt Gorman, a spokesman. The blame game is getting more intense as lobbying groups see a must-pass piece of legislation to fund the Food and Drug Administration as a vehicle for price regulation. Every five years, the pharmaceutical industry negotiates “user fees” they'll pay the FDA to review new drug applications. The current authorization of the law ends in September. “We are very much focused on user fees as an opportunity,” KJ Hertz, senior legislative representative on AARP's federal health and family team, said in an interview. “Everyone is looking for this to be an issue in 2017.” Pricing Coalition AARP, which represents seniors, is part of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, along with Anthem Inc., one of the U.S.'s biggest health insurers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The coalition has proposed having drugmakers submit for government review any price increases over 10 percent, and making it easier for generics to come to market. Health insurers, who just six years ago were painted as villains during the passage of Obamacare, are relishing the turnabout now that drugmakers are the focus. “These increases have got to stop,” said John Bennett, chief executive officer of Capital District Physicians' Health Plan Inc., or CDPHP, a not-for-profit health insurer in Albany, New York. Last year, 22 percent of the premiums Capital took in for its commercial plans was spent on drugs. “They are unsustainable for us as a society and they are morally wrong,” Bennett said in a telephone interview. “They are extracting profit out of a scarce resource that people need to survive.” Pile On Hospitals have jumped in as well. Two industry trade groups this month released a report that found average annual inpatient drug spending at community hospitals rose 23 percent from 2013 to 2015. “The industry has proven time and time again it can no longer regulate itself,” Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer for the Cleveland Clinic, said in an Oct. 11 call discussing the report. Clinton has released a plan for combating price increases that includes penalties for unjustified hikes, a federal group charged with overseeing drug prices and emergency importation of treatments from developed countries. If Democrats win the Senate, there's a chance Bernie Sanders, an independent representing Vermont, could chair the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees the FDA legislation. Sanders this month denounced corporate “greed" in a tweet from his official account that called out Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the $199,000 price tag on its leukemia drug, sending the company's shares down as much as 15 percent. Saving Lives Drugmakers have another powerful message -- their treatments save lives. Pfizer Inc. in May introduced a TV ad where a male narrator ticks off the research, business and regulatory hurdles to bringing a new drug to market. Then the camera cuts to the man closing a medicine cabinet as he sees his young son behind him. “So after it became a medicine, someone who couldn't be cured, could be -- me.” Pfizer declined to say how much it was spending on the ad campaign. “Our hope is that if more people understand what it takes to bring a new medicine to patients, that together we can create a better environment for discovering treatments,” said Neha Wadhwa, a spokeswoman. Blame Elsewhere Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Washington lobby group for the drug industry, has also attempted to put the cost of drugs in perspective through explanatory videos. In one, the group calls out the hospital industry, on which it said the U.S. is expected to spend $3.5 trillion over the next decade -- three times what PhRMA says will be spent on medicine. The back-and-forth will likely only get more intense. Tim Wentworth, CEO of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., said on a conference call Wednesday he's taking his argument directly to lawmakers. “We are very, very much in Washington,” Wentworth said. “We are spending a significant amount of time with key legislators in the decision-making areas to make sure they understand exactly what it is that we've done and what we can do.” Donald Trump Hillary Clinton Education Environment Pensions Society Technology Insurance Biotechnology Hospitals Innovation Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

Credit: Jason Margolis A decade ago, Marwan Sweedan was performing surgeries in Iraq. At the time, his family was working with coalition forces, and they became targets.

PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="http://www.pri.org/node/155477/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> “My dad got captured, kidnapped, tortured and killed,” says Sweedan. He says doctors were also being marked, so he applied for refugee status and was later relocated to San Jose, California. “Being a refugee is not something you plan for, you don’t wake up in the morning and go, ‘I’m going to be a refugee today.’ No, it just happened,” says the 37-year-old Sweedan.  “It was a cultural shock to me coming to the United States, and I didn’t understand what’s going on, and everything was collapsing around me, my world was collapsing. So the first job, and the only job I found at that time, was selling hot dogs in a mall, Santana Row, in San Jose.”  He laughs, looking back at it, saying, "It was a fun job to be honest, I learned a lot.” The US will take in close to 70,000 refugees this year from across the globe. Being a refugee isn’t easy, leaving behind friends, family, and, for many, careers. For highly educated workers — with occupations like doctors, engineers, and lawyers — being a refugee in the US generally means starting over. But a program in Boise, Global Talent Idaho, or GTI, is helping refugees find jobs more suited to their backgrounds. Tara Wolfson co-founded the nonprofit two years ago. She was working with a refugee resettlement agency and often saw people’s talent, education and expertise not being used. “I just decided that I couldn’t look in the mirror any longer if I knew that a doctor was mopping floors or an engineer was working on an assembly line, picking raw meat off of it,” says Wolfson. She explains that resettlement programs in the US aren’t designed to help people land professional jobs. “The goal of the refugee resettlement system is early self-sufficiency — and that is the first job you can get as quick as possible.” Her organization has helped clients like an engineer working in an onion processing plant and an IT specialist stocking shelves overnight at Wal-Mart. In two years, Global Talent Idaho has placed about 125 refugees and immigrants into higher-skilled work more appropriate to their skill set. On average, people who complete the GTI program are now earning $26,000 more. And all of those higher salaries have pumped roughly $1 million into the local economy. The course, which typically takes about six months, helps newcomers improve their English, polish their résumés and do mock interviews. GTI’s program manager, Gina Finley, says many refugees simply don’t know how to market themselves here. “Probably one the most common mistakes out the gate of an interview is in the US, the most common first question is: ‘So tell me about yourself?’ And often times, in other countries, that means tell me about you personally. Tell me about your family and how your family is,” Finley says. "Here in the US, that's very secondary. It's really about, 'Tell me about your skills and your capabilities and where you fit into my organization.'" Albert Makuna goes through a mock interview through Global Talent Idaho. Makuna was a neurosurgeon in the Democratic Republic of Congo before he came to the US as a refugee. His first job in the US was sewing hot tub covers.  Credit: Global Talent Idaho Sweedan, who had relocated from California to Idaho, was making these mistakes before GTI honed his interviewing skills.   “[GTI instructors] make your experience into a good story that the employer will be interested to see.” I asked Sweedan what he could possibly have been doing wrong — he came across as a nice, intelligent, instantly likable person.   “Let me tell you something, I learned the term ‘overqualified’ in the United States, because you put everything on your résumé,” Sweedan says. Employers were understandably confused why a surgeon was applying to deliver pizza (he did that, too). Once the talent nonprofit stepped in, Sweedan got hired as an infection prevention specialist, keeping operating rooms clean. He’s back in a hospital, but it’s a long way from performing surgery. “I think that I’m using my experience, but not to full capacity,” he says. At least he’s making better money, not the same salary a surgeon draws, but it’s a start. “I’m making a good living,” Sweedan says. “I actually purchased my first house here in the United States.” A few other cities also have programs like Global Talent Idaho. One's called Upwardly Global, which has branches in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Silver Spring, Maryland. These organizations can help highly skilled refugees get back on their feet, but not all the way back — certain occupations come with barriers to entry. “Law and medicine are [professions] that, if you’re coming to the United States from abroad, it can be very difficult to enter into ... due to the bar exams and the licensing boards and all that come in with that,” says Bill Kerr, a professor at Harvard Business School. “Occupational licensing can be quite common, even to become a hairdresser or a barber.” To become a licensed physician in the US, Sweedan would need to study for and pass three highly rigorous, and expensive, board exams. Then, he’d need to get accepted into a residency program, competing against recent US medical school graduates. If he works like mad and all goes smoothly, it could take him four to five years to get back to where he left off in Iraq, working as a doctor. He says, don’t count him out. “I’ll never let go of that dream,” says Sweedan. “I worked hard for my degree in Iraq, and I’m going to work hard again, but eventually I’m going to make it.” Comment facebook Share on Facebook twitter Share on Twitter googleplus Share on Google + share Share In Business, Finance & Economics, Business and Global Nation.

WIRE Amazon Could Open up to 2,000 Grocery Stores The retailer reportedly sees an opportunity to expand well beyond its 20-store pilot program. By Eugene Kim Business Insider@eugenekim222 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Amazon wants to open 20 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next two years, and the online retailer believes the US market has room for up to 2,000 of its Amazon Fresh-branded grocery stores over the next decade, Business Insider has learned. Amazon is planning to operate a 20-location pilot program for its grocery stores by the end of 2018, in places like Seattle, Las Vegas, New York, Miami, and the Bay Area, according to documents viewed by Business Insider. The company wants to experiment with different versions of stores during the pilot program. Ten of the grocery stores will be "click-and-collect" drive-up spots for Amazon customers to pick up their online orders. The other 10 will be traditional stores where cart-pushing shoppers can stroll the aisles while touching, smelling, and inspecting produce and other goods for themselves. The documents draw the curtain back on Amazon's vision for the grocery stores, though the company could change course depending on business and market conditions. Physical stores are becoming increasingly central to Amazon's business ambitions as the company expands beyond its online-retailing stronghold and looks for new ways to reach customers. Besides groceries, Amazon has already opened a few physical bookstores and is building out a network of pop-up stores in malls to showcase its line of hardware products. The physical store strategy is expensive and will pit Amazon against far more experienced players, such as Walmart, which has more than 5,000 stores in the US. As Amazon has moved into the massive $800 billion grocery market, it has until now taken a measured approach. Its grocery-delivery service, Amazon Fresh, has been unusually slow to expand, rolling out in only 17 US cities and one overseas location (London) nearly a decade after its first launch in 2007. With the new stores, however, Amazon appears to be preparing for a more aggressive push into the market. Amazon declined to comment. Members only? Amazon has studied the physical grocery store market closely in recent years. An internal market research report from 2014 that was updated earlier this year focused not only on sales data from Amazon's Fresh and Prime delivery services but on market data from competing grocery stores. Amazon has wrestled with the important question of whether to open the grocery stores to the general public or limit them to members of its Prime Fresh club, who pay a $15 monthly fee to receive grocery deliveries at home. The question is cited in the "risks/concerns" section of the internal documents. The grocery market is the single largest shopping category in the US, at $800 billion in spending last year, but it's also a tricky one because of its notoriously thin profit margins and high operating costs. By going membership-only, Amazon can use the membership fees to offset the high operating costs of grocery stores. On the other hand, eliminating the membership requirement could help the stores reach a broader set of customers and increase sales faster. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month said the first grocery stores would be available only to members of the Fresh subscription service. If the 20-store pilot program is successful, Amazon envisions opening as many as 2,000 "multifunction" stores across the US over the next 10 years. The total number of grocery stores has not been finalized and could change, but the documents refer to a proposed launch schedule of 200 stores a year, all supported by a new generation of distribution centers to replenish inventories. 'Destination' stores It's still unclear exactly what the new Amazon grocery stores will look like. Bloomberg describes the drive-through spots as "gas stations," while The Wall Street Journal characterized the grocery stores as "convenience stores." Some of the internal documents viewed by Business Insider say the drive-through spots will be 10,000 square feet in size, while physical stores could go up to 30,000 square feet. New technology like license-plate scanning or in-store kiosks are also being considered, along with a new rapid drive-through pick-up option. Some stores could be a combination of drive-through and walk-through as Amazon continues to iron out the format. Amazon believes that some of its stores will offer enough of a draw to become "destination stores" that consumers are willing to drive across town or even out of town to shop at. An Amazon grocery store under construction in Washington state and spotted by GeekWire is located in Ballard, a 25-minute drive from downtown Seattle. GeekWire also recently flagged a revealing 2013 report by the Deloitte consultant Brittain Ladd, which hints at where Amazon may be headed with its grocery stores. Ladd, who was recruited by Amazon Fresh in 2015, argued at the time that Amazon should build its own grocery retail stores that carry more than 42,000 products, with multiple shopping options like drive-throughs and touch-screen kiosks. "Amazon Fresh will only succeed as a grocery retailer if they can sell more groceries and selling more groceries requires attracting and delighting as many customers as possible through all available channels," wrote Ladd, who declined to comment for this story. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has previously stressed the go-slow approach for grocery deliveries, saying in a 2013 annual letter to shareholders that "we'll continue our methodical approach -- measuring and refining Amazon Fresh -- with the goal of bringing this incredible service to more cities over time." After several years of "measuring and refining" grocery deliveries, Amazon looks as if it's almost ready for its grand opening.
