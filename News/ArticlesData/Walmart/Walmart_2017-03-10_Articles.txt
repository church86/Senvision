Picture taken Dec. 20, 2016. (REUTERS/Mark Makela) Amazon.com likes to change the rules. First it sold books online. Then it launched an online shopping revolution. When it started the subscription service Amazon Prime, customers received two-day shipments for free. Each innovation caused a paradigm shift in how we shop and entertain ourselves. Amazon is not without competition. Walmart has definitely taken aim. Click here to learn which site offers cheaper prices, Amazon or Walmart. More than 65 million people were actively enrolled in Amazon Prime last year, paying $10.99 per month or $99 per year. Many customers use their accounts for free shipping, but they don’t realize that there are other terrific benefits as well. Here are nine Prime perks you may not be using. Free same-day delivery It sounds too good to be true: You order an item, and someone hand-delivers it within a few hours. How is this possible? Amazon Prime Now usually works like this. You can order a product by noon and expect to receive it by 9 p.m., sometimes even within an hour. Click here to learn more about same-day delivery. Share benefits with others There you were, enjoying the rewards of an Amazon Prime membership, when you moved in with your significant other, who also orders a lot of stuff online. You can share the same Prime membership with two other adults in your household. To do this, go to Account Settings >> Manage Your Content and Devices >> Settings >> Holds and Family Library >> Invite Adult. More from Kim Komando New breakthrough technology stores 1,000 times more data One Instagram secret you won't know unless you get hacked Optimize Windows 10 for longer battery life Watch out! Scary new Facebook scam spreading now Tip in a tip: Shopping on Amazon the right way is more than clicking items and loading up your cart. Once you learn a few tricks, you’ll find sales and price cuts that you never imagined possible. Click here for five insider secrets to save money on Amazon.com. Watch streaming video Amazon Studios gained global attention at the 2017 Academy Awards when Casey Affleck won Best Actor for “Manchester by the Sea.” Like Netflix and Hulu, Amazon is producing a wide range of high-quality programs, and critics are giving the retail giant a big thumb’s up. Amazon also offers a colossal library of movies and TV series, from HBO flagships like “The Wire” to indie films like “The Lobster.” Keep in mind that not every flick or episode is available for free, but you can easily buy or order a streaming version of almost any movie imaginable. You can also download certain titles to watch offline. Click here for the steps on how to do this. Download free music Many people enjoy their first year of Prime membership without ever knowing they can download music for free. That’s right: download. You can also stream songs, the same way you stream music on Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora, but you can also choose from more than a million mp3s to keep forever on your phone or computer. The Prime Music app is also a handy tool. You can upload your own music library and listen to your songs wherever you go. Read free books and magazines Amazon started as an online bookstore, so it’s no wonder the megastore would nod to its roots with free volumes on Kindle. Amazon Prime reading offers you a trove of ebooks, comics and magazines that you can download at no charge to pretty much any device. The selections rotate regularly, just as they do for Prime Video. So if the book you want to read isn’t there now, it may become available in a few months. Just download the Kindle app and you should be ready to read. Verbophiles can even use the built-in dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. Use special cloud storage The truth is scary: Many people still don’t back up their hard drives. These folks are always one man-made or natural disaster away from losing all their pictures, music, videos and documents. If you don’t already have a dependable storage service but you do have a Prime membership, you can use Amazon’s handy Cloud Drive, which gives members 5GB of storage for music and videos. Even better: You can use Amazon Prints to turn some of those stored photos into beautiful, frame-worthy images. Click here to find out how to print high-quality photos for cheap. Order food and domestic goods Imagine calling up your supermarket, ordering 45 pounds of groceries, and having them deliver it to your home for an extra $5.99. Sound fantastic? Well, that’s basically what Amazon Pantry does. The service is still working out its kinks, so you won’t find the same selection you’d find at your local Super Target. But the idea is catching on, and many customers appreciate its versatility. Prime membership grants you access to a wider array of products. If you like the service, you can also subscribe to Amazon Family for $99, which gets you some extra perks, such as discounts on diapers. Get a discount on games Diehard gamers love to be the first to nab a new release. Amazon Prime members get a 20 percent discount on video game pre-orders and new releases. This applies to any game that has hit the market within two weeks of ordering. Just keep in mind that it applies only to physical copies of the game, and it doesn’t include console game bundles. Get restaurant meals delivered to your door Just when you thought DoorDash was a wild innovation, Amazon created its own dining delivery service. Just visit Amazon Restaurants and order a multicourse meal. Granted, you have to live in a city where Amazon Prime Now already exists. But if you do, you’re guaranteed to receive your steaming entrée within an hour! What other digital life benefits are you missing out on?

Chattanooga Auto Square names Sconzo as manager Steven Sconzo has been named executive general manager of Chattanooga Auto Square, which comprises four luxury automotive brands: Jaguar, Porsche, Land Rover and Infiniti. Sconzo comes to Chattanooga from Hilton Head Island, S.C., where he was luxury platform manager for Coastal States Automotive Group. He has more than 25 years of experience working in the luxury automotive space, including with three of the brands he will manage at Chattanooga Auto Square: Jaguar, Porsche and Land Rover. Sconzo says he is excited to work with the Infiniti brand. "I learned a long time ago to treat every customer like they are a guest in your home," he said. "We are excited to be in a city with a strong culture and a history of innovation." Chattanooga Auto Square, located on Lee Highway near the I-75 Bonny Oaks Drive exit, is a division of Furrow Automotive, which has served the luxury automotive needs of East Tennesseans for more than 100 years. BMW recalls 34,000 SUVs over driveshafts BMW is adding nearly 134,000 SUVs to a 2016 recall to fix driveshaft joints that can fail and could cause the vehicles to stop moving. The expanded recall covers certain X5 and X6 SUVs from the 2011 to 2014 model years in the U.S. and Canada. The company recalled about 21,000 of the vehicles last year. It decided to expand the recall after getting more warranty claims. BMW says some front universal joint seals were manufactured wrong and can let water and dirt into the joint. That can cause faster wear and potential failure. The company says in government documents that it has no reports of crashes or injuries. BMW will replace the front driveshaft at no cost to owners starting on April 24. Caterpillar refutes challenges that it skirted tax laws Caterpillar, a week after its headquarters and other facilities were raided by a number of federal agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, denied that it had broken any federal tax laws. "The IRS has challenged Caterpillar's taxes for years 2007-2012," the company said Friday. "We disagree with the IRS' position, have cooperated for requests for information and believe that we are compliant with tax laws and stand by our financial reporting." Caterpillar has been challenged for some time by federal agencies in regard to its accounting practices, and last week the company said that the raids may have been related to a Swiss business called CSARL. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Caterpillar said that the IRS had informed the company that it owed $2 billion in additional taxes for the years 2010 to 2012 because of profits from that Swiss unit. "Caterpillar takes very seriously its obligation to follow tax law and pay what it owes," the company said Friday.

Mann 5 days 22 hours ago Cullman County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Mark Persall and Lt. Rex Sorrow   CULLMAN - This weekend, the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) and Cullman Police Department (CPD) are out in force, for a worthy cause.  Deputies and officers were at the south Cullman Wal-Mart Friday and will be again tomorrow, Saturday, taking donations to help support Cullman’s Special Olympians, and to provide free services to Olympians and their families at the local meet scheduled for April 21 in Cullman. “It’s our fundraiser for local special needs children who participate in the Special Olympics,” said Sheriff Matt Gentry.  “You’re going to see deputies out there, and you’re going to see volunteers.  We’ll have bands at the south Wal-Mart playing music.  Lt. (Rex) Sorrow (who heads up the program) is very passionate about Special Olympics and helping them in those events and in the schools, to help them meet their goals.  The deputies get very involved; it’s a great thing for the deputies and the community.” The Tribune caught up with Sorrow at the south Wal-Mart, and he shared: “We have CPD and deputies here, and a lot of volunteers from our Citizens’ Academy.  We do this every year to raise funds for our special needs students, who’ll be having their track and field games on April 21 at Woodard Stadium.  They normally have to go and find people who’ll sponsor their T-shirts, meals and different things like that.  I told Bridget Keith, who’s over the Cullman County part of the Special Olympics, ‘Look, y’all don’t have to do that anymore.  We’re going to raise enough money to pay for your T-shirts, pay for your medals and food.  We’re going to come out and cook hot dogs and hamburgers, and we’re going to let not only the kids but the parents also eat, and it’s going to be free.’  One-hundred percent of this goes toward that.” This year’s event is a little different from the past, with live entertainment at Wal-Mart that includes local school bands, FFA string bands, bluegrass and gospel performers.  The CCSO is even giving awards for the best act in each of those categories.  The CCSO also has its mobile command center and several department vehicles on-site, along with a reproduction of the Mayberry Sheriff’s patrol car from “The Andy Griffith Show.” The public is encouraged to come out, enjoy live entertainment, and drop a little something in the buckets of officers and deputies who will be at store entrances Saturday.

Staff, vendors and customers will celebrate the opening of the market, located at 1705 South Kings Highway, with various festivities and games beginning at 7 a.m. &nbsp; “Pepsi’s going to bring some inflatables,” store manager Sherrie Carlisle said. “We’ll have some of the characters out, we’ll have the Planter’s Peanut, we’re going to have the Pelican from Pelican stadium … we’ll have the polar bear, the Coke Polar Bear. We’ll actually have some free things to give out and coupons and different things like that.” On top of that, the mayor, the Chamber of Commerce and the Myrtle Beach High School ROTC will be in attendance. While the location is convenient for locals, who will no longer have to travel to the larger Walmart Supercenters, it is also close to the beach and various hotels. “We’re right here, you know,” said Carlisle. “They won’t even have to cross [U.S.] 17 to get to a shopping center. A lot of the customers can either walk, or if they ride a bike or golf cart, and they can get here very easily.” Walmart Neighborhood Markets are unique compared to the Supercenters because they are smaller and designed for convenience, and have a pharmacy, deli, bakery and fresh produce. “We offer a large assortment like the Supercenter; however, it’s a lot closer,” said Calisle. The new location is a prototype, meaning that the look of the market is cleaner and fresher looking while offering more customer space. The market has a new make-your-own pizza option where customers can customize their own pizza and have it cooked at the market or take it home to cook. “I think that’s going to be a key item, especially for the tourists at the hotels,” said Carlisle. The number for the make-your-own pizza option is 843-353-5635. The market will also have a beach shop, making it easy to purchase last-minute beach needs. The opening of the new market brought over 100 jobs to the Myrtle Beach area, ranging from maintenance, cashiers, managers and others. A hiring event was held in January when the company set up a temporary hiring center at 1517 N. Kings Highway, The Sun News reported. About 90 associates were hired at the event, but the market continued to hire afterward. “We’re expecting to have a really busy area being this close to the beach,” Carlisle said. “So we’re going to hire some temporary associates for the summertime as well.” Those interested in applying for part-time or temporary associate positions can submit applications at www.walmart.com. This location marks the fifth location along the Grand Strand with others in Murrells Inlet, The Market Common, across from Ocean Lakes Family Campground and in the Village Square Shopping Center.

LOUIS — Two Georgia men have pleaded guilty in a credit card fraud scheme that targeted area Walmart stores. In a press release, U.S. Attorney Donald S. Boyce said Samirahdam E. Rolley, 25, of Stone Mountain, Ga., pleaded guilty to two credit card fraud charges and a charge of aggravated identity theft Thursday in federal court in East St. Louis. Michael A. Gordon, also of Stone Mountain, pleaded guilty Feb. 27 to the same charges arising out of the same incidents. The duo’s crimes occurred at several Walmart stores in the Metro East over a three-day period in June 2015. At their plea hearings, the pair admitted that they traveled from Georgia to Southern Illinois in early June 2015. During their trip, Rolley and Gordon possessed numerous gift cards. The cards’ magnetic strips had been re-encoded with stolen debit card numbers. Some of these debit account numbers were for the accounts of Southern Illinois residents at a local credit union. Rolley and Gordon used the altered gift cards to make purchases at Walmarts, including stores in Cahokia, O’Fallon, Belleville, Highland, Wood River, Collinsville, Glen Carbon, Godfrey, Jerseyville, Waterloo and Carlyle. The purchases made by Rolley and Gordon were debited to the bank accounts of the victims whose debit account numbers had been embedded on the gift cards. The sentencing hearings for both men are scheduled for June 23. The charges of using stolen account numbers and using counterfeit credit cards are both punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, three years of supervised release and restitution. The aggravated identity theft charge carries a mandatory sentence of 2 years in prison, which must be served consecutively with any prison sentence imposed for the stolen account number charge. The investigation is being conducted by the Springfield Division, Fairview Heights Resident Agency, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Several Metro East police departments have assisted the FBI with the investigation. Those include the Carlyle, Collinsville, Glen Carbon, Jerseyville, Waterloo and Wood River police departments, as well as the Madison County Sheriff’s Department. Walmart’s Global Security Department has also provided significant assistance in the investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott A. Verseman.

 Walmart is testing touchscreens in stores BI Intelligence Mar. 10, 2017, 11:11 AM 1,540 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also OMNICHANNEL STRATEGY BUNDLE: Your guide to engaging with shoppers on multiple channels THE REVERSE LOGISTICS REPORT: How retailers can save money by making returns smoother in the e-commerce age The top 5 predictions for the future of digital This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Several Walmart stores in Texas are testing touchscreens in the toy aisle, TheStreet reports. The touchscreen monitors allow customers to browse inventory that is available to order beyond what the store currently has in stock. In addition, the screens can suggest items for shoppers, guiding them to best-selling products based on a description of who the toy is for. Customers can order out-of-stock items for delivery to their homes.  The touchscreen could help Walmart overcome common inventory management issues that retailers face when implementing omnichannel strategies. Despite the benefits omnichannel can deliver, many retailers struggle to match inventory for online and in-store fulfillment, which often results in out-of-stocks. With the new touchscreen, a customer can easily order an out-of-stock toy on the spot and have it delivered straight to their home. The shopping assistance feature may also generate more sales by providing customers with confidence in purchases they are likely making for someone else. This is just one in a string of recent moves by Walmart to augment its online and in-store experiences. Walmart made a series of acquisitions recently — Jet.com, MooseJaw, and ShoeBuy — aimed at boosting its online inventory and expanding its online customer base. The retail giant also launched new app capabilities to free up in-store traffic and decrease wait times in lines. At the beginning of March, it rolled out features that allow customers to order and pay for prescription refills, as well as fill out forms needed for its money services, on its mobile app. Last year, Walmart launched its Scan & Go tool for both Sam’s Club and Walmart stores in an effort to smooth out its in-store checkout process. Omnichannel remains Walmart's best line of defense against Amazon. The company posted a 36% year-over-year (YoY) increase in US e-commerce sales in Q4 2016, yet online sales still only make up 3% of Walmart’s top line. This suggests that even with a growing online business, Walmart is unlikely to catch up to Amazon anytime soon. Optimizing the in-store experience is therefore a prudent strategy, particularly given the company's massive physical footprint. In bridging its online and in-store operations, the retailer can better fend off competition from the e-commerce giant by drawing in customers with greater options and more channels through which to shop.  To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the E-Commerce Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

Waste360 Staff | Mar 10, 2017 ReFED–an effort of 40 businesses, non-profits, foundations, investors and policymakers committed to reducing food waste in the United States—has named Chris Cochran, Walmart’s senior manager of corporate sustainability, as its first executive director, effective in April. Sarah Vared, who has served as ReFED’s Interim Director since its formation in early 2015, will continue to support ReFED strategically as needed in her role as a Principal at MissionPoint Partners. Vared is credited for positioning ReFED as the country’s leader in providing actionable solutions to reduce food waste. She was recently named as a member of the 2017 Waste360 40 Under 40 list. “I’m thrilled to be joining ReFED at such a pivotal moment, both for the organization and for the broader movement to reduce food waste in the United States,” Cochran said in a statement. “ReFED’s first-of-its-kind Roadmap has revolutionized the way we look at one of our biggest opportunities to save money and resources, feed people and create jobs. Using economics and data analysis, the Roadmap has identified a set of practical and proven solutions that can cut food waste dramatically and immediately. Now, it’s our job to catalyze the action and investment needed to realize the Roadmap’s promise, working closely with businesses, investors, foundations, non-profits and government to reduce food waste by 50 percent by 2030.” Cochran brings credentials and experience across the food system to his leadership of ReFED. In his role at Walmart, Cochran developed a farm-to-consumer view of food waste while leading sustainability for Walmart’s global produce business. He also led cross-sector, multi-stakeholder alignment of company food positions on animal welfare and farm antibiotic use. Most recently, Cochran led development of Walmart’s first end-to-end food waste model and the company’s initiative to reduce food waste in its supply chain. He also managed the company’s Direct Farm initiative, which formed long-term purchasing relationships with growers in Latin America, Asia and Africa, reducing post-harvest loss and creating stable incomes to small and medium farmers by ensuring reliable pathways to market. Before joining Walmart, Cochran held positions at PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York and CARE International in Honduras, where he worked on CARE’s agricultural development project that benefited 750 smallholder farmer families. In addition, Cedro Capital – an organization Cochran founded –operates a cocoa farm in Honduras. “The ReFED Steering Committee couldn’t be more enthusiastic about the dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit Chris brings to ReFED,” said Jesse Fink, chair of the ReFED Steering Committee. “His strategy and policy experience, coupled with his firsthand knowledge of industry’s role in food waste reduction, is precisely what ReFED needs to take its work to the next level. We are excited for him to build upon ReFED’s progress, connecting stakeholders and reaching new ones to win the fight against food waste.” “Our ambition when we developed the Roadmap was to create a surge in demand within the industry to take on proven waste-reducing solutions. Chris’ leadership will enable ReFED to continue tackling food waste from multiple points in the value chain and we hope his retail background will bring together even more actors from the business community who haven’t – or otherwise wouldn’t –collaborate on food system challenges,” Vared said in a statement. Since launching the Roadmap in 2016, ReFED’s efforts have included a multi-stakeholder initiative to standardize date labels; collecting data and generating insights on the innovation taking place to reduce food waste, as well as to navigate the policy and financing landscape; and developing the tools and resources that businesses, nonprofits, government, and investors need to put solutions into action.

Expat in philippines. US sites and protectionism :) Lately, many US websites (Walmart, Netflix, banks, shopping, etc) would show you a failed msg if you try to access them from out of the US! I can understand the reasons but it's indicative of how vulnerable we've become and don't really know how to confront it? What's the meaning of being an American if you can't travel? Duh! I use VPNs to connect as if I am in the US. It's expensive to block VPN connections but some do.

Expat in philippines. I think it has mostly to do with advertising money. Before Netflix was available in the PIs I could use a VPN with no problems. Now that they are licensed in the PIs they keep trying to block the VPNs. A good VPN company still gets around it. The Philippine Netflix choices are terribly limited, so I still want to use the VPN. A lot of YouTube content is restricted by countries too. I have even had online shops cancel my order as soon as I enter my mail forwarding address. It immediately kicked back as a fake address. Others have balked at the VPN. So, they know, some just don't care. My bank does not care if I use a VPN. I have a mail forwarding company handle my mail (so the bank does not have my real address). I use a VPN for the website. I use MagicJack to call them. As long as they have my money - they don't seem to care.   #3 (permalink)   11th March 2017, 08:02 AM pronse Member   Join Date: Apr 2009 Posts: 59 Rep Power: 0 33 likes received 6 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in philippines. I agree regarding Netflix. I used to get it too but switched to their flipino Netflix when they switched too. Buy, what's with the shopping sites? Walmart? Target? Etc. What's with even phone companies? What's with others? I expect more of the same though.. I too, use a mail forwarding service and still have my address in the US. Otherwise, no one would give me money What's a tried VPN that you use? It's better not to try one then discover it's not working. I use the free version of Tunnel Bear. I figured that Walmart doesn't want to ship if it discovers it. Amazon don't even require VPN for people to buy. You can order right away.

Expat in philippines. I use Private Internet Access. It came highly recommended on the torrent boards. They are based outside the US. They say they keep no records of your traffic. When signing up you can pay with a store gift card (they use Target and WalMart as examples). So you never even have to give them your name or any contact info. I have used them for 3 years and been very happy with them. Recently Russia tried to make them keep tracking records - so they voluntarily shut down their Russian servers. I think it is like $35 a year.   #5 (permalink)   11th March 2017, 11:34 AM Rebaqshratz Member   Join Date: May 2016 Location: usa Posts: 55 Rep Power: 0 38 likes received 40 likes given Originally from usa.

Thanks Reba A lot of the internet is country specific so people load special sofware on to their computers to spoof their location. It tends to be a game of cat and mouse between VPNs being blocked and new ones appearing.   #7 (permalink)   11th March 2017, 01:58 PM Tukaram Member   Join Date: Dec 2014 Location: Iloilo Posts: 323 Rep Power: 61 347 likes received 3 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in philippines. The VPN is a virtual private network. There are ways to set up your own, but most people use a service provider. The VPN allows you to trick the net into seeing your computer in another country (it basically gives you a different address). My service lets me pick what country or state I want to be "in". Some content providers (YouTube etc) restrict access by country. One of my videos I uploaded says it is not available in Germany...because of a background song in it. Odd, but ok. I find it useful in banking. Some US banks get weird if you access them from overseas. Using a VPN you can pick a server and your bank thinks you are still there. (my bank does not care but Western Union did). Some online stores also try to make you use their site in whatever country you are in. Target tries to make me use their international site (but now allows you to still use the US site). Netflix has a complete different offering of shows in the PIs and the US. Using a VPN I can tell Netflix I am in the US and get many more shows. Sometimes I switch it to Canada or England and get a different offering of shows.   #8 (permalink)   11th March 2017, 01:59 PM Tukaram Member   Join Date: Dec 2014 Location: Iloilo Posts: 323 Rep Power: 61 347 likes received 3 likes given Originally from usa.

MICHELE W. FOREHAND/DOTHAN EAGLE Alabama State Trooper Kevin Cook holds a picture of his son, Tyler Condrey, who was killed in a car crash in November. Fatal traffic crash makes driving safety personal for Trooper Kevin Cook BY MICHELE W. FOREHAND mwatson@dothaneagle.com Mar 10, 2017 Updated Mar 10, 2017 (…) Tyler Condrey, a 2016 graduate of Rehobeth High School, was killed in automobile accident in November. MICHELE W. FOREHAND/DOTHAN EAGLE Alabama State Trooper Kevin Cook holds a picture of his son, Tyler Condrey, who was killed in a car crash in November. As part of his job, Alabama State Trooper Kevin Cook has had to knock on many doors to inform a parent or other family member that their loved one had been killed in a traffic crash. On Nov. 14, 2016, Cook was on the other side of that door. He got the worst news a parent can receive. Then it was his job to inform his wife, Holley — their son Tyler Condrey had been killed in an automobile accident. “Tyler was traveling on the south side of town, near Wal-Mart, at 12:54 p.m.,” Kevin Cook said. “He was headed home for the day. By Tyler traveling at a high rate of speed, all of our lives changed that day. Life as we knew it, and loved it, was changed forever.” Condrey was speeding and ran off the left side of the road. He overcorrected the vehicle and went off the right side of the road. The vehicle came to a stop by hitting a tree. Condrey was not wearing a seatbelt. “The only thing that allows us to have a little peace about this situation is we know, without a doubt, he did not suffer,” Cook said. “When the accident came in, I received a call from a co-worker notifying me of the accident. You know, I had just got off work and was shopping at Wal-Mart, not far from where the accident happened. I asked what had happened several times and I was informed Tyler didn’t make it; you need to get to Holley. I left everything right there in the store. I knew I had to get to Holley at the trooper’s office. I had to tell the love of my life, our son was gone. The worst news she would ever get, and I had to be the one to give it to her. To this day, I feel guilty for that. She is constantly telling me not to, but I do. For years I had to do death notifications to family members. I always sympathized with the family, but it never crossed my mind that one day I would have to tell my wife our son was dead. Now I really know what those family members were feeling.” This past Thanksgiving and Christmas were different than any other holidays in the Cook household. “On Thanksgiving we just looked at the empty chair,” Cook said. “We spent Christmas morning just lying in Tyler’s bed. This is something I don’t want anyone to have to go through. I basically make myself get up every morning and put one foot in front of the other and so does she. It actually feels like someone is pushing against your chest, trying to keep you down. But, we are trying. We want to use Tyler’s story to help educate children and adults on the dangers associated with driving. For years, I have reached out to students to educate them on the dangers of driving, whether it is speeding or driving while under the influence. It is all about distracting driving. Since Tyler’s death, I have incorporated his story. His story means something, and he would not have wanted his death to be in vain. Now, hopefully, if one student decides to go the speed limit, or if one parent makes a point to talk with their child about the dangers of driving a vehicle, his story has served a purpose and we are all grateful knowing his story helped someone.” Cook encourages parents to reach out to their children during their teenage years. “I will be the first to tell you, being a teenager in today’s time is not like it was 20 years ago,” Cook said. “The peer pressure teenagers face today is horrible. There is so much out there to influence them to make the wrong choice and making the wrong choice once is all it takes. I will be the first to tell you, I would not want to be a teenager. Parents, I ask you to talk with your children about the dangers on the roadways. Let them know you are family, they are loved and if they need to call you, you will be right there. I want the teenagers to understand, a parent may be upset with them because they are not seeing eye-to-eye, but the parent still loves them. Believe me, instead of trying to drive, call a parent. They would much rather get a call from you than have an officer inform them their child was involved in an automobile accident. Yes, there may be some discussion the next day, but look at this way, you are there for that discussion. Remember, family is the most important thing.” Cook uses each opportunity he has to share his family’s story, with hopes on it reaching and making a difference to just one student. “For parents who believe your children are perfect and do no wrong, that is incorrect,” Cook said. “Talk to your children. Remind your children they are not in control of a vehicle. The vehicle controls them. If anyone feels this story will help reach anyone, contact me at 983-4588, I want to share this story as much as I can. I don’t want anyone to have to walk in our shoes.” Tags Kevin Cook Motor Vehicle Telecommunications Tyler Condrey Traffic Crash Christmas Highway Transports Work Parent Popular Fatal traffic crash makes driving safety personal for Trooper Kevin Cook Arrest made in Taco Bell assault Shootout occurs at Rucker Boulevard War on booty bumps Smith, Brandi Nicole Schulman Body discovered in Pea River identified Former Dothan commissioner Taylor Barbaree arrested on felony charges Hot grease thrown in Taco Bell employee's face during dispute Gordon mayor Elbert Melton arrested on voter fraud charges Dothan, Northview high schools consolidation proposal likely dead Videos Featured Businesses Bama Rv 5386 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-678-9510 US Mobile Homes of Alabama 5214 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-983-5658 All Metal Building Systems 409 S Broad St, Cowarts, AL 36321 800-440-1307 Billy Lawrence Buick GMC 525 Kirkland St, Abbeville, AL 36310 334-585-3551 McLeod's Publick House 5540 W Main St, Dothan, AL 36305 334-648-1912 Currently Open Alabama Eye Physicians & Surgeons 5937 W Main St, Dothan , AL 36305 334-446-0872 Jim Skinner Honda 3823 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-671-8100 Center for Vein Restoration 3280 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-678-9494 Miracle-Ear of Dothan - Southern Hearing 4440 W Main St, Ste 3, Dothan, AL 36305 334-377-4065 The Dothan Eagle 227 N Oates St, Dothan, AL 36303 334-792-3141 Coupons Bondy's Nissan 3693 W Main St, Dothan, AL 36305 334-794-6736 Bryant's Outdoor Equipment 2200 S Brannon Stand Rd, Dothan, AL 36305 334-794-4419 Beltone 2115 Denton Rd, Ste 2, Dothan, AL 36303 334-712-6778 Derrel's Sewing and Vacuum Center 2507 Montgomery Highway, Dothan, AL 36303 334-794-0824 Conestoga Steak House 3549 Montgomery Hwy, Dothan, AL 36303 334-794-4445 Currently Open Hearing Associates Of Dothan 1891 Honeysuckle Rd, Dothan, AL 36305 334-702-4327 Bondy's Ford Lincoln 3615 Ross Clark Cir, Dothan, AL 36303 334-792-5171 Vehicles Miles of Flowers 4143 W Main St, Ste 5, Dothan, AL 36305 334-699-5773 Contests Bracket Challenge Subscriber Services Dothan Eagle Subscriber Services e-Edition online Subscriber log-in Demo ePaper Print edition Subscribe for delivery Manage subscription Sections News Sports Lifestyles Obituaries Photos Weather Services Contact Us Subscription Rates Submission Forms Newspapers Enterprise Ledger Jackson Co.

Cho, The Plain Dealer The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 10, 2017 at 6:55 PM, updated March 11, 2017 at 8:53 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Walmart Supercenters nationwide will be giving away three million free birthday cupcakes Sunday afternoon, including 27,000 at its supercenters in Greater Cleveland, "in honor of everyone's birthday everywhere." The cupcakes, baked in store, will be chocolate or vanilla with buttercream or vanilla frosting. No coupons or special codes are required and no purchase necessary. Quantities are limited to one per customer from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday, while supplies last, only at Walmart Supercenters.  That means Ohio's 139 Supercenters will collectively hand out 120,000 cupcakes. In Greater Cleveland, that includes stores in Cleveland's Steelyard Commons, South Euclid, Eastlake, and Mayfield Heights. The cupcakes contain milk, wheat, eggs, and possibly peanuts, a spokeswoman. No allergy-free alternatives will be available. Walmart did not give a reason for the promotion, but is likely hoping that it brings three million extra customers to its stores on Sunday.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 March 2017 by Military News How Best Buy Survived While RadioShack Has Been to Bankruptcy Court Twice RadioShack has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time, with the company’s owner immediately closing 200 stores, and considering its options for the remaining 1,300 it owns. At roughly the same time, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) , another electronics retailer, has turned the corner in its battle for survival. Its earnings per share (EPS) rose dramatically, climbing from $2.30 in fiscal 2016 to $3.74 in the chain’s fiscal 2017. In addition, its stock, which is currently trading around $45, has more than tripled since bottoming out in late 2012. That was enough for Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly to literally declare the company’s turnaround efforts over. „Since the introduction of Renew Blue in November 2012, we have improved the operating performance of the business dramatically,” he said in the Q4 earnings release in early March. „We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and launch our strategy for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.” Those comments were released a week before RadioShack once again sought bankruptcy protection, raising the question as to why one electronics chain has succeeded while the other has failed. It’s not a simple answer, as you will see below that both chains made many of the same moves. Best Buy has come back from the brink. Image source: Best Buy. What did Best Buy do? Launched in 2012, Renew Blue was a road map to help Best Buy turn around its fortunes. At the time the plan was introduced, Best Buy was, like RadioShack, on the list of companies many expected to not survive, largely due to the internet and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) specifically. Its turnaround began because the company systematically attacked its weaknesses while building on its strengths. One key weakness was the fact that consumers did not see Best Buy as offering attractive prices. In a report the company shared in its Renew Blue presentation deck [opens in PDF], only 23% of consumers perceived Best Buy as having lower prices than its rivals while 56% of Amazon customers saw the online retailer that way and 71% of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) customers believed it had the lowest prices. Best Buy aggressively addressed that by offering a price match program that let people pay the same price they would at top online competitors and „local retailers,” a category that includes Wal-Mart. That one move immediately removed the incentive for showrooming, that is, the practice of doing your research on a product at Best Buy but buying online or from another retailer. In addition to that major move, Best Buy did a number of things: It launched an internal program to lower costs through what Joly described as „disciplined promotional strategy, continued optimization of merchandise margins and strong expense management.” Those efforts targeted $400 million in potential annual savings by 2018, about half of which it has already delivered. The company built on the idea of its stores as destination shopping by adding store-within-a-store concepts from major partners including Apple , Samsung , Microsoft , and Sony . Best Buy increased focus on its Geek Squad service, a differentiator from other sellers. The chain also devoted resources to improving its digital shopping experience including moving to one-click checkout and offering more items (some that are not in its stores) through its website. Taken on its own, any one of these moves would probably have not been enough, but made together they left Best Buy with price-competitive stores that consumers had more reason to visit and a robust, easy-to-use digital presence. Where did RadioShack drop the ball? As a private company it’s hard to see exactly what the second iteration of RadioShack did differently than the previous publicly traded version. The company did partner with Sprint (NYSE: S) on some locations, but the wireless carrier (which also has a presence at Best Buy) may not have been the customer draw that Best Buy’s store-within-a-store partners proved to be. In fact, in its bankruptcy filing, RadioShack cited „the surprisingly poor performance of mobility sales,” i.e. Sprint, as a reason for it having to file, USA Today reported. The company did not price match and its website, while it got some attention, was not made a priority in the way Best Buy’s was. RadioShack also failed to articulate any clear reason for people to visit its stores aside from its long-standing function as a nearby option when you’re missing cables or batteries and having them now trumps price in your mind. However, CEO Dene Rogers did share some info in the company’s press release on the bankruptcy that shed some light on the steps it did take. „In 2016, we reduced operating expenses by 23%, while at the same time saw gross profit dollars increase 8%,” he said. „Over the same time, we integrated FedEx pickup/drop-off into 140 RadioShack locations, delivered to customers over 700,000 Hulu login pins and sold more than a million RadioShack private brand headphones and speakers delivering high quality, value-based audio products to consumers across the country.” Maybe RadioShack had no chance RadioShack management made some of the same moves that Best Buy did, yet it still failed. Some of that may be because it bet too heavily on Sprint as a partner. In addition, doing nothing to address consumer expectations on pricing certainly sent some business to Amazon, Wal-Mart, and even Best Buy. In the end, though, RadioShack may have been doomed by the fact that small, limited-selection stores are not the draw they once were now that people can simply go online and get nearly anything they need with two-day delivery. With the average RadioShack being roughly 2,400 square feet, it simply can’t compete with destination chains like Best Buy that are 10 to 15 times larger on average. In its heyday, RadioShack succeeded because its many locations made it convenient for customers and it sold products that were interesting to look at, with many not being offered elsewhere. Add in being a source for things like blank cassettes, VHS tapes, and other accessories, the company filled a niche that does not exist any more. RadioShack has failed while Best Buy lives on to continue battling Amazon, because it may have outlived its usefulness without finding a new reason for being. Perhaps there was a pivot that could have saved the retailer (and maybe Blockbuster would still exist if it had become a chain of liquor store/vape shops) but non-extreme measures were always likely to end in this result. 10 stocks we like better than Best Buy When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Best Buy wasn’t one of them!

The autopsy released on Friday showed that Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach. David HarrisContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach, her autopsy released Friday showed. Clayton was killed Jan. 9 while confronting a murder suspect in a Wal-Mart parking lot. The autopsy confirmed much of what was previously released. One shot entered her neck at a downward angle, suggesting that she was on the ground when she was hit. The bullet partially exited her left upper back, according to the autopsy. Police previously said this was the fatal shot, although the autopsy did not specify. She also was shot in the lower stomach, buttocks and thigh. Clayton, 42, suffered cuts and bruises on her face. She did not have any alcohol or drugs in her system. Police say she was at the Wal-Mart on Princeton Street and John Young Parkway when someone came up to her and said they had spotted Markeith Loyd, who was wanted on murder charges in the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. When she confronted the 41-year-old Loyd, he opened fire, striking her in the thigh. She returned fire and hit him in the chest, but he was protected by a bulletproof vest. According to police, Loyd continued shooting even after Clayton fell to the ground. Clayton’s killing set off a massive manhunt for Loyd. It ended nine days later when he was arrested at an abandoned house. He’s charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Clayton and Dixon, and faces a slew of other charges, including shooting at an Orange County deputy. Loyd is being held without bond at the Orange County Jail. dharris@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5471 or @DavidHarrisOS Caption Seminole High School student shot A student was shot outside Seminole High School in Sanford.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. So this is the fantasy football poll. This football podcast with Jim Hackett and presented by Dre. Clark Chrysler. Dodge Ram. Oh my friend WEEI. Hackett he did some of his football guys who WCI. A pack in heat like to welcome you with a hearty hello I hit ticket you're here on an ally. Loral is the outlook outlook our audience and my good friend Pete Davidson Ed Johnson write about him. Yeah men were back with that. You you can have got ten it is so. But it's good idea it's mostly you know I mean you know and it's got to get gig gig going again this is the right stimulus. It is. I think actually last week in the week but item I was I was really sick and become GAAP and I've been sick guy this year what's up with that. But definitely on a case today and it was it was woods you know. And interest income by but come on in the launch of free agency which is there a whirlwind I mean you know. I think back to a couple of years ago when I think it shows how much people want to not pay attention to politics. Yeah it does does that thirst out that regular diet of poverty agency I can just packaged pay attention to this export yeah ours on this screen. Wal-Mart is now dealing a lot of people but dumb. You know I remember a couple of years ago. When they didn't have a collective bargaining agreement and I forgot like just how crazy can get the first couple days in our own beloved patriots yelling dove and faster than usual for them. With Stephon Gilmore in the made the trade. The pick up Dwayne Allen which is it Justine has a lot of implications but all on the league big names flying around and in the rumor sell. What do people do is we'll get into what has happened and what the impact of Tennessee's perspective is in what is rumored to happen a little bit who's still dangling out there where they might land. And what's gonna disagree you're you come mined spots in terms of the rocks because that is a special. Talent and skill that you provided that a lot of people kind of I don't know I don't act analysts say you know put in time there's an a for the time in that you do. Scott how well listen I mean yeah watching hours and films. You know of games that already taken place laborious some people don't like that before. I actually like its ethnic you know I don't mind it Tom. But back to the free agency thing what wanna you let's go through let's go through your list well the first and a legacy audio yeah I'm just you know let's let's throw. The let's throw the locals a little meet here with you between Allen the renowned trainer I think is is now. I'm not surprised by it because I didn't think I don't think that it was gonna come back from the start is a one year players did a great job it's something the patriots like to do. In Erie is ideally concern for me is you know long term solution that tide and Crocker three back surgeries and renounce what were the most durable player but I like an allotment sensitive. Yeah well to Leo it's good football player I think that. Amuse you I've been saying that on this broadcast for years adopted a flip just because he signed with the pace. It's columns attic he just got a good football player. On similar to ban it in man he eased equal parts receiver. Blocker and be in line can't plea attached to I don't know if he's quite his first house and maybe. I don't think he's as good as Martellus Bennett I think that is. Speaker battered and yes they're really good in general and on but but definitely in the seemed. You know basic Spain. For the pages in terms of why did you guys can be you'd be tighter so if you got if you got Toledo and crock of pulling them week. Okayed the tightest spot com and I'm just gonna throw this out there I think Alan. So I mean was. Right or wrong but I think it's that odd. Twos this rookie free this rookie tight market yeah I think. We're gonna get to the rookies second after this podcasts but I think. The patriots seat the rookie class I think they want piece of it I agree and I think two in Allen is away they don't have to. Draft these rookies just throw him into the fire com. So it would not shock to patriots to a guy like. And I. Well the ethnic model and a dollar million I don't know with the trade him again were high rise that's exactly say from. You know right now we don't know exactly where the teachers are going to be in the draft. But it almost doesn't matter they're going to be tight ends worthy of taking. In the first meet firstly first second late second you know that top. Six tight ends these are good the. While the girls that did all the all the that the three NFL five for sure yet the pre NFL free agents the the first shot from the pundits for the draft advocate from Miami in a lot of those slow mock drafts come into New England that makes sense but. It's got to move lag I don't see them the guy that I first at 32 I just don't. I mean I. Joke to a degree the patriots accuracy he would he would the you know the guy who could take over for Crockett Crockett is forced to beaten. You know it's literally yeah it's back injuries. An indication of things that. You know I. It's Weir's so people are out front and god out. He's done back injuries just to be it's just one more injury for growth. Yeah I expect it to just expect it to be gone by re one related GAAP umps are well I mean you have to think about shut down early as got a long offseason and it's just another year with crock having surgery in its sound to be like the Super Bowl bid a month later later. Yeah bomb but kudos but. Anyways it. In joke who could be a guy who could be your primary tight end in line detached either way but the guy who relief. Intrigues me for the teachers got Mississippi editing it and because he could be that guy please on the field with Croat. In a Aaron Hernandez role he could be Eric Hernandez. About the murdering but block yeah walking walking the streets were afraid the unafraid of an impending arrest for. Without a three hots and a cut yet if you had no but I mean he's air Hernandez. Better who he's faster than there Hernandez. He's run better routes well there's let me Ingram England could easily. Just play wide receiver and hear good things about him in another capacity and who's pretty good it's based blockers or any key it. Are terrified to think that featured office looked like truck ASCII avenue Ingraham and settlement on the other that's just terrifying array. Weaponry but if you add Brandon coupe sedan next. I don't believe in coast of the pitchers I think it higher. The F. It doesn't make sense to me well that's a thing you know let's talk about this a little bit okay. I look corruption yet and I know you hate the rumor mill it drives me crazy as well. I think a rumor mill when it's just the needs of rumors that are clearly coming from marginal sources just to get that you know I. Call click update the clay court yes yet but I'm very sickly but yet we'll just put but he hasn't adjusting threats and throw this out idling wasting time I don't happen but I agree with it. So listen. You know in terms of those three names that have come. To mind with the agents have been political rumor out there cooks. These John Jackson Justin hunter this morning all of a bomb under you already Ares free again. But all of the deep threats in that's usually it's way off the patriots playbook in terms of their scope so. Wandering accidents seniority have hope in yeah you know developing as well yeah but I'm wondering if this. Might be a sea change with they look to the future with one Jimmy or apple. Who throws a beautiful long ball as we've talked about unions in nice touch on I just wonder you know. If it's it if it's building towards that. A couple of years out should they be in a position to keep pump and that's a whole little rabbit hole that we are down it's. So tired of our I don't know it mean I. I mean to meet you look at Malcolm Mitchell is good young players you know you look at Hoch in east that he's not going to be. He's not going anywhere any time soon you got cattlemen and they've got. Receivers. They could use some youth at the slot I think human element and in the delegate a lot there. Yeah I mean yes but I mean Britney cooks. Isn't youth at the slot I mean as you come tonight right wing but I'm mullet but he's hiding guy's gonna need to be paid and paid soon right. So you know I just don't see how he fits into the patriot paradigm not to mention. And again this has come out so would really like spurning coached by a com. We've seen receivers were good receivers committed struggle with the patriot system Aaliyah as these were guys that the patriots brought it needed to show up you know patrons thought they would work and then once they got them in the room. They were swift and the uptake to run the system right so I don't see them like rolling the dice in a big way with a guy like cokes we really have to pay a lot. I I think the patriots in my opinion are much more likely to use that. Pick capital. On a guy like. At a bankrupt you know you know fits the picture parent patriots like guys who do everything you know who who blocked. Cook's problem now it does a lot of scuttlebutt about how Belichick really likes them when they did the joint practices in this and that tells her into kicking the tires he would they can do it's just I just wanted to let. I'm not saying cooks would be a fun toy have always I'm I'm just I'm just saying that it doesn't. I just don't. I just don't see it making sense for them if they have all these these assets to bring him in it lesser gonna do something radical like. Get rid of adult and there's something new you know it's it's will they be idol if he can he thinks he can eakins. These personal which is a huge you know things you know animals Sloc anybody as we talked about before what amounted to be successful. Easily decided yeah yeah maybe see what it's that the patriots are Smart team and embarrassment of riches that the skill position just is their style yeah I agree. So you're talking about is it's just it's it's out of character for them you know so well is out of character if they do it. True yeah I again and rumors rights and it certainly and it goes circling buzzards over corpse right now yeah I mean to me from the patriots. I'm thinking much more about making sure Tom Brady gets hit as little as possible yet. I'm not worried about him heading higher and weaponry I'm worried about him being. Free of bruises yup the future if you know I mean the pictures or you have more than enough. Weaponry help they just won the Super Bowl out Gradkowski. Rice so you know it's a means. I I'm I'm circling the wagons around pretty making sure that he's in one piece because they've already proven they don't. They don't need. Actually there and at must that it even with the super couple announced that it cryptic occasion closeness and you don't say I do. Thanks anyway so. Out of the pats I think it's it's a good solid move for the past typical. You know low investment level. Probably he's probably one your player too. And and you don't oil Jack oil stays in Indianapolis and he loves. Viable tight end fantasy yeah I think I think. You can see Andrew Luck lean on him that that that now they need to do over reason you had a good deal last year lost you for a rebound I think they're tourists. You know what yeah yeah it's like you have a guy like. Allen around for years can't stay healthy I think eventually just like you know it. Yeah I was just you know we can for two in our pocket asylum or her yet. And you know Doyle did decent jobs and it got swoop yes are now. And it and obviously that it's a team expelled out of three receivers yet mixed since the big passing on the institute for AD right now is who's going to be starting running back they can echo with quart the year of the economy beat qualities. You know big time running backs slide around these guys in the draft. Yeah I know we've got some running backs to get to there are guys hanging out there you know your only Arab blunt wanna bump. And down on another go in that direction but you know they they were very very light last points indoors doesn't seem yeah I know he's gonna be in the frozen tundra. And dom but they went they were very light heading into the year behind gore. And you know I eat data never Goodyear sells you know I think that's of the that they have to address amongst other things offense minus caramel stuff lock was there like not like Jim Clark in 1972. And they need to get Laporte yeah I mean people and collect the unpopular take a minute you hear people have given up on Philip Schiller said he's a bus. You look he did deep threat on a team that can't protect the quarterback you know. So you know that's gonna mean low volume relative to what he would have if they could protect you quarterbacks are I wouldn't write. Doorsteps of the fastest yet com. You know let's see what happens if they can actually protect the quarterback and and you know they finally have some new blood there and media personnel before missiles would have. Much needed indeed it is a weird year for India last year it and I've said this a million times in our conversations you know. On the air in the podcasts in just regular conversations and all starts at the line. Yeah everything and he didn't now in yields in me and a lot was made to look like. As everybody says what are what are the line it all starts at the line and then we get into the offseason everybody let's talk about which teams he skill players. I mean the the the general emphasis on skill players instead of the offensive line it is. It's silly yup just in general there's so many teams that should be addressing a line but all the fans and pundits talk about which receiver a running back. We surprised to see mingled they'll leave the jets. Speaking in line no bagels and operated for a couple of years to say the truth. Amidst a good player yeah it not not not some monsters died. Now granted the jets are much worse when he doesn't play right but I don't receive that mangled is not a dog was a good chat or conduct. The jets are the worst team the football. You know and and by choice faced. It as bad as people think re displayed last year was as bad as people think. But the money is ridiculous. Angle the money doesn't line up with the production the comments of the gestures. You know they're they're cut the players that they don't Brandon Marshall in and we're gonna get a second. They just do the right thing. The thing that people's needs are members of the reason they're now doing the right things because they spent the last two years to the role in the wrong things yeah absolutely you know and I you know a lot of people roll it up on me because I was so rough on Fitzpatrick. You know all you out there listening you know feel for you. August and whose terrible last year awful. Take a tick the six interception game out he was still awful it was terrible leader before now it's just the statistics told the story that he was good pitchers that matters he beat up on a lot of European defense and a now. And he had unbelievably good healthy receivers he had Decker Brandon Marshall both having really good see decorated tree area. Yeah Marshall at one of his better years as well right. Coming up the dog let's talk about him now in India across the street now with the giants. Fizzled a lot of receiver movement now son Jeffrey signs that the Eagles Brandon Marshall goes the giants renewed vision. These John Jackson leaves the Redskins go to the bus go all I want yet. So I'll move lets its it that's it Marshal a captain is yeah I mean marshall's value I think. If team goes up. A little bit vs jets or maybe it's his floor goes up babies ceiling comes down a little bit not to attack Libya and number one target now. But he is going to feast. Our number two court eaten. You know I don't know backwards obviously can draw. The best quarter most of the time it lest their polling team for everybody stays holed up. And at the giants can choose the matches themselves. But yet Brandon marshall's views he softer covers and he seen. Really at any time in his career. Steve for his rookie year yeah so. You know it's definitely a good thing for Marshall on Eli Manning. Gets opponents. Are flat on the interwebs and in general for last year I don't think you played in yours bat as a lot of people claim the and he gets he gets a bad picks at times no doubt. But you know listen that's what happens when your quarterback is under fire constantly yeah of protection airline was terrible from the stat criminal and he did end up taking some chances that he normally would take. I think if they protective. Manning is a candidate for a huge bounce back candidates on the Marshall Marshall two men and an off year last you to his court martialed liberals for the most part last year were. Maybe he was hurt a lot last year so. You know that's a factor yup you his games he played hurt yet an accord ended quarterbacks that just can get on the ball you know in in you know. Period and category well yeah I mean yes that's definitely factor too although you know Fitzpatrick did pepper targets most of the time but. The targets were turning interceptions and bring in my that's just terrible last year yeah it's terrible it's a good move for Marshall leaving in good move for the jets get rid of yeah. Let's move over to. The Eagles in the same division now Sean you know that's that's a that's a big coup for them. They've been building short term deal yeah I am they they needed that they needed. Outside presence and also picked up Torrey Smith yeah. Who I colonel I'd still like touch with a ten foot pole. Keys I tried I tried or some people outsource its last year but it's such a value it's just not that good. He's deep threat he's very fast athletic player but he does not get in and out of breaks he's not it was routes. He was perfect for Flacco as long touchdown and 100 catches. He's he's horses for courses kind of player but I'm telling you right now and again here's another really popular take. Don't know so that was a guy who's overdraft should have been a first peck but I did have a second grade. And you know I think act orchid easily finally get its act together and plan Smith at some point this year you know looking into it Matthews now show on connected open arsenal excellent car. Listen with the ouster thing out so value this go up he's always been about the health he's going to be Garrett. And the guy who has a sea change years way it's the way it's now has enough weapons to you big time fantasy producer which shocked if he was yeah. He's definitely going to be outline. Value QB list this year I doubt about it and it dynasty leagues he's our guy. It was a pretty solid future but it. For for dynasty valuation sport remember Al shall decide what your deal. So that is an impact on temperature. Well yes awaits might not have Al shortlist is currently just you know what your bit for. But I'd I'd definitely fine without Sharon I am a believer in cars that way it's. So a little less often for the most spot last year incidents the most party look like a rookie slipped a little bits of times but forgot profits profits or it was banged up a lot of the year they're the best offensive lineman was attended suspension Johnson most of the year yet. So I think things get better for the future I would agree and real good. Canada's team to bounce back while the move. And in the NFC east so let's let's go to Washington all right so. They lost the two best receivers a lot of what an absolute dumpster fire unbelievable who it was cousins still. Well. I don't know while they will eventually calm but. I listen I don't know what is going on with Scott McLaughlin. Maybe some of the rumors are true. But you know a couple things for the redskins' first of all you do it this guy was about Rodman yeah it's not like oh this country X. Frederick and his whole career it's always been a thing yeah. And then they allow rumors that I mean Chris Cooley starting those rumors that is some weeks you gonna keep that stuff inside the registry keys you'd better be right sense yeah like yeah. On line to get this is not a guy whoever set on I don't drink anymore. This guy never stopped drinking Ricoh opening clear about that as the got a phone for years it's an amazing. Judge of talent. And it's carried out Smart NFL team right now to the jets had half a clue and they. Don't have a tenth of it won't it won't happen but at the jets were Smart they would give this guy GM money to be the director of player personnel to work under the Jia I just paint GM money he's African Gooden from. But they want but some Smart team will bring this guy and say look. Let's get you out of the public glare which is what you do which you do well we pay you handsomely. In the ops guys. You know under your gonna be our director player personally you can scout who you what when you watched Arenas good information players of the super roster. And it literally pay you like as much energy. Just don't give them. You know the responsibilities that you take that office platelet and do what he does well protect Wimbledon title and his I don't I don't singing needs to be hidden maybe he does maybe he doesn't but. You know. It's it's amazing how. Organizations turn quickly people like this guy and there's no the Redskins have absolutely no justifiable reason to act surprised. You know if this guy showed up a little bit off flipped in yet if I'll. That's one of the problems with a lot of these you know big companies you know we'd like the way this guy does his job even though we screwed that. And that's no way to win. Yeah don't you get you gave the most study personal dislike hopefully this isn't even wrong is driving intoxicated yes you know is he abusing his wife first answer you know is doing something really bad okay figure out something yet that's. You know he's a little bit. Weird or whatever who cares it's jobs to pick players since he's come since that guys over the Redskins. Yeah I was stated given a team on the rise for two years and now they wake up today with a disenfranchised quarterback. No. PR appearance on unprintable those guys or regional debt. But that's behind the other manager Josh docs and Indian Jamison Crocker who's a jag now I pump out there. So you took a team that was on the rise of the emerging quarterback who really took a big step last year. And I got you know to go on and you know a quarterback who's likely in my mind and some. Well they've got. You know group really better because of personnel experts now it's been along time he's not so they just killed their goaltenders couples out there yet and the giants in the Eagles is just discussed got better so. The law and then at Dallas. So in it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Well you know stance either via the only thing about this Snyder's he doesn't New York. He really should be perfectly simple jets beat you with the profited so well there is on the jets and now he's just like told in the all odds. Completely lost its anyway let's let's move on a couple yeah couple couple other receivers don't get too before we kind of flip it to rookies is you know Kenny stills resigned. If a fantasy owners that I Kenny stills is tough got to predict. He can get you know touchdowns in ways beat in and you go silent but into the year he did just. He did feature a little bit more significantly more listened they went out of their way to get him back they offered him play that your team money. Com. So. To me actions speak Latin absence deals a guy. I think his you know. Probably good solid fourth receiver for your fantasy team up again he's he's going to be in a lineup he's a flex for sure. And the other guy that signed the rams five years 39 million for rob would now. That's a big ticket but what is the guy you've always liked and we talked about a lot when it in my rookie. Who we talk about Robert Woods. Did you just say he signed with the 49ers and the rams are okay literature books are yeah the rams it's our amber you went behind you hear that. But so it was it a money for it was five years 39 million but a guy who has it's. Here are the structure that deal at me dot. A lot of these deals you hear the element but then the practicality of cut to be the classic NFL in the guaranteed contract it is yes fifteen billion there and the like this it is. More than he should have gotten no question. But but but behind a guy that you know united talked about for a few years ago you came out Indies a bit a little bit. I like Robert Woods yet but his NFL performance to date. Not much that doesn't merit that kind of money but you know he's a young players 24 years old so yeah go go young quarterback to with off this saluted. Something to watch but night not and I was still. And the thing with some of these contracts people have to realize calm you and I have to realize that these teams have so much money to capital so much on these teams are. They're just looking for ways to spend this money yet. It did the other part of it with the with the Brodeur saw a deal was just like wow. When he's on the back in and he this year last year didn't you see the contract. Five years 47 and a half million lately you know now while it's and it's it's his he's over thirty but his stick it. I think his 2017. Salaries seventeen millions who've. You know it just shows replace a little bit of funny money this year some of these teams so the 49ers haven't they don't obviously. Don't think he's seventeen billion dollar player. But the front loading deal because what they don't wanna dues to budget deals this year that it interact and definitely their right mind right so they paid arson and a bunch of big money this year. And he's a guy who can help them install the system. Because he's been remember his ship which. Was the Redskins right. That there. They're essentially operating port ship which she has a really big on the system and having guys who knows the system look what they've already done it brought it ought Robson and our son goes all the way action against the risk yet. At Shanahan brought that bought brought altered crops and delta Atlanta first so robs a follow up to Atlanta and its efforts systems so they obviously put on a premium on guys who. They don't have to teach you know Parcells thing you know coach the coaches yup. And you know they don't wanna they would get as many players don't need to be coached for the system as possible so they concentrate on the guys who knew. Anchors on the veteran who can. You know bring young receivers law. So it's it it makes sense for them but the I think. Don't judge the first your money to partially it's that they stagger the contract for Kia. The immediate quarterback community is just picked up Bryant or color you know it's like a deal on Foreman. Corners underrated he's decent. I like I saw a news and not know is not sort of solution by any stretch and I I think. That was a move to cover them mr. cousins that fell through which it looks like it has. But you don't date date paid where contractor started to have two buddies got back money. You can get because it. Yet they wanted on this compact on DeSean Jackson is like you know let's talk about where he ended. She was Winston Winston's a happy guy I'm thinking with Mike back indecent acts and I didn't realize we talked about it's always talked about what can the exile. Of Washington community yes that's a great signing for the Bucs move it's a big sign for them and that that's. That really that that's a good offense anyway. It's growing together and they just and a big and Lewis if. It was an office that needed some pieces for sure now they got one you know offices. And I think if there are definitely hurt some rumblings for some of the numbers people. You know that this can hurt after this disease doctors are crazy amount of targets but you know Hughes getting to maybe toward yet. He's becoming inefficient because teams know where it's going. I think TV coach or he loses three or four target two week I think it doesn't hurt his yards and does touchdowns at all I agree I do to big play guy he's like it is a target on. So to speak. Any game flow can determine happen I agree with you don't think this hurts Evans of justice to be this this this pull this this. Makes teams play more flat beat you til til the field Evans who they were last year. And now after should be army and he should be more efficient player I think and Sheila Jackson. Yeah its can make big plays like you know is does as low as he stays healthy that's the the tough thing for Tampa you know what it is due to the shuttle is escapes the yeah I think they still probably need one more receiver then vote. Yeah let's get to the rumor mills a little bit in this and nibbles. On itself if it just while we're still want I think Jackson's value hold steady at me because uncle. Going to choose I would think so I can see the public I mean is fairly valuable actually play obvious to be giving you hit on the head he's a you know you can count on him to miss three or four games. But he gives you as a fantasy owners to play him right you time it right in matchup trying to get ideas for sure audacity softy but he's he's a smallish player that's going. He's willing to take hits and yet and then his Adidas which react well. But yeah I'd get to credits that's a good football he played real good football Washington he did he competed. I would just touch on Terrelle Pryor a little bit who. He had a break out last year but some he's got a lot of doubles and it just is who he goes because he's a guy who is a very unique skill set. But basically did it without a quarterback all you want a few incidents and a good spot that's a real that you could be something specialized. You know equipment quarterbacks I don't know RG three games rules tough confidence in the they were OK I mean but yeah I do understand is it yes yes yes but I mean I you know. He. The quarterback's hurt him but the volume was ridiculous. Side it wasn't about this situation for right you know he's going to a conventional office for you have to deal probably lower targets. That's I think it I think it probably balances out. My outs Torre is so. What serial Lance and hope hopefully goes to a place where the targets are going to be there and he's got to QB but yet he played Terrelle Pryor probably didn't get enough pop last year. For how well please. Yet and he was using monster statistically played well good good football and it is a monster a real sense of if you watch the on the field is making an impact of the browns for sure you know do one and fifteen but he was it he was he was an impact player fresher. No doubt about that says yes he's definitely guy's gonna drop somewhere it's going to be big deal. But that back to the guys who have some. Right Taylor renegotiating statement yeah bills that's significant I think it's good for Tyrod. Obviously it's good for city Watkins. Peters out their tail I actually have always liked and it seemed with him and it is pretty good player although I'm on neither side I mean he definitely needs. To get better in terms of pocket presence of times. He forces and throws. But he frozen ice ball the resident steep fall on you know athletic meet please his feet and editing what he did last year he did without Watkins for most of the season. And a lot of the other receivers are marginal or hurt so yeah he's got to get to your credit for last year. There migrant he's the guy I like and I think they made it as a Smart move by the oath before we got into free agency to at the end of the year. There was a lot of I think it's because of Rex you know and it. Everyone knew Rex is gonna goal and that you know he kind of was older collateral damage but a player like so enacted they can build around him that they do the right stuff so. He's on he's he is signed and in buffalo to stay for lots of. Actually got such for a second curse on going to be fantasy Bible which. By the way its product to pursue your targets in. You know it'll be it'll be ugly production because he's not released suited to play against quarterbacks we can display of mr. bud. I think due to the body shall be there you're sneaky good last year since it was in the year I played really good last year yet he's he's half. He'd he'd be good patriots Belichick would love tough guy yeah yeah really goes out there puts itself on line or it would take to catch. Good football player gets the drop sees some times it's only about guns and fight. It says that a bomb but. The fifth. That's your take yeah I had our estimates around prior to put backs patrol prior for a second yeah Kenny Britt saluted his spot on the nose. I think that. Probably means Pryor can go back to the rules that nothing much percent but. I think that closed in to Cleveland. And Brit because. An interest in player depending. What happens QB situation at the rock below its echo there. Britain can be pretty target field but that's just your Circuit Court called it a little bit of resurgence last year wasn't Brit. Brigadier very similar Pryor's right news number of players team that was always again. Easy not easy not to see but he was doing it yeah I got that would surprise you in in the league mostly I play and he was never available. But you you know a guy it's gone like to he's doing it ever comes free the demise of the. That's a solid third procedure yeah this year. And and closing out the player movement offs Weiler. Cholera while. Not that he ever play. What year deal an idea that is an NBA trade in the NFL yeah that's exactly analyst cap and trade yeah you know the I don't know exactly how they got away with it. I guess the key participate. Across while the people are taking it like the NFL should be able to justice who spiral was re entry well. He really was. And now you know I don't know Cleveland has to do in terms of like holes like how long needles before. Which is four. How that not a week. Like works right. Like can watch it for 45 minutes it is content to fit that adds depth and we thought he'd be good or at least an audience. I thought that film is right I'm not sure how much suspend reality have to go through the ops while our. For the deal not deterred or whatever you have I don't see why anybody should have a problem history. I really don't you know it's locked the browser positions that contract. You know so they had an epic four to I'd probably. Yeah probably that to me it's just it's it's it's about what happens next. You know so in Houston is you Romo was a likely suitor right in Cleveland is grapples still in the mix it's about it's it's an assessment released rules. I know but that's that's kind of what's I think it's gonna act and the well is I don't know I'd like like I. Jerry Jones is sort of the Donald Trump in the NFL before you go before a good line of before you go go there but. One of saying about the Oslo deal from my perspective is to me it's about the next she was that a flaw it's not so much about. What's there what isn't DOS allow arm whenever he was terrible last year I think they did terrible job leading in and getting his had ruined. In and how much is there anyway but homage to cement which she was in the fall next to that. What right sort of saying is. I think Dallas was OK with the idea of letting Romo go until it became 100%. Clear. That was it but it goes about to sign with the other team attacks ya now look to use zone I think you are sort of saying Jerry Jones suit going yeah we want to do what's right for Tony until he realized that Tony's estate taxes and maybe. Go to a team can win a title wins. And now all of a sudden. Jerry doesn't like it is much. Sought. I mean I'd like beat holy off on this but. I mean haven't released yet yeah so it's still early days and it feels like it's like in free agency for three weeks of all the transactions that happened. Right by the Dallas say we ought to do the right thing by toady but notes are they can all suddenly want compensation from the Texans maybe certain he can get to Denver that's another one due to view of those team I think go to Denver horrible for. Why because he'll he will last two weeks by the office of that's 22 and half of Denver I have absolutely no interest Tony Romo and I thought that right now I can't protect him. It's just don't do it don't waste capital for. If it doesn't make sense to me I don't think he lasts Aries yes shall be ability. To hold up to a lot of contact and you know. The Texans can sit there and run they've got great receivers and they've got a good up front line of defense. They don't have to expose rowboat who wins and I think if you perfect spot for. They get tight and there are those that you know you can musical safety net. It Denver the attraction the appeal would be. I think if they felt they could protect them then they're right back in the in the mix of things I think that's but they have to commit at the I. I get a they've got receivers get those guys the law and I don't think. That. Wilson outsiders and here's what sleeper would be funny Cutler went back to Denver. Who understood that would have cut was going to be wearing green. She knows what if that. But if not but he might play yeah that I did you talk about a guy who knows how to play by the craft line Somalia it's a Cutler. But that that. That's Sherwood Beatrice the entire thing right it won't happen. Well let's Cutler go back to a place Cory receivers. Have at some level if you're caught you're definitely advocate jets. Cutler the jets I mean everybody's talking about it like it's a plea I mean if your cheek Cutler. You go jets. I don't care that he would please please don't have to back up some. It is amidst the ultimate feat in cushion you know I don't know I'd be out. But that's could be the jets. To be made it look like they're making every effort to be losing team which has the right thing to do and that's what they're doing. They they have the potential to be winning excellent and I limit it was their guy I mean. As a guy who knows he'll weigh in August Cutler sort of from the job perspective although other jets I'd much work it just. Draft are located at the kids compete yet lose. But. Analysts say CO plays out he went the last thing on the docket if they can shoot some more assailants its position in the rookies of the throat let's talk about let's talk about Clinton. It's uninteresting to the bears that was a guy and I'm might be me along along with Agilent. Mark this week in the massive yet so. That the killed you know. What does not expect it if uncle and weaknesses like I'd get that south aloft for. But. You know it's not as bad as it is a camera merits of the popular James White but. Generally. You know what Jack reminds him of what he'll lumbered not use high traffic you know have to get healthy and it. You know in the sense. You look at tight so. And Alec Wheaton united tackling talent and it's not exciting stuff elected got two or Howard who's an exciting he'll players rookie year. If white can she ought to be the player but he thought it was going to be ever there. He continued doing what he did last year. And escalated can be the players that he was when he was starting games for Tampa. Is that as people think I don't at a good price. If it might not be as bad as people think it added if you plated two QB the U Bible. Well that yes that's a good point he can put the beat you put the points out he doesn't have elongated neck syndrome which is you know it's a death nail for quarterbacks here I said at a tree yesterday Acco you know after watching the animals you know. It's a political Greta I Josh. I'm glad it is running away from the president it's note there's no doubt about that he's against now is eyes and has not right now it's not. He's not tiger but but but you know shrapnel for a feast and I mean he he's so he definitely unique problem. As there are nothing alike is quarterbacks but at the scene in this where. I think you can do okay with them but you better protect the Michael and it's not run around and bite you a lot of time you don't want to put the football team culture trouble. Richard droplets or is there a war but Jimmy you don't want him getting it he smallish guy he played against small college competition and I got used taking. And national level shots while lucky ticker shot in and he talked about yeah I needed it what I don't want it be too much of that one play. This is something this is something that column. Grapple as coach told me directly at the right places like the NFLs going to be real step up in terms of state that's for the and now so probably needs to bill's body up and needs to get ready for it you know but. He stepped in god need to protect you know what you problem goats of team where is gonna have to run around for a couple seasons like bill alignment. He needs to go to a place where they can protect away. So. On to say if you can get unique problems protections weapons I think he's really. Dealing tournaments in his brand fell who I jogged along rightfully so is terrible year can be used to be actual bounce back. When little went a little bonds that would when he agreement out nearly mute them. He focused so you know it is safe safe safe resigning not a great reasoning but yeah I mean you know what they've they've they've already got a couple of receivers who are obviously yeah stunt that appetite for blowing monster. So. I points Tyler boy probably an inside guy but you know you gotta have I got somewhere star. That's now and you know. Against second third quarters economics vice Nagin is. What's your position so did he would have which the ravens yeah. Significantly there it is and it looks like probably a big part of why it happened in tax suspension. He'll be out for four teams. Leo. You know for me I think everybody's going to be Texans probably Qatar Dubai and yet I think you know. What that is the guy who who becomes that the pass catching back obvious that you're thrilled with but Allen lost the fullback Munich and occupants. And juicy Egypt Jews yet on. The thing about what had everybody's just sort of pants in different numbers I I love would have but yet thirty years old the properties you know it's not. And tell me. So well hold fragile in in time need to talk about is we yeah. He's going it's the leaking companies and nick are. You going to keep before we get into the rooks is Eddie lacy. Who you know lacy agencies and Charles is Maria. I directs Burkett who vital to hold much people are on. But I was of the orchid tree before the years ago. What's yours to got a lot Cilic like a guy on the watch list but yen the skills I sub Smart teams here's expert it seem a bunch of money to place a bomb but yeah it's good to see these guys drop. Oh right now it's it's hard figures don't Wear discovers a long after the one last guys talents. The Celtics go to buffalo but it could signing from Bosnia who would. Because Marcellus feature it's oh. He can help you the way he needed to help you on a weekly basis and tickets are good consistent target for tied tyrants who spent some time. You know everybody including me you know talked about him being eccentric equipped athletes are exceptions he has. During easier doing an imminent but what you saw. A battery of and I think they've just said. That's sports palace yet. It'd be itself which I think is the week ago I was having agreed on what you saw is a guy where witness on the Chinese entities on the team can we give you a good soldier you know feature SaaS from the block for a whole game like would target the props blocks you know some games gets its targets that's fine he did what they asked every week to be good job. Actually hurt business probably about 70% year gasses and he did all that he didn't hurt me he was used literally. Limping in camping throughout the year and I've always been a fan of Marty before David and in news. It was nice to see him do Revis thing better be good guys for your history and capitalist and make some money to his critics yeah. Good player all right so before NFL free agency kicked off on Thursday. Was the Columbine last week and does a lot to talk what you put. Pre combat rankings up on rural bond dot com yeah you know ignited some. Sure I'd argue. Looking at the ratings I just pulled out yeah I mean you guys that you walk through those and ask questions we can do that if you. I I got about what fifteen minutes here and we I definitely hit the receivers but you know this year. The the receivers have at least write one bunch and know exactly that we oh well quarterbacks. Yet can weak weak class quarterback I think quarterbacks are weak I just don't think there's just. There's not an interlocutors. You know there's no. Monster in this quarterback. Let's let's start with the music it's it's it's this is the of the tonight and that's that's the cream of the crop this year right in the titans and in all our board yes you you know I'd go to. The Columbine it if you read what I wrote. Yeah expert. Pretty firm not a good start it's going to be a priority at four of them at my first round for a draft switches all the crazy and three of them definitely remain. With Jordan Buck Rogers sort of out there the periphery. You know being fair urged players now OC. What's at stake about this whole tight end thing with the rookies dynasty leagues it is. Hey it's slow roll position where they generally take a couple years to develop you know. Not a repeal the gronkowski easier or rare problem. As you know. So that creates an extinct for guys who won immediate payoff looks possible. So I don't know what that's gonna do their traps and the other thing is if you legally you can play it tight and or keep lately that's not related premium or completely short pitches. You know how you value that position. Maybe a little different I've played some really big guys these. Titans preview what you get double keeps you are one point five pound purely now listen this is great yes on an odd odd odd to be diving into this thing. I think some of these guys. Art are definitely for for a traffic's rookie draft. You may see as many as. Three of them go to the first culture and the realistic is gonna matter and we're winning end up and you know got a guy like oh some guys it will some guys that won't I don't think it matters a whole lot for our. Obviously we always wanted to quarterback. You know stuff like that. But like for editing room out of Mississippi. Who. Is a receiver spots and I mean he you know. And eighties. 234 parents so you know definitely a small tight and are huge receiver. But this guy runs and he has 44. That's an obscene number that's for a guy his size you know he jumped. Which the surge of 36 inches. You know a point five Russia. 693. Code Easter certain numbers 4632. Pictures there athlete. It's he's a monster and I hate to see him go to teams that use of its tight end right. You gonna get you to stay in the ball he's right in Arlington as a big slot who bounces outside. Like I I I what is different thing to be he's outside vs its side I don't what is different going to be he's in line persisted taxed so you know we'll see how. So for for him I Green Bay comes to mind you guys the second imagining as it's not like teams where. They can get a little funky with him and it was yeah but they have a dedicated sly it and I don't yeah I mean outlook yet obviously because they're routers that decree so. That would be good Atlantic spot. I'd love to see it would seem to see Austin. Or the patriots would be perfect well let's without having it with clean last year right now never happens so well his opportunities and some people. You I would say not on with it in the he's just he's just not very good. You know England ski equipment used to be different speaker as a rookie if he goes to a team. That was to basically utilized him as the receivers it. So. Definitely it was spot depend but he's a monster I mean if if your diaries he gets out of a first round. Trade operate yet it's like. He's a big talent. And the Joker from Miami also big time. I'm not scourge buys forty talent at all first well what's bad for 64 for its. Actually pretty good at these but he was explosive it is jumping subset of three code. To cut cut. 35 and a quarter which arms freaking kidding me apps like entombed in about it that's a goat and its. 64 can chill about building that is a red zone monster pig program to him yet so I the big news. In Jordan Leggett from clips it could have a really great future book odds at Virginia Tech. He's a Levin Paul eleven feet two inches with a crotch law. You couldn't jump up to the top of the dome on the and it's just reflect and a so chimp you got some serious guys in this class. That that the clients deftly outshine. The receive their judgment if you're judging the music group. During the com. By knitting I need any particular people yeah it's pretty rankings on jump on that you either positive negative or just a media scuttlebutt that came out. But I. I gotta be honest the Khobar did not move the needle for me of that guys. On a couple guys who I didn't want as much media should happen to go back and really look at closer lake saint Joe's Chris Dodd would look at. You know those guys definitely are going to be moving up from the comp board. What I need to do now is find out if I can find that on the field. But you know those guys definitely have the size and now they've got the miserables. They've got production the college level I just like the separations off. A lot when you know like I'm on I'll definitely be back under the hood those guys. And I have a lot more film and both players of that that meet the laws. Pollack died Dupree who I always pronounced a lot she Dupree fit fit and not secrets actually you know why. I think he. I think it's 45 to his vertical. It definitely helped him. So he's a guy who could have a future. I think so people will run away a problem for pure art of running backs or hold it is of course X five. Does scare me off him at all our guys as real future. John Ross is a guy to coach and I really really like. Is that he came in dropped to four point 22. Brooke brokers Johnson's record lob it it's funny didn't seem to get him all that much in terms of lovely people are still. You know nicest to speed guy but John Ross great player. You know he could coterie of 44 I sort of the he's great player. That's a program the Washington too it's always thrown the ball well that's them you know good history and he sees his field is really impressive he tracks the ball well he. He catches the ball pretty well he uses body on catches but he's got its work. A big fan of John Ross. We have set our top. 45 receivers stone yet. I can't tell for sure that your borders seem like Corey Davis a lot at western Michigan. There's not a lot of us ought not a lot of things on his film that I don't like. So I don't offer to be getting an accord Davis. But ironically like John Ross the problem is that he sent me. A major knee injury and he's gonna have shoulders are just cancel surgery. Shoulder surgery. And is not an absolute lock to be healthy week one although he projects to be off for week. But I'm on a big fan of John Ross. But not ice the Isaac Bruce potential. That's name for the past that act of receiver. That's a closed with a but the national champs we talked about against the tide and I'm curious. Elect likely yes SA EU go I'm not I am not running away from Mike Williams. And he's not perfect. I think sort of criticisms of him are real terms separation. But good lord he's got serious for good ball skills at you know to eighteenth 63 point five. 3333. Its arms. So this guy's real confidence grow being cooperative group pulled them football. And that's going to be beaten by police produced against consistently. Off competition. So when you're projecting him to go the next level he's at usually gets a lot of guys of leaders and come right so you know as you know you can handle it. Right this is a guy who you know the separation he did get was real and I think you project pretty well the next level so. Excellent and but QB give you some additional Watson any any thoughts about him obviously I RE a lot in college and not sit and fabulous film you know there's things that don't like about him in terms of accuracy. A little bit too mechanical for my liking. His footwork is at times good at times less than good. I've got film to watch the show lots so I'll I'll I would give him. He deserves a complete and thorough vetting yet and I'm not there yet. I don't. The people talking about it at the top draft adults who don't but ups. Maybe well maybe active and I've got hit with a short Kaiser editor David a similar kind of place like the upside. But I think there's still some work to be done it yet same kind of thing with pat holds at a Texas Tech. I like the upside I see what people are seeing in terms of being tough kid really gutsy it makes a really good throws he also makes it scary that zone. As you know he's an advocate I'm halfway through the field. The guy electable so far structure this Carolyn this image of the loser let's let's talk about that he's going to DK throws a good long ball again no that Morris you know out of them big time Barnett. You know les mis. Skis. People are saying here's what six feet tall turns out he's over six to 222 pounds as a so he's you know he's there's enough for him he's got an NFL body. The things that coach and I both noticed is that he locks onto receivers to lose so he's another guy I think who isn't exactly ready. To be in NFL quarterback I don't know if there's that one team ready guys that's class that's. But I do think that's a really nice prospects you know it and now it's of Israelis are sort of like late first round early second round level prospects to meet. Source toxin she writes Alec the last couple years we had Winston married on in the end it got dark there's a lot of markets area business. There's not teams with us not to be. But you know again I've I've got more field these quarterbacks I'm me. A month from now I'd be low one of these guys morals. But. Over to the receivers just for a little bit yeah hour. And I know we got to get those shoes. I still like wants Hillary to Iran a little bit slower than expected. I'm not a fan of Eugene Schmidt Shuster and USC. The right in my life here with one receiver who I don't think it's getting enough love and maybe it's because he's not really a receiver. Its currency and you'll from Ohio State and I'm definitely willing to plot a late first rounder. It occurs I think he's going to be a star but he can't out and talent that's coming out Ohio State the license years and I have a huge biscuit and big time player if they wanna turn into a receiver I think it's at work they'll be some time. But I think he's really one of these guys to. You bring in the system freaking weapons he doesn't have to be running back or receiver can be guide both. Although. Probably the best that produced targeted toward the other yet. Rock acting not enough people are considering how good this team speed on the back. You know we could break formation with and do other things with. You know his team at 196 that's not too small that's Chris Johnson sides let guys like that has made a great career in the NFL and a big impact Neff a few years even you know. I just think if he goes to a team that knows how to coach up. Whatever transition he needs to make I think he will make. It's a younger version of Braxton Miller who in terms of I believe in the player yet but unlike Braxton this kid is in a guy who had multiple Red Shirts yeah idiotic piece. You know easily younger so. Big believer careers and lives state Joseph makes it is a guy ideally it's not even talk about poll African. I mean. What he did it's just horrific news com it would sat me would be if puck popped up and it felt but I don't think it's gonna happen. You know people ought to just decide what you can do. We have these kinds of players. You know whether you wanted shall excellent team that's a GU. The thing I can't tell you is that you don't want him because she's not good he is cute you know he's really good. He's a first round caliber running back he's arguably. The most talented running back in this class. And you know if you could pass him up for moral reasons hey. All the respect in the world Syria but don't think you're not past couple leisure town. Because our delegates who did two backs and not Oklahoma in the draft and the tub at the going has sent a big parents do. Picks and very different players but they're both felt backs. And hero it could be. He's another guy oral once you're egos my hate for to be turned into a Mike Tolbert. Some teams could sub teammate Sasha the united united but I think he can via a full time running back really gatlin. I think he's a multi skilled players your freedoms need to did he block. Very good football player but just. But we needed at the top running backs of I'd like Alvin caught the least bit worried about a scum by numbers they don't matter to me at all and then on top still justice higher caucus I was going and and I don't know if I'd love letter fortnight. But I do think if he goes to a team that was to use him the right way you'll be just fine. We demeanor that. Quality is a big high volume power back yet. You know. You know I I don't think he's a great fit. You know for a team like the saints but the pats. I don't know if you make sense for the past just because the pass I think according use him basically like bullets. And I think disguised more than blunt. You. But I I don't think he fits the patriots because I don't think he's a guy who plays he doesn't play passing situations page with the unions and to fill that role and it's not going to be blown. Over third on the right but I I just before it doesn't make sense to patriot he's and an every down back that they would be using your role as a role player so I just don't see it. But if it seemed does wanna sit there say we're going to be power running team won big back we give the ball to 25 times a game he's that kind of back. I just don't most of the NFL does seem to be going that way enough and did Dallas sort of got their got. Yeah. So you know. If they're a team like the readers. Took him he took great behind that line and let generators or two ago. To a power running scheme I don't know Carolina would be great place. For four minutes ago I don't know if they'll do better Knots Landing spot I think matters for. I'd just we got a guy what does he put him by the front office now. He's not a meat in this kind of mixing help you know yet he needs a little bit of you know. He's he's a build up speed and a guy you need him a little bit of runway. And the door reporting back we have we talked about is speaking of my favorite one. And that's Christian cap. And who I was I'd laugh again he's getting away on get a lot of attention of their from the quote unquote experts united talking about this. It's weird here so people talking about like this just happened to Michael the rest. Running backs are you know their receivers now. You're either talking about this like literally since 2001 yeah assisting five incident yet and McCaffrey is that guy who fits the new paradigm. He can be early down router for union early down routers but he's. His skill set for passing downs it's just a fees. And he's a really good interior wrap. So. I don't know ultimately what kind of volume to handle he certainly not a guy wanna run 25 times a week like four. I mean you know characters to a 22 pounds. But any rate of four for the forty. Jumped 375101. Broad requests. And insert 6573. Killed you and this guy's got a decent hands heroes unbelievably good rhapsody look issues raised by an NFL receiver you know. Select the same thing we said with Tyler Lockett last year. You know work two years ago yet. Holds true I mean wouldn't we read your dad is a guy who knows how to run and look at the plot lines and yet so. I just I'm a big believer McCaffery he stays healthy it is huge impact I think that the idea that he is. You know decoded wisdom seems to be at the top four players are cook Davis. Fortunate. You can't present and Mike Williams for mean McCaffrey's in that top for a discussion. Based on landing spot he'd. I know a lot of times you're critical what the heck is he talking about but. I could see myself taking him as the top player he's a guy have a Green Day and a new green bank is not a lot of Yad and it did no running game last year. There are a lot of police were discouraging because yeah. He's getting everything. He's a little bit small to be a high volume broader apart from that. I just huge fan interest you know huge excellent. I'd go repo what's upcoming road Obama's your week look like in the gas knicks weren't. We're gonna start putting up some scouting reports John Ross is going to be coming up next couple days after that McCaffrey of the next good Obama to point out. Yet and probably the guy after McCafferty and do OJ Howard it but you know we're gonna do that the other. I'm really putting it on assignment the film in the rankings this year really get as many. Guys nailed down correctly as possible sort dimes signature for Napster's music can be good so I don't take too much time away from that to right. Long for scouting reports. But we will do about ten to fifteen of them and we're just gonna try to put some we're gonna try to isolate guys where we sort of feel like. There ATP in the rookie drafts. Is wrong and you'll feel like they're getting enough love we wanna sort of shine a light and guys where we think. Were higher than the consensus. All right very. Michael. Hopefully wood to about 1015 those. Sounds good so will be back at you repeat next Friday and go to looking forcing some of those initial scout reports we appreciate you tune in and 78 are back we are you know post Columbine we are into free agency and you know like the Madras thirty going to get a draft going right now self.

A man is accused of ‘Robbery of a Toddler’ after showing up on Walmart security video in Oklahoma City, appearing to take a $100 bill from a small child while the child’s mother was distracted. “You’ve heard of taking candy from a baby,” Oklahoma City police posted to the department’s Facebook page. Police say the mother had placed a $100 bill on the counter as she talked with an employee at the Walmart Neighborhood Market customer service counter. The child picked up the money and was playing with it when the suspect snatched it from the child’s hands. Police are searching for the suspect, along with two other men seen in the video; they appear to be with the suspect and laugh at what’s going on. Anyone with information on the crime or identities of the suspect and two associates are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 405-235-7300 or leave a tip at okcrimetips.com. 35.467560 -97.516428 Related stories Watch these kids crash their dad’s serious interview on BBC Video shows little girl being blown away in heavy winds College student proves sobriety by juggling during traffic stop Filed in: National/World News Topics: Caught on Camera, Crime Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Heeeeere’s Johnny!

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 10, 2017 at 9:31AM RadioShack has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time, with the company's owner immediately closing 200 stores, and considering its options for the remaining 1,300 it owns. At roughly the same time, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), another electronics retailer, has turned the corner in its battle for survival. Its earnings per share (EPS) rose dramatically, climbing from $2.30 in fiscal 2016 to $3.74 in the chain's fiscal 2017. In addition, its stock, which is currently trading around $45, has more than tripled since bottoming out in late 2012. That was enough for Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly to literally declare the company's turnaround efforts over. "Since the introduction of Renew Blue in November 2012, we have improved the operating performance of the business dramatically," he said in the Q4 earnings release in early March. "We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and launch our strategy for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue." Those comments were released a week before RadioShack once again sought bankruptcy protection, raising the question as to why one electronics chain has succeeded while the other has failed. It's not a simple answer, as you will see below that both chains made many of the same moves. Best Buy has come back from the brink. Image source: Best Buy. What did Best Buy do? Launched in 2012, Renew Blue was a road map to help Best Buy turn around its fortunes. At the time the plan was introduced, Best Buy was, like RadioShack, on the list of companies many expected to not survive, largely due to the internet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) specifically. Its turnaround began because the company systematically attacked its weaknesses while building on its strengths. One key weakness was the fact that consumers did not see Best Buy as offering attractive prices. In a report the company shared in its Renew Blue presentation deck [opens in PDF], only 23% of consumers perceived Best Buy as having lower prices than its rivals while 56% of Amazon customers saw the online retailer that way and 71% of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) customers believed it had the lowest prices. Best Buy aggressively addressed that by offering a price match program that let people pay the same price they would at top online competitors and "local retailers," a category that includes Wal-Mart. That one move immediately removed the incentive for showrooming, that is, the practice of doing your research on a product at Best Buy but buying online or from another retailer. In addition to that major move, Best Buy did a number of things: It launched an internal program to lower costs through what Joly described as "disciplined promotional strategy, continued optimization of merchandise margins and strong expense management." Those efforts targeted $400 million in potential annual savings by 2018, about half of which it has already delivered. The company built on the idea of its stores as destination shopping by adding store-within-a-store concepts from major partners including Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and Sony. Best Buy increased focus on its Geek Squad service, a differentiator from other sellers. The chain also devoted resources to improving its digital shopping experience including moving to one-click checkout and offering more items (some that are not in its stores) through its website. Taken on its own, any one of these moves would probably have not been enough, but made together they left Best Buy with price-competitive stores that consumers had more reason to visit and a robust, easy-to-use digital presence. Where did RadioShack drop the ball? As a private company it's hard to see exactly what the second iteration of RadioShack did differently than the previous publicly traded version. The company did partner with Sprint (NYSE:S) on some locations, but the wireless carrier (which also has a presence at Best Buy) may not have been the customer draw that Best Buy's store-within-a-store partners proved to be. In fact, in its bankruptcy filing, RadioShack cited "the surprisingly poor performance of mobility sales," i.e. Sprint, as a reason for it having to file, USA Today reported. The company did not price match and its website, while it got some attention, was not made a priority in the way Best Buy's was. RadioShack also failed to articulate any clear reason for people to visit its stores aside from its long-standing function as a nearby option when you're missing cables or batteries and having them now trumps price in your mind. However, CEO Dene Rogers did share some info in the company's press release on the bankruptcy that shed some light on the steps it did take. "In 2016, we reduced operating expenses by 23%, while at the same time saw gross profit dollars increase 8%," he said. "Over the same time, we integrated FedEx pickup/drop-off into 140 RadioShack locations, delivered to customers over 700,000 Hulu login pins and sold more than a million RadioShack private brand headphones and speakers delivering high quality, value-based audio products to consumers across the country." Maybe RadioShack had no chance RadioShack management made some of the same moves that Best Buy did, yet it still failed. Some of that may be because it bet too heavily on Sprint as a partner. In addition, doing nothing to address consumer expectations on pricing certainly sent some business to Amazon, Wal-Mart, and even Best Buy. In the end, though, RadioShack may have been doomed by the fact that small, limited-selection stores are not the draw they once were now that people can simply go online and get nearly anything they need with two-day delivery. With the average RadioShack being roughly 2,400 square feet, it simply can't compete with destination chains like Best Buy that are 10 to 15 times larger on average.  In its heyday, RadioShack succeeded because its many locations made it convenient for customers and it sold products that were interesting to look at, with many not being offered elsewhere. Add in being a source for things like blank cassettes, VHS tapes, and other accessories, the company filled a niche that does not exist any more. RadioShack has failed while Best Buy lives on to continue battling Amazon, because it may have outlived its usefulness without finding a new reason for being. Perhaps there was a pivot that could have saved the retailer (and maybe Blockbuster would still exist if it had become a chain of liquor store/vape shops) but non-extreme measures were always likely to end in this result.

Police responded to the South Black Horse Pike store around 10:45 a.m. "Due to the nature of the device, the decision was made to evacuate the store," police noted in a press release on the incident. Once all staff and shoppers were evacuated, the Camden County Bomb Squad was called in to investigate. The device was rendered safe and K-9 teams were called in to search the entire store, authorities said. Police have not provided details on what the device was or how it was rendered safe. The store reopened several hours later with no reports of anything else suspicious found. An investigation into the incident is ongoing, police said. Monroe police were assisted by the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office, Deptford Police Department and New Jersey State Police. Matt Gray may be reached at mgray@njadvancemedia.com.

On 44th Avenue, the municipality of Lakeside has 2 traffic lights between Sheridan and Harlan that haven't worked properly for years.  One is at Fenton, going into Walmart, the other is at about Depew, going into a gas station.  Both of these lights are just on a cycle, rather than sensing traffic.  They constantly stop traffic on 44th and hold it for several minutes, when no other cars have approached from the cross streets.  Super annoying!  They've both had black plastic over the walk signals for several years as well. I can't figure out how to contact anybody official for Lakeside.  Please help!” Teresa, the little town of Lakeside is really, really little. It's only about a quarter square mile in size with its boundaries between 48th Ave to the north, 44th Ave to the south, Harlan Street to the west and Sheridan Blvd to the east. A large portion of the town’s land is water in the form of Lake Rhoda. The other big land owners are Walmart on one side and Lakeside Amusement Park on the other. Another big chunk of town land is the rundown Lakeside Speedway that closed in 1988 and sits in a state of decay and disrepair today. According to the 2010 census, the population of Lakeside is 8, making Lakeside the least populous municipality in the State of Colorado. I too had trouble at first getting ahold of someone at the city of Lakeside. You have the option of calling the courthouse or the police department. I started with the clerk and was eventually directed in the right direction.  The two traffic lights on 44th, at Depew and Lamar, belong to Lakeside. The town uses WL Contractors to maintain the lights and set the signal timing. WL maintains lights for many small and large towns across the Front Range. These lights are on a system called an inductive loop. I talk all about inductive loops in an earlier Driving You Crazy story you can read here.  WL reports that the signal timing and the loop system are working properly. Sometimes though, small cars, some newer cars and motorcycles don’t have enough metal in them to trigger the electromagnetic field to activate a change in the traffic light. That might be part of the problem you have at the lights.  MORE: Read more traffic issues driving people crazy As for the cover over the crosswalk signs, they definitely don’t look pretty. They are covered in thick, black plastic, tied tightly over the walk/don't walk signals. Lakeside Assistant Police Chief Sam Vecchiarelli tells me the signs are covered because they want to discourage people from crossing the street on that side of the intersection. “We have a lot of foot traffic through there because there are two bus stops and fortunately both bus stops are on the east side of those intersections. So it is easier, I think, for the people to just use that east side crosswalk.” Vecchiarelli admits that they could make some improvements to the intersection that might help the pedestrians who want to cross 44th. “We need to get it repainted because it is getting faded out,” he said. Since the town of Lakeside doesn’t have their own public works department that work will have to be contracted out. Vecchiarelli indicated to me that it could be a while before that work is done.   Denver7 traffic reporter Jayson Luber says he has been covering Denver-metro traffic since Ben-Hur was driving a chariot. (We believe the actual number is over 20 years.) He's obsessed with letting viewers know what's happening on their drive and the best way to avoid the problems that spring up.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 March 2017 by Military News Which Wireless Carrier Has the Best Network? In some ways, a wireless carrier claiming it has the best network has about as much meaning as your local pizza place saying it has „award-winning” wings. It may be true, but it’s very hard for customers to determine what that actually means. On this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods , the team discusses two recent industry reports on wireless network quality in the U.S. While one crowns T-Mobile  and Verizon  as the best options, the other has surprisingly different results. For consumers, pricing may be prove to be the key factor. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This podcast was recorded on Feb. 24, 2017. Vincent Shen: I would like to turn our attention to the telecom industry. First, for more of a consumer-facing topic. You mentioned there had been some new reports released regarding the quality of the networks among the big four players –Verizon , AT&T , T-Mobile , and Sprint . Who managed to come out on top? Daniel Kline: There’s two very different reports. There’s the OpenSignal report, which is done using actual data from people’s cellphones. It’s billions of data points. And that report has Verizon and T-Mobile neck-and-neck. Sprint does OK, and AT&T is at the bottom. It’s worth noting that even with all those differences, it’s kind of one in 1A, 2A, and 2B. And everybody is grouped pretty closely. The second report is the RootMetrics report, and that’s the one, do you remember the Verizon commercial with all the balls where it showed how they won in every area, Verizon dominates in this report. This is a report where they effectively drive around and do testing. Both companies argue that their methodology is correct. T-Mobile takes huge issues with the RootMetrics report every year. But Verizon wins dramatically. T-Mobile is about the same as they were a year ago. AT&T is number two in that report, Sprint is number three, but even RootMetrics more or less says, „For most people, all of these are good enough.” It’s kind of the message that Sprint is delivering in its commercials with the old Verizon guy, Paul — Shen: „Can you hear me now?” Kline: Yeah, the „Can you hear me now?” guy. It’s basically this idea that, are you going to pay Verizon to be a little bit better? They say 1% better. They might be more than 1% better. But for the average person who doesn’t travel a ton, Verizon could be bad in their house and Sprint could be great, and that could be the small difference. So for most people, it’s actually worth trying T-Mobile or Sprint, which are the cheaper options, and seeing if they work with your lifestyle. Because for the vast majority of us, every network is good enough. Shen: I think that definitely applies, as well if you live in a major metropolitan area, or a larger metropolitan area — Kline: And T-Mobile, which is tied in the OpenSignal and clearly number four in the RootMetrics report, even RootMetrics acknowledges that they are very strong in urban areas. I use T-Mobile. We have talked about this. I live in West Palm Beach. I come here all the time. I have family in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The only place I have problems with it is, we have a family home in rural New Hampshire, and in the actual town, I can’t get service, and it’s very clear on the T-Mobile map that there is no service. They have Wi-Fi calling, it’s not a super big deal. So for most people, it’s hard to imagine that it’s worth paying significantly more money for Verizon or AT&T.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Mar 9, 2017 at 6:08PM Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has lagged the broader market over the last year, but there's clear evidence that the company's efforts to overhaul its business are having an effect, especially on the rest of retail. Over the last year, the world's largest retailer has raised wages and increased and streamlined employee development. It's also driven comparable sales increases by investing in stores to clean them up and make sure shelves are adequately stocked. On the e-commerce front, Wal-Mart has rapidly expanded its online grocery pickup program, and completed a $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com that gave a jolt to its online sales growth. Traffic at Wal-Mart continues to rise, even while much of the rest of retail is suffering -- shoppers have begun to avoid malls and instead shop online, and department stores almost universally reported declines in comparable sales. And Wal-Mart's strategy, while failing to boost its own share price, has squeezed a few of its closest competitors. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Motley Fool. 1. Target  Target (NYSE:TGT) was once the cheap chic answer to Wal-Mart, widely praised for its partnerships with fashion labels and mix of affordable household products, but the company seems to have found itself in a no-man's land with the rise of e-commerce and a resurgent Wal-Mart. Shares of the big-box chain sunk to a near five-year low after an underwhelming holiday-quarter earnings report and weak guidance for 2017. The stock dropped 12% following the release as Target said comparable sales fell 1.5%, 3.3% when online sales are removed. Adjusted earnings per share fell from $1.52 to $1.45, missing estimates at $1.51, while overall revenue dropped for the sixth straight quarter, falling 4.3% to $20.7 billion, due in part to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS. Target announced a revamp plan, similar to the one Wal-Mart offered two years ago, as it plans to invest to make its stores more inviting. The retailer continues to struggle with its grocery department and its pricing, and its 2017 earnings forecast was $3.80-$4.20, well below the consensus at $5.35. 2. Kroger Wal-Mart's recent efforts to lower prices on groceries seems to have added to Target's problems, and they've certainly created challenges for Kroger Inc (NYSE:KR) at a time when the nation's largest traditional grocer is already struggling with food deflation. Like Target, Kroger's shares also fell after its own recent underwhelming earnings report, approaching a two-year low. The supermarket chain also saw its 13-year streak of same-store quarterly sales increases come to an end as comps fell 0.7% in its fourth-quarter report. Sales were already sliding going into the report on news that Wal-Mart, the country's biggest grocery seller, was cutting prices. In its 2017 guidance, Kroger said it expected same-store sales growth of just 0-1%, and for EPS to be essentially flat once the extra calendar week is removed. In response to the sluggish growth, Kroger offered hundreds of employees early retirement buyouts, and management also said it would invest in stores and e-commerce offerings like its Clicklist pickup program and a delivery pilot program with Uber.  3. Dollar General While Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has not yet reported fourth-quarter earnings, the dollar-store chains have found themselves squarely in Wal-Mart's sites as the retail giant cuts prices in an attempt to claw back market share from those companies. Dollar General stock surged in the post-recession years as it expanded rapidly and saw sales grow as struggling Americans traded down. More recently, however, the company has seen comparable sales decline amid Wal-Mart's efforts to revamp itself. The stock has also pulled back on weak reports from peers such as Kroger and Target, and on news of poor retail sales in February. The discount chain has also aggressively been opening new stores, but that strategy may backfire as more sales go online and many other retailers shutter stores. With other Wal-Mart rivals struggling, there's a good chance Dollar General will sell off after its earnings report as well. Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Kroger.

A Buisness Insider report chronicles Peterson's journey from taking prescription opiates for the first time to her addition to heroin. The story is all too familiar for many Americans who suffer from opiate addiction.  At 16, Peterson tried Lortab which was given to her by her friend before she even drank alcohol. She found the pill helped with her social anxiety and caused her to relax. She tried opiates again two years later because she trusted her doctor. She was prescribed Percocet after her emergency C-section for her son when she was 18. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Pamela Anderson calls rumored beau Julian Assange 'sexy' in...

Share this article Share Once again, she discovered it made her feel good, but it was expensive. At the suggestion of her boyfriend, the Wal-Mart employee tried what she saw as the cheaper alternative: heroin. She told Business Insider: 'It didn't seem like a big deal to me then. I was naive. I didn't know all the consequences that it would lead to. It just made me feel good. Normal.' Three years of sobriety: Andi Peterson appearance and health transformed after being sober for three years Suburbs like Weber County were lousy with painkillers so it made sense for drug dealers to get in on this market and offer clients cheaper alternatives. The dealers would also help clients not feel like addicts by offering delivery and prioritizing customer service.   In the book 'Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic,' author Sam Quinones wrote: 'Guys from Xalisco had figured out that what white people — especially middle-class white kids — want most is service, convenience.'  After six months, Peterson confessed to her parents her addiction to the drug after her father noticed her twitchy behavior. Naloxone is a nasal spray that  helps save people who are overdosing on  heroin She wanted to get clean but it would take her years. Opiates rewire addicts' brains to constantly crave the substance.  Peterson would also spend a year in prison and lose custody of her son. She would finally get clean after failing out of a treatment center once. She also had a wake up call when she watched someone overdose. The heroin epidemic was a major talking point in the 2016 election. Journalist Chris Arnade has documented the opioid crisis and noted that President Trump won wherever there was heavy drug addiction, especially to opiates.  President Trump famously won the New Hampshire Republican primary which has a severe opiate problem which included swing states. In September, 24 people suffered heroin overdoses in a single night in Akron, Ohio as the state battles a drug epidemic. The UN reported heroin usage had reached a 20 year high in June.  Heroin deaths nationwide rose 23 per cent in 2016, to 12,989, slightly higher than the number of gun homicides, according to government data released yesterday.

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services announced Thursday that the company will allow parents to send electronic payments to the agency to transfer to custodial parents. The parents will be able to use the MoneyGram locations at retail stores, its online site or a smartphone app. MoneyGram will charge a $3.99 fee for each child support payment transfer. The Department of Children and Family Services oversees about 290,000 child support cases in Louisiana, either through court orders or because parents choose to use the agency as its intermediary for child support payments.

Home Opinion Rest Of The Story Rest Of The Story March 10, 2017 · · 0 Last Tuesday night, President Donald Trump brought it in his first address to a joint session of congress. Now, I’m not an ideologue and, when there is not a viable two-party system, the nation suffers. In 1887, Sir John Dahlberg-Acton said, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” The warning? Power must to be shared in order to be wielded fairly. Hence, my anger with Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi and her minions. Oh, it was bad enough when you refused to even acknowledge that, “Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Sofbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others … will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” The clear message: “We intend to continue to obstruct this administration no matter how much money flows back into this country or the American people benefit.” US News on its blog said it, “Every single one of them should be ashamed of themselves.” We get it — you’re sore losers. But, when the President of the United States honors the wife of a fallen Navy SEAL, get your butt out of your chair, stand up and applaud! There was not a dry eye in America when Carryn Owens, widow of Senior Chief Ryan Owens, mouthed, “I love you baby,” as she sobbed next to Ivanka Trump. What in the H@#$ is the matter with you? In particular, Dems Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Keith Ellison (Deputy Chair of the DNC) who didn’t stand at all. You don’t applaud this noble sacrifice. Just sit there on your rump with some of your fellow Dems? You’re such a bankrupt ideologue, you can’t even acknowledge an American hero sacrificing himself for this country? Spitting on this hero’s memory just because Donald Trump started the ovation? And, you still don’t get it when you laughed at “We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption.” I don’t know what’s so funny. Because the public wants government cronyism gone … like yesterday! And, turning your thumbs down on dismantling Obama-Care? What are you guys now — movie critics? Or, just the modern-day Caesars deciding who lives/dies in the arena of American politics? Wearing white/purple for what? Sitting there with their proverbial stick in their keister, stone-faced and proving what? They can hold a grudge over a non-existent issue? And, the mainstream media spin? The New York Times, “Lawmakers sustained the bipartisan tradition of using spare tickets to import human symbols, looking upon Mr. Trump like a mismatched orchestra … the president’s guest list … the father of a teenager killed by an undocumented immigrant, the widows of two officers killed in the line of duty by an undocumented immigrant and the widow of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia …” This pandering was disgraceful. Whether you like this president or not, frowning in lockstep and then scurrying out of the chamber like so many sore losers as soon as you could make a break — we get it! In case you missed it, citizens everywhere in this world (including North Dakota) are tired of politicians and the old tax and spend status quo. And, Dems, who are you pandering to? Because, the logical, inevitable result of this is going to be felt in two years. We don’t care about your ideology. We want a good-paying job, safe drivable streets, a final end to Islamic terrorism and a stop to illegal immigration (just to help keep you in power). Get it?

What does it mean for consumers and investors? Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 11, 2017 at 12:00PM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) plans to raise its membership prices in the United States for the first time in over five and a half years. The increases, which take effect in June, are modest. Goldstar and Business memberships will rise from $55 to $60. Executive Members will pay $120, a $10-per-year increase from the current price of $110. Those who pay for the pricier memberships, though, will see the cap on the 2% reward members earn on eligible purchases increase from $750 a year to $1,000. Members whose renewal date occurs before June 1 will get another year at the old price, and any new signups before the deadline will also pay the current prices. The company said in its Q2 earnings release that the change will affect around 35 million members, about half of them Executive Members.  Costco has not raised membership prices in more than five years. Image source: Costco. Will this cost Costco members? For members, or even people considering signing up, the increases are modest enough that they likely will not matter. The company could lose a small amount of people to Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, where memberships start at $45 a year. The same could be said of BJ's, which charges basic members $50 a year. Costco traditionally has very strong membership renewal rates. In its most recent quarter, renewals were a little over 90% in the U.S. and Canada, and 87.7% worldwide, according to CFO Richard Galanti on the company's earnings call with investors. Total accounts globally were up 400,000 from the end of Q1, while the total number of cardholders rose 800,000 to 88.1 million quarter over quarter. Executive member also grew, now accounting for a little over one-third of the membership base, but two-thirds of total sales. It's those executive members who mean the most to Costco, and while they may not love the price increase, it's very unlikely that they will leave over $10 a year. In addition, some of these members may even like the change since the new rewards ceiling lets them earn an extra $250 back each year if they spend enough. What does this mean for the bottom line? Eventually, it will be a positive for the company, which makes about 75% of its operating profit from membership fees, but the impact will take a long time to be fully felt. "In terms of how it hits our P&L, our membership income line, approximately one-twelfth if you will, or one month worth of the increase in fees from the June renewers, that will be the first group that gets this fee increase," Galanti said. "Approximately 1/12 of the increase will be booked to the income statement in that first month of June, with an additional 1/12 being booked in each of the succeeding 11 months." Because renewals take place every month (every day of every month, really) the actual full impact will take nearly two years. Galanti explained the math: Next, the increased fees from our July renewals, those will be booked starting in July, one-twelfth and following through to the following June, and so on. So the full P&L impact of these increases will be over a 23 month time line, such that the last group of members to be billed at these new levels will be next May of 2018, with a booking if you will, of those $5 and $10 increases being recorded over that month, and its succeeding 11 months, i.e. 23 months out. In a broader sense, the increase in fees may not have much impact at all on the bottom line. Traditionally, Galanti noted, the company has raised prices around every five years, and much of the extra money goes into lowering or keeping prices low. What does this mean for Costco members? For regular members, it's hard to compute how much extra they would have to buy in order to recoup the price increase because there's no standard discount for shopping at the warehouse club versus other retailers. When it comes to Executive Members, spending an extra $500 year earns you $10 in added cash back, covering the increase. Of course consumers probably won't buy that much more just to get a relatively small reward, but some were likely already making enough purchases to put them over the previous $750 cap (business members especially). This fee increase is big news for Costco, only because it has been so long since the last one. In the long run, while there may be mild anger from a small amount of consumers, many may not even notice or care. This was a needed move, but one that's very measured. It will slightly pad the company's bottom line (albeit slowly), and it's really nothing consumers nor investors should be overly concerned about. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Pender, 30, of Millville.NJOAG  TRENTON -- A Cumberland County woman on Friday admitted running a retail shoplifting ring that boosted merchandise and made bogus returns at stores across South Jersey, authorities said. Chiara K. Pender, 30, pleaded guilty to a second-degree charge of leading an organized retail theft enterprise during an appearance in front of Superior Court Judge John T. Kelley in Camden County, according to the state Attorney General's Office. Authorities say Pender, of Millville, ran an operation that stole more than $20,000 over a six-month period in 2016, recruiting members and driving them to targeted stores including Marshalls, TJ Maxx, Target, Walmart, Home Goods, Lowes, Kohls, Burlington Coat Factory and Rite Aid. According to a statement from Attorney General Christopher Porrino's office, the thefts followed "a consistent pattern." A member would steal clothing, electronics and other items from the store and then either return them at the same store or another location of the same chain, according to police. They would often receive gift cards with store credit for the returns, selling them at a discount to pawn shops, authorities claim. State Police arrested Pender in June, and three other members of the ring -- Thareick Archer, 26 of Vineland; Sharhonda Collins, 50, of Bridgeton; and Mark Rabb III, 30, of Millville -- have since pleaded guilty to lesser charges, authorities said. Under a plea deal, prosecutors are recommending Pender receive a five-year sentence and pay restitution to the stores, authorities said. S.P. Sullivan may be reached at ssullivan@njadvancemedia.com.

Wade obsolete, North Woods monument an asset, restore tip credit Print Email Share Tweet Posted March 11, 2017, at 9:09 a.m. Roe v. Wade obsolete A Feb. 28 BDN OpEd by officers of the Mabel Wadsworth Center in Bangor claims that “It is unconscionable for a billionaire CEO to impose his personal, scientifically inaccurate belief that birth control causes abortion.” Pro-abortion organizations and their lawyers readily admit the early abortion potential of the Pill. In 1989, attorney Frank Sussman, who represented a Missouri abortion clinic in a challenge to a Missouri abortion law, said before the Supreme Court that intrauterine devices and birth control pills, which work by blocking the development of a fertilized egg, essentially “ are also abortifacients.” That’s why these pills and devices are accurately named birth control instead of conception control. Pro-abortionists define conception as implantation, allowing them to claim that birth control has no abortifacient effect. But, as the CEO of Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court, and scientists have acknowledged, implantation of the embryo takes place about one week after conception. Justice Harry Blackmun stated in Roe v. Wade, “If the suggestion of personhood is established, [Roe’s] case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed.” With the invention of ultrasound we can now watch the fetus suck his or her thumb, smile. Today, they even operate on the fetus. Today’s science has now proven Roe v. Wade to be wrong and obsolete. As Thomas Jefferson told us, “the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” Ron Stauble Sr. Unity Helpful stranger I had never felt so sad and helpless. At the Brewer Wal-Mart, I chose the line with one elderly woman placing canned vegetables, bananas, cat food on the conveyor. Her total was more than $100, and she began searching through her purse. She unzipped pockets and peered into slots for something, anything. I wished I was rich. I wished could pay for her food. But I couldn’t. She apologized for being unorganized, mumbling about Alzheimer’s. Finding a checkbook, she slowly filled out a wrinkled page, but then she needed identification. My heart sunk. I doubted she could find any ID. “Ma’am, do you have a driver’s license?” she was asked. “No, I can’t drive. Will this work?” she said, holding a business card. I looked at her gray frizzy hair and her gnarled fingers, which were still fumbling in her cluttered purse. She could be me in another 20 years. I looked behind me. The others in line were not complaining. One man said, “I don’t have that much with me.” I’m not a leader, especially of strangers, but the thought of organizing an impromptu collection for her went through my mind. Then one man handed her a $100 bill. “Is this enough?” The woman reluctantly took it and asked for his name. “Call me Bob,” he said. “Merry Christmas.” I would have liked to thank him for doing what I couldn’t and for showing kindness to somebody’s mother. She was all our mother that night. Yvonne Blake Searsport North Woods monument an asset The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument is as great an asset to America as are Yellowstone, Yosemite and other national treasures. As the world population increases, the pressure to overdevelop the Maine wilderness is becoming a reality. People worked tirelessly to establish the Sieur De Monts National Monument, which later became Acadia National Park. Parks and monuments allow visitors to enjoy special areas of natural beauty without the destruction of precious resources. This does not mean that economic opportunity is not viable. For example, the economic impact from Acadia is second to none during the tourist season here in Maine. Cottage industries are major business here in Maine. Unique hand-crafted goods are a type of business that fits in perfectly with the economic development of the communities adjacent to the North Woods monument. Maine residents have an outstanding work ethic that is a real plus in establishing a new economic future for this area. Maine residents have for generations taken pride in sharing our beautiful state with people from around the world. We know that Maine is a magical treasure. We are a caring and compassionate people who want to keep Maine a special place in which to live, work, relax and be inspired by its wonder. Gov. Paul LePage is completely wrong in attempting to get President Donald Trump to rescind the executive order that created the monument. LePage’s vision for Maine is shortsighted and biased. His views are not in the best interest of residents of Maine. Robert Chaplin Bar Harbor Restore tip credit Thirty-two years ago, I began a summer job not knowing the journey I was about to begin. Since then, I have worked at eight different restaurants, each sharing the common thread of flexible hours, on-the-job training and payment at the end of the shift. Many people become servers for income potential, not realizing the skills they will gain along the way. Successful servers must be highly organized, problem solvers, have impeccable people skills, and unbelievable memories. All of this while wearing a smile and remaining calm. We have all had great service provided by a skilled server, one who makes going out to eat a pleasure. As a server, I was blessed to have a flexible work schedule while raising my children and putting myself through college. The tip credit with my job allowed me to afford and attend college to become a teacher. My children worked in area restaurants while they were in high school. My daughter continues to work as a server today, as a way to help support her young family, much like I did when she was young. The tip credit allows the food service industry to provide its workers with real world training, lifelong skills and good-paying jobs. Being a server is truly one of the most challenging and yet rewarding jobs I have ever had. With the tip credit eliminated, not only will income be lost, but many opportunities for people to improve their lives will be lost as well.

TERRY AHNER/TIMES NEWS ‹ Prev 1 of 2 Next › By Terry Ahner tahner@tnonline.com Education is pivotal in the continued attempts to address the heroin epidemic. “One of our biggest problems is heroin,” John Sienkiewicz, president of Safer Streets for Tamaqua’s Little Feet, said at a recent STEP-Up Tamaqua meeting. “What they’re doing now is a diabetic needle.” Sienkiewicz said the diabetic needles are sold at Walmart by the box of 100. Safer Streets for Tamaqua’s Little Feet purchased a mock drug board for educational purposes by through donations and fundraisers. “Education is key to stopping this epidemic,” he said. “By that, we mean adults, parents and children need to be educated.” Sienkiewicz said, “With children, the education needs to include all aspects. What happens if you start, where it leads and what the end result will most likely be. “With adults, they need to know what the drugs look like, and (what) all the symptoms of drug use are,” he said. “They also need to know that it is OK to get educated without having the problem in their family, because it could become them or a friend’s kid. They can use that knowledge to help the person or family.” Sienkiewicz’s daughter Alex died of an overdose of fentanyl last year. The people accused of selling her the drugs were charged this week. Sienkiewicz and his wife, Tammy, created Safer Streets for Tamaqua’s Little Feet on May 25, 2016, to educate school kids, and adults alike, on drug addiction. The group is a nonprofit that is run on donations. For more information, visit www.saferstreetstamaqua.com, or follow them on Facebook at Safer Streets for Tamaqua’s Little Feet. “We also do help those affected by addiction get help through rehab and recovery houses; we give support to families with answers to hard questions, education and a shoulder to cry on,” he said. “We always tell them they are not alone, and the response we get is ‘we thought we were.’ ” Sienkiewicz said the group’s cleanups and beautification projects are designed to get those in recovery to give back to the community, and to have the community help as well. “What this does is allow the recovering addict to see people do care and don’t always look down on them, and will give them a chance,” he said. “As for the community, it helps to show them that the recovering addict is still a person and deserves to be treated as one.” He added, “Through this, we hope all can heal and help one another stop stereotyping one another. After all is said and done, we are all still humans, and the stigma surrounding addiction needs to be broken before we can heal.” STEP-Up Tamaqua is a project of the Tamaqua Area Faith Fellowship Network, a 501(c)3 nonprofit under the umbrella of the Tamaqua Area Community Partnership. Its purpose is to address the addiction issue in the community. Contributions are welcome and may be sent to STEP-Up Tamaqua, 125 Pine St., Tamaqua, PA 18252.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Pearlstein By Steven Pearlstein March 11 Follow @StevePearlstein House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans are determined to try again on corporate tax reform, which three presidents and many congresses have failed to enact. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo) If President Trump was surprised by how complicated health care could be, he’ll be in for a real shock when he gets around to business tax reform. Everyone agrees that the way the United States taxes business profits needs an overhaul. The current tax regime encourages companies to move operations, assets and even corporate citizenship overseas, while raising less and less money every year as companies come up with ever more ingenious and ethically questionable ways to avoid it. For most big companies, the official 35 percent corporate tax rate is irrelevant. The average rate actually paid is about 24 percent, with some companies routinely paying no tax at all. So why have three presidents and countless Congresses been unable to fix it? The answer is that despite all the bellyaching by business leaders about our uncompetitive tax system, it is the business lobby itself that has stood in the way of reform. The reason is simple: To restructure the tax code while still raising the same amount of revenue, all those companies paying less than the average effective rate would have to pay more so those paying uncompetitive rates could pay less. And the low-tax companies have made it their business to prevent that from happening. Now, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and his Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), are determined to try again, proposing to replace the existing business profits tax with a “destination-based cash flow tax. ” The wonky-sounding idea — long championed by economist Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley — has been kicking around in tax policy circles for more than 20 years, winning plaudits from think tanks on the right and left. Despite what you may have read, it is not part of a Republican conspiracy to eliminate taxes on capital. It is not a disguised tariff, or sales tax or value-added tax, although it would mimic their economic impact in some respects. It would not raise the price of imports by anywhere near 20 percent, nor would it bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to the United States. So what is it? Let’s start with the “cash flow” part, which has received too little attention. What that means is that companies would deduct the full value of any investments they make in the year they make them, rather than spreading them out — or depreciating them — over many years, as now required by tax and accounting rules. It also means that interest payments used to finance those investments could no longer be deducted as a business expense. This switch from a profits tax to a cash-flow tax makes things simpler, encourages investment and eliminates the incentive for businesses to borrow rather than raise capital from investors. This is the part of the Ryan-Brady plan that economists love and most businesses support because of the way it simplifies business taxation and removes taxes as a factor in business investment decisions. In the short run, it also reduces the amount of profits that are subject to tax. More controversial is the “destination” part of “destination-based tax flow tax.” What that means is that companies will be taxed only on profits from sales made in the United States. Consider four different scenarios. The first is an American company producing goods or services at home and selling them to American customers. That’s a big chunk of the economy, and the tax structure for those companies would remain largely unchanged. Then there are sales from overseas divisions of American companies to customers who are also overseas. Right now, profits from these transactions are not subject to U.S. tax as long as they are left overseas. A destination tax would ignore them as well. Then there are sales of goods and services produced in America but sold to customers overseas — think Boeing. Under the destination tax, the overseas sales would not be counted as revenue, but the expense of producing them would still be deducted as a business expense in calculating the company’s taxable profit. That’s the tax equivalent of all gain, no pain. And the opposite would be true of a company that imports products, or parts of products, for sale in America — think Walmart or Nike. In that case, the revenue will be counted, but the cost of the imported goods or services will not. All pain, no gain. By lowering taxes for exporters and raising them for importers, this “border adjustment” is meant to remove the current incentive for companies to locate production and intellectual property, or realize profits, in tax havens such as Ireland or the Bahamas. As a result — and this is what gets President Trump all excited — jobs would come back, tax revenue would increase and the trade deficit would disappear. Or not. For if those good things actually happen, or even look like they are about to happen, then something else might also happen — namely, that the value of the dollar would rise sharply against other currencies, which for Americans will lower the price of imports and makes exports seem more expensive to buyers overseas. Economic theory, in fact, predicts that the dollar would rise just enough to offset the new tax advantage that would flow to exporters as a result of a border adjustment, and offset the tax hit to importers and their customers. What the new tax code giveth in terms of higher or lower taxes, the currency exchange market would taketh away in the form of lower or higher prices. [White House split on import tax puts Congress in limbo] If economic theory is right, in other words, the only lasting economic impact of border adjustment impact might be a nasty global financial crisis as some foreign countries and companies that borrowed cheap dollars would find themselves unable to repay more expensive ones. In addition, as the dollar rises, the value of foreign investments held by Americans would fall, while foreigners’ appetite for investing in the United States would wane, potentially depressing stock prices and pushing up interest rates. While economists are fairly united in predicting that border adjustment will lead to an equal and opposite currency adjustment, business executives aren’t so sure. That’s why importers have mounted a furious effort to kill the Ryan-Brady plan, while exporters are pushing it with the urgent conviction of new converts at a tent revival. Officials in the Trump administration are said to be similarly divided. There is good reason to be skeptical that global markets are so efficient that the dollar will rise to offset the economic impact of the border tax. If markets were that efficient, currency adjustments would have prevented the United States from running large and persistent trade deficits all these years. The reason that didn’t happen was because the flow of investment capital across borders is even greater than the flow of goods and services, with an opposite effect on the dollar exchange rate. The same dynamic could limit the rise of the dollar in response to a border-adjustment tax. Whatever happens with the dollar, border adjustment will put an end to ridiculous and costly shell games played by virtually every global corporation to shift activity and profits overseas, where nearly $2 trillion sits idle in the bank accounts of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Other countries will almost certainly mount legal challenges to border adjustment, claiming that it violates global and bilateral tax treaties. But there is also a possibility that other countries could realize what a good idea it is and copy it. That would neutralize some of the economic benefits to the U.S. economy. There is debate about whether the Ryan-Brady proposal would shift the burden of the corporate tax from shareholders and employees to consumers, which would make it less progressive. Liberal economists such as Jared Bernstein think so, but Kyle Pomerleau at the conservative Tax Foundation thinks not. In the end, it would depend on how much the dollar adjusts and whether importers would be able to pass tax increases on to consumers rather than to their shareholders and employees. In other words, it’s anyone’s guess — although either way, the effect will probably be modest. For me, the problem with the Republican business tax plan is not so much the structure of the tax, but the fact that the proposed 20 percent rate is too low. As Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center has written, if border adjustment increases exports and discourages imports to the degree promised by some proponents, then the 20 percent tax rate will not raise anything close to what the corporate tax raises now. Edward Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California law school, figures a rate of 25 percent would be needed for the plan to be revenue neutral. William Gale of the Brookings Institution thinks it would be 30 percent. “The 20 percent rate is not economically driven,” Kleinbard said. “It’s purely a political number.” The House plan also retains the current tax advantage enjoyed by small businesses, partnerships, proprietorships, investment trusts and limited liability corporations — enterprises that, as a result of this tax advantage, account for half of all business profits. Such enterprises — some of which are very large and very profitable — are not subject to either the corporate tax or to the additional 20 percent tax on dividends and capital gains that corporate shareholders pay. Instead, they are taxed only once at the personal income tax rate of the owners. The House proposal would expand this boondoggle by creating a special new tax rate of 25 percent for these “pass-throughs” — a rate that is not only undeservedly low but will create a whole new tax scam, as highly paid employees rush to turn themselves into independent contractors to take advantage of it. Because of these and myriad other problems, the Ryan and Brady proposal needs lots more study and debate — it shouldn’t be rushed through to meet artificial political deadlines. But by the same token, it deserves serious consideration. “I’m very intrigued by it, particularly the economic benefits,” said Martin Sullivan, the respected columnist and chief economist at Tax Notes. “There are concerns with it, no question. But the reason we are still talking about it is that there is no obvious alternative.” Pearlstein is a Post economics and business columnist.  He is also Robinson Professor of Public Affairs at George Mason University.

He’d ask them, in broken Spanish, if they wished to go to heaven. If they said yes, he would pray for them. If they said no, he would ask for at least a donation to The Family International, a church formerly known as the sex cult The Children of God. Young’s parents, devout American missionaries who moved to Mexico in 1998, told him that such work was his destiny and duty. The alternative was an afterlife spent in the slums of heaven, a place only slightly better than hell. When he was eight years old, in 2000, Young’s family moved to Texas and started their missionary work anew in mini-malls and Walmart parking lots, handing out theological tracts about the imminent apocalypse that would soon wipe out the unbelievers.

But Young was unaware that his parents’ church was labelled as a sect by the FBI and hounded by child abuse allegations. In a 1974 report, The New York attorney general’s office had also called the Children of God a “cult”. The group’s practices drew investigations from the FBI and Interpol, which were on the hunt for its leader, David Berg. One anonymous informant spoke of rape, incarceration, kidnapping and incest inside the group. The investigations ended in 1994, with Berg’s death. But in 2009, the organization started to crumble. The church disintegrated and Young was suddenly forced to forge himself a new life, along with thousands of other isolated missionaries who had to assimilate into a society that they had long rejected. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Young: ‘I was spiritual in a way that was kind of very obsessive.’ Photograph: Michael Young The Children of God started in 1968 as a small group of runaway teens and hippies who, under the direction of Berg, a charismatic evangelical preacher, devoted themselves to the worship of Jesus Christ and promiscuous sex, according to the New York attorney general’s office. The report documented Berg’s proclivity for incest and witnesses testified that child rape was used as an excuse to “increase the tribe”, leading to many pregnancies in various communes. “A 14-year-old runaway who spent nine days at a COG commune testified that she was raped and because of her refusal to cooperate with the elders, was held in solitary confinement on no less than three separate occasions,” the report states. The late actor River Phoenix, who grew up in the Children of God, told Details Magazine in 1991 that he was four when he first had sex while in the group. Young says he never personally experienced sexual abuse from members of the church, but witnessed it. “It definitely wasn’t a safe place to grow up, especially if you were a girl,” he says. “Close friends of mine growing up were abused and raped.” Berg’s philosophy, which he called the Law of Love, was a blend of Christian dogma and the free love ideals of the 1960s’ sexual revolution. To recruit new converts, he advocated that women of the church proposition men, which Berg’s daughter Deborah Davis described in her autobiography, The Children of God: The Inside Story, as a “world-wide prostitution network” that brought “dad unwanted publicity and attention from the law”. “The Law of Love is a doctrine that’s meant to justify and conceal sexual exploitation,” Young says. “It’s made to make other people feel obligated to give up their bodies to others’ so-called sexual needs. That your body is not your own –you’re supposed to give it up to God.” Berg, with his long white beard and apocalyptic visions, saw himself as the last prophet before Armageddon. His message was relatively simple, if not terribly original: God would soon be returning to Earth to hand down judgment. To avoid His wrath, Berg advised his followers, they should live an austere life and abandon all their possessions. And they did. David Berg. Photograph: Children of God archive The New York attorney general found an estimated 120 Children of God communes in 1974, many of whose members were required to surrender their personal belongings and money to leaders of local homes. More than three decades later, in 2006, there were over 1,400 communes in more than 100 countries, according to the group. Berg discouraged members from working and sending their children to school, according to interviews with 10 former members who were born in the group. The Children of God were to eschew the world. Members lived in large communes, typically with four or five families under one roof, as they waited for the impending apocalypse. The Children of God had communes in small and big cities as dispersed as Staten Island, Tucson and Coachella, the report shows. It recruited among disgruntled teenagers from school dropouts to draft dodgers, who would end up giving all their money to the group. Berg renamed his movement the Family of Love shortly after the mass suicide at Jonestown in 1978, which brought negative media attention to other fringe Christian sects. In 2004, the Family changed its name again to the Family International. “We were always fundraising for cash, using that cash to pay rent and then fundraising the next month so there was a lot of anxiety,” Young recalls. “We didn’t buy food from the grocery store, it was usually donated.” He’d spend much of his time teaching Bible courses and “the New Testament, where there would be the signs of the times and Jesus was coming back at the end of them”. But the apocalypse would never happen. ••• In 1993, allegations of sexual abuse finally caught up with Berg. Interpol launched an investigation into Berg’s activities in Argentina and, according to documents obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request, the FBI was investigating him as well. Berg was on the run. He fled to Portugal, where he died in 1994. Karen Zerby, Berg’s widow, assumed leadership of the group, along with her new husband, Steve Kelly. Faced with growing disillusionment among members, Zerby and Kelly decided it was time for a change. In February 2009, they made the surprise announcement that the world would not be ending after all, at least not imminently. “It looks like they were just trying to stem the flow of members out of the movement,” says Laura Vance, a sociology professor at Warren Wilson College who studies the Family and other new religious movements. “They went in the direction of stricter enforcement of the rules first, and then when that didn’t work, within a few years, they went in the opposite direction.” In a series of letters to their followers, the two leaders admitted they really couldn’t be sure when Jesus would return, and that the Lord showed them that they needed to “set goals up to 30 years or even farther into the future”. According to Family materials, they told their followers that if Jesus wasn’t going to come earlier to take them to heaven, they needed to worry about financing the care of aged Family members and the future of their children. “The whole cult was built on the theory that the antichrist was coming so you didn’t have to save for retirement. You didn’t know how long you were going to live so nobody looked ahead,” says Angel Yamaguchi, a former member who was born in the group and left at the end of 2009. “They’ve left a bunch of people that they’ve damaged struggling to try and cope and find out ‘how do I move on?’” Over the next year, Zerby and Kelly told Family members that they weren’t required to live in communes or devote themselves entirely to the organization. Members were free to enroll their children in school or to find regular jobs, which had previously been known as “system jobs” held by “systemites”. They could seek relationships with nonbelievers, an activity they’d been told for decades was reprehensible. The proclamation came to be known as “the Reboot”. Zerby and Kelly framed it in terms of giving the group a fresh start. But to many members, it was devastating. “All of a sudden, we started thinking about the tomorrow,” says one missionary member who asked to be identified as Clara. When contacted by phone, she said she was trying to distance herself from the group and would only speak on condition of anonymity. Clara panicked when she realized that after two decades in the Family, she was ill-prepared to lead a normal life with her husband and four children. “Now I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of my life. I don’t regret our missionary work but I regret not having a proper education and being so restricted with what we chose to do with our lives.” The Family’s 15,000 members were free from the oppressive rules that dictated their lives. Communes were disbanded as dazed members began planning for the future, something completely foreign to Family members who grew up in isolation and thought that they’d never reach adulthood (because the world would end long before their 21st birthday). That was four years ago. Today, they’re adjusting to society and letting go of the strange beliefs that had dictated their lives since birth. “They started giving us more freedom to think about things and maybe ask questions without just trying to force ourselves to believe things,” Young says. ••• In a series of phone conversations, Young told me how he struggled to leave the group. He said he grew disillusioned with the Family after the Reboot but he didn’t immediately turn away from the church. He studied the Bible from cover to cover in search of God’s meaning. “I was definitely still working through what I was supposed to do and why did I leave. And should I have left? And is Jesus real?” he says. “I was pretty freaked out and I had panic attacks where I thought I’m going to hell.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Young: ‘I had panic attacks where I thought I’m going to hell.’ Photograph: Michael Young He couldn’t find a job, with no experience other than missionary work. But he was good at making balloons for kids and blew them up in restaurants in exchange for tips. Once, a hostess asked him out on a date at work. She bought a balloon, gave him a kiss and her number. They went home to her roommates and talked about video games and TV shows. “I was just paralyzed with not knowing how to say anything and just sitting around being weird,” Michael recalls. “I liked her a lot and I was really devastated because she never called me back after that.” Dr Marlene Winell, a psychologist who studies religious indoctrination, says it can take a long time for former members of cults or extreme religious groups to feel comfortable in their new reality. “It’s a common thing to feel like you have to adjust to the secular world because there are so many expectations and behavior patterns that you’re not familiar with,” says Winell. She says it can take them a long time to leave those groups, especially if they were born into them. “They also are reconstructing who they are. If I’m not a cult member or a member of this religion, then who am I?” More than a year and a half after leaving the Family, Young joined a community college honors program, which helped students get scholarships and transfer to a four-year college. “That was the first time that I felt like I had friends. We talked about art, music, dancing,” he says. “I felt instantly like I belonged with these people.” After the Reboot, many former missionaries landed where the movement originated four decades earlier. Clusters of the Family appeared in places like Houston, Texas, and San Diego, California, according to interviews with former members. ••• Some younger members, like Martin Merour, 28, have kept one foot in the Family. Merour was very candid about his life in the Family and their unconventional beliefs. His family had sometimes discussed the Law of Love, Merour said by phone, and read some of the literature on the subject, but people mostly kept their sex lives private. “Because they’re not living communally, there are not as many opportunities to engage in sexual sharing,” says Vance. “So, in practice, it’s rare but it certainly is still allowed.” Martin spent most of his childhood on the outskirts of the Niger Delta in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where his French and German parents moved in 1997 to preach Berg’s gospel to the locals. The Reboot didn’t seem to affect the Merours who were far removed in the mission field. They stayed in Nigeria and continued on with their work. But most communes collapsed. Kansas town reels months after foiled mosque bombing: 'I'm still scared' Read more “It was a bit disconcerting seeing that other branches were closing down or other people, even friends, were deciding that perhaps the missionary work was no longer for them,” he says. “You’re wondering if you’re going to be the only one left for a while.” Today, the Family counts only about 2,500 members in some 80 countries. In 2015, Martin moved to Berlin, Germany, discovering life outside the missionary world. He enrolled in a soccer club and went to school to learn German. Still a proud Family member, he sends a donation every month to the Family and remains fond of his childhood years in Nigeria. But he doesn’t know if he’ll go back to mission work anytime soon. “Ultimately, I still want to serve the Lord,” he says. “I’m just not sure how.” For Young, who recently started his master’s degree at Penn State University, there is nothing about the old days of the Family to be nostalgic about. “What I worried about the most when I left was, will I ever find friends, a girlfriend, fit in, a place where I belong,” he says. “I found people I connected with once I found people who shared my values and goals, rather than trying to fit in.” Topics Religion Family Parents and parenting features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world selected opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world selected UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video World › Religion back to top family fashion food recipes love & sex home & garden Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Rolley, of Stone Mountain, Ga., pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts of credit card fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft in federal court in East St. Louis. A release from Donald Boyce, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois, stated Rolley’s co-defendant Michael A. Gordon, also of Stone Mountain, pleaded guilty to the same charges at the end of February. During three days in June 2015, the two took to several Walmarts across the metro-east with gift cards that had been re-encoded with stolen debit card numbers. Some of those account numbers belonged to Southern Illinois residents who bank at a local credit union. Rolley and Gordon made purchases at stores in Cahokia, O’Fallon, Belleville, Highland, Wood River, Collinsville, Glen Carbon, Godfrey, Jerseyville, Waterloo and Carlyle. “The purchases made by Rolley and Gordon were debited to the bank accounts of the victims whose debit account numbers had been embedded on the gift cards,” the release stated. Both defendants are scheduled to be sentenced June 23. They face up to 10 years in prison, $250,000 in fines, restitution and three years of supervised release. The aggravated identity theft charge, the release stated, carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence to be served consecutively with any other prison sentence imposed. The FBI’s Springfield Division, Fairview Heights Resident Agency led the investigation. Several agencies assisted, including Carlyle, Collinsville, Glen Carbon, Jerseyville, Waterloo and Wood River police departments, Madison County Sheriff’s Department and Walmart’s Global Security Department.

(WKRN) – An Ashland City man is in the hospital with serious burns after police say the cleaning product he was huffing ignited. Brandon Gibson is accused of stealing the product from Walmart and going right behind the store to huff the chemicals when the accident happened. News 2 did some digging and discovered that Gibson’s arrest record with the TBI is more than 20 pages long. His extensive criminal history includes multiple theft charges and unlawful huffing, and that’s exactly what Ashland City police say happened Thursday night. This time, the product was Ultra Duster, an all-purpose cleaning product that is toxic and sold in aerosol cans. Somehow the product ignited and Gibson suffered a burn so severe to his hands we can’t even show you the pictures. He was rushed to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where he remains in the burn unit. He was last listed as critical but stable. (Photo: WKRN) Dr. Corey Slovis, Medical Director of the Nashville Fire Department, told News 2 that cases of huffing are declining because even abusers realize how dangerous it is. “The way some people have burns, they are smoking a cigarette or they are near a flame and it just combusts. It’s like gas at a fire,” he explained. “They use a solvent, paint thinner, spray paint, gasoline, put it in a paper bag and breathe in and out and huff it,” Dr. Slovis continued. He told News 2 that inhaling hydrocarbons leads to the feeling of euphoria, but it also destroys brain cells. According to Metro arrest affidavits, Gibson has multiple arrests for huffing. Brandon Gibson (Courtesy: Metro Nashville Police Department) In one instance, he was found unconscious in the woman’s room at a restaurant on 21st Avenue. In 2015, he was being treated at a local hospital for huffing. While there, he asked to go to the bathroom and was caught huffing aerosols he smuggled in his clothes in the hospital restroom. “The big picture in health care is how many diseases, complaints are based on the abuse of things not good for you,” Dr. Slovis told News 2. “Drinking and driving, using drugs, using solvents… It is a huge burden on society, and a huge burden police, fire and EMS,” he added. Gibson faces a long rehab and more charges when he gets out of the burn unit.

In a social media exchange, a few stated that there is not a Black middle class neighborhood in Pittsburgh and some even went as far as saying that there is not a Black middle class in Pittsburgh. Well, contrary to what some believe there is a Black middle class in Pittsburgh. They don’t all live in one neighborhood or on one street, they are spread out throughout the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. Isn’t that something that we fought so hard for? To be able to live where we want to live, as long as we have the money. When someone comes to Pittsburgh from out of town, “the code” can be a little hard to crack. First things first, if you are moving here, 99 percent of the time you are moving here as a professional, not to be a greeter at Walmart, so your primary contacts are going to be White. The realtor will steer you to areas that will have the best resale value because you probably will not be making Pittsburgh your home. Here is where groups like the North Hills Ebony Women and BASH (Black Association of South Hills) come in. For years,  they have embraced Blacks that move into predominately White neighborhoods. If one is a member of the Kappas, Ques, Alphas, AKA’s or Deltas, then you have a brotherhood or sisterhood to help you. Perhaps you will even find a church where you will be embraced, and someone will show you the ins and outs of “Black middle class Pittsburgh.” 1 2Next page » Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION!

Police charged Zachary J. Geiger, 20, of rear 276 Lee Park Ave., after he filed a harassment report against the girl, who said she was pregnant with his child. Geiger told police the girl was 15, but that she told him she was 18, the affidavit said. He told police that after he had sex with the girl, she wouldn't stop contacting him on Facebook, where they met in January, saying she was pregnant. He also told police they had sex at his home, police said. Police interviewed the girl and learned that Geiger lied about where he and the girl had sex and the girl's age, the affidavit said. Geiger is jailed at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility, unable to post $10,000 bail set by Magisterial District Judge Michael Dotzel. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. on March 19.

Local woman Leslie Linquist remarked "Some guys I know might wear stripes or plaid when they dress up, and I've even noticed a few floral prints," referring to the more familiar styles donned by most of the community's male population, "But this dude done took it to a whole nuther level." "He definitely did not buy that shirt anywhere around here," confirmed Wal-Mart Manager Eric Lawson. "You wouldn't find clothes like that on any of our shelves. And don't forget to check out our clearance aisle today, up to 75% off." Some are concerned that Hoey's wardrobe has become radicalized. "That garment was not made in America. You can tell by the extremist needlework," cautioned fabric expert Adele Mikkelson. Ranch Steakhouse owner Joel Elvrum described Mr. Hoey as "kind of quiet, you know, keeps to himself. So it was shocking when he walked into the bar dressed like that. And then he just orders a beer like nothing happened." Sources at city hall revealed that officials are calling for a "total and complete shutdown of men's casual designer shirts…until we can figure out what the hell is going on." At press time, however, Hoey is unrelenting. He says "If they think that shirt was scary, wait till they see my red silk number with the embroidered dragon on it."

Beauty The recent IPO sells cosmetics for less than big brands, and shares could easily rise 25% in the next year. By Jack Hough Biography March 10, 2017 3:07 p.m. ET This week Barron’s argued that shares of SnapChat parent Snap (ticker: SNAP) looked “ridiculously valued” following their initial public offering and could fall 50%. They’ve since slid from $27 to under $23. Like Snap, E.l.f. Beauty (ELF), hereafter Elf, is a recent IPO whose shares have soared and whose users skew young. But the similarities end there. Unlike Snap, Elf is profitable. And it looks like the “fast fashion of beauty,” as Cowen & Company analyst Oliver Chen put it in a Thursday report. In other words,...

Life Buy/Sell The Platform Editorial: Short takes on scouting blues, hot-sauce gunfights and retirement, Jimmy Buffett-style By the Editorial Board Mar 10, 2017 (…) Taxing Americans' patience This week’s marathon hearings that slammed the Republican health care act forward in the U.S. House provided many of the sorts of moments that your civics teacher never warned you about. Sadly, two of them came courtesy of the bistate congressional delegation. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Collinsville, complained during a hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee about mandates in the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act. "What about men having to purchase prenatal care?" Shimkus demanded. The hearing room began to buzz. A puzzled Shimkus said, “I'm just … is that not correct? And should they?" Well, only if you believe in the concept of insurance, where all health care risks are pooled, be it prenatal care or for prostate cancer or heart attacks that men suffer far more often than women. Speaking of women, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Salem, whose district takes in parts of Jefferson County, was concerned about the Affordable Care Act’s tax on tanning salons, which women patronize far more frequently than men. The sun causes more skin cancer than tanning beds, Smith said, “so why have they not proposed a tax on the sun?” Sigh and double-sigh. But the winner of Capitol Hill's “Mr. Warmth Award” goes to Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who went on CNN Tuesday morning to peddle a version of the Republican mantra, “poor Americans need to make smarter choices.” Chaffetz said, “Americans have choices. And they've got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They've got to make those decisions for themselves.” Cost of fancy new iPhone? About $800, plus monthly fees. Cost of individual health policy? About $393 per month, or $4,617 per year, plus if you actually need the policy, deductibles of about $4,000 a year. Triple sigh.  Hankering for a thin mint? Then don't go to the O’Fallon, Mo., Walmart, which has yanked the welcome mat for all forms of solicitation, including Girl Scout troops selling cookies, following an altercation at the store. Girl Scouts were not involved in the disturbance. Forbidding solicitors at popular locations is detrimental to groups that depend on community support to help finance their undertakings. Last summer, the Schnuck supermarket chain was criticized when it banned solicitors as a labor union dispute simmered. The chain later allowed Salvation Army bell ringers at area stores. A spokeswoman for Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri said participating in the cookie program helps girls develop leadership and life skills. The Walmart decision adds up to disappointed cooker sellers, as well as buyers. All wrong at Eat-Rite The unfortunate story this week about James Bommarito, 51, prompts the question of which is worse if your father owns Tony’s, the only former five-star restaurant in town: Eating at the Eat-Rite Diner? Getting into a dispute over passing the hot sauce? Shooting a patron in the face while rolling around fighting on the diner’s parking lot at 4 a.m.? An even better question is why Bommarito wasn’t charged in the fracas until Wednesday, three months after the shooting occurred, as reported by the Post-Dispatch’s Christine Byers. The Clayton man was charged with first-degree assault, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon. Flip-flops not optional Never has the lyric “wastin’ away again in Margaritaville” seemed so ominous. Jimmy Buffett, the bard of beach bums, is opening a chain of retirement communities to be called Latitude Margaritaville — named after his signature song "Margaritaville" (which, sorry, will now be playing in your head all day). What’s next? The Rolling Stones present “Satisfaction Estates”? Buffett, 70, already has a chain of hotels and resorts popular with aging Parrotheads. So why not give them a place to live out their retirement years, complete with all the Del Boca Vista amenities like golf, tennis, shuffleboard, pools and neighbors like Morty Seinfeld. The first 7,000-home community will open this fall in Daytona Beach. Units start in the low $200s. You have to be at least 55 to qualify, but why would anyone under 55 want to? If you build it, they will come We’ve gotten so used to lamenting the steady flight of major corporations from the St. Louis central business district to the suburbs that we did a double take when reading the news that Microsoft is moving out of its CityPlace office in Creve Coeur to open shop in the Central West End. Even better, the company will boost its existing 60-employee staff to a total of 150 in its new offices. Microsoft will be the anchor tenant at a new $55 million, 180,000-square-foot complex in the Cortex technology district. The move marks a “remarkable vote of confidence and validation” for Cortex, says Hank Webber, the Cortex board chair and vice chancellor at Washington University. As the Post-Dispatch’s Jacob Barker reported Thursday, the district also will see a new 150-room Aloft hotel. It would have been sweeter to celebrate this as a clean recognition by investors that St. Louis is attracting business based entirely on its merits and allure as a technology hub. But, alas, a $9.5 million tax increment financing deal appears to be what sealed the deal. Either way, St. Louis emerges a winner.  Tags James Bommarito Aloft Hotel Nicola Thorpe Margaritaville Company Politics Economics Law Financing St. Louis Commerce View (…) comments Opinion Features Read Letters to the Editor Submit a Letter to the Editor How to submit an opinion article (op-ed) From the Post-Dispatch's archives Found on St. Louis Post Dispatch powered by Newspapers.com Follow the Platform Most popular Ferguson Market owner disputes new Michael Brown documentary SLU medical school put on probation by accreditation agency Ferguson Market disputes claims as new Michael Brown documentary prompts new protest Ferguson video about death of Michael Brown rekindles unrest, arrests Is everything we thought we knew about the Michael Brown shooting really wrong?

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. We've all been there: You follow a recipe to the T, pop your masterpiece in the oven and then... you have to tinker with timing to get it cooked properly. Not only is this incredibly annoying, but it's also a telltale sign that your oven isn't heating the way it should. The result? Anything from frustratingly burnt cookies to an underdone Thanksgiving turkey. Luckily, there's a simple way to tell the true temperature of your oven: the humble oven thermometer. But not all oven thermometers are created equal. We put eight of the top products to the test and found that some do the job better than others when it comes to measuring temperature accurately—and also when it comes to smart design. Read on to find which thermometers are worth your consideration, and which aren't worth a second look.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney) Admetior Oven Thermometer Best Overall This is an efficient, straight-forward thermometer that meets right at the intersection of great functionality and visual appeal. The no-frills model reported temperatures with great accuracy and responded quickly to any changes in heat. A temperature gauge that starts at 50° F ensures that you can see the needle move even at room temperature. It's effortless to hang on the oven rack, and although the face is small, it's easy to read thanks to clear, bold print and distinct tick marks. Where to Buy: $8.99 at Amazon  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney) Taylor Large Dial Oven Thermometer Best Value This thermometer has one of the largest faces of the lot, with large tick marks and a gradated color wheel that makes it a breeze to read through an oven window. Beyond that, it has both front and side hanging orientation, as well as a stable base for standing, so that you can position it wherever and however you like. Though it wasn't the most responsive or accurate model we tested, its appealing aesthetics and inexpensive price make up for any shortcomings. If ease of use and a good value are most important to you, this is our recommendation. Where to Buy: $2.84 at Amazon $5.74 at Walmart Farberware Protek Classic Oven Thermometer This Farberware model blew competition out of the water with its ability to accurately report changing temperatures, but its appearance leaves something to be desired. While the color coding was nice (blue for cool, red for warm), the narrow numbers made it difficult to read when it's inside the oven. However, it was the most responsive to temperature changes out of all the thermometers we tested, so it may be worth the squint. Where to Buy: $7.90 at Amazon Polder Oven Thermometer While this Polder is very accurate, it's not great at detecting changes in heat. This means that while you may initially get a precise read on your oven's temperature, you won't be terribly privy to variation in temperature. We found the face difficult to read, with very small type and a confusingly busy interface. This wasn't the best thermometer we tested by any means, but you could do worse. Where to Buy: $3.99 at Amazon $7.49 at Walmart Taylor TruTemp Thermometer The TruTemp is a fine middle-of-the-road pick. It's easy to read when it's in the oven, and the red/blue color dial helps with visibility. We found it moderately accurate and responsive when it came to detecting precise temperatures, and while the side hook didn't fit on our oven rack, the front hook and base stand worked fine. We could take it or leave it. Where to Buy: $2.37 at Amazon $3.18 at Walmart $2.49 at WebstaurantStore $2.20 at KaTom Restaurant Supply Rubbermaid Oven Thermometer This product is visually cluttered; the tick marks are sized and spaced oddly, making it confusing to read. However, it proved fairly accurate at reporting temperature and was the most responsive thermometer of the bunch. If you plan to make a dish with a lot of temperature variation, this may be the best pick for you. Where to Buy: $6.36 at Amazon $6.36 at Walmart OXO Good Grips Oven Thermometer Sorry OXO, but we hated this one. As soon as we put it in the oven, it became extremely difficult to read due to a semi-opaque face that made the numbers hard to see. It couldn't stand in the oven and was tough to hang, continuously wobbling before settling in a crooked position. As far as performance goes, it proved wildly inaccurate and woefully unresponsive. Don't be fooled by the brand notoriety—just put this one back on the shelf. Where to Buy: $13.95 at Amazon $25.99 at Walmart CDN Pro Accurate Oven Thermometer Stay away from this CDN thermometer. Not only did it flunk our accuracy tests, but it's also oddly tall, making it difficult to read when it's inside the oven. The temperature gauge doesn't begin until 150° F, so it's tough to discern where the needle is pointing while you're baking. Lastly, its side hook didn't even fit on our oven rack. With no major redeeming qualities, we'd recommend you stay away.

Marijuana vending machine company Medbox and its founder were charged this week with tricking investors by using a secret shell company to create "bogus" sales. Medbox bragged in press releases about "record" profits and claimed to be a leader in the marijuana industry, authorities said. And in a May 2013 Bloomberg BusinessWeek article, Medbox was profiled as the marijuana vending machine company "plans to be the Walmart of weed." In reality, nearly 90% of its quarterly revenue once stemmed from "sham transactions," according to a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint. Medbox founder and majority shareholder Vincent Mehdizadeh allegedly orchestrated the scheme and then used the proceeds to buy a luxury home in California's Pacific Palisades. The SEC said Mehdizadeh installed his then-fiancee Yocelin Legaspi as CEO of New-Age Investment Consulting, a shell company that carried out "illegal stock sales" used to inflate Medbox's revenue. "The only thing we are really good at is public company publicity and stock awareness," Mehdizadeh said in a text message, cited in the complaint. "We get an A+ for creating revenue off sheer will," the Medbox founder and chief operating officer allegedly wrote. Mehdizadeh and Medbox, which has since changed its name to Notis Global, agreed to a settlement, which is pending court approval. As part of the settlement, Mehdizadeh must pay more than $12 million in ill-gotten profits and penalties. He also agreed to be barred from serving as a public company officer or director. "Investors were misled into believing that Medbox was a leader in the burgeoning marijuana industry when the company was just round-tripping money from illegal stock sales to boost revenue," Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, said in a statement. Mehdizadeh said in a statement that he decided to settle without admitting or denying the allegations "for peace of mind and so that I could move on with my life" following a three-year investigation. He said he didn't read the SEC's complaint and doesn't plan to, adding, "They have their version of what happened and I have mine." Mehdizadeh said his attorneys are in the process of filing a complaint against previous legal counsel for providing incompetent advice related to his work at Medbox. Notis Global didn't respond to a request for comment nor did its lawyer. Legal action continues against Legaspi and former Medbox CEO Bruce Bedrick, who the SEC said was "complicit in the scheme" and also personally profited off it. The Medbox charges are the latest in a series of red flags about the risks of investing in marijuana-related penny stocks. In 2014, the SEC suspended trading in five different pot-related stocks due to "potential illegal activity." At the time, the SEC sent an investor alert warning about the risk of "fraudsters" spreading false information about marijuana companies to enrich themselves while "creating losses for unsuspecting investors." Investors also need to navigate complex political risks. Pot stocks took a hit after the Trump administration signaled last month it plans to get tough on marijuana. White House press secretary recently promised "greater enforcement" of federal marijuana laws. Innovative Industrial Properties, a NYSE-listed company that buys buildings and leases them to growers of medical marijuana, has lost 15% of its value so far this year after going public in 2016. Lawyers representing Bedrick and Legaspi didn't respond to requests for comments. --CNNMoney's Aaron Smith contributed to this report. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 March 2017 by Military News Keep Genesee County Beautiful Partners with Keep America Beautiful for School-Based Recycling Education in Flint Schools SOURCE: Keep America Beautiful DESCRIPTION: Keep America Beautiful and its local Flint, Michigan, affiliate Keep Genesee County Beautiful recently announced the launch of an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 school students affected by the Flint water crisis. The comprehensive recycling education program, funded by The Coca-Cola Company, Nestlè Waters North America, the PepsiCo Foundation and the Walmart Foundation, brings Keep America Beautiful’s pre-kindergarten through college educational resources and supplemental curriculum materials to Flint schools in an effort to increase the capture of water bottles for recycling. Designed using Keep America Beautiful’s proven behavior-change methodology, the educational activities and resources teach the fundamentals of litter prevention; preserving our resources; responsible solid waste management; and how to reduce, reuse and recycle.   Keep America Beautiful had worked in tandem with KGCB to tailor the recycling educational lesson plans, tools and activities for Flint’s students, while ongoing recycling education and program implementation will be conducted by KGCB staff and area educational partners. The program offers one educational kit per school, which includes ready-to-use classroom lessons, activities and games for each grade that align with state and national educational standards as well as the Flint Community School’s curriculum. Resources include take-home materials in an effort to bring the school education and experience home, reaching families in their residences to also enhance curbside recycling participation. The educational program was initiated a year after The Coca-Cola Company, Nestlè Waters North America, PepsiCo and the Walmart Foundation began donating up to 6.5 million bottles of safe and clean drinking water to Flint school students in response to the water crisis in that community. From the outset of the program, they have been providing for the storage and delivery of the bottled water, as well as the transporting of the empty water bottles for recycling.

(AP) — A former pastor from New Jersey has been ordered to stand trial on charges that he tried to choke an infant girl he didn’t know at a Kansas City-area Wal-Mart. The Kansas City Star reports a judge in Kansas’ Johnson County ordered 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych to be tried on charges of aggravated battery, aggravated kidnapping and battery. Monquisha Hill testified Thursday she was in the checkout line last October with her then-4-month-old daughter in a car seat in a cart when a man she didn’t know took the infant from her cart and began choking her.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Two Freeport men accused of theft Friday Mar 10, 2017 at 1:07 PM Mar 10, 2017 at 1:31 PM Derrick Mason Staff writer FREEPORT — Freeport police have one man in custody and are looking for another in an alleged theft. Officers went to Horizon Liquor Store, 27 South Walnut Ave., around 2 p.m. Wednesday after a man reported his plastic Wal-Mart bag filled with $1,500 in cash and $150 worth of lottery tickets were taken. The man said he was in the gaming portion of the store when he noticed his bag was not where he had last placed it, Freeport Police Sgt. Chris Shenberger said. Police reviewed surveillance film and identified that Joshua Williams, 38, had allegedly been in the gaming area and talked to the victim about 10 minutes before the items went missing. Williams commented that the man needed to be careful with his bag of money, Shenberger said. Williams exited the liquor store and met with Michael Sanders, 39, Shenberger said. Williams then re-entered the liquor store with Sanders behind him. Williams distracted the victim, turning him away from the bag of money as he allegedly pointed to the bag for Sanders to grab, Shenberger said. The pair soon left the store. Williams was arrested and charged with theft with a prior conviction. His bond is set at $25,000. Police are looking for Sanders and have a felony arrest warrant for him. His bond is also $25,000, Shenberger said. Anyone with information should call the Freeport Police Department at 815-235-8222, Stephenson County Crime Stop at 815-235-7867 or Stateline Area Crimestoppers at 866-847-7669.

Ashia Christine Huddleston, 29, was booked into the Jefferson County Jail at 8:30 a.m. Friday on a probation violation charge to which she pleaded guilty in 2013. She was arrested in August 2016  in the slaying of 49-year-old Tammy Huddleston, but was ultimately released on $250,000 pending trial. She is now being held without bond. The slaying happened on an August Saturday morning in the Bessemer Walmart parking lot. Witnesses told police the mother and daughter were in a physical dispute that ended in Tammy Huddleston's stabbing death. According to an affidavit in the case, "Ashia was being very disrespectful to her mother and a physical altercation begin in which Tammy slapped her daughter and the two began to fight. The witness stated that Tammy was stabbed in the stomach by Ashia but he did not immediately realize that she was wounded. The witness state that the argument was over Ashia's drug use and her inability to care for her kids." The daughter fled the scene with her boyfriend in a blue Nissan Versa after the stabbing. Tammy Huddleston died overnight Saturday at UAB Hospital from a stab wound to her side. The victim's son witnessed the slaying. The U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force and Bessemer police arrested Ashia Christine Huddleston, who also goes by the name Ashia Fletcher, several days later. She was taken into custody at the intersection of Johns Road and Mud Creek Road in Adger. The murder case has not yet been set for trial. Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

Medbox founder and majority shareholder Vincent Mehdizadeh allegedly orchestrated the scheme and then used the proceeds to buy a luxury home in California’s Pacific Palisades. The SEC said Mehdizadeh installed his then-fiancee Yocelin Legaspi as CEO of New-Age Investment Consulting, a shell company that carried out “illegal stock sales” used to inflate Medbox’s revenue. “The only thing we are really good at is public company publicity and stock awareness,” Mehdizadeh said in a text message, cited in the complaint. “We get an A+ for creating revenue off sheer will,” the Medbox founder and chief operating officer allegedly wrote. Mehdizadeh and Medbox, which has since changed its name to Notis Global, agreed to a settlement, which is pending court approval. As part of the settlement, Mehdizadeh must pay more than $12 million in ill-gotten profits and penalties. He also agreed to be barred from serving as a public company officer or director. “Investors were misled into believing that Medbox was a leader in the burgeoning marijuana industry when the company was just round-tripping money from illegal stock sales to boost revenue,” Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC’s Los Angeles Regional Office, said in a statement. Mehdizadeh said in a statement that he decided to settle without admitting or denying the allegations “for peace of mind and so that I could move on with my life” following a three-year investigation. He said he didn’t read the SEC’s complaint and doesn’t plan to, adding, “They have their version of what happened and I have mine.” Mehdizadeh said his attorneys are in the process of filing a complaint against previous legal counsel for providing incompetent advice related to his work at Medbox. Notis Global didn’t respond to a request for comment nor did its lawyer. Legal action continues against Legaspi and former Medbox CEO Bruce Bedrick, who the SEC said was “complicit in the scheme” and also personally profited off it. The Medbox charges are the latest in a series of red flags about the risks of investing in marijuana-related penny stocks. In 2014, the SEC suspended trading in five different pot-related stocks due to “potential illegal activity.” At the time, the SEC sent an investor alert warning about the risk of “fraudsters” spreading false information about marijuana companies to enrich themselves while “creating losses for unsuspecting investors.” Investors also need to navigate complex political risks. Pot stocks took a hit after the Trump administration signaled last month it plans to get tough on marijuana. White House press secretary recently promised “greater enforcement” of federal marijuana laws. Innovative Industrial Properties, a NYSE-listed company that buys buildings and leases them to growers of medical marijuana, has lost 15% of its value so far this year after going public in 2016. Lawyers representing Bedrick and Legaspi didn’t respond to requests for comments. –CNNMoney’s Aaron Smith contributed to this report.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 10, 2017 at 12:45PM The evidence speaks for itself: Investing in winning dividend growth stocks is a well-worn path to long-term investment success. It's for precisely this reason that investors often place dividend aristocrats -- companies that have grown their payouts for 25 consecutive years -- at the heart of their income investing goals. Given their popularity, though, dividend aristocrat stocks often, but not always, trade at a premium to the broader market. In this article, we will explore the reasons that make Target (NYSE:TGT) and Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) two of the cheapest dividend aristocrats on the market today. Target: P/E of 10 On the face of it, Target appears patently undervalued, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. This also serves as a useful reminder that such isolated statistics are only so useful in forming investment decisions. In fact, Target shares have sagged dramatically over the last 12 months thanks to the company's faulty strategy in the face of increased adoption of e-commerce. TGT data by YCharts. Target signaled that it finally plans to prioritize e-commerce going forward after incorrectly emphasizing smaller stores in urban areas in recent years. However, the transition will be marked with potential pitfalls. Amazon.com's e-commerce empire has never been stronger, and larger retail rivals like Wal-Mart have already made significant investments on their own online sales channels. By contrast, Target said it expects non-GAAP earnings per share to fall by as much as 24% in the coming year.  Target has raised its dividend annually for the past 49 years, and its relatively healthy capital structure and cash flow characteristics should enable this trend to remain intact in the near term. However, Target finds itself in a fight to its future today. Depending on your view of its ability to successfully manage that transition, Target's rock-bottom valuation should be viewed as a sign of the current dire straits in which it finds itself today. Image source: Getty Images. Abbvie: P/E of 17 If investors are intrigued by Abbvie's P/E ratio of 17, its forward P/E of a mere 10 should have investors salivating. Its 4% dividend yield certainly doesn't hurt either, particularly considering the company's vaunted history of dividend growth. Abbvie and its predecessors collectively increased the company's cash payouts for 44 consecutive years. And unlike Target, whose current business struggles explain its cheap valuation, Abbvie's steep discount to the market strikes me as a legitimate opportunity for investors today. The company's compelling portfolio of current medications should provide a tailwind for Abbvie sales for year to come. Among them, the company controls Humira, the world's best-selling drug. The drug continues to demonstrate impressive growth, with 2016 sales rising 16% to eclipse $16 billion. Better still, the company's flagship medication should enjoy at least several more years of insulation from potential competitors; analysts see sales declines beginning somewhere between 2018 and 2020, though estimates vary by analysts. Better still, Abbvie enjoys a strong pipeline to fill the void if, or when, current blockbusters like Humira suffer from generic competition. The company says it has 12 late-stage clinical trials currently under way, with another 21 drugs in the mid-stage of development. Analysts see significant commercial potential among at least a few candidates in its current pipeline. Turning to its financials, increased interest and income tax expenses weighed on Abbvie's financial performance in its most recently reported quarter. Barring that one, fairly minor operational hiccup, the outlook for the company remains undeniably bright in the years to come. Analysts see Abbvie sales increasing 8.6% this year, and 9.2% next year. Its own adjusted EPS projections suggest its bottom-line profits will rise 13.9% at their mid-point next year. So, nearly anyway you slice it, Abbvie seems like an attractive buy for dividend growth investors interested in big pharma stocks. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The milestone was achieved only 24 trading days after the Dow first reached 20,000. The only time in history the Dow passed a 1,000 point milestone in as few days was during the dot-com boom. The DJIA is a price-weighted average of 30 large American companies. Fluctuations in the Dow often reflect overall market conditions. In addition, because it is one of the oldest market indices, it is regularly used to compare markets over time. 24/7 Wall St. determined the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year since 1929, the first full year the index contained 30 companies. Click here to see the value of the stock market the year you were born. The companies comprising the Dow are picked by the editors of The Wall Street Journal as Charles Dow, the creator of the index, was also the founding editor of the publication. Since its inception in 1896, when only 12 companies comprised the average, the Dow has changed 51 times. The index currently contains companies such as Walmart, Disney, J.P. Morgan, Boeing, and the newest member as of 2015, Apple. The only company remaining from the original list of 12 is General Electric. Like the economy as a whole, the stock market is much larger today than it was in 1917. However, the Dow has experienced extreme swings over the course of its history. One of the most notable events in the history of the often-referenced index is the lows during the Great Depression. The Dow started 1929 at an inflation-adjusted level of 4,274.94 points. In October of that year, the Dow lost nearly one-quarter of its value in just two days. The Dow reached its lowest point on July 8, 1932, with an adjusted value of 725.90 points — only 17% of its value at the start of 1929. After the historic low, the Dow soared by close to 70% in 1933, the largest single year growth in the history of the Dow 30. Still, the Dow did not return to its pre-Great Depression level until the mid 1950s. There have been several more dramatic stock market swings since the Great Depression. The largest single day drop in the index’s history occurred during a stock market crash on October 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 22.6%. The Dow’s value doubled between 1995 and 1999 during the dot-com boom, only to collapse between 2000 and 2002. Relatively soon after, the Dow lost nearly a third of its value in 2008, after the financial crisis emerged in the summer of 2007. To determine the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the daily Dow figures aggregated by economic research website MeasuringWorth.com. Historical Dow data are inflation-adjusted using annual headline CPI. This is the value of the stock market the year you were born.

Today we have a video that may make you down right sick. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. Outside an Englewood, Florida Walmart there was another case of someone mixing up their car’s pedals. The elderly woman responsible left with more than just a fender bender when she accidentally slammed on the accelerator though. She managed to end up on top of another car in the parking lot. Even worse, the victim turned out to be a 1959 Corvette in near mint condition (I just cringed typing that). Corvette lovers may want to look away. I have to give the owner here a tremendous amount of credit. He handled the entire situation very calmly. Part of that may be because yelling at a grandmother doesn’t help your case, but he did just have his classic car wrecked by a Ford Fusion. Personally, I’d consider any reaction to this situation excusable. It’s hard to tell the exact amount of damage, but we can at least tell the driver’s side door and paneling is crushed. Hopefully the repairs don’t put a hole in your pocket, sir. And if they do, who cares if the kids have to wait a few extra years to apply for college. Nothing beats a vintage Vette!

Hammond Jim Miles Paul Craig Roberts David Swanson Select Page The Dismal Economic Outlook For The New Year By Paul Craig Roberts | Jan 7, 2012 | News & Analysis, US | 4 | The Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C. Jobs offshoring, financial deregulation, and ten years of wars have severely damaged the US economy and the economic prospects of 90% of the American population. The signs are everywhere in front of our eyes. They are in the income distribution data, the BLS jobs data, the Census data, the poverty figures, and the high number of food stamp recipients. The signs are in the foreclosed and boarded up homes and the accompanying homelessness. They are in closed strip malls, in office building, warehouse, and shopping mall vacancies, and in the huge population losses of America’s manufacturing cities. The Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C. The New Economy was a hoax, like Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction” and the “war on terror.”  Americans were deceived by “their” corrupt government, by greed-driven corporations, and by corporate shills among economists and the pundit class into believing that they were trading middle class “dirty fingernail” jobs in manufacturing for better middle class “clean fingernail” high-tech service jobs.  Instead, reasonably paid manufacturing and professional skill jobs, such as software engineering and information technology, were traded for lowly paid jobs as waitresses and bartenders and for jobs in ambulatory health care. Consequently, real median US income fell for the vast majority of the population.  To keep consumers spending when they had no raises, the Federal Reserve used low interest rates to create a real estate and credit bubble.  The low interest rates drove up housing prices, and Americans refinanced their mortgages and spent the equity in their homes. Americans maxed out credit cards. The rise in consumer indebtedness kept consumer demand growing and the economy afloat. But there is a limit to how far debt can outpace income, and the bubble burst.  And when it burst the financial fraud that had been hidden in the euphoria was revealed.  That set off the financial crisis. As the US government is controlled by financial and armaments interests and not by the people, the government responded to the financial crisis by shoveling more debt and more hardships on the American people in order that financial interests did not have to pay for their own mistakes and crimes.  Instead of blaming the responsible parties, “our” government handed the bill to the American people. An important part of the bill is the huge number of new dollars being created in order to keep “banks too big to fail” afloat and in order to finance the federal government’s enormous budget deficit from its illegal wars. Sooner or later, the proliferation of dollars will cost the American people sharply higher prices. We will return to the dollar crisis later in this column. First, let’s look at what the loss of manufacturing and manufacturing related jobs have done to the economy and the prospects of US citizens. In the first decade of the 21st century, Detroit, Michigan, lost 25% of its population.  Gary, Indiana, lost 22%. Flint, Michigan, lost 18%. Cleveland, Ohio, lost 17%.  In St. Louis, Missouri, 19% of the housing is vacant. These population losses were not the result of the Black Plague or killer viruses or a nuclear attack.  They were the result of corporate CEOs, pushed by their own greed, by the greed of Wall Street and that of large retailers such as Wal-Mart, aided and abetted by “our” government, into moving millions of manufacturing, software engineering, information technology, engineering, research, development, and design jobs offshore. The process of moving American jobs offshore left cities, counties, and states with shrunken tax base. The resulting state and local budget deficits are being used to dismantle public sector unions and to cut social services. Public assets, such as water companies, and future income streams from parking meters, toll roads and bridges, are being sold off to foreign buyers in order to insure another year of local and state government solvency. In the first decade of the 21st century, Americans lost 5,500,000 manufacturing jobs. US employment in the manufacture of computer and electronic products fell by 40%; in the production of machinery by 30%, in motor vehicles and parts by 44%, and in the manufacture of clothing by 66%. In other words, in ten years the US economy was decimated by jobs offshoring for the sole purpose of higher rewards to capital in the form of multi-million dollar executive bonuses and large shareholder capital gains. A few hedge fund executives were paid a billion dollars in annual renumeration and a couple of dozen of them were paid $500 million in annual compensation.  What sense does that make? Huge fortunes paid for one year’s work, not in productive activity but in destroying the financial system and the value of pensions that tens of millions of Americans had worked their lives to achieve. While this was happening, “our” government squandered several trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan on wars based on lies and deception. The American people were lied to and deceived, and continue to be, in order that arms industries can enjoy record profits and in order that crazed neoconservative war criminals could pursue their ideology of world hegemony and empire. We were even lied to about US war casualties. As Dennis Loo points out in his book, Globalization and the Demolition of Society (2011), the 4,801 Americans killed in action in Iraq leaves out the 50,000 suicides of veterans and active duty US troops. The truth of the matter is that the casualties of the Iraq war are as high as those of the Vietnam war. With all income gains redirected to the financial and war sectors, the distribution of income in the US has become, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the worst of all developed countries. The Central Intelligence Agency—yes, the CIA—concluded that America had achieved not only the worst income distribution of all developed countries but also a worst income distribution than Iran, Cambodia, Uganda, Nicaragua, Russia, and China. The economic “recovery” that Washington and the financial press hype is all talk and no reality. The “recovery” is produced by understating the inflation rate, which overstates GDP growth, and by dropping the long-term unemployed out of the measurement of unemployment. An economy, the driving engine of which has been moved offshore, cannot recover unless the economy is brought back home, and that requires the repeal of Globalism. Overstatement is common in order to produce good news, but eventually it catches up with the spinmeisters. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that it had overstated home sales by 3.5 million.  Statistician John Williams (shadowstats.com) reports that the “birth/death” model, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to estimate the net effect on jobs data of unreported business closures and new start-ups, overstates the annual number of new jobs during troubled economic times by approximately one million jobs annually. Each year the accumulated monthly overstatements are quietly revised away by BLS. Similarly, data can be understated in order to hide bad news. The understatement of inflation results from basing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on substitution rather than on a fixed basket of goods, the traditional method.  During the “progressive” Clinton regime, a deceptive change was made to the CPI. If the price of a good rises, for example, sirloin steak, the higher price does not appear in the index. Instead, the CPI assumes that consumers switch from sirloin to a cheaper cut, such as round steak. Thus, the rise in prices is negated by substituting goods that represent a lower standard of living. By understating inflation, the government has been able to produce a “recovery,” when in fact the positive economic growth number is created by counting inflation or nominal GDP growth as real GDP growth. John Williams says that when inflation is measured in the old way, prior to Clinton, the US has experienced essentially no real GDP growth in the 21st century. In other words, we have had a decade of essentially no growth in the GDP while the presstitutes in the media proclaim “recovery.” The government’s forecasts of its budget deficits are based on the assumption that an economic recovery is underway. If in fact there is no recovery and the economy is about to worsen, the trillion dollar plus deficits that the government forecasts for as far as the eye can see will be even larger. As more debt creation likely means more money creation by the Federal Reserve, the future purchasing power of the US dollar appears to be dismal. The federal government’s reckless issuance of debt in order to finance its hegemonic wars and the Federal Reserve’s misuse of its authority to create $16.1 trillion in secret loans to US and European banks (as revealed by the GAO audit of the Fed) have created an enormous number of new dollars.  In addition, financial deregulation has resulted in banks creating paper claims on real assets that far exceed the value of the underlying real assets.  This is an untenable situation.  How is it likely to be resolved? This is a two-part question: there is the banks’ debt and there is the federal government’s debt. Both are serious problems. Mortgage-backed derivatives exceed the value of the homes, and Credit Default Swaps and other financial innovations have resulted in the paper claims on assets exceeding the value of the underlying real assets. Consider Credit Default Swaps, a form of unreserved “insurance.” Investors, really speculators, do not have to own a Greek government bond or a mortgage-backed derivative in order to purchase a “swap” that insures its value. Thus, the total value of swaps issued on Greek bonds, for example, can far exceed the total value of Greek bonds. The value of swaps issued on mortgage-backed securities can exceed the total value of mortgaged real estate. Financial institutions, such as US banks, which sold “swaps” on Greek bonds were gambling that Greece would be bailed out and would not default.  The financial institutions regarded as gravy the fees paid to them for “guarantees” on which they cannot make good.  I don’t know the extent of swaps on sovereign debt, but I recently saw a report that the Bank of America alone has sold $2.1 trillion in swaps on sovereign debt. Imagine the crisis if the Bank of America had to pay off these swaps. Obviously, if European sovereign debt blows up, the US financial crisis will become deeper. The GAO audit of the Federal Reserve showed that the Fed made secret loans to banks of $16.1 trillion between December 2007 and June 2010.  To put that figure in perspective, it is larger than the US GDP and larger than the US public debt.  In other words, it took a tremendous amount of new money to keep the financial system from collapsing. Despite this huge sum pumped into the banking system, the banks are still regarded as weak and troubled. The insecurity of bank depositors is reflected in the one basis point interest rate on Treasury bill money funds. Many Americans are willing to receive a negative interest rate in order to have their money in instruments that can be paid off with newly created money. When the paper claims on assets exceed the value of the underlying assets, one solution could be slow write downs of bad paper over time as the banks’ profits permit. This would require suspending the mark-to-market rule and permitting the banks to remain “solvent” by counting bad assets as good until profits permitted write-downs. This would be a sensible solution if the banks have profitable prospects. But with consumers too indebted and broke to borrow and the consumer market too impaired for good sales prospects for businesses, what profitable prospects do banks have? Only those created by the Federal Reserve’s support of the “carry trade,” the ability of financial institutions to borrow from the Federal Reserve at essentially zero interest rates and to put the money in Greek and Italian sovereign debt. This is gambling, otherwise known as “casino banking.” If reality rules out the solution of gradual write-downs, all that remains is bankruptcy or inflation.  The Federal Reserve and the US government have ruled out permitting the banks to fail.  That leaves inflation. Except for a relatively few indexed Treasury bonds, financial instruments are in nominal values.  Thus bad debts can be inflated away by driving up the nominal values of the underlying real assets and the nominal values of wages and salaries.  It seems that the path that policymakers are taking is to reduce the purchasing power of money in order to drive up nominal asset values so that they exceed the claims against them. For example, consider a person with a $200,000 mortgage whose home, if he could sell it, is only worth $175,000.  This person’s asset is under water. However, if inflation drives up the price of his home to $250,000, the person has gone from a balance sheet $25,000 in the red to one $50,000 in the black.  It seems clear that in order to save the financial institutions and itself, the government will sacrifice the purchasing power of the dollar. Thus, the same solution appears to be in effect for the government’s growing debt. For the moment the US dollar is benefitting from flight from the euro due to the hyped sovereign debt crisis in Europe. As in the past, a scared financial world takes refuge in the dollar and in US Treasury debt instruments. The main difference between Greece’s indebtedness and America’s is that Greece cannot print euros, but the US can print dollars. Thus holders of US debt can always get back the nominal dollar value of Treasury debt issues. Of course, the real purchasing power of these printed dollars can be very low. The dollar as a refuge is a short-run phenomenon. Once the transfer out of euros into dollars has occurred, how does the Treasury sell the next round of bonds to finance trillion dollar deficits?  Sooner or later the Federal Reserve will be back to monetizing the new Treasury bond issues, that is, the Federal Reserve will create new money with which to purchase the new Treasury bond issues. Sooner or later the new money will find its way into the economy and drive up prices, or the continual monetization of new US Treasury debt will cause the world to lose confidence in the dollar.  Heavy sales of US dollars in currency markets would drive down the exchange value of the dollar and raise the prices of imports such as energy, manufactured goods, and food.  Either way inflation is the result.  Indeed, both can occur together, which is the likely result. Normally, inflation is associated with a booming economy, but as too much of the US economy has been moved offshore, there is little left to boom other than prices. Therefore, the combination of high inflation with high unemployment is a likely fate that awaits Americans. I cannot predict how long policymakers can hold economic armageddon at bay with spin, money creation, currency swaps, intervention in gold and silver markets, and outright lies. The onset could be sudden and take place this year, but we shouldn’t underestimate the power of spin over a gullible public that trusts “their” government and fervently believes that Muslim terrorists are out to get them and that the demise of the Constitution, the product of a eight hundred year struggle that produced Anglo-American civil liberty, is worth the price of “safety.” There is no safety in a police state and a debauched currency. The comfortable world that Americans have known is falling apart at the seams. This article was originally published at PaulCraigRoberts.org.

This, like Rome, must surely mean the end of the Western world as we know it. As though the greater Middle East is not enough fodder for the US, it is now putting its feet into Asia, AGAIN. I would have thought that with vietnam still fresh in our minds, Obama would refrain from stepping into that region again. But the white supremist psyche is strong and needs to be fed. We watch in morbid anticipation of the senseless expenditure of man and weapons in conflicts that need not happen. It must be true that whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. Robert Barrows To add even more perspective to the consequences of outsourcing so much of our manufacturing to other countries, you might also want to read a poem called “It used to be made in America.” You can see it online at http://www.itusedtobemadeinamerica.com -Robert Barrows, San Mateo, CA Cathy Donabedian So sad,but all of this was predicted years ago. When you decouple man from the natural law and he becomes a materialistic zombie , the result is the sick society that we have today. Politics and economic activity are reflective of the populace. We vote ourselves other people’s money. Entertainment and sports are the new religions. We mock virtue. Either there will be another ‘Great Awakening’ or we’ll be in a death spiral. What’s a body to do? Concentrate on getting out of debt. Stockpile non-perishable food, water, and some other emergency supplies. Parents of school age children should homeschool them if at all possible. ( One of the main reasons high tech jobs have been outsourced is the fraudulent education system.Thank you teachers unions! ) And then, pray as if your lives depend upon it. They do. Person I know that only a Civilized, Educated, and Humane society can be in a position to act wisely and especially calmly; so as to understand that these things need to be said as the Only way to restore the Economy, and create the jobs that all People need and are entitled to. Unless the European Union is sufficiently Civilized, Educated, and Humane, they will not be able to handle the cure for the disease of the Euro Zone, because they will not be intelligent enough or forgiving enough to for that, and so I understand if the Web Site realises this, and removes this comment. I was asked at another Web Site to provide evidence for what I think I cannot provide evidence for, and so it can only remain a genuinely held opinion, but I will provide a Method for finding any evidence for my opinion. It is my honest opinion that Many European Union Politicians are the Puppets of German Banks, and that they have Voluntarily Agreed to be Secretly Filmed in Acts of Bestiality, and in some instances they have Voluntarily Agreed to be Secretly Filmed in Acts of Paedophilia to ensure their continued Puppetship to their Fourth Reich Puppet Masters. I will give my reasons why I think this is the way it is at the end of the comment, and I have already published that elsewhere, but I want to give my Method for finding any evidence. The first thing I need to say, is, that because none of the People involved in this matter will ever Confess willingly, and that is the only credible evidence that can be said to be evidence, if it is Confessed without any duress or compulsion. The Euro Banksters and Plutocrats who find the Puppet Politicians and make the Films, will not volunteer to give them to the Public, and because they Rule their part of the World, and so, unless they stumble upon them accidentally, no one can find these Secret Films of Puppet Politicians who have Voluntarily Agreed to be Secretly Filmed in Acts of Bestiality, and in some instances they have Voluntarily Agreed to be Secretly Filmed in Acts of Paedophilia to ensure their continued Puppetship to their Fourth Reich Banskter Puppet Masters. If a former Puppet Politician were to confess, then People could accuse that former Puppet Politician of being paid Money to lie. We know that if a lie is repeated often enough, then most People will believe it, and they will act on that belief, regardless of the fact that it is a lie. The Unprincipled have used this Proven Method to manipulate People, and even today, Many Americans believe that Saddam Hussein was behind the September 11 2001 attacks, even though the have been told that Saddam Hussein was innocent on that account. There are other examples, but the important thing is that we know how People are deceived by repeated lying, and they are manipulated by what is just another form of nagging. The Banksters and the Plutocrats own the Main Stream Media, and if they and the Media deny that there are any European Politicians who have Voluntarily Agreed to be Secretly Filmed in Acts of Bestiality or Paedophilia, in order to become Rich, then the Public will believe the Media. This is because we know that a lie repeated often enough will be believed by most People, where the bigger the lie is; the better are the chances of it being believed. We all know that the Banksters and Plutocrats will not allow the Puppet Politicians to bring a camera to Film themselves, and that there would be no reason why the Initiating Puppet Politicians would want to Film themself, because they Strongly Lust for the Dirty Money from their Puppet Masters, and let us just say to put it mildly, that they value some privacy. I am not a Detective, but I think that a Special Secret Detective Unit in each Country, set up after an International Summit Conference of Detectives would come up with the best ways to prove this Crime against Humanity and this crime against Democracy. We know that former American Rulers such as Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy who did not do what the Banksters wanted were assassinated. The Official Reasons that were given by the American Investigators were always lies, but the real reason was because they were not Puppets of the Banksters. After the murder of John Kennedy that was blamed on an innocent man, the American Plutocrats and Banksters had to invent a more subtle way to prevent disobedience from their Puppet Politicians. I cannot provide the evidence because no Puppet would admit to it, but I could ask anyone to disprove what I said, and they cannot. We know that President Nixon said that he was very poor, and he come just after President Kennedy and he gave the Banksters the Fiat Currency that they wanted, or more Correctly the Banksters gave themselves Fiat Currency, and Nixon just happened to be there to announce it, and this has caused the problems in the Global Economy. In this World where certain People will murder others for power and money, then it would be naive in the extreme to suggest that they would not Demand that those who Strongly Lust after their Dirty Money of the Euro-American Plutocrats and Banksters would be too moral to have a System of Guarantees that their Puppets will always obey their Decrees, because those who want Dirty Money must have A Dirty Personality. If a Person is Filmed in Acts of Bestiality, they will not go to jail, but they probably never work again. However, if they are Filmed in Acts of Paedophilia, then they could go to Court, even as the former Prime Minister of Italy is going to Court over a similar mater, and if they were not good enough Puppets, then they will go to jail, and we know what it would be like there for Convicted Paedophiles. I do not think that all European Union Politicians have Volunteered to be Filmed in Acts of Paedophilia and Bestiality. However, my genuinely held opinion is that many Have Volunteered to be Filmed in Acts of Paedophilia and Bestiality to Receive their Dirty Bribe Monies, and this is why we are seeing a Democratic Deficit in Europe. It is because of this situation, that I suggested that All European Politicians and High Official be granted a Pardon, even though Many will be Innocent of such Crimes in the past, but the Pardon must not for the date after the Pardon. I do not see the fuss really, because after World War 2, there was an acceptance that the German Army were Nazis and Murdered People, but that was Confessed to, and People began to concentrate on the Economy. We cannot Prove that certain Police Officers are Corrupt and that they take Bribes and even commit Criminal Offences, but we all Know that these things are Proven Facts. The only real evidence will be if Detectives are able to catch them in the act, or if they can Secretly tape record them using the latest technology and training of professional Detectives, because the Banksters are in control of the situation. The problem here is that they can always bribe People, and get the charges dropped, because they know the Judges. They are some of my thoughts on the matter, and I cannot offer People proof, but it is my genuinely held opinion on this matter.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Mar 10, 2017 at 11:00AM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) opened its 100th warehouse in December 1992. A quarter-century later, the retailer generates $116 billion of annual business out of its 728 locations. Here are a few things you might not know about the world's second-biggest retailer by revenue. Image source: Getty Images. California matters Costco is highly leveraged to the California market because of its high concentration of the retailer's biggest, most profitable warehouses. Almost one-third of its entire U.S. revenue came from that single state last year. And since the U.S. business accounts for over 70% of its operations, California plays an unusually large role in its global footprint. "Any substantial slowing or sustained decline" in this market, the company warns in its 10-K, "could materially adversely affect our business and financial results." Customer traffic trends are down Customer traffic gains have been the engine behind Costco's sales growth over the past decade. It handled a market-thumping 4% more member visits in each of the five years leading up to fiscal 2016, which helped produce comparable-store sales gains of 6% or better. Annual sales gains. Chart by author. That awesome streak ended last year, in part because its co-branded credit card switch produced a major disruption in membership renewals. Executives are hopeful that this will be just a temporary challenge, though, and renewal rates should climb back up above 90% over the coming quarters while bringing customer traffic levels higher as well. Small selection Rivals like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) aim to stock as wide a selection of products as possible, but Costco deliberately takes the opposite tack. These retailers carry over 80,000 items while a typical Costco warehouse holds less than 4,000. By restricting selection to just the most popular, fastest-selling products, Costco can keep its expenses low through elevated sales volumes. In fact, the retailer moves through its inventory so quickly that in most cases it sells a product -- and receives payment for it -- before it has to pay its supplier. It can then use those savings to deliver prices that peers just can't match. The membership business Nearly all its earnings are generated by membership fees rather than the product markup that underpins most retailers' business models. That's why it's more useful to think of the company as a club engaged in subscription sales rather than a retailer interested in selling stuff. The approach makes for significantly lower profitability. Costco's gross profit margin is roughly half Wal-Mart's 26% of sales and even further from Target's 30%. The same is true on the bottom line, where the company is lucky to turn 2% of sales into net income, compared to 4% for Target and 3% for Wal-Mart. Yet Costco's earnings are much more stable since they're attached to recurring subscriber revenue and thus less exposed to swings in the economy. Odd dividend approach Especially considering its reliable profit stream, Costco delivers only a small portion of earnings to shareholders as dividends. Its payout ratio is about one-third of profits, compared to 50% for its retailing peers. One good reason for this skimpy capital return promise is that Costco is still aggressively expanding its store base and so there's less cash available to send right back to owners. On the other hand, its paltry 1% dividend yield understates its actual payout. Twice in the last five years it has issued a massive special dividend to investors, amounting to $7 per share in 2012 and $5 per share in 2015. By the end of this year, Costco will have opened 29 new locations to nearly match its most aggressive expansion pace on record. Executives see a wide retailing opportunity ahead, both in the U.S. and international markets. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale.

Schneiderman announced Tuesday settlements with seven toy retailers accused of selling more than 2,000 imitation guns through Amazon in 2015. “We have seen all too often the tragic consequences that can arise when toy guns are mistaken for real ones,” he said. “The toy gun law exists to protect New York’s children and our brave law enforcement officers, and we will continue our commitment to enforcing this law and holding accountable any retailers who violate it.” New York law bans imitation weapons, but a 2015 investigation into major retailers — including Wal-Mart, Kmart and Sears — revealed the companies continued to sell the “realistic looking” toys online. In August, all three retailers and Amazon agreed to stop selling the items and paid a $300,000 fine. Tuesday’s agreement brings the total number of retailers caught in Schneiderman’s crackdown to 42. The retailers, who will pay a combined $44,000 in penalties, are: Halloweencostumes.com (fun.com), Holy Monkey (Kids Army), Dentt, Inc. (Hammond Toy & Hobby), GL2 LLC (Always Brilliant), Chevere International Corp (Five Big Stars), Fatherland Shop (Jubilee Enterprises) and Costume Hub. Schneiderman said the retailers can continue selling toy guns so long as the items meet “the stringent New York City standard” of being colored “entirely white, bright red, bright orange, bright yellow, bright green, bright blue, bright pink, or bright purple or a combination of these colors.” Imitation gun bans continue gaining traction nationwide as police-involved shootings of teens carrying the items dominates the news cycle. In December, Baltimore City Council approved its own ordinance banning replicas after police officers shot 14-year-old Dedric Colvin in the shoulder and leg seven months earlier. Colvin was carrying a BB gun officers said resembled a semiautomatic pistol. And in Brooklyn last month, three police officers shot and killed 18-year-old Sergio Reyes after he robbed a deli with a pellet gun, The New York Daily News reports. Officers said they opened fire after Reyes pointed the gun at them. Filed Under: Gun Laws, Product & Industry News Share Tweet Brian from Va All retailers should pull out of New York. Let them have nothing until they vote that communist government out. Omer Woodruff I think New York Politicians have gone nuts . You can’t buy a toy gun . But yet you can walk across the street from Central Park and get a meat cleaver and as many knives as you want at the kitchen store . Does New York politicians know you can now also purchase battery operated saws and nail guns ? How about hammers , screw drivers, ice picks, beer bottles . And how many cars are driving in New York from out of state might have a trunk load of guns ? I have driven in New York . There is nothing stopping guns being driven into New York . The proof is in the recent bust where a single bust netted how many guns ? And how many bb and toy guns got sent to kids as Christmas gifts ? Is every box delivered to residents in New York ran through an X ray machine ? And then there was the man in Central Park that got stabbed during Christmas in Central Park . And then there was the killer that had a gun and shot one of the beetles . So I guess no one ever got robbed by a knife ? How about the guy that attacked officers with an ax ? And was there not a person that got pushed down on the train tracks ? No , a person does not need a real gun or a toy gun to rob someone . Just like the African American that tried to get me to look off into the distance so he could steal a friend of mines fur coat right off of their back . Lucky for me as a former officers I did not take my eyes off of the African American in back of my friend . Because I saw his accomplice hide in a doorway .

In the Jackson, Wyoming metro area, you have to make a minimum of $1.65 million a year to be in the one percent, whereas in the New York, New York metro area you need to pull in $672,795. The Jackson metro area includes Teton County, Wyoming, which has been called a playground for the rich. Among its wealthy residents are Dick Cheney and Wal-Mart heiress Christy Walton. The numbers come from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), which examines income inequality across U.S. states and cities and published its findings in a 2016 report. It presents the highest income thresholds required to be part of the top one percent by metropolitan area. Read on to see how you stack up in these 15 cities. 15.

Not so. By Michelle Ye Hee Lee / The Washington Post Friday, March 10th, 2017 at 8:25am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........“I’m very pleased to announce the great company ExxonMobil is going to be investing $20 billion in the Gulf Coast and the Gulf Coast region. . . . This was something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulators and so many other things.”– President Donald Trump, video message on Facebook, March 6 “President Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning.– White House news release on ExxonMobil’s investment program, March 6 — President Trump claimed undue credit for ExxonMobil’s investment announcement – the latest example of the new president’s now-predictable formula: A company announces a U.S. jobs plan that predates Trump’s presidency. The company gives a nod to Trump’s anti-regulation policies. Trump then takes credit for bringing jobs back to the United States. Repeat. Advertisement Continue reading Among the many problems with this exercise is that hiring pledges aren’t binding. Plans change, and the jobs don’t always come to fruition. For example, in 2013, Foxconn announced it would create 500 jobs at a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. The factory was never built, and the jobs never came, The Washington Post’s Todd Frankel reported. Yet the company recently announced a plan to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers – a plan that Trump then touted. We took a look at ExxonMobil’s investment program, and a host of other corporate decisions that Trump falsely touts as a fulfillment of his promise to bring jobs back to the United States. — ExxonMobil On March 6, the oil giant announced its “Growing the Gulf” investment plan to spend $20 billion over 10 years in projects in Texas and Louisiana. The company said its plan would create 35,000 construction jobs and 12,000 full-time jobs, through 11 chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects. The company acknowledged that its investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. ExxonMobil’s spending plan may seem like a lot, but it represents only 10 percent of the company’s current capital spending levels, our colleagues reported: “Those levels would probably increase with higher oil prices. Moreover, ExxonMobil has been a major operator and investor in the Gulf of Mexico region for decades. The gulf accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. domestic oil production.” Indeed, ExxonMobil and other oil companies have been expanding and investing in the Gulf Coast for years, using new hydraulic fracturing technologies to extract natural gas and export it overseas. Advertisement Continue reading In 2013, when ExxonMobil began its investments, there were more than 120 petrochemical construction projects totaling $80 billion that were announced for the Gulf Coast region, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The White House news release quoted Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, as praising Trump’s commitment to “a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment.” “The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration’s support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment,” Woods said, acknowledging Trump’s pro-business policies but stopping short of giving any credit to the administration for his company’s business decisions. Trump has credited himself for a host of other corporate decisions. (In fact, his claims about creating jobs are among the most common claims we recorded so far in our 100 Days of Trump’s Claims project, tracking every false or misleading claim in Trump’s first 100 days.) Here’s a running list: Ford. Ford decided to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico. But the decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal – particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles – than with the administration. Here’s what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company’s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: “The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.” Fiat Chrysler. The company announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio plants and create 2,000 jobs. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said his company’s plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Marchionne credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors. The company plans to add or keep 7,000 jobs in the United States and invest $1 billion. Trump touted the decisions on Twitter, but a company spokeswoman said the decisions “had been in the works for some time” but that “the timing was good for us to share what we are doing.” Just two weeks before GM’s announcement, Trump had blasted the company on Twitter over its Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze. Advertisement Continue reading Walmart. Walmart said it would create 10,000 jobs in the United States in 2017 – a part of a $6.8 billion capital spending plan announced in October, before the presidential election, Reuters reported. Intel. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona. But Intel actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-President Barack Obama. The factory never opened, making it technically “new” in 2017. The company told CNN Money that it’s resuming its factory project because it is expecting a demand in the computer chips to be created there. Lockheed Martin. Trump says he lowered the cost of the company’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes. But the Pentagon had announced cost reductions of roughly $600 million before Trump began meeting with Lockheed Martin’s chief executive. SoftBank. The Japanese company announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. After a December 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump, SoftBank announced that $50 billion would go to the United States. But the United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America – regardless of whether Trump was elected. Sprint. Sprint announced it would add 5,000 jobs in the United States, and Trump took credit. Sprint later said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint, the New York Times reported. Alibaba. Chinese e-company Alibaba pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs. Trump said that until he got elected, Alibaba founder Jack Ma had “no intention” of investing in the United States. But Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015, when Ma outlined a plan similar to what he promised in his announcement with Trump. — Trump’s bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke. He claims credit when little or no credit is due to his policies. Moreover, he is counting these jobs as jobs in the bank, when corporate plans frequently change according to market or economic forces. Trump has promised to create 10 million jobs over the next four years, and that ultimately is what he will be judged on. (We are tracking this promise and more on the Trump Promise Tracker https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-promise-tracker/?tid=a_inl.) All the job announcements in the world will mean little if actual hiring does not turn up in the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the meantime, he earns four out of four Pinocchios for his repeated, inaccurate claims of credit.

Penney's business, but it would make it really difficult for the department store to be profitable, CEO Marvin Ellison told CNBC in an exclusive interview. Ellison was among the retail executives that meet with President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to discuss tax reform last month. When asked if it was possible to operate in the black if the proposal goes into effect as written, Ellison said simply, "It will be very difficult. In the short run, virtually impossible." J.C. Penney has run its financial models and Ellison said its tax rate swells exponentially. "It takes our tax structure, as an example, from roughly a 34 percent corporate tax to over 170 percent," he explained. "So that gives you an idea of the financial impact to a company like J.C. Penney. And that's very consistent with other companies, companies like Best Buy, Target, Kroger, Wal-Mart — I mean, you name it, we're all in this same precarious position because we don't have a manufacturing capacity that exists in the United States." It all means an increase in the prices consumers pay is inevitable. "Very simply, it adds a 20 percent cost to goods that are going to middle- and low-income consumers. There's no way around it, there's just the simple math," Ellison said. Still, the conversations are continuing and a border adjustment tax isn't a foregone conclusion. "It's a very tricky situation, but if it goes through as written, it's going to be pretty devastating to the U.S. consumer in many ways." Ellison said J.C. Penney is in a better position than some of its competitors because it has a higher percentage of private apparel brands in its merchandise assortment. Private brands, like J.C. Penney's St. John's Bay and Liz Claiborne, are brands owned by a particular retailer, those that can only be purchased at the retailer and are more profitable than national brands available at multiple retailers. "But if I can control the first cost and maybe there's something we can do to adjust the pricing structure to try to alleviate some of the cost without taking it to the consumer. So we think it gives us a complex problem to solve but I don't think it's a death blow to J.C. Penney," he said. However, there's a limit to how much cost J.C. Penney can strip out. J.C. Penney, like the vast majority of retailers, has to rely on an overseas supply chain. "It would take me a decade just to get the level of manufacturing capacity where we need it to serve the needs of our consumers," he said, pointing to the American Apparel and Footwear Association data that shows 98 percent of clothing bought in the United States and 97 percent of the shoes, are imported. "We'd have to renegotiate cost. We'd have to look at the factories and the suppliers we use in different locations. We'd have to look at design structure — we call it design to value. So there are a lot of things we'd have to do, but none of those things would benefit the consumer directly because we'd still have to raise prices. I can't take out 20 percent cost without cheapening the goods and we're not going to sell goods at that poor quality."

Her mom, Kris Blanchard, thought it would be fun to have a themed birthday party where the girls got a chance to be creative. Photo by J.B. Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com When Isabella Blanchard designed her bedroom, she carefully considered the look she wanted to create before finalizing the drapery, bedding and paint colors. She was 7. “I let her pick out everything — the wall color, the bed spread,” her mom, Kris Blanchard, of St. Louis, said. The finished project features purple walls, pink glitter curtains and a gauzy, princess canopy hanging from the ceiling. “I didn’t have so much say at that age,” Blanchard said. But like many other modern parents, Blanchard has embraced the idea that a child’s room is his or her space that should be created to express one’s individual style. The design liberties today’s parents had as kids may have been limited to picking the posters they wanted to hang on their bedroom walls, and even those had to meet certain criteria of tastefulness in some homes. But this generation is growing up curating and exploring their aesthetic in a digital world saturated with images. The most popular social media sites for young people — Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat —trade in visuals. Tweens can search and create Pinterest boards that hone what appeals to them visually. Businesses beyond retailers like Pottery Barn Kids, have recognized this market. There are designers that cater to helping guide younger clients, empowered by their parents’ pocketbooks. Walmart offers a $15 “Design Your Dream Room” kit that allows kids to “decorate the room of your dreams” with an interior design portfolio. Different activity sections let the child experiment with patterns, colors and space. A new party-concept store at West County Mall, My Room Rocks, gives customers a box to decorate as a room. Isabella, now 8, recently celebrated her birthday there with a group of girls, creating elaborate models of rooms complete with miniature furniture, wall paper, valances and bedding. She decided to go with a modern black and white theme in this room, including a Star Wars bedspread, and adding accents of purple, her favorite color. Mary Sittler, creator and owner of the store, says she remembered how her own daughters, now grown, would customize and build rooms for their dolls. She sees the store as another form of creative expression for children. There is an entire wall with more than 50 different fabric options for bedding, pillows and window treatments to customize each cardboard box room. The store has hosted birthday parties, but boys and girls also drop in to create individual projects. Not everyone is sold on the idea that young children should have complete artistic control of creating actual bedrooms before they’ve mastered making the bed. The Wall Street Journal ran a pro and con piece on the question of whether parents should allow kids to design their own bedrooms. Proponents argue that it gives children a sense of ownership and imparts a sense of security in children. It’s best if parents provide a few pre-approved choices from which a child can choose. On the other side, designers cautioned parents that children can be “capricious, which can lead to overspending and truly bad décor.” In the case of the Isabella’s real-life bedroom, everyone was pleased with the final product. Her mother ordered the furniture, and Isabella chose the colors and accessories. Isabella wanted a princess room, and her mother wanted something that could last longer than a passing interest in princesses. Paint can be a fairly inexpensive change for do-it-yourselfers. Now, Isabella has her eye on an unfinished attic in the house she would like to convert into a craft or play room one day. “I’ve been thinking about stuff,” she said. “Pink and purple and a big glass chandelier,” she said. Before she takes on her next design project, however, she needs to graduate second grade.

Despite sounding like a rejected scene from an bad romcom, it has been claimed that the owner of the blue car is the wife of the owner of the Corvette, and purposefully drove at it after seeing him with another woman. British backpacker murdered in India was raped before she died, police confirm Kyle Tipton, who posted the pictures on Facebook, wrote: ‘So I went to Walmart to get a few things and I saw a badass corvette (sic) parking. ‘I stopped the guy and talked to him about it for a few seconds… ‘All original, low mileage, and garage kept (typical Florida guy and car) so I didn’t think anything of it, said it was a beautiful car and went inside. ‘I come back out and that’s when things got interesting…’ https://www.facebook.com/groups/masstuning/permalink/1464426403590276/ Kyle’s original post has been shared over a hundred times and attracted nearly 200 comments since it was posted on March 2. One of the commenters was Andrew Carlson, who wrote: ‘Apparently the vette’s owner was cheating on his wife (the girl left the scene) and his wife happened to be at Walmart at the same time and she saw them together and decided the best course of action was to assault him with her vehicle.’ This picture is a warning to husbands everywhere (Picture: Facebook/Kyle Tipton) According to a later post, Kyle was was accused of Photoshopping the picture of the 1958 Chevrolet Corvette, but a number of different images have appeared online, as well as a video. However his account that the Corvette owner’s wife had ‘lost it’ could be a serious case of Chinese whispers. ‘She pinned the throttle down and rammed the car,’ he wrote. Homeless man transformed into hipster in incredible turnaround video ‘How it got up there is still a mystery that even the tow truck driver and police couldn’t figure out.’ Asking prices for 1958 Chevrolet Corvette’s online range from around $60,000 (around £50,000) up to $300,000 (around £247,000).

Oleh ZhownirovychJohnson County (Kansas) jail  The baby's mother testified at a court hearing on Thursday that alleged attacker Oleh Zhownirovych said, "I'm going to take her. Call 911." Hill also said the attack left her daughter with scratch marks and that the girl had trouble eating and sleeping for weeks, the report said. Zhownirovych allegedly pulled the 4-month old girl out a cart and began to choker her while on the checkout line of the Overland Park location in October. The mother started screaming and people rushed to help, KMBC.com said at the time. People in the store then pinned the man down until police arrived. Zhownirovych was charged with aggravated battery. The trial will begin May 22, KansasCity.com reported. The pastor left his position at the Ukrainian Orthodox Holy Ascension Cathedral in Clifton in late 2015, according to KMBC.com and KansasCity.com.

The Bradford-based manufacturer struck a deal with Lulu in the United Arab Emirates in April last year and has since then expanded rapidly, now operating in a total of 15 countries. After securing well-known customers including Monoprix in France, Carrefour in Spain and convenience chains 7-11 in Hong Kong and Walmart in China, it has also expanded its offering with Lulu’s Choitrams across the Middle East. Seabrook now has its sights on the Australian market with a new deal in the pipeline this month and has developed a number of key relationships at the recent Gulfood 2017 in Dubai, one of world’s largest annual food events. The new deals are part of a sustained international growth plan for the crisp manufacturer which has also appointed corporate advisors to explore strategic options, including overseas acquisitions. Kevin Butterworth, marketing and international sales director at Seabrook Crisps, said: “We have been overwhelmed by our success overseas and we are striving to boost our growth even further. “Our international product has good appeal, with long shelf-life and flavours relevant to the non-UK market and our customers warm to our British heritage.” Seabrook was founded in 1939 when Charles Brook opened a fish and chip shop in Bradford. It began making crisps in 1945.

(JOHNSON COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE) OLATHE, Kan. — A former pastor from New Jersey has been ordered to stand trial on charges that he tried to choke an infant girl he didn’t know at a Kansas City-area Wal-Mart. The Kansas City Star reports a judge in Kansas’ Johnson County ordered 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych to be tried on charges of aggravated battery, aggravated kidnapping and battery for the October 2016 incident. Monquisha Hill testified Thursday she was in the checkout line last October with her then-4-month-old daughter in a car seat in a cart when a man she didn’t know took the infant from her cart and began choking her. People in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. Police said Zhownirovych appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time. The baby wasn’t injured during the incident.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo Switch In Stock Updates: Switch Available On Amazon Prime Now Posted: Mar 11 2017, 1:26pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The new $299.99 Nintendo Switch is hard to find. Amazon Prime Now offers the Switch in select cities. Updated. The new Nintendo Switch was launched last week and sold out on day one - as expected. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March turned out to be untrue - also as expected. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com Amazon is now offering the hard to find Nintendo Switch through its local delivery service Amazon Prime Now. We just spotted the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in stock for San Diego (92110) on Amazon Prime Now as of midnight Pacific on Friday. Customers in San Diego can receive the Switch with 2 hour free delivery once the Amazon Prime Now service begins in deliveries. San Diego, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Richmond, San Antonio, Tampa, Virginia Beach and Austin residents also can order the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller for $69.99, which is sold out on amazon.com. The only other option to find a Nintendo Switch we know of is GameStop and of course our Nintendo Switch Giveaway. The video game retailer has started to take pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch with a mid-April delivery date on March 7.  Also some shoppers are now ordering the Nintendo Switch at Amazon in Spain. This works the same way as for the NES Classic. Amazon Spain offers the Nintendo Switch for 319 Euro with a March 17 release. This likely means that there are no major new Switch console shipments coming in March. GameStop is offering a $599.99 Nintendo Switch bundle for pre-order with a delivery of April 16th online. GameStop also offers a $509.99 Nintendo Switch Bundle, but that is only available for pre-order in stores. The $599.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console Starter Bundle Two includes: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass, Snipperclips, Just Dance 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Complete Official Guide, Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Charging Dock, Nintendo Switch Hybrid Cover, SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSD Card with Adapter, and Power Kit AC-Adapter for Switch. The bundle features sensible items, but not all consumers will need all that stuff. This expensive Nintendo Switch bundle is available for pre-order on gamestop.com. You can also try your luck and win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in our two exclusive I4U News Giveaways. We have both hot Nintendo consoles in the office and are giving them away this month. GameStop says that the Digital Season Pass Code and Digital Game Code Download Instructions will be emailed when orders ship. Items in this bundle may ship separately. GameStop also warns that any products that were sold as part of a bundle are not allowed for return, unless the bundle is returned complete and in sealed new condition. No other store is currently offering the Nintendo Switch online. Below is the list of shops that have carried the Switch at launch. Amazon  Best Buy  GameStop  Target  ToysRUs Nintendo lists six official stores that sell the Nintendo Switch including Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, ToysRUs and Target. Other stores have also listed the Switch including NewEgg, Fry's, BHPPhotoVideo and Nintendo's own store. We expect the Switch to be sold out after Friday and go down a similar route as other successful Nintendo consoles before i t. The Wii was a hard to find console and the surprise NES Classic hit is still very hard to find months after its release. The Nintendo Switch is expected to sell out on launch day and will be hard to find for weeks or even months after launch. Resellers are already preparing to snag up as many Switch consoles to resell them on eBay. Resellers have not yet settled on a profit margin as it is not clear yet how hard the Switch will be to find on launch day. The listings prices are all over the place, ranging from $400 to $1,000. We already received a Nintendo Switch on Thursday that we are giving away. Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway now to get a chance to win a free Nintendo Switch. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock online To track online inventory and get alerts, shoppers can use zoolert and NowInStock. Both inventory tracker have already setup the Nintendo Switch trackers. We also recommend to use the Chrome browser extension Page Monitor Pro to monitor Nintendo Switch product pages in the hours ahead of the release. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock in stores Once the Switch is released, consumers can use BrickSeek to try to find a Switch in stock at Walmart Stores and Target Stores. The Target DPCI for the Nintendo Switch console with neon blue and neon red Joy-Con is 207-29-1001. The DPCI for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 207-29-1000. The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822. We will provide continuous updates about the availability of the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

(Facebook/The White House) “I’m very pleased to announce the great company ExxonMobil is going to be investing $20 billion in the Gulf Coast and the Gulf Coast region. … This was something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulators and so many other things.” — President Trump, video message on Facebook, March 6 “President Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning. — White House news release on ExxonMobil’s investment program, March 6 President Trump claimed undue credit for ExxonMobil’s investment announcement — the latest example of the new president’s now-predictable formula: A company announces a U.S. jobs plan that predates Trump’s presidency. The company gives a nod to Trump’s anti-regulation policies. Trump then takes credit for bringing jobs back to the United States. Repeat. Among the many problems with this exercise is that hiring pledges aren’t binding. Plans change, and the jobs don’t always come to fruition. For example, in 2013, Foxconn announced it would create 500 jobs at a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. The factory was never built, and the jobs never came, The Washington Post’s Todd Frankel reported. Yet the company recently announced a plan to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers — a plan that Trump then touted. We took a look at ExxonMobil’s investment program, and a host of other corporate decisions that Trump falsely touts as a fulfillment of his promise to bring jobs back to the United States. We’ll keep a running tally, and update the list as necessary. The Facts ExxonMobil On March 6, the oil giant announced its “Growing the Gulf” investment plan to spend $20 billion over 10 years in projects in Texas and Louisiana. The company said its plan would create 35,000 construction jobs and 12,000 full-time jobs, through 11 chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects. The company acknowledged that its investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. ExxonMobil’s spending plan may seem like a lot, but it represents only 10 percent of the company’s current capital spending levels, our colleagues reported: “Those levels would probably increase with higher oil prices. Moreover, ExxonMobil has been a major operator and investor in the Gulf of Mexico region for decades. The gulf accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. domestic oil production.” Indeed, ExxonMobil and other oil companies have been expanding and investing in the Gulf Coast for years, using new hydraulic fracturing technologies to extract natural gas and export it overseas. In 2013, when ExxonMobil began its investments, there were more than 120 petrochemical construction projects totaling $80 billion that were announced for the Gulf Coast region, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The White House news release quoted Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, as praising Trump’s commitment to “a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment.” “The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration’s support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment,” Woods said, acknowledging Trump’s pro-business policies but stopping short of giving any credit to the administration for his company’s business decisions. Trump has credited himself for a host of other corporate decisions. (In fact, his claims about creating jobs are among the most common claims we recorded so far in our 100 Days of Trump’s Claims project, tracking every false or misleading claim in Trump’s first 100 days.) Here’s a running list, and a link to separate fact-checks where available. Ford. Ford decided to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico. But the decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than with the administration. Here’s what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company’s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: “The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.” Read the full fact-check. Fiat Chrysler. The company announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio plants and create 2,000 jobs. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said his company’s plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Marchionne credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors. The company plans to add or keep 7,000 jobs in the United States and invest $1 billion. Trump touted the decisions on Twitter, but a company spokeswoman said the decisions “had been in the works for some time” but that “the timing was good for us to share what we are doing.” Just two weeks before GM’s announcement, Trump had blasted the company on Twitter over its Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze. Update: On March 15, Trump took credit for General Motors’s plans to rehire about 700 laid-off workers in Michigan and create 200 new jobs. But the company did not credit Trump or his election. Walmart. Walmart said it would create 10,000 jobs in the United States in 2017 — a part of a $6.8 billion capital spending plan announced in October, before the presidential election, Reuters reported. Intel. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona. But Intel actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-President Barack Obama. The factory never opened, making it technically “new” in 2017. The company told CNN Money that it’s resuming its factory project because it is expecting a demand in the computer chips to be created there. Lockheed Martin. Trump says he lowered the cost of the company’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes. But the Pentagon had announced cost reductions of roughly $600 million before Trump began meeting with Lockheed Martin’s chief executive. Read the full fact-check. SoftBank. The Japanese company announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. After a December 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump, SoftBank announced that $50 billion would go to the United States. But the United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America — regardless of whether Trump was elected. Read the full fact-check. Sprint. Sprint announced it would add 5,000 jobs in the United States, and Trump took credit. Sprint later said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint, the New York Times reported. Alibaba. Chinese e-company Alibaba pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs. Trump said that until he got elected, Alibaba founder Jack Ma had “no intention” of investing in the United States. But Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015, when Ma outlined a plan similar to what he promised in his announcement with Trump. The Pinocchio Test Trump’s bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke. He claims credit when little or no credit is due to his policies. Moreover, he is counting these jobs as jobs in the bank, when corporate plans frequently change according to market or economic forces. Trump has promised to create 10 million jobs over the next four years, and that ultimately is what he will be judged on. (We are tracking this promise and more on the Trump Promise Tracker.) All the job announcements in the world will mean little if actual hiring does not turn up in the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios for his repeated, inaccurate claims of credit.

LIVE: #4 Philip Barbour vs. #5 Mingo Central LISTEN NOW! About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows Weather Outdoors Cabell, Kanawha counties file separate lawsuits against drug distributors Share Article By Alex Thomas in News | March 09, 2017 at 10:21PM CHARLESTON, W.Va. – County commissions in Cabell and Kanawha counties filed separate lawsuits Thursday against prescription drug distributors, alleging the companies contributed to West Virginia’s drug epidemic. The lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Both name pharmaceutical companies AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health, as well as retail chains like Wal-Mart, CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Kroger. The Cabell County Commission said nine companies sold 40 million doses of pain medication from 2007 to 2012, while the Kanawha County Commission said 16 companies sold 66 million doses during the same period. The commissions are not the first bodies to file suit connected to the drug epidemic; the McDowell County Commission, City of Huntington and Town of Kermit have moved to seek legal action since December. The lawsuit mentions reports from the Charleston Gazette-Mail regarding the number of pills shipped to West Virginia, and an investigation from The Washington Post on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s slow action against drug distributors. Attorney Paul Farrell Jr. of Greene Ketchum Farrell, Bailey & Tweel in Huntington filed the lawsuits. He said he expects at least five other county commissions to take similar legal action.

Submitted photos. MOUNTAIN IRON – “Dancing is my passion, not my job.” So says Nicole Gulbranson, a bubbly, vivacious, not-at-all-shy, energetic wife and stay-at-home mom of “three awesome kiddos” – Phoenix, 9, Jace, 8, and NiKiah, 4. Gulbranson, who lives in Mountain Iron, is the founder of Dance4Fitness with Nicole, a dance/fitness class held twice weekly at Merritt Elementary in Mountain Iron and once a week at the Mesabi Family YMCA. “I started it because of my love for dance and fitness,” Nicole said. “I love to help people feel good about their bodies. I love to help people and dance makes everyone happy and feeling good.” Nicole has been dancing “since I could walk.” She is self-taught, learning to dance by “watching MTV.” She started making up her own dances as a 7-year-old and was soon performing in front of her school. Nicole with her KidsDanceFit class at Merritt Elementary. “I never got to be in a dance class,” Nicole said. “(But) from a very young age, my dream was to be a dancer and to own my own dance club or studio. I won’t give up on that dream. “Performing and dancing have always been a huge part of my life because (they) make me happy and keep me feeling healthy.” Three years ago, after many years of dancing, making up and choreographing dances, and performing in front of hundreds of people, Nicole started to make her dream a reality. She started a dance class at Merritt Elementary twice a week. Soon after, the Mesabi Family YMCA also gave her a day to dance. “At first starting off it was hard to get people to understand what my vision was and what the class is about,” she said. “(But) I knew I wanted to do it and nothing was going to stop me. The Dance4Fitness with Nicole class does an ab fusion exercise. “Through the last three years, I’ve really grown a lot and so has the class.” Her dance class has evolved throughout the years as Nicole has learned on the job. “I’ve grown a lot,” she said. “It’s not just a chance to dance and get your cardio in. I added light weights, and, wow, what a huge difference. I was walking in Walmart one day and thought to myself that it would be really cool to start using a light weight (while dancing). I found “walking weights.” They are a nice add to intensify the workout.” She choreographs many of the dances for her class. Think of a high-energy Jessica Bass, according to Nicole: “I do a lot of her dances; I’ve just amped them up a bit.” She primarily uses top 40 music – “It’s upbeat and current” – and says if your want some fun in your exercise routine, “you’ve come to the right place.” Nicole directs her class in a choreographed dance workout. “My class is super fun,” Nicole said. “I have three rules for my class. One: Always have fun. If you’re not having fun then I’m not doing my job. Two: No judging. Everyone is there trying to work on themselves and to be happy and healthy. I don’t want people to discourage or say mean things. Three: Just keep moving. Don’t give up. As long as you are moving, you’re grooving.” Laughing is also a necessary part of the class. “We love to laugh and have fun,” she said. “Laughing burns calories, so it’s greatly encouraged.” Some of the Dance4Fitness with Nicole class: (Top row, from left) Beth, Mary and Lilly Archambeau, Shannon and Summer Polinder, Jordan Auel, Kristine Maki; (Bottom row, from left) Jessica Auel, Nicole Gulbranson and Shirley Potocnik. One of Nicole’s students is Jordan Auel. "Working out is something that a lot of people, including myself, find hard to get into a routine with,” Auel said. “It's difficult sometimes to push yourself to go to the gym and do the ‘same old’ every time. It gets boring. “Dance4fitness is an amazing way to get fit and still have fun. We're there for close to an hour and a half, but it feels like 10 minutes because it's constant fun and laughing along with working out. Also you know that Nicole is going to be supportive and that helps a ton. She's a ball of non-stop energy and is constant entertainment the entire session.” “It’s a great class for all ages,” said Shirley Potocnik, one of the older students. Nicole isn’t shy about promoting her class. “I encourage anyone and everyone to come take my class. It’s amazing,” she said. “I promise my class will really kick you into shape, make you feel good and keep you going. And it’s like family. I make sure everyone is comfortable and doing well. “I have men and women in my class, and it’s fun to see guys out there moving and grooving. I’ll help anyone who wants it. Just come to a class and ask and we’ll go from there.” Dance4Fitness with Nicole meets from 6 to 7:15 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays at Merritt Elementary and Thursdays at the Mesabi Family YMCA from 6:15 to 7:15 p.m. Cost is $5/session at Merritt. A sixweek package (12 classes) is available for $40 – a savings of $20. Participants are encouraged to bring a yoga mat and water bottle. Monday’s classes are held in the multipurpose room; Wednesday’s classes are held in the gym. The class at the Y is free for members. Non-members can take the class by paying for a day pass. “I also do an on-the-floor ab fusion,” said Nicole, who said the great feedback from participants is a big encouragement. “This class is not easy by any means. Nobody said it would be easy, but if you are looking for results, you will get them. With your hard work, you can do anything. I want you to have fun, smile and get your workout in. You are sure to go home sore, but I hope you always come back to the class ready to dance for you. “This is a very fun dance class with lots of energy, great music and awesome dance moves. Move to the beat. If you don't get the dance, that's ok. Just move. All I ask is that as long as you are having fun and moving, you are burning calories. “It’s a full-body workout.” For anyone who is interested in the class, Nicole has a Facebook page, “Dance- 4Fit with Nicole” that contains up-to-date information on classes, cancellations, inspiration, motivation, pictures and videos. New attendees can register in person at a session or by calling Jean at 218-735-8271 ext. 1003. Nicole also teaches KidsDanceFit at Merritt Elimentary. “It’s a fun way to get the kiddos moving and grooving to the beat,” she said. “I'll post on my Dance4Fit with Nicole page when classes start up again.” Persistence has paid off for Nicole, who after seven years of trying got on the “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” for a segment called “Ellen’s Dance Dare” in February of 2012. She also got a call out of the blue from producer Jillian Bergman who was working on a documentary about the history of American Idol. She had seen a video on Nicole’s YouTube channel and wanted to use a clip from Nicole’s “American Idol reaction.” That show aired in May of 2016. Nicole will also be going to an open casting call for the reality show “Big Brother” for the second year in a row. “Wish me luck,” she said. “It didn’t happen for me right away – it took Ellen seven years to notice me. Persistence is key. Never give up. That’s how I feel about my dreams. Go for them and never stop.” You can watch Nicole’s hilarious video that landed her on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and other dance videos and more by Nicole on her YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/nmarimborgo.

Life Buy/Sell Letters to the editor A few ideas to get St. Louis moving in the right direction Mar 10, 2017 (…) After reading the commentary by Max Gillman and David C. Rose ("Is the House blueprint for tax reform good for St. Louis?” March 8), I felt I had to express an opposing view. The idea that tax reform will lead to a manufacturing boom in St. Louis is absurd. Let me encourage Gillman and Rose to visit their local Walmart store, as I did recently, when I bought a garden furniture set for under $100 and a microwave oven for under $40 — both manufactured in China. There is no way an American factory using American labor can compete with those prices. There is no doubt that the St. Louis-area economy is struggling, and there are no silver bullets that will solve our problems. Let me mention a few ideas that will move us in the right direction. First, let us build on our strengths in areas that have a future: medical care, biotechnology, plant science and software development. Our Missouri government should expand Medicaid, bringing more money and jobs to the St. Louis-area hospitals and medical facilities. Second, we need more cooperation between the city and the county. The county has to realize that the area will not prosper unless the city improves. The county should offer a major financial contribution to a possible new city soccer stadium. Third, St. Louis needs to make more progress in race relations. There needs to be far fewer police departments in the county with greater professional training, greater racial diversity, higher pay and a commitment to community policing. The major steps needed to move the St. Louis area forward are in our own hands, not in the proposed House tax code blueprint.

A lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen, CVS, Cardinal Health, HD Smith, Kroger, McKesson, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart claims that the drug distributors breached their duty in reporting suspicious opioid prescriptions.

After two years of declining satisfaction, they reversed course during the 2016 holiday shopping season, according to the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index report. Retailers scored 78 out of 100 points, that's up 4.7 percent and an all-time high for the sector. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Death of department stores? Macy's, Sears, Kmart close dozens of local branches 3:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/849050691504" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> All six categories covered in this report — department and discount stores, specialty retail stores, supermarkets, drug stores, gas stations, and online retail — improved year over year. But online retail was the clear winner with an ACSI score of 83, up 3.8 percent from 2015. (The report is based on 12,500 customer surveys collected in the fourth quarter of 2016.) "Shopping online is so easy and convenient and as a result satisfaction is much higher than the brick-and-mortar experience and is playing a big role in putting that pressure on the brick-and-mortar side of retail in terms of sales performance and just getting people into the store," said David VanAmburg, ACSI managing director. Personal Treatment Oddly enough, as more people shop online and national retailers close stores, customers who go to the ones that remain open may get better service. If the store isn't crowded and there are no lines at the register, the experience will be more satisfying, VanAmburg told NBC News. Of course, this is not a sustainable business model. "Long-term this is likely to flip on its head because more layoffs and store closings are coming," VanAmburg said. "Down the road we're going to have lots of consumers who are frustrated that their favorite store in their favorite location is closed and now they have to drive a lot further to get to that store." Of course, emptier stores are not the only reason for happier customers. The report points out that better service, lower gasoline prices, and food price deflation have also contributed to stronger satisfaction. While foot traffic is down, customers who go to brick-and-mortar stores are intent to buy and are buying more than in the past, according to the National Retail Federation. "Basket sizes continue to grow thanks to effective customer service and low competitive prices on everyday items," Ana Serafin Smith, NRF's senior director of media relations, told NBC News. "As consumers continue to evolve the way they shop, retailers will pay attention and modify their strategies to align with the needs and wants of their customer base." Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, said retailers are focused on dealing with online competition and working harder at "creating a better and more satisfying in-store experience." This includes a sales team that's better trained and making sure popular merchandise is always in stock. The ability to buy-online and pick-up at the store is one example of using technology to improve the brick-and-mortar shopping experience, he told NBC News. People walk past the Apple Store at the Los Cerreitos Center mall in Cerritos, California. REUTERS/Bret Hartman What Are America's Favorite Stores? Department and discount stores have an overall ACSI score of 78, up 5.4 percent from last year. Dillard's takes first place with an 83, up 4 percent and a new high for the company. JCPenney which came in second place at 82 had the biggest improvement of any national chain, up 11 percent. The report noted that the reintroduction of appliances, new same-day pickup of online orders and an overhaul of the JCPenney website and app appear to have been successful. Nordstrom (80) was the only department store to see customer satisfaction decline last year, a drop of two percent. Related: Nordstrom Stock Soared by 7 Percent After Trump Twitter Slam "Nordstrom seems to be experiencing a challenge — in part, from their own online success," VanAmburg said. "Their website is enormously successful and very satisfying and that's putting some pressure on their ability to keep the brick-and-mortar side running at the high level that is has traditionally." Kohl's, Macy's and Target all saw satisfaction increase, but still scored 79. Sears gained eight percent to score a 77. Satisfaction at Walmart soared nine percent, but the company still took the bottom spot at 72. "Walmart made a concerted effort on service during the holiday shopping season and created the 'holiday helpers' program to really ratchet-up their ability to provide service and it seems that really paid off," VanAmburg said. "But almost everyone is making gains as well and that keeps Walmart lagging behind in the overall ratings." Top-Rated Specialty Stores Costco was the top-rated specialty store, scoring an 83, up two percent from last year, beating Sam's Club (81, up 7 percent) and BJ's Wholesale (79, up four percent). "Costco is to brick-and-mortar what Amazon is to the online experience," VanAmburg said. "They do what they do very well. They put their money into great staffing, competitive prices and they get you in and get your out and help you find what you're looking for." Last week, Costco announced that it was increasing its annual membership fees effective June 1. Memberships in the U.S. and Canada will be $60, up $5. Executive memberships will go up by $10 to $120. VanAmburg told NBC News he's interested to see if that hurts customer satisfaction in next year's report. Barnes & Noble, L. Brands (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works) both tied for second place with an ACSI score of 81. Home Depot (80) saw a ten percent jump in satisfaction to squeak past Lowe's (79). Staples (80) just beat out Office Depot (79). Supermarkets Show Big Gains Falling food prices — combined with higher quality products and better customer service — boosted scores for most supermarkets. The industry average of 78 is up 6.8 percent from 2015. Trader Joe's (86) took the top spot, followed by Publix (84). ALDI, H-E-B and Wegmans tied at 83. Wegmans, last year's top-rate supermarket, dropped three percent this year — the only chain to experience a decline in satisfaction. Whole Foods (81) saw an 11 percent rebound. Giant Eagle and Walmart (74) came in at the bottom, even though their scores jumped 10 percent. Internet Champions For many Americans, the Internet is the preferred way to shop — and satisfaction rose another 3.8 percent to 83. That's five points higher than the overall score for retail shopping. Once again, Amazon is the online leader, capturing the majority of the sales growth in the U.S. and earning the highest ACSI score: 86, up four percent. That's three points higher than the industry average. Other sites: Tech-focused Newegg (83), eBay (81) and Overstock (79). Netflix, which is rated in this category, also scored a 79. Related: Online Sales Hit a Record $91.7 Billion Over the Holidays Today's customers want speed and convenience and the Internet delivers on both. "The ease of payment and steady improvements to product images, and a variety of merchandise keeps shoppers very happy with e-commerce websites," the report noted. "Merchandise is rarely out of stock and there are numerous shipping options to suit each individual buyer." Herb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan.

A scam ruined his computer. He can't afford to buy a new one but he can't keep this one either. So he turned to ReSource in Burlington for help. "So we just have to fill out some paperwork and we'll get you a desktop," said Danielle Dubois of ReSource. "Four different times he called me with four different numbers," Leonard said. That's where Leonard's troubles started. He got a call from Mike, a man claiming to be a Microsoft technician. He told Leonard Microsoft had detected 40,000 viruses on his computer and he wanted to help him fix it. The computer was a gift from Leonard's daughter. He wanted to protect it. So he handed over his computer password. "Then he wanted me to go to Wal-Mart to buy three $100 iTunes cards," Leonard said. "And I said, whoa! Wait a minute. Something is not right here." Leonard was duped by a sophisticated cybercriminal. Once he let him in, he couldn't stop it. These crooks prey on the elderly and trusting people like Leonard. "I felt like I had been violated," Leonard said. Microsoft says it will never proactively solicit customers for tech support. The company warns on its website the scam tricks victims into installing software that steals sensitive data like banking usernames and passwords. Vermont's attorney general says 463 Vermonters reported similar computer tech support scams last year. It also ruins the computers it infects, leaving the victims with tough, expensive choices. "If it's a virus that's just tracking what they're doing, but they want to keep their information, but it hasn't completely taken over the computer, we can sometimes just remove it," said Paul Webster-Pact, an IT generalist at ReSource. "But if it is something that's much more serious, the customer will come in and ask us just to completely wipe and reinstall the operating system on the computer." The tech team tells WCAX News they are seeing this Microsoft scam quite often, sometimes even helping repeat customers. And they say the effects can be devastating. "He drained my bank account," Leonard said. "Took about $600 of my money." Money that had taken this Vietnam vet months to save, cash he had set aside for food. It was everything Leonard had in his account. "I just don't want anyone else going through this, Jennifer. It's horrible," Leonard said. Through a charity program, ReSource was able to get Leonard a refurbished computer for free. He tells me he won't be answering phone calls or downloading programs on his new computer from people he doesn't know. "I'm very grateful to you and [ReSource] in helping me," Leonard told Danielle.

With legislators once again raising the hope it will be adopted this session, Pottsgrove School District officials putting together another budget took the time to see what that would look like had last year’s school tax elimination bill been adopted. And what they found is that there are indeed lots of devils in those details. “A lot of people hear ‘property tax elimination’ and they think ‘boom,’ their bill goes away, they save a lot of money and that’s it,” Pottsgrove Business Manager David Nester told the board Tuesday. Advertisement “But it’s not that simple,” he said. State Sen. David Argall, R-29, of Schuylkill County, has proposed the same bill that failed by one vote last year, saying some changes in the makeup of the state Senate after the November election give him the votes he needs to get it passed. The first thing people should know, Nester said, is that school property taxes would not be eliminated completely at first. Under Argall’s bill, as much property tax as is necessary to pay down existing debts would remain until it was all paid. In Pottsgrove’s case, the annual debt payments add up to about $5 million, or 8 percent of the proposed $66.4 million budget for 2017-2018. That means about 15 to 20 percent of the current school property tax levy would remain, said Nester, along with the municipal and county property tax levies, which are a much smaller proportion of property taxes and not affected by Argall’s proposal. As for new debt, like that needed for school renovations or major building projects, that would have to be approved by voters in the spring, should the tax reform bill be adopted. “And we all know no one is going to vote themselves a tax increase,” at least not for the first few years, observed board member Ashley Custer. That means any construction or capital projects at the schools could only be undertaken with whatever cash the district has on hand, Nester said — which is one reason he has been advocating for putting surpluses into the district’s capital budget fund. Argall’s proposal also has the potential to lock in the funding disparity between rich and poor school districts with the difference being that instead of wealthy districts funding their own higher spending through their property taxes, the entire state would be paying for it under the “dollar-for-dollar” replacement provisions of the bill, according to Nester’s analysis. An Associated Press analysis of state data found that more than 70 percent of school property taxes were collected by the wealthiest half of school districts in 2014-15. That means that a wealthy district like Lower Merion, which funds a higher level of spending mostly out of its own property tax pockets, would instead enjoy the same level of spending but now at the expense of all personal income taxpayers in Pennsylvania. And none too soon, given that the high commercial and industrial property tax revenues on which districts like Lower Merion and Spring-Ford depend would be gone. “No more King of Prussia Mall, no more Glaxo, Merck or Wal-Mart paying the bills,” said Nester. To make up for what the Associated Press calls a $14 billion tax shift from property owners and businesses to Pennsylvania consumers and workers, the state’s personal income tax rate would be hiked from 3.07 percent — one of the lowest in the nation — to 4.95 percent. Additionally, the state’s sales tax would be increased from 6 to 7 percent and more things, including food and clothing, would be subject to the tax. This is where the question of who benefits and who doesn’t from the change gets murky, said Nester. “A lot will depend on your spending habits and it will be hard to track, because it’s a little more here, a little more there,” said Nester. One thing that is clear is that retirees who own their homes and whose primary income is pension and social security, will join property owning businesses as the clear winners in this tax shift, according to Nester’s analysis. On the other hand, residents of poorer districts — like Pottstown and Reading — would see little or no change in the gap between wealthy districts and poor ones under this plan, absent a decision by the Legislature to increase state funding to those districts under the fair funding formula, Nester said. In fact, he said, the Reading School District has so much debt that it would keep almost its entire property tax levy in place on top of its residents paying higher sales and income taxes if Argall’s reform plan is adopted. On the other hand, noted school board member Rick Rabinowitz, the elimination (or reduction) of local school property taxes would level the playing field in terms of attracting residents and businesses. It also has the potential to make homes in Pottstown — traditionally less expensive but carrying a higher tax burden — more attractive to homebuyers. As for future spending, all districts would only see an increase in funding based on whichever is lower — a percentage of income and sales tax projections, or the statewide average weekly wage — thus making school funding more varied from year to year and more dependent on the economy. As Nester asked at the end of his presentation — “what happens if there’s a recession?” The answer could be program cuts or the deterioration of facilities, said Nester. He also said there is currently no information about how this change would affect charter schools — if at all — and board member Bill Parker said funding constrictions at public schools under “this bill could have parents fleeing to charter schools with their children.” Eliminating property taxes under Argall’s bill could have many implications, both short-term and long-term said Nester, but one thing is clear: “This is not the windfall that most people anticipate.” Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $2.50 per week!

Indeed, my takeaway from Thursday's Public Safety and Security Committee hearing is that MGM Resorts International has won the lobbying war here in Connecticut against the Mashantucket Pequots and Mohegans, killing off the tribes' plans to build a casino in East Windsor meant to compete with MGM's new $950 million project in Springfield, now under construction. Using the tribes' own numbers, taking away their option to build a new casino in northern Connecticut will lead to the loss of 9,000 jobs once Springfield opens. Get ready for that. MGM has made it clear it will challenge in court the constitutionality of any new law giving the tribes a commercial casino license without competitive bidding, a potent threat. Even more powerful, though, has been MGM's warning that a new casino license for the tribes could threaten the deal, overseen by the U.S. Department of Interior, by which the tribes pay the state 25 percent, currently $270 million, of the revenues from their reservation slot machines. To make this point loud and clear MGM, hired Kenneth Salazar, the former secretary of the Department of the Interior, who wrote a letter suggesting a possible scenario in which "Connecticut's entitlement to the 25-percent revenue stream would likely terminate." The tribes, in return, presented their own hired expert testimony at last week's hearing, from a retired bureaucrat from the Department of the Interior, who contradicted the former secretary and suggested the deal guaranteeing the state the slots money is not at risk. You can't expect public safety committee members, who seem generally clueless in the first place about the legal points in this deal, to decide who is right. Moreover, Attorney General George Jepsen is expected to weigh in with an official opinion before the committee votes, and he, too, already has warned that a new tribal commercial casino could impact the payments from the reservation casinos. There is no way any legislator can spin the wheel and vote for the East Windsor casino if there is no airtight guarantee that it is not going to imperil the existing slot machine payments. There are a bunch of other reasons why the tribes' plan is unworkable at this late hour, from the lack of guidelines for how a commercial casino would be regulated by the state to the assertion by East Windsor officials that they don't need to put the issue to a referendum vote. A petition calling for a referendum already is circulating in town, and many legislators have suggested the lack of one is a deal killer on its own. No one, other than the tribes, seemed to be beating the dead East Windsor horse harder than Sen. Tim Larson, the committee chairman who also represents East Windsor. Larson made the incredible suggestion that a casino is not that different than the Wal-Mart and movie complex the town already has hosted nearby. He angrily challenged MGM's right to send a mailer to his constituents warning that they may not be getting a good deal from the tribes and pointing out they get no say without a referendum. Last I heard, senator, freedom of speech covers even Las Vegas gambling companies. During the testimony by an MGM senior vice president, the committee chairman loudly berated him, interrupted when the casino executive tried to answer a question and then stormed out of the hearing room. I think it was the most shameful performance I've ever seen in a General Assembly hearing. Must be the chairman, too, could see those promised gambling dollars slipping away from his district. The other casino expansion bill, a vague plan to have open competition for a new commercial casino license, also seems quite dead, given written testimony from the attorney general that the bill, as written, would immediately stop the slots machine money from the tribes, part of the deal that gives them a duopoly on state gaming. Many hundreds of millions of slot revenues could be lost before a new casino ever opened its doors and started paying. It's possible the state, with some professionally assisted planning, could indeed plan a two-part process to solicit proposals for commercial casinos, maybe in southwest Connecticut, without stopping the tribal slots money, but that is not going to come out of the haphazard process underway now before this committee. I feel badly for the tribes and for the employees who are certain to lose their jobs from this big new competitor. But much of the blame falls on the tribes. The obstacles that seem insurmountable now have been apparent for some time and no other solutions were developed. Maybe the tribes' commercial venture simply could have guaranteed the equivalent of the reservation slot machine payments, since they claim to expect to continue to pay them anyway. And maybe they should have proposed open bidding for a northern Connecticut casino license, with each bidder promising to match the reservation slot money. I suspect they would have been the only ones bidding. MGM can't, because it is too close to Springfield. Instead, the tribes are asking legislators to roll the dice, hoping for maybe more gambling dollars and jobs but putting at risk the revenue they already get. And then there is the certain court battle that will follow. It's not going to happen.

Grant | @kelligrant Saturday, 11 Mar 2017 | 2:00 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters March shopping deals    Friday, 10 Mar 2017 | 4:00 AM ET | 01:25 March is a month that, at first glance, doesn't lend itself to shopping sprees – there's no big sales holiday, and the turn of the season can shift retailers' focus. But with retail sales off to a rough start this year, shoppers are likely to find more deals, said smart shopping expert Trae Bodge. "The winter has been a little bit slow," she said. "Retailers want consumers to come out ... they have all this spring merchandise they want to move." kali9 | Getty Images Some categories are more likely to have deals than others. Bodge partnered with SlickDeals.net to determine which items historically have had great sales in March. One top buy? Spring apparel for men, women and children. Often, this makes the list of worst buys for March, but Bodge said retailers like Wal-Mart and American Apparel are already dropping prices. "Spring is coming," she said. "It's a little bit of a teaser sale." Hold off on purchases for home improvement, which see better prices around Memorial Day. And if you're in the market for a new TV, you'll have to shop carefully, said Bodge — sales are rarer now that we're in a quiet spot between the Super Bowl and Black Friday. "Maybe the TV you're looking for is on sale, maybe not," she said. "On the Money" airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 a.m. ET, or check listings for air times in local markets. Kelli B.

(Clark County Sheriff's Office via AP) JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) — A southern Indiana man accused of killing his former girlfriend and eating parts of her body in 2014 will undergo psychiatric evaluations, despite his insistence that he’s competent for trial. Defense lawyers say Joseph Oberhansley can’t consult with them or understand court proceedings. Clark County Circuit Court Judge Vicki Carmichael this week granted their request for evaluations. The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky, reports that Oberhansley, of Jeffersonville, told the judge that he is “completely innocent of all of these false charges” and is “completely competent.” Oberhansley is charged with murder, rape and abuse of a corpse in the September 2014 slaying of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton. If convicted, he could be sentenced to death.

Just the other day at work, in the women's washroom, a colleague was whining about her tattoo to a friend, and to anyone who cared to listen. Inspired by Priyanka Chopra's body art, she decided to get a small design on the side of her hand. Apparently, the reaction to her body art — at home and at work — wasn't what she had expected. She was now considering laser removal. A reason why they tell you to think before you ink. Work and tattoos is not a match made in heaven. Maybe because they started as the bastion of the marginalised: gypsies, freak shows, criminals and the non-conformists. A Pew Research Center study found that 76 per cent of respondents feel tattoos and piercings hurt an applicant's chances of being hired during a job interview. And 39 per cent of those surveyed believe employees with tattoos and piercings reflect poorly on their employers. I ink, therefore I am But etiquette trainer Sheena Agarwal has noticed some relaxation in corporate attitude towards body art. "While industries like banking, consultancy and finance are still strict about visible body art, in most other companies, I have noticed even HR professionals sporting small, tasteful inks," she says. It's the profile and industry that determines body art. For someone in a creative, marketing or media company, a tattoo is par for the course. Agarwal says, "Its just another mode of self-expression but make sure your tattoo is not offensive." A study by CareerBuilder found that tattoos are looked at as a sign of immaturity, bad judgment and bad taste by managers. Over 42 per cent of managers polled said their opinion of someone would be lowered by that person's visible body art. Corporate grooming and soft skills expert Konkana Bakshi agrees. "We form an opinion of a person in the first seven seconds of meeting them. A visible body art always conjures up images of recklessness and lack of credibility," she says. The Unwritten Code Globally, companies prefer written down codes dictating what is acceptable. Starbucks requires employees to cover all tattoos and remove certain piercings. Walt Disney World doesn't allow its employees to use bandages to cover tattoos, but they can use makeup. Wal-Mart specifies tattoos 'that are offensive or distractive are to be covered.' Tattoos at the workplace is a visibility issue - no one cares as long as it stays hidden. Wear dark coloured shirts, full sleeves, leave your hair open, or if need be, wear makeup to hide it. Clearly, body art and boardroom don't mix. But in India, dress codes are more understood than written down. Agarwal says, "Ultimately, they look at your CV not your tattoo." But even then, the best place for a professional to get inked would be the inner upper arm, shoulders, chest or lower back as they stay covered. What can cost you a promotion? Looks matter - Provocative attire: 44% - Wrinkled clothes or shabby appearance: 43% - Unconventional piercings: 32% - Too casual attire: 27% - Visible tattoos: 27% Other reasons: An unprofessional haircut, unprofessional facial hair, bad breath, heavy perfume, too much makeup Behave yourself - Negative or pessimistic attitude: 62% - Regularly showing up to work late: 62% - Using vulgar language: 51% - Regularly leaving work early: 49% - Taking too many sick days: 49% Other reasons: Gossiping, excessive social media during office time, neglecting to clean up after himself/herself, taking personal calls at work, taking smoke breaks Source: Careerbuilder 2015 survey on what factors can hurt an employees' career advancement prospects Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Local News Broward News Pembroke Pines News Burger fundraiser benefits toddler who can't eat Burger chain fundraiser to benefit toddler who can't eat This Sunday and Monday, a local burger chain and high school students will raise money to help get her to a medical center in Wisconsin that treats undiagnosed and rare diseases. This Sunday and Monday, a local burger chain and high school students will raise money to help get her to a medical center in Wisconsin that treats undiagnosed and rare diseases. Emily BlochContact ReporterSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel Privacy Policy Some of Mackenzie Nelson's favorite foods include pizza and doughnuts — but she's never eaten any of them. The only diet the 3-year-old has ever known is a pretend, plastic one from her toy kitchen set. Her actual nutrition comes from a formula fed directly to her stomach. That's because Mackenzie has a mystery illness that doctors can't diagnose. This Sunday and Monday, a local burger chain and high school students will raise money to help get her to a medical center in Wisconsin that treats undiagnosed and rare diseases.   The Pembroke Pines girl, who's just a few days shy of 4-years-old, has a rare condition that causes her body to treat food like poison and reject anything she consumes. Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome — or FPIES for short — is an intense food allergy that can result in severe vomiting and diarrhea. But that's usually triggered only by certain foods. Mackenzie on the other hand, reacts to everything. "If she were to even have a crumb, within two hours she'd react," said the girl's mother, Ashley Nelson. The 32-year-old single parent says her daughter's symptoms include violent vomiting and severe lethargy. After visits with 48 different specialists, doctors say they're stunned that Mackenzie's disease is still unidentified. "I'm convinced there's someone someplace who can help," Ashley Nelson said. "And I'm going to find them." Now, the Pembroke Pines and Southwest Ranches communities want to help. On Sunday and Monday, March 12 and 13, the Gimme A Burger restaurant on Flamingo Road will organize a fundraiser for Mackenzie. "I believe in always paying it forward," Director of Operations Mike Burstein said. "When I met Mackenzie and her mom, Ashley, I wanted to help." The burger spot will dedicate 20 percent of both days' profits toward the Nelson's next stop: the Undiagnosed and Rare Disease Program at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Because the hospital is north of West Palm Beach, it's considered out of network by Ashley's insurance and expenses incurred there are not covered. Archbishop McCarthy High School will also have students on hand selling T-shirts and wristbands to raise funds. Mackenzie isn't able to go to school due to her weakened immune system. Last year, a common cold put her in the hospital for nine days. So, Ashley Nelson homeschools her daughter. But before taking on the role of stay-at-home mother, nurse and teacher to Mackenzie, Nelson was a third-grade teacher at Fox Trail Elementary School in Davie. She never had any ties to Archbishop McCarthy High — except for a former student of hers. More than 10 years after sitting in Ashley Nelson's class, Lauren Perlstein saw her and Mackenzie's story on a local news station and wanted to help. "I'm amazed and beyond thankful," Ashley said of the gesture. From there, the Hungry For A Cure program was born. In January, Ashley Nelson started a GoFundMe page, through which she's raised about $12,000 of her $50,000 goal. The high school also helped produce teal wristbands that read "Hungry For A Cure." They're worn regularly by both Nelson and her mother, Donna Nelson, who lives with Nelson and Mackenzie. The only thing Mackenzie's body can consume is a formula called Neocate Splash, referred to by doctors as "liquid gold." The formula, which costs about $1,000 a month, comes from the United Kingdom and contains already broken-down amino acids. It is administered through a gastrostomy tube, or G-tube for short, delivering nutrition directly to the girl's stomach. But that doesn't stop Mackenzie from "eating." The 23-pounder sits on the carpet of her living room and prepares her meals. Dumped in front of her is a pile of plastic foods that she'll fix for herself, including macaroni and cheese, ice cream and broccoli. Though Mackenzie can't physically eat, she has the soul of a foodie, preparing recipes at her toy kitchen set, making soup for her mother and asking her grandma what's for dinner. Every day, the sandy blonde packs a lunch box for herself by stuffing it with her plastic foods — "In case I get hungry," she explains. Her family always picks up an extra copy of the weekly Publix circular for her to peruse and choose what to "eat." Her pants are made for a 24-month-old with the waist rolled to fit her tiny frame. After a long day of poking and prodding at the hospital, or physical therapy, Mackenzie celebrates with her favorite treat, plain shaved ice. Donna even bought a snow cone maker from Walmart to have the treats readily available for her granddaughter. "It's hard to hold back the tears," Ashley said of her daughter's constant hunger. "Last Christmas, she asked Santa for food." But the mother-daughter duo are making the best of things. "We're BFFs," an abbreviation for best friends forever, Mackenzie says with a nod and smile of her relationship with her mother. She pours water from her plastic tea cup — pink, her favorite color — into her mom's cup to share. Even water has to be checked before consumption. Anything with added minerals will trigger a reaction in Mackenzie. Even though she can't eat it, Gimme A Burger will honor Mackenzie at its fundraiser with a sandwich of her namesake. The Mackenzie Sandwich, with marinated chicken breast, provolone cheese and pear-infused coleslaw on a brioche bun, was made with the girl's mother in mind, according to Burstein. "She's got to be the strongest woman in the world," he said of Ashley Nelson. "When you see this girl, you fall in love with her. I knew I needed to help." The fundraiser for Mackenzie's medical care will take place on Sunday, March 12, from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and on Monday, March 13, from 3:30 to 8 p.m. at Gimme A Burger, 2010 N.

(WFLA) – A children’s toy is being recalled due to a choking hazard, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Kids II Inc. is recalling Oball Rattles because a plastic disc on the ball can break, releasing small beads that kids can choke on. So far, there have been 42 reports of the plastic disc breaking. There were also two reports of beads found in children’s mouths, and three reports of gagging, according to the CPSC. The rattles included in the recall have date codes T0486, T1456, T2316, T2856 and T3065. Those codes can be found on the inner surface of the rattle. The products were sold by several retailers, including Target, Walgreens and Walmart. They were also sold online. If you have an Oball Rattle at home, you should take it away from your child and check to see if it’s impacted by the recall on the Kids II Inc. website.

Spark Festival continues to March 26. Full schedule at sparkfestival.ca     Since 2004, Victoria’s Atomic Vaudeville has staged outrageous cabarets, musicals and more. One of the company’s greatest hits is Ride the Cyclone. It had a critically acclaimed run in Chicago and, playing off-Broadway in 2016, was cited by the New York Times as one of the year’s top picks. Atomic Vaudeville’s latest offering is BlissKrieg, a 90-minute musical co-directed by Britt Small and Jacob Richmond. The driving creative forced behind Ride the Cyclone, Richmond is also the show’s dramaturge. The show is mostly the creation of Alex Wlasenko, who wrote the bulk of the book and collaborated on a score with Hank Pine. Before Thursday’s performance, Small explained to the audience that BlissKrieg is a “work in progress.” Bugs are being worked out; it will be tweaked and prodded and sections will be rewritten. A festival of new work such as the Belfry’s Spark Festival gives audiences the chance to have a sneak preview. What we saw on Thursday is a musical that still needs a lot of work. Certainly there were bright moments. Rielle Braid is a fine singer/actor who can grip us by the lapels with her big — and often thrilling — voice. Another stand-out is R.J. Peters, imbuing the proceedings with a pleasingly seedy gravitas. Ditto for the charming Madeleine Humeny, a very promising actor who knows how to make a character (notably a 1930s-era Dust Bowl woman) her very own. However, as it stands, BlissKrieg is a bit of a mish-mash, lacking in focus and, at times, coherency. Two key characters are Braid, who plays Tilda, and Ming Hudson, portraying Tilda’s daughter Jingwei. Tilda explains she’s one of the “Jimmy Jammers” — a cultish tribe that, for some reason, is obsessed with Jimmy Stewart. Jingwei is a gothy teen with black lipstick who dreams of running a vampire sex club. She’s an odd, brainy kid with fantasy crushes on such unlikely candidates as filmmakers George A. Romero and Werner Herzog as well as surrealist artist Marcel Duchamp. The introduction of Tilde and Jingwei — who happen to be time travellers — is followed by a disjointed patchwork of scenes. The notion (if I have it right) is that this is Jingwei’s “show,” which she’s showing her mom. Or something like that. One of the strongest routines is a spoof of The Music Man. Wearing a straw boater and red-striped jacket, Peters plays a Harold Hill-like con-man selling the town on the idea of Walmart. It will, he promises, provide greatest-hits CDs, fast food and discounted tombstones. Theatrically it works, but in terms of satire, it’s pretty soggy stuff. Elsewhere, a couple who are into kinky sex sing about transgender bathrooms and a certain someone who had a Russian prostitute urinate on him. A doorman tells of being fired because of his habit of freestyle rapping. He complains of being replaced by “a rock.” There’s also a robot who tells knock-knock jokes, followed by an appearance by Laika the Russian space dog. Later on, BlissKreig gets more serious, weaving a thread of social responsibility into the skits. A young girl sings about a negative inner voice that saps her confidence. The rapper has a rap battle with his real adversary: himself. A bullied boy is given advice by a visiting character, Gaylord, who wears a bathrobe and a paper crown. Later, the show jumps the shark with an absolutely mystifying bit in which chess pieces execute a cheerleading routine. If it all sounds a bit collegiate, that’s because it is. That could be forgiven if the material was funnier, sharper and less obvious. BlissKreig’s attempts at satire seem more of a de rigueur pose than anything else. Certainly the nihilist wit and absurdity found in such Atomic Vaudeville productions as Legoland and Ride the Cyclone is in short supply. Some of the songs (backed by a recorded soundtrack and a live bass player) are good. Others are just OK. Again, it’s important to mention that theatre — and especially musicals — can require a long gestation period. With hard work, and perhaps some luck, it’s possible BlissKrieg will be remoulded and polished into the wild and hilarious humour fest it aspires to be. achamberlain@timescolonist.com © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Sandy Springs Police blotter, Feb. 10-24 From Sandy Spring police reports Feb. 10 through Feb. 24. The following information was provided by Capt. Steve Rose. Capt. Steve Rose Robbery 7840 Holcomb Bridge Road — On Feb. 23, just before 4 p.m., the SunTrust Bank branch was robbed after a man handed the teller a handwritten note demanding money and threatening violence if the money was not given to him. An undisclosed amount of cash was taken and the suspect placed it in a small cloth bag and left the bank. Burglary 8100 block of Colquitt Road — On Feb. 10, an apartment was burglarized after someone came in through a window. The resident is missing four rings and a watch. 100 block of Cedar Run — On Feb. 11, the resident said someone entered his apartment through a rear window and took a PS4 an, iPad, an iPod Touch, and an HP laptop. 5900 block of Roswell Road — On Feb. 13, about 2:30 a.m. cops were called to a business where they spoke with an employee who said he was working inside when three suspects in white masks attempted to break in. He walked to the door and the three jumped into a white Ford Escape vehicle and fled. 400 block of Heritage Way — On Feb. 13, a witness reported that she saw a car park in front of a neighbor’s home and watched a man get out and walk up to the home. The man later got back into his car and left, only to return a short time later, when he backed his car into the carport, opened the trunk, and then made several trips to and from his car. The officer arrived and found the home had been forcefully entered and several items taken. 7000 block of Blandford Place — On Feb. 14, between 11:30 a.m. and 1:15 p.m., the resident said several pieces of jewelry were taken. Two back doors were unlocked and no forced entry was found. 8100 block of Colquitt Road — On Feb. 14, the resident said someone entered the apartment and took a 32-inch Vizio TV, a PS3, and a laptop. The entry point was most likely a kitchen window. 5700 block of Long Island Drive — On Feb. 16, someone stole a KitchenAid stove, valued at $10,000, from the kitchen area of a home under construction. It appears the crook got inside through the unlocked garage and then dragged the stove back through the garage. 900 block of Johnson Ferry Road — Between Feb. 13 and Feb. 16, someone entered the office and took keys, belonging to the parking entrance machines; $603 in cash was stolen. 5920 Roswell Road — On Feb. 20, just before 3 a.m., two iMac computers were taken from a store. Video showed two men forcing the glass on the door and taking the stolen items. 1110 block of Hammond Drive — On Feb. 23, a construction foreman said that someone entered the east side of a building through an unlocked gate, then forced open two storage areas and took several items. Several rolls of electrical wire were stolen. Theft Fenwick Place — On Feb. 10, the victim said the Veterans Administration shipped her medication to her mailing address on Feb. 7 at 4:30 p.m.; however, it appears the mail was taken before she received it. 100 Embassy Row — On Feb. 10, a 23-year-old student said she left the classroom, leaving her iPad and laptop bag behind. The bag was turned in by one of the staff but the iPad was missing. 2600 block of Spring Creek Lane — On Feb. 11, a 24-year-old man said his car has been stolen although he admitted he was a few payments behind on it. 6690 Roswell Road — On Feb. 11, a 54-year-old man said that following his workout at a gym, he received a text from his bank that a $4,919 charge had been declined at the Apple Store. He checked his wallet, finding that his driver’s license and four credit cards were missing. On Feb. 12, a cab driver said he picked up a woman at the Magic City Strip Club in Atlanta and took her to the Wyndham Hotel on Powers Ferry Road. She said she would get her money she owed from her room. She never returned. 4920 Roswell Road — On Feb. 12, a young woman reported she went to a grocery store and left her iPhone on the self-checkout lane. The store video shows someone picking it up and walking out with it. 5600 Roswell Road — On Feb. 12, before 10 p.m., the manager of a sports bar reported that a party of four ran out on a $72 tab. All four ran in different directions and absconded from the restaurant. 1145 Hammond Drive — On Feb. 13, a 36-year-old woman said someone stole makeup from her hotel room. 300 block of Winding River Drive — On Feb. 14, a man reported that his ex-girlfriend stole his computer tablet and changed the passwords on three Google accounts. She also sent his new girlfriend an email. A woman called police to say that she purchased a car off Craigslist and believed it to be stolen. The officer checked it and it was indeed stolen from DeKalb County. The car was impounded. 5600 block of Roswell Road — On Feb. 15, a 58-year-old woman reported that her 2015 Honda CRV with a NC tag was stolen. It was last seen in front of a tavern at the Prado. 1155 Mt. Vernon Hwy — On Feb. 15, a 63-year-old man reported he accidentally left his cellphone in a store. He left, and then later realized he left it there, then returned to discover that the phone was gone. The phone is a Samsung Edge 7 valued at $700. On Feb. 16, a 16-year-old student reported that while at a baseball game, his wallet and its contents were stolen from his unlocked locker. 500 block of Enclave Circle — On Feb. 16, a 2007 Honda Ridgeline was stolen from the residence. 8100 block of Colquitt Road — On Feb. 16, a maroon 2006 Chevy Malibu was stolen from the apartment parking lot. 8371 Roswell Road — On Feb. 17 ,a 26-year-old employee said that during a slow night at the restaurant where he worked, he sat at the bar doing his taxes and at one point placed his wallet on the bar, then left for a few moments. Someone stole the wallet. 400 block of Pearl Cove Court — On Feb. 17, the victim said his mail was stolen from his mailbox between Feb. 12 and Feb. 17. 7000 block of Princeton Trace — On Feb. 20, someone cut and then stole the copper wiring from 13 light poles at the tennis courts. 5501 Glenridge Drive — On Feb. 23, a 23-year-old man reported that his white 1982 Chevy S-10 was stolen during the night. Thefts from Vehicles Between Feb. 11 and Feb. 14, there were nine thefts from vehicles. Between Feb. 16, and Feb. 23, there were 14 thefts from vehicles. Fraud 5920 Roswell Road — On Feb. 10, security employees at a home improvement  store told officers that two men entered the store and went to the flooring department, where they picked out a carpet. They walked out with the carpet, passed the registers, and then returned to customer service, where they attempted to return the carpet for a refund of $178. They used an ID of a man that matched the ID of another fraudulent return. A 29-year old woman called police and reported that her bank contacted her to notify her that her credit card was being used at a department store. She informed them she was not there and so the purchase was declined. She said that she was at a fast-food restaurant at 6360 Powers Ferry Road, earlier, and believes that her card was traced or copied. She recalled the employee was wiping her card with receipt paper, telling her the card was dirty. She is not sure that the card was copied but thought it was odd. It is more convenient to pay with the debit/credit card, but you inherit the risk. Carry a few bucks in cash.  7000 block of Glisten Ave — On Feb. 10, a 58-year-old woman said she was looking for part-time work and answered an e-mail ad on the internet for a mystery shopper. She was contacted by a woman calling herself Brenda Adkins who sent the victim a check for $3,150, which she deposited in her account that the bank later closed due to the fraudulent activity. Adkins gave a phone number listed in Jacksonville, Fla., and sent the check from Remsen, N.Y. You should already have recognized this as a scam setup. It sounds like she deposited the check before sending funds along to a second address. Although her account was shut down from fraudulent investigation, she didn’t lose money, according to the report. A 25-year-old man said someone opened several accounts in his name, nine total. Two were with the Department of Education. A 77-year-old man reported that someone opened a credit account at a department store in his name. He believes that someone took mail from his box in mid-January. An employee at a business at the Concourse said he received a fraudulent email, disguised as an email from the owner, requesting W-2 forms for his 13 employees. The email was sent to the email address. Later, the same email requested a payment to a separate account number, which made the complainant suspicious. He then found out the email had been sent from someone other than the owner and was not displayed, but rather only listed the owner’s name in the “from” slot. On Feb. 19, just before 6 p.m., a 35-year-old woman said she received a phone call from an out-of-state number and spoke to a man with a heavy accent, described as Spanish, who said her husband had been in an accident and they were holding him until she paid them money. She went to a grocery store at 5630 Roswell Road and wired $1,000 to a woman in Puerto Rico. Once she sent the money, she called her husband and found that he was not being held or had been in an accident. OK, I know what you women are saying right now. “I would have said, ‘Keep him. He’s not worth $1,000. Yuk-yuk.’” Well, at least my wife said that. Sadly, so many people are easily duped. Too bad. Here is a good philosophy when dealing with unsolicited conversation asking for your money: Be politely skeptical and ask questions. Usually, scammers are not so good at answering multiple questions. On the Feb. 17, a 54-year old woman received a call from someone she described as having an Indian accent, who said she was with IRS. She was told she needed to pay $2600 or warrants would be served. Unfortunately, she complied and went to Wal-Mart and purchased iTunes Cards for that amount. 5900 block of Roswell Road — On Feb. 21, a 17-year-old said he placed an ad on an internet sales site to sell a set of stereo speakers. A man named “Shawn” contacted him and made arrangements to meet. He gave the victim a $240 check and showed him an Alabama driver’s license. The check came back as fraudulent a couple of days later and the driver’s license was a fake, too. The victim did say the man was in an 18-wheeler and apparently making a delivery. A 57-year-old woman said she answered an internet ad for work and was contacted by an HR person looking to expand into the Atlanta area. The victim received a check for $2,450with instructions to send $2,400 of it to another account.  She later received a check for $3,650 with similar instructions, but now she was suspicious. She received numerous text messages threatening legal action if she did not forward money. She was informed by her bank that $2,400 was being deducted from her account and it was now closed due to fraudulent activity. I’m hoping that most of you realized this scam early on, since they are frequently listed in my reports. That little light bulb up there represents when you should have recognized the scam, being an unsolicited check sent to you with instructions to keep some, but send the rest to a separate address. A 40-year old limo driver reported that he was hired by a man to make a couple of round trips to Milledgeville, Ga., with several stops in between. He later found the credit card used was stolen. The value of the trips totaled $1,240. Arrests 5610 Roswell Road — On Feb. 10, security officers at a discount department store observed a man who picked up a iRobot Vacuum Cleaner and left the store without paying for it. Officers were notified and were at the store when the man walked out. He was detained and then arrested on felony shoplifting charges. It appears this is connected to previous vacuum cleaner thefts at this and other locations by more than one person. The person arrested was wanted in DeKalb County for shoplifting as well. On Feb. 12, following a traffic stop on Roswell Road, the driver was found to have two outstanding warrants from Atlanta Police on traffic charges. He was turned over to APD. On Feb. 16, an officer responding to a suspicious car on Hammond Drive detected an odor of marijuana from the car after the driver rolled the window down. The passenger was cited for possession (8 oz.) but the driver was jailed after a warrant was found on his record, from Franklin County. 6120 Peachtree-Dunwoody Road — On Feb. 18, about 6 p.m., officers were called to a hotel to meet the staff to investigate drug use inside two rooms. The staff initially tried to investigate but the guests refused to let them in. The officers went to the rooms and entered, smelling marijuana and located the guests, who, surprisingly, were packing up to leave. One of the guests was on parole and probation on a felony burglary charge, and was not supposed to be involved with alcohol or drugs, which he was. He was also in possession of a 9mm gun, stolen from South Carolina. He was jailed on several felony charges. 5610 Roswell Road — On Feb. 20, loss prevention staff at a discount department store watched a male take two box sets of cards and conceal them, then try and leave the store. He was arrested for the $89 theft. Other Things Gettysburg Place and Roberts Drive — On Feb. 11, just after midnight, a traffic sergeant observed a car on Ga. 400 in the northbound emergency lane moving at about 95 mph. The car exited onto Northridge where the police unit lit up the blue lights. The car then fled. The sergeant, having only traffic charges, terminated the stop when he realized the car was accelerating to elude him. Minutes later, the sergeant drove up on the car at Dunwoody Lakes/Dunwoody Hills Condos, where it had wrecked into the brick sign; he found that the driver fled. A passing motorist said she saw a male running into the woods. A search was initiated but the driver was not located. Inside the car were a couple of grams of cocaine, pills, syringes, a cellphone and $4. A .22-caliber Rohm pistol also was recovered. An 18-year-old woman reported that someone, whom she did not know, knocked on her door. She believes the man is involved in drugs. Furthermore, she said her cousin owes this person around $800, although she’s not sure it’s for drugs. The man has consistently hounded her for this debt to be paid and offered to erase the debt in exchange for sex, something she will not do. A 27-year-old man said he was driving on Abernathy beneath Ga. 400 on Feb. 12. He has a rear window with the following writing: “No Ban, No War, No Trump.” A truck pulled up next to him and a man yelled obscenities at him, including the dreaded f-word. The driver of the truck then accelerated, causing exhaust smoke to obscure the man’s view. Both vehicles pulled onto Williamson Road. The truck then made a U-turn and drove away, again dispensing exhaust smoke. The man in the car took, or said he took, a photo. The tag on the truck came out to a nearby address. The officer spoke with the person at the house the truck was registered to. The man acknowledged seeing the car and writing on the window, but he and his passenger denied making those statements. 8200 block of Roswell Road — On Feb. 12, around 7 p.m., a patrol officer spotted a man in the center of Northridge Road, picking up items from the road. The officer stopped and spoke to the man, and noticed he was bleeding about the side of his head. A car stopped at a nearby gas station and that driver exited and appeared to be upset with the man who was in the center of the road. Turns out the man had taken a taxi from Stone Mountain to Sandy Springs and refused to pay the $120 fare, then jumped from the moving car. He claimed the driver pushed him out of the moving car, from the back seat. Neither man was arrested. The injured man declined medical attention. A woman reported that she received a Valentine’s card at her office. The card had a rather lame poem but an excerpt read: “I would like to be our Valentine. I want to be our moon cause cool, calm, and always there.” She said the note was delivered with chocolate and flowers. 6650 Roswell Road — On Feb. 17, cops responded to a restaurant and met with the manager, who said a couple purchased shots of liquor but now refused to pay. The man said the shots were too expensive. He said the bartender offered the shots for free and he therefore, would not pay. The officer said if he did not, he would be arrested for stealing the liquor. The man said he would rather go to jail than pay.

Well, here's the truth: The working men and women of this country are working more jobs and more hours, and they're still barely hanging on. Beneath those fingertips, they can feel that middle-class dream - the American dream - slipping right away from them. It's time for President Trump to do something about it. I come from Ohio. It's where I was born, and it's where my roots run deep. We are humble, proud and hard-working people who've been battered by the twin storms of globalization and greed. This past weekend, I was in another state full of humble, proud, and hard-working people; I marched with workers from the Nissan plant in Canton, Miss. For decades, manufacturing provided millions of Ohioans and Mississippians a solid roadway to the middle class. A family breadwinner could work full time and earn enough money to buy a home, put the kids through college, and enjoy a secure retirement. But today, 600,000 American manufacturing workers make less than $9.60 per hour - barely more than they could earn at a fast food joint. And their real wages dropped nearly 4.5 percent from 2003 to 2013. They are barely hanging on. We marched in Canton because Nissan isn't giving its workers the dignity and respect they earn every single day along that assembly line. They are furloughed for the equivalent of months throughout the year, killing plans for homeownership. They don't have a predictable schedule, putting college tuition for their kids out of reach. They've even had their pensions frozen, making dreams of retirement seem more like a cruel joke than an attainable goal. And that's just the full-time workers. Nissan uses a temp company, Kelly Services, to fill almost half the jobs at the plant. Temp workers there receive $12 an hour plus the promise that after a certain time, they'll become full Nissan employees. But many of them languish for years. To make matters worse, this poverty-wage business model is paid for by our tax dollars. In fact, Nissan and Kelly Services have scooped up more than $3 billion in federal contracts and loans. That means our government is helping keep American factory workers in poverty jobs while corporate executives get to pocket billions in profits. This isn't just happening in Canton. Right now, the U.S. government is America's No. 1 low-wage job creator, funding more than 2 million poverty jobs across the country through contracts, loans and grants with private corporations. That's more than McDonald's and Wal-Mart combined. And when federal contractors like Nissan and Kelly Services illegally violate the rights of their workers to organize, they're passing poverty from generation to generation. So you can understand why Ohioans and Mississippians sat up and listened when Donald Trump promised that he would bring manufacturing back; that he would create more jobs and better wages. Everyday Americans took him at his word. And now it's time to hold him accountable. It's time for President Trump to guarantee that the only companies doing business with the federal government are the ones that pay living wages, provide safe work environments and benefits, and don't fight their workers when they want to form a union. We know that he can do this, because he's done it before. Workers at the Trump International Hotel - a federally owned property - were allowed to form a union shortly after President Trump was elected. It's time to demand that other federal contractors do the same thing. Grandma was right. The truth always does catch up. And the truth of the matter is this: President Trump made us a promise. It's a promise that we all need to ensure that he keeps - for our workers, for our families and for the future we all share.

(Mike McArthur/CBC) Greg Rasmussen National Reporter Greg Rasmussen is a National Reporter for CBC news based in Vancouver. He's covered news stories across Canada and around the world for more than two decades.

External Links Vancouver Aquarium Ocean Pollution Research Program Vancouver Island University Centre for Shellfish Research (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) Scientists are growing increasingly concerned about microplastics in water and in the food chain, but they face some daunting challenges in the race to uncover the sources of the problem. "We're encountering a pollutant unlike any pollutant we've ever seen before," says Dr. Peter Ross, director of ocean pollution research at the Vancouver Aquarium. "This is not a chemical pollutant, it's a structural pollutant." Recent samples his team have taken off the B.C. coast contained up to 25,000 plastic particles and fibres in just one cubic metre of water. Yes, some of it comes from plastic bags, foam packaging, cigarette butts and other remnants of the millions of tonnes of plastic debris slowly breaking down in the world's oceans.  But there are some surprising sources, too, like laundry. This water sample taken by researchers in B.C.'s Strait of Georgia contained an average of 3,200 plastic particles per cubic metre of ocean. Other samples off Vancouver contained up to 25,000 particles. (Vancouver Aquarium) "A single sweater could release as much as 10,000 particles of microplastic fibres," said Ross. "That's getting into the wastewater stream, and you have a million or two million people doing such laundry — it adds up." Sewage treatment plants may hold answers But no one knows yet how washing your favourite fleece jacket fits into the bigger picture. To find out, Ross is working with sewage treatment plants to measure the number and types of fibres in the water coming in, and later sampling the treated water as it flows out into the Fraser River to compare. What they find could lead to changes in filtering techniques at treatment plants. Water sampling is also being done out in the open ocean, revealing a mix of fibres and other microplastics, defined as anything smaller than five millimetres in size. It's a global issue, so everyone has an interest in reducing the amount of plastic being added to the world's waterways. One estimate puts it at the equivalent of a garbage truckload every minute. At this rate, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Microplastics at 'alarming levels' in Canadian lakes and rivers Plastics dumped in world's oceans estimated at 8M tonnes annually To home in on the problem, technicians at the Vancouver Aquarium lab recently began using a $325,000 infrared spectrometer like the kind usually found in crime labs. It can identify the type of plastic from tiny samples. 'It's not going to give us the exact fingerprint," says Ross. "It won't say 'Walmart fleece made in China,' but it will confirm it is plastic, give us the category, tell us about additives and sometimes actually a manufacturer." MEC funding research Vancouver-based Mountain Equipment Co-op has a long track record of trying to reduce the ecological footprint of its products. Many in Canada's clothing industry worry that fleece, like this raw material at MEC's Vancouver test facility, could be a major source of microplastics. (Tristan Le Rudulier/CBC) Jeff Crook, MEC's chief product officer says microplastics are on the radar of a number of outdoor speciality retailers including MEC and Patagonia. The co-operative says it's leading Canadian efforts on the retail side to look for solutions. "We can work upstream with manufacturers, as we've done in different periods of our history, to change the way things are made, either the materials going into them or construction, manufacturing methods." Interviewed at the company's product testing lab, Crook said the world's multibillion-dollar textile industry likely can reduce its microplastic impact, but the lack of research to date means there's not yet a clear sense of how to go about it. Vancouver Aquarium ocean pollution researcher Peter Ross is working with sewage treatment plants to measure the number and types of fibres in the water coming in. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC) To help find out, MEC is donating $50,000 to Ross's work on plastics. It's the first time the co-op has directly funded scientific research. The federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and various universities are also studying the issue. 'We don't know what the risk is' It does seems as though textiles are a significant contributor to microplastics in the oceans. At Vancouver Island University's Nanaimo campus, Dr. Sarah Dudas leads a team dissolving oyster guts in the name of science. Her team harvested thousands of shellfish from multiple locations along the B.C. coast. They use chemicals to break down the organic materials, leaving behind microplastics, which are painstakingly filtered and counted. 'We're finding fibres in almost every shellfish.' - Sarah Dudas, Centre for Shellfish Research "We're finding fibres in almost every shellfish," she says, holding up a piece of the filter paper she uses in her study. When plankton and filter-feeding organisms ingest these plastics, it's a gateway into the food supply. "We don't know what the risk is of microplastics from an ecosystem level or a human consumption level. We don't know a lot about how microplastics might affect food safety or food security," she says. "We have our work cut out for us." This microscopic image shows a tiny zooplankton tangled in a microplastic fibre. Plankton are part of the diet for some bigger fish, give the microplastics a gateway into the food supply. (Vancouver Aquarium) Vancouver Island oyster farmer Keith Reid puts about 12 million oysters onto dinner plates every year. The owner of Odyssey Shellfish says he's supportive of the research. "It's something as an industry we need to know," he says. "Are there microplastics in our oysters? And if there are, what levels are safe?"

(Photo: Robert F. Bukaty / AP) 14 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Portland, Maine — Gone are the days when cyclists had to put away their bikes for the winter. These days, hard-core riders are staying outdoors year round thanks to “fat bikes” that allow them to conquer winter’s worst instead of staying indoors on a stationary bike. The bikes, with comically large tires, have come into the mainstream in the past couple of years, after being introduced about a decade ago. John Grondin, 48, of Scarborough, got his fat bike to kick the winter blues. “I wanted to get outside and ride in the winter,” he said. “I like to ride, period. I’ll ride a road bike. I’ll ride a mountain bike. I just want to ride.” The ginormous tires are wide enough to float over snow and bounce over obstacles. Groomed snowmobile trails provide miles and miles of winter riding. Fat bikes represent the first major bicycle trend in several decades, after BMX bikes in the 1970s and conventional mountain bikes in the 1980s, said Jay Townley, partner in Pennsylvania-based Gluskin-Townley Group, a consultant and market research company focusing on the bicycle business. Growth in the segment has provided something to cheer about for bike retailers and has prevented a slide in bike sales, which number about 18 million units a year, he said. “The industry, quite frankly, needed something. If anything, the fat tire bike helped to keep a stable bike industry instead of losing volume,” he said. The NPD Group, which tracks retail sales of bikes in the U.S., reports that fat tire bike sales have grown eightfold in the past three years, to $74.7 million in 2016. The growing popularity can be seen at fat bike races. Every weekend there are races and festivals across the nation’s snowbelt. Dozens of riders braved single-digit temperatures in February for the “Sugarloaf Fat Tire Festival” at Maine’s tallest ski mountain. The bikes aren’t cheap. Purchased at an independent bike shop, they can easily top $1,000, and the price goes up from there. But less-costly versions are being sold these days at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart. Bike shops appreciate the extra business during what’s typically a slow time of the year. The Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop used to close for the winter but is now offering fat bike rentals for riding inside Maine’s Acadia National Park. Cyclists can ride their fat bikes even if there’s a lack of snow that sidelines snowmobiles and cross-country skiers and others winter sports, said shop manager Adam Gariepy. Range Morton, sales manager at Gorham Bike and Ski in Portland, said fat bike sales creep upward when there’s a lack of snow that leads to a corresponding decrease in ski sales. “The fat bikes really help us to get through the winter,” Morton said. “They were a big help last year and this year.” David Crowell, of Laconia, New Hampshire, said riding takes him back to his childhood, except that he couldn’t afford a $5,000 carbon-fiber bike when he was 12. Getting outdoors, there’s a sense of freedom, and perhaps a bit of danger. After all, there’s no way to avoid the occasional spill while bombing around in the snow. Thankfully, riders note, snow hurts less than pavement in a crash. “There’s something about those big fat tires — they tend to put a grin on people’s faces,” Crowell, 47, said. “It’s like being a kid. You’re out there doing something. Maybe you shouldn’t be doing it, but you’re doing it anyway.” 14 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Written by Catchthisdrift Topics: Donald Trump, Transgender, sexuality, Kellyanne Conway Thursday, 9 March 2017 Conway before she became transgender. Kellyanne Conway, a Counselor to President Trump, yesterday during an interview with the Wichita Weekly Shopper admitted she is a transgender woman and has an "alternate vagina." Ms. Conway says she has been transgender since she was an infant, saying "my parents used to say "coochie coochie coochie" to me, which I think awoke my feelings that I was in fact a female trapped in a male body." Conway went on to explain that "coochie" is a term for a vagina, so she was essentially hearing "vagina vagina vagina" for the first year of her life. Ms. Conway said she had not been planning on announcing her being transgender, but during a stop at Walmart, which insists that people use the restroom aligned with their biological sex, she was forced to use the men's room. "People saw me go in the men's room, which I guess seemed out of place to them given my long flowing locks of golden curls." Although Ms. Conway says she is not ashamed of being transgender, she is going to try to keep that fact from her boss so she can continue to use the ladies room at work.

Need a hair cut or nails done? Maybe you need a new license or even a place of worship. Malls today need to be the one stop for everything in a person’s life. “Shopping malls are places now where people go now to do those things in their lives that are important to them,” said Eastwood Mall Spokesperson Joe Bell. Big retailers have been off to a rocky start this year. JCPenney and Staples are planning on shutting down stores, though exact locations have not yet been announced. Recent local brick and mortar store closures: Family Christian — all stores Macy’s at the Shenango Valley Mall Sears at the Shenango Valley Mall Sears Appliance and Hardware store in Austintown Sears in New Castle Your Home by Goldsteins in Boardman Wet Seal — all stores The Limited at the Eastwood and Southern Park malls Aeropostale at the Eastwood and Southern Park malls Kmart in Boardman Kmart in Warren Cards & Collectibles in Boardman “We saw just a slew of national bankruptcies this year and it’s been early in the year. It’s a little bit unsettling to a lot of people,” Bell said. It’s not just stores closing. Many companies, like Walmart and Lowe’s, are laying off thousands of employees throughout the country. Chains can place some blame on the tremendous success of online shopping, especially through Amazon. Shoppers can buy anything on the site and they don’t even have to leave their homes. Bell said the Eastwood Mall will never fight the success of online shopping — instead, they embrace it. “We’re going to see online shopping here for a long, long time but you’re also going to see places where you’re going to walk in, put your hands on merchandise, and by it that moment.” Another reason stores are closing their doors has to do with natural selection. “It’s a very competitive environment so certainly, there will be some winners and losers,” said PNC economist Mekael Teshome. Bell said big name stores closing is nothing new to the mall industry. “Strauss, Kauffman’s, and others have just gone away and others rise to take their place. So in that sense, you shouldn’t be too alarmed when you see other retailers go away. It’s part of a natural cycle.” The Eastwood Mall’s big name retailers are doing pretty well, Bell said. He said the Cafaro Company is always thinking ahead about what is going to sell, which is why popular retailer H&M moved in. .

Credit: Sarah Rice/Redux By Colby Buzzell March 10, 2017 More News Hunter S. Thompson Widow Plots Weed Strains Based on Author's Pot NFL Players Association to Study Marijuana for Pain-Management Why the Addiction Recovery Community Should Accept Medical Marijuana All Stories Editor's note: This is an expert from the story "The Perils of Pot Farming: A Season on America's Least Chill Weed Farm" from this month's issue of Men's Journal. Before I started as Eric's full-time employee, I thought a weed farm was kind of like a Christmas tree farm. You plant seeds, water them, let nature do its thing, and when it's time and they're big enough, you chop them down and sell them, make your money and everyone has a merry Christmas. The end. It's not. "All it takes is one bad run," Nelson says, "and you lose your entire ass in this game." There's an endless list of things that can go wrong. The wind can wipe out your crop; the plants can all stress out and hermaphrodite on you; you can lose them to gophers, deer, caterpillars, spider mites, broad mites, bud rot, mold, powdery mildew, thieves, or a bad crew; if it's too dark in the greenhouses, you can end up with larfy-ass buds, which means they're too fluffy; and you can overfertilize and burn your plants chemically. Eric says his crop is totally organic, but he guesses that most growers use chemicals on their plants at least once during the grow. Related Meet the Mogul Bringing Great Weed Back to Jamaica Once the premiere destination for pot, Jamaica's product has declined – but Balram Vaswani plans to change that Nelson inspects the plants by feeling them with his hands. He says he can tell they're “happy." "They're perky," he says. "See how they're lush and green and full of moisture? They're not distressed. If they're sad, they're droopy. Probably dehydrated. If they're unhappy, they don't smell like anything and start to rot." Nelson grabs a bud from another plant and has me take a whiff. It smells like weed. They all do. I can't really tell if they're happy or not, but they look and smell night-and-day different from the weed we smoked in high school. That shit was brown and full of seeds, and it was sold out of plastic Baggies, usually by a classmate who went to school primarily to sell weed. Nelson pulls out his phone and says we should document our working together on the farm. "Something to show the kids someday," he says. He sends it to me, but I'm not allowed to post it anywhere that could tag the location. "Once you start bragging and showing the world your shit," he says, "that's how you get jacked." The plants exceed the height of the fence, so they're visible to anyone driving along the road a couple of hundred yards away. The first day of work, Nelson and I use plastic zip ties to attach bamboo extensions to the fence. They're the same type of plastic zip ties we used in Iraq as handcuffs, and the green plastic netting over the chain-link fence looks to be of the same material as the sandbags we used to cover the heads of the handcuffed prisoners. "The plants exceed the height of the fence, so they're visible to anyone driving along the road a couple of hundred yards away" Sarah Rice/Redux It's odd to think that I went from being a machine gunner in the infantry to getting a master's degree to working on a weed farm. But I have child support and a seven-year-old I have custody of every weekend. I've just turned 40. Where did I go wrong? My ex-wives probably have their theories, but I don't know. There is another worker with us in the garden. Alicia is a Latina from Southern California. She wears running shorts and headphones and walks around with a stopwatch, watering all the plants. Nelson flirts with her constantly, calling her “Beautiful," “Sweetie," telling her how extremely good she looks. “So when are we going to hook up?" he asks her. “Sorry, Nelson, I'm not into Mexi-can'ts." Inside are a few trimmers who manicure the buds with pruning snips: a couple of guys, sporting sandals and man buns, and a slender girl in short shorts, with a blonde bob, who has that slight stony thing about her — Nelson noticed her when we first pulled up to the house. "I love her," Nelson said, which is exactly what he says about every woman. Whenever Nelson gets bored with hitting on Alicia, he goes inside to flirt with the blonde. All day we work while Nelson goes from one girl to another. At one point, it's just me and Eric in the garden. With his hands folded across his chest, he asks my advice. "You think I should get a shotgun or an assault rifle?" Eric tried to buy a gun recently but failed the background check. Nelson told me that Eric had attacked one of his employees with his bare hands. The two went to a bar, and the guy started bragging to the female bartender about how much weed they were growing. Eric told him to shut the fuck up, but the guy just continued and bam. Eric beat the fuck out of him and got arrested, but the charges were dropped. I shake my head and tell Eric he doesn't need a gun. “I mean, what are you going to do? Shoot and kill somebody over weed?" He just looks at me. My first week of work, Nelson goes back to the city, and Eric gives me a little tour of his “nest egg." All these plants are his eggs, and they're all in one basket. “Once Prop 64 passes," he says, “everything is going to be regulated and no one will be able to afford to grow. None of this is going to be profitable. That's why I'm cashing out. This is my last harvest. After this I'm done." His plan is to travel, maybe get a house in the mountains, and bury whatever is left. He points out a trailer from the '70s parked next to the house. Several years ago he gave up his job, bought the trailer, lived in the woods, and grew weed. Just him and his mutt. He invested all his money into that grow, and every year since, he's expanded until he has what he has now, a basket with all his nest eggs. The three main things he's worried about are being robbed, broad mites, and some freak-of-nature storm coming through. He boasts that his weed sells for $1,400 a pound – bare minimum – and with some strains he can pull in as much as $2,300. The first year he grew, weed was selling for $4,200 a pound. Every year the price drops while operational costs for growing that same pound remain the same or increase slightly. Some predict that once Prop 64 passes, the price will drop dramatically. "For the independent grower, the end is here and now." "You don't talk much, do you?" Eric asks me while we walk through his garden. "Not really," I say. "I just follow orders, I guess. Keep my mouth shut." He says he likes that about me. Eric instructs me on how to water his plants properly with nutrients. I'm supposed to use the stopwatch to make sure that each and every plant gets two and a half minutes of feed. It's OK to go a little over, but just a little, because I'd be wasting hundreds of gallons of nutrients that Eric paid for. "He says he likes that about me. Eric instructs me on how to water his plants properly with nutrients." Jason Henry/The NY Times/Redux Later, when he comes back to check up on me, I tell him everything's going well, but that's a lie. In truth, I get a little lost in the garden because the plants all look the same. Or I forget to press the stopwatch, and I might have even watered a couple of plants twice or three times, but I couldn't tell because the heat instantly dried the soil. But I tell him that things are going great, how I got this. Eric doesn't like to hire potheads or commune types. They're the last kinds of workers he wants. He can see them doing the math in their heads when they look at his crop. They'll think he's loaded and will want a piece of it. "I don't get it," he says. "You go down to Walmart, and they have millions of dollars of inventory. They pay their employees shit and they're all happy! They don't look around and say, 'Hey, wait a minute here, they're making millions. I should be getting paid a hell of a lot more!' But these fuckers, these stoners and hippies, they come here, they see my shit, and they're like, 'Oh, I deserve more of this,' and it's like, 'Fuck you!' What they don't see are the years of fucking bullshit I had to go through to get here, all the thousands and thousands of dollars I have to spend! Do you know how much I spent on soil alone? I spent $70,000! For dirt! That's more than what most Americans make in a year! And I pay that! See all the bamboo sticks? How many do you think I have? Thousands. And guess what. Those are several dollars a pop." And unlike Walmart, which has hundreds of employees per store, here it's mostly just him. He's in charge of opening up shop and making sure the lights are on, the employees are doing their jobs, and the plants are watered correctly. "I'm in charge of everything, all the way down to how many coffee filters I need to order. I'm in charge of all of it! Me!" My first week is easy. Every night I pass out in the trailer and wake up at around 8 a.m. A breakfast of organic eggs, sausage, and Tater Tots is made, along with a pot of coffee. In the living room hangs a whiteboard with a list of tasks for the day. On some days, Eric writes messages commending employees for their hard work, or some motivational quote. Other days, he writes angry messages: "Don't fucking wake me up!!!" Over breakfast, Eric typically briefs Alicia and me on what needs to be done that day, and then we execute the orders. One morning before breakfast, I head into the garden. Which is where I notice something alarming about Eric. He talks to himself. A lot. I'll be working when I hear Eric's voice coming from somewhere. "Two thousand, 4,000, fuck . . . one, two, 55, 13, goddammit, and three dozen fucking 40 . . . I need 12 more, three of those and nine of . . . Shit! Shit! Shit! Fucking! Fuck!" And then there's the murder talk. "I swear to God I'll kill their whole fucking family!!! Each and every fucking one of them! Stab them, rip their fucking hearts out, and bury them!!!" One morning, as we drive to the dump, Eric is extolling the virtues of a gluten-free diet when he suddenly asks if I ever get thoughts in my head of killing people. "Um . . . no, not really." “Really? Never?" A part of me wants to fuck with him and say, "Well, yeah, but only when I'm wasted," just to see where it'll go, but I tell him no. Never. Ever.

In a social media exchange, a few stated that there is not a Black middle class neighborhood in Pittsburgh and some even went as far as saying that there is not a Black middle class in Pittsburgh. Well, contrary to what some believe there is a Black middle class in Pittsburgh. They don’t all live in one neighborhood or on one street, they are spread out throughout the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. Isn’t that something that we fought so hard for? To be able to live where we want to live, as long as we have the money. When someone comes to Pittsburgh from out of town, “the code” can be a little hard to crack. First things first, if you are moving here, 99 percent of the time you are moving here as a professional, not to be a greeter at Walmart, so your primary contacts are going to be White. The realtor will steer you to areas that will have the best resale value because you probably will not be making Pittsburgh your home. Here is where groups like the North Hills Ebony Women and BASH (Black Association of South Hills) come in. For years,  they have embraced Blacks that move into predominately White neighborhoods. If one is a member of the Kappas, Ques, Alphas, AKA’s or Deltas, then you have a brotherhood or sisterhood to help you. Perhaps you will even find a church where you will be embraced, and someone will show you the ins and outs of “Black middle class Pittsburgh.” 1 2Next page » Also On New Pittsburgh Courier: Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 22 photos Launch gallery Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 1.

China's toys and games sector expanded about 10 percent between 2010 and 2015, compared with a meagre 1.7 percent increase in the United States, according to market research firm Euromonitor.Market leader Guangdong Alpha Animation & Culture Co Ltd held 4.4 percent of the market in 2015, while Danish toymaker Lego commands a 2.8 percent share.GREAT WALL Mattel opened shop in China in 2002, selling Barbie dolls in regional stores, and later introduced Ling, a Barbie with black hair and traditional Chinese attire. An aggressive push to expand in 2009 by launching a 36,000 square feet "House of Barbie" store in Shanghai, the world's largest at the time, backfired due to high costs and low sales. The company shuttered the store after just two years in operation.The setback proved that Chinese customers preferred tailor-made products and their buying decisions were not always price driven."Some of the partnership push is also done to make sure that they understand right and better cater to that market," said UBS Securities analyst Arpiné Kocharyan.Mattel's new strategy reflects an acknowledgement of the fact that one size does not fit all, especially in China where one in every five customers prefers to shop for toys online rather than in hypermarkets and toy stores. Regulation is another stumbling block - getting approvals for educational content is difficult in China, where government censorship is high.Mattel isn't the only U.S. company that has struggled to navigate the Chinese market.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) sold its online grocery store Yihaodian in China last year in return for a stake in e-commerce firm JD.com Inc (JD.O), saying the country's e-commerce market was hyper competitive.Several others including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Hershey Co (HSY.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) have also struggled in China.For now, nearly everything is riding on Mattel's partnership with Alibaba."It is just one of a hundred initiatives for (Alibaba)," said Rein. "But for Mattel, it is really do or die."

Plans change, and the jobs don’t always come to fruition. For example, in 2013, Foxconn announced it would create 500 jobs at a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. The factory was never built, and the jobs never came, The Washington Post’s Todd Frankel reported. Yet the company recently announced a plan to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers – a plan that Trump then touted. We took a look at ExxonMobil’s investment program, and a host of other corporate decisions that Trump falsely touts as a fulfillment of his promise to bring jobs back to the United States. ExxonMobil On March 6, the oil giant announced its “Growing the Gulf” investment plan to spend $20 billion over 10 years in projects in Texas and Louisiana. The company said its plan would create 35,000 construction jobs and 12,000 full-time jobs, through 11 chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects. The company acknowledged that its investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. ExxonMobil’s spending plan may seem like a lot, but it represents only 10 percent of the company’s current capital spending levels, our colleagues reported: “Those levels would probably increase with higher oil prices. Moreover, ExxonMobil has been a major operator and investor in the Gulf of Mexico region for decades. The gulf accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. domestic oil production.” Indeed, ExxonMobil and other oil companies have been expanding and investing in the Gulf Coast for years, using new hydraulic fracturing technologies to extract natural gas and export it overseas. In 2013, when ExxonMobil began its investments, there were more than 120 petrochemical construction projects totaling $80 billion that were announced for the Gulf Coast region, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The White House news release quoted Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, as praising Trump’s commitment to “a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment.” “The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration’s support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment,” Woods said, acknowledging Trump’s pro-business policies but stopping short of giving any credit to the administration for his company’s business decisions. Trump has credited himself for a host of other corporate decisions. (In fact, his claims about creating jobs are among the most common claims we recorded so far in our 100 Days of Trump’s Claims project, tracking every false or misleading claim in Trump’s first 100 days.) Here’s a running list: Ford. Ford decided to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico. But the decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal – particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles – than with the administration. Here’s what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company’s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: “The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.” Fiat Chrysler. The company announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio plants and create 2,000 jobs. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said his company’s plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Marchionne credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors. The company plans to add or keep 7,000 jobs in the United States and invest $1 billion. Trump touted the decisions on Twitter, but a company spokeswoman said the decisions “had been in the works for some time” but that “the timing was good for us to share what we are doing.” Just two weeks before GM’s announcement, Trump had blasted the company on Twitter over its Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze. Walmart. Walmart said it would create 10,000 jobs in the United States in 2017 – a part of a $6.8 billion capital spending plan announced in October, before the presidential election, Reuters reported. Intel. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona. But Intel actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-President Barack Obama. The factory never opened, making it technically “new” in 2017. The company told CNN Money that it’s resuming its factory project because it is expecting a demand in the computer chips to be created there. Lockheed Martin. Trump says he lowered the cost of the company’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes. But the Pentagon had announced cost reductions of roughly $600 million before Trump began meeting with Lockheed Martin’s chief executive. SoftBank. The Japanese company announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. After a December 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump, SoftBank announced that $50 billion would go to the United States. But the United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America – regardless of whether Trump was elected. Sprint. Sprint announced it would add 5,000 jobs in the United States, and Trump took credit. Sprint later said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint, the New York Times reported. Alibaba. Chinese e-company Alibaba pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs. Trump said that until he got elected, Alibaba founder Jack Ma had “no intention” of investing in the United States. But Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015, when Ma outlined a plan similar to what he promised in his announcement with Trump. Trump’s bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke. He claims credit when little or no credit is due to his policies. Moreover, he is counting these jobs as jobs in the bank, when corporate plans frequently change according to market or economic forces.

The company’s brand value, $106.4 billion, is nearly double that of Walmart ($62.2 billion), which ranked as the second most valuable retail brand. (An explanation of the ranking is provided at the end of article.)     Amazon also ranked as the third most valuable brand across all industries, just behind Google ($109.5 billion) and Apple ($107.1 billion).   “The firm (amazon) is growing strongly as it continues to both reshape the retail market and to capture an ever larger share of it,” stated Brand Finance in a release. “Its brand value is already nearly double that of second-placed Walmart. Amazon Fresh, its grocery service, is still relatively limited in scale but this year began operating overseas for the first time, serving Central and East London initially.   Rounding out the top five most valuable retail brands were Alibaba, with a brand value of $34.9 billion; The Home Depot, $30.2 billion; and Ikea, at $24.1 billion.   Other top ranking retail brands included CVS, No. 6 with a brand value of $23.2 billion; Target, No.7 (brand value of $17 billion; Walgreens, No. 8 ($16 billion); Lowe’s, No.9 ($14 billion); and Costco, No.10 ($13.4 billion).   The brands in the Brand Finance study are first evaluated to determine their power / strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation) and given a corresponding letter grade up to AAA+. Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value.    Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Report: Midwestern retailer to file Chapter 11 The world’s most valuable retail brands are… Off-pricer to open 90 stores in 2017 Walgreens makes executive moves Study: Majority of retailers are ready to invest in IoT President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration's support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment," Woods said, acknowledging Trump's pro-business policies but stopping short of giving any credit to the administration for his company's business decisions. Trump has credited himself for a host of other corporate decisions. (In fact, his claims about creating jobs are among the most common claims we recorded so far in our 100 Days of Trump's Claims project, tracking every false or misleading claim in Trump's first 100 days.) Here's a running list: Ford. Ford decided to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico. But the decision has more to do with the company's long-term goal - particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles - than with the administration. Here's what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company's decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: "The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars." Fiat Chrysler. The company announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio plants and create 2,000 jobs. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said his company's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Marchionne credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors. The company plans to add or keep 7,000 jobs in the United States and invest $1 billion. Trump touted the decisions on Twitter, but a company spokeswoman said the decisions "had been in the works for some time" but that "the timing was good for us to share what we are doing." Just two weeks before GM's announcement, Trump had blasted the company on Twitter over its Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze. Walmart. Walmart said it would create 10,000 jobs in the United States in 2017 - a part of a $6.8 billion capital spending plan announced in October, before the presidential election, Reuters reported. Intel. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a "new" plant in Arizona. But Intel actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-President Barack Obama. The factory never opened, making it technically "new" in 2017. The company told CNN Money that it's resuming its factory project because it is expecting a demand in the computer chips to be created there. Lockheed Martin. Trump says he lowered the cost of the company's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes. But the Pentagon had announced cost reductions of roughly $600 million before Trump began meeting with Lockheed Martin's chief executive. SoftBank. The Japanese company announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. After a December 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump, SoftBank announced that $50 billion would go to the United States. But the United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America - regardless of whether Trump was elected. Sprint. Sprint announced it would add 5,000 jobs in the United States, and Trump took credit. Sprint later said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint, the New York Times reported. Alibaba. Chinese e-company Alibaba pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs. Trump said that until he got elected, Alibaba founder Jack Ma had "no intention" of investing in the United States. But Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015, when Ma outlined a plan similar to what he promised in his announcement with Trump. Trump's bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke. He claims credit when little or no credit is due to his policies. Moreover, he is counting these jobs as jobs in the bank, when corporate plans frequently change according to market or economic forces. Trump has promised to create 10 million jobs over the next four years, and that ultimately is what he will be judged on. All the job announcements in the world will mean little if actual hiring does not turn up in the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

When you are training a horse, you have to train both sides. I recall when Goliath was all a flutter over the "prairie jellyfish" as someone dubbed those plastic sacks from Walmart and IGA that somehow don't get recyced but get free to roam the prairies with the wind. My pal and mentor, Rick, taught me that the horse needs to learn the sack is harmless so it will ignore the sight and sound and maybe the smell of the plastic "monster." Hooking up a few bags to a small fly rod he taught me to shake it, wave it and eventualy touch Goliath with the bags while holding him steady on the lead rope. Eventually, he calmed down and I could wve it about his head and ears and rub it on his neck, back and hind quarters with out him flinching. I was pretty proud of myself and started to take Goliath back out for a ride when Rick stopped me. "You're only half done," he said. You taught his left brain, but now you have to teach his right." That's when I learned about the two brains of a horse. Yet both brains belong to the same animal. In reading Goliath's Gospel text I discovered the devil is like a horse in the sense that he too often has more than one head or brain. Consider the Pharisees and Sadducees who were polar oppositis in religion, but served the same master in their hatred and opposition to Christ. The Pahrisees were the ultra-conservative, legalistic Jews who not only insisted on obedience to the Law, but sought to "improve it" by adding more rules and regulations of their own. Some see them as the "fundamentalits" of their day. More concerned with being right in their own minds than in being righteous before God, they saw Jesus as a threat to their control and power. So they saw Him as the enemy and sought to destroy Him with a clever ploy - asking Him if good Jews should pay taxes to Caesar. The idea was simple. If He said "yes," then they could tell the people Jesus was a lackey of the Romans and thus a collaborator with the enemy. If He said "no," then they could report Him to the Romans as a rebel and have Him arrested. But Jesus turned the tables on them by asking them to show Him a coin. It was a Roman coin - bering the image of Caesar! "Well, if you use Caesar's coin, then accept Caesar's authority and his right to tax you." Then came the Sadducees - whom many consider similar to the secularized and politicized religion of many of the so-called progressive and liberal Church leaders of our day. They did not take the Bible seriously and did not accept many of the basics of the Jewish faith - such as the resurrection of the dead. They also thought to be clever and raised a silly challenge to the concept of the resurrection by coming up with the idea of a woman who had been widowed seven times, and at the resurrection, which husband would truly be hers. Jesus' response was simple and dismissive: "Despite your role as priests of the Temple and supposed servants of the Lord, your question demonstrates your incredible ignorance of both the Scripture and of God." As we might say today, "You can't have a battle of wits with an unarmed foe." And with these words, Jesus silenced the Sadducees. Pharisees - the legalists who are more concerned with their own doctrine and being right than with God's righteousness - and Sadducees - who have more in common with the secular and pagan culture than with the basics of their own supposed faith - were two different points of view, two different heads, but all part of he same body - not the Jewish faith but the Devil. For both Saduccees and Pharisees worked for the same master, and it was not the Lord. When Jesus confronted them, they reacted as did the demons - screaming in indignation and yet helpless. In the movie "The Passion," the devil is seen in various scenes passing among the Saduccees and Pharisees, working and encouraging them in their hatred and desire to destroy Jesus. The devil seems to succeed, uniting the bitterest of enemies in the common cause of stopping Jesus. Two heads seek to kill the Christ and seem to succeed as He dies on the cross. But then comes the resurrection. One of the final scenes shows the devil in hell screaming in anguish as the Risen One overcomes the power of the hatred, deceit and evil. Two heads, one master - and all fail. This is the story of the season of lent and of Easter. As a simple, uneducated man trying to read the Book of Revelation noted when two smarty-pants seminarians challenged his ability to comprehend it, "It ain't all that hard when you boil it down to what John is trying to say. God wins. 'Nuff said." -- John Bruington and Goliaths serve in Havre at First Presbyterian Church.

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – Cato Corp, DSW , Bon Ton, Tilly's, Genesco By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 16 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch booked results that missed expectations, while The Children's Place achieved what it said was a "spectacular" year. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a net loss of US$12.8m for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.8m in the year-ago period. Fourth-quarter gross margin decreased to 28.8% of sales from 36.1% of sales in 2015, primarily due to reduced merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs. Sales for the period were $218.2m, a decrease of 12% on last year's $247.3m. Same-store sales were also down 12% for the quarter. CEO John Cato said 2016 was a "very disappointing year" for the company. He added: "The overall apparel retail environment continued to be difficult and was compounded by several mistakes of our own.  We also are being impacted by the disruption caused by the growth of online sales at other retailers, resulting in lower store traffic.  In the back half of the year, we made several mistakes in our merchandise assortment, fit and timing.  This resulted in significant reductions to regular priced sales causing us to liquidate a large portion of our slow selling inventory which put severe pressure on earnings." DSW DSW said its return to year over year earnings growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net income rising 158.5% to US$30.5m, compared to $11.8m in the year-ago period. Gross profit increased by 50 bps, while total sales edged up slightly, increasing 0.4% to  $674.6m. Comparable sales meanwhile, decreased 7% compared to last year's 0.7% increase. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "After making fundamental changes to our core business last year, we are laser focused on driving comp growth through our merchandise and allocation initiatives and the elevation of our customer's digital experience." The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores saw earnings and revenue decline in the fourth quarter. The York, Pennsylvania-based company recorded net income of US$44.7m, down from $50.6m in the year-ago period. Gross margin increased 145 basis points to 36.2% compared to last year, primarily due to reduced markdowns and lower distribution costs, partially offset by deleverage from lower sales volume. Total sales in the period decreased 5.5% to $877.3m, versus $927.9m last year, while comparable store sales decreased 4.7% as compared with the prior year period. Tilly's  Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's says it is encouraged by its fourth-quarter results as earnings reached US$6.3m from $2.9m a year earlier. Gross margin dropped to 30.6% from 31.4% last year, primarily due to a 60 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns and a 20 basis point increase in buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Total sales edged up 0.7% to $160.2m, while comparable sales were up 0.1%. CEO, Ed Thomas, said: "While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to seek ways to improve profitability and continue our progress during fiscal 2017." Genesco Genesco booked declines in both earnings and revenue during the fourth quarter. Net earnings reached US$46.5m compared to earnings of $44.7m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped 5% to $883m from $932m, reflecting the sale of the Lids Team Sports business in the fourth quarter of last year and a decrease of approximately 2% in sales from the remaining businesses. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalogue sales were flat  with an 8% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 6% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 2% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 1% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group.  Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends posted profit and sales increases in its fourth-quarter. For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income increased 60% to US$5.6m, compared to $3.5m in the year-ago period. Sales were also up, increasing 5.4% to $185.5m from $176.1m last year, while comparable sales grew 3.4%.  The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, with the former dropping to US$36m from $54.3m a year earlier. Revenues were down 15.7% to $280m from net sales of $332m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 16.1%. Online sales were down 8.8% to $32.2m for the 13-week period ended 28 January.  Zumiez  Zumiez said its fourth-quarter earnings performance exceeded expectations,with net income in the period ended 28 January, increasing 38.3% to US$18.2m, compared to $13.1m in the year-ago period. Net sales for the quarter were also up, increasing 8.7% to $263.6m from $242.4m, while comparable sales for the period increased 5.1% compared to a 9.5% decrease last year. Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, moved to a loss in its fourth-quarter. For the period ended 31 December, net loss from continuing operations was US$4.9m, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.7m for the prior year period. Net sales, meanwhile, were up 108% to $42m from $20.3m in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands, as well as 3% growth in Robert Graham. Gross margin fell to 51.8% compared to 59.9% last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans, which carries a lower gross margin rate as a wholesale business. Sears Holdings US retail giant Sears Holdings revealed a widening of its net loss in the quarter to US$607m from $580m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.3%, primarily attributed to lower margins in the apparel business, and an increase in promotional activities. Net revenues fell to $6.1bn from $7.3bn in the prior year quarter. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "We delivered significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter, reflecting our firm focus on profitability to offset ongoing revenue pressures. Building on this positive momentum, we are taking decisive actions to become a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability." Tailored Brands Tailored Brands, the former Men's Wearhouse, said it has booked a lower than expected fourth-quarter, despite driving its net loss down to US$30.1m, compared to $1.1bn last year. Retail gross margin increased 60 basis points to 39.0%, primarily as a result of "anniversarying" an $11m inventory write-down in last year's fourth-quarter. "Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross margins," said CEO Doug Ewert. Express Express said its fourth-quarter earnings were in line with its guidance, despite net income dropping to US$22.8m from $56.1m a year earlier. Merchandise margin declined by 330 basis points, driven by increased promotional activity. Net sales fell 11% to $678.8m from $765.6m, while comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 13%. CEO David Kornberg, noted:  "Despite ongoing pressures in the retail sector, our fourth quarter earnings were in line with previously issued guidance. As expected, our store performance continued to be impacted by challenging mall traffic and a promotional retail environment. As our industry adapts to changing consumer preferences, we continue to invest in our omni-channel and marketing capabilities to ensure that we capitalize on this evolution."  The Children's Place, Inc The Children's Place has achieved what it says was a "spectacular" year thanks to significant progress on its numerous self-help initiatives. "Our product assortment, supported by a foundation of superior design, sourcing and merchandising capabilities, clearly resonated with our customers," said CEO Jane Elfers. Net income for the quarter almost doubled to US$34.2m from $17.5m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 36.1% thanks to merchandise margin leverage and a higher Average Unit Retail (AUR). Net sales were up 4.5% to $520.8m on a comparable retail sales increase of 6.9%. For the full year, earnings soared 77% to $102.3m, while net sales were up 3.4% to $1.78bn. Stein Mart, Inc Stein Mart has revealed a "disappointing" fourth-quarter as the company continued to work through higher than desired inventory levels and the impact of changes to marketing, merchandising and promotions implemented during the third quarter. The company moved to a net loss of US$4.9m from earnings $6.3m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 22.8% from 26.8% a year earlier. Total sales were down 2.2% to $385.5m, while comparable store sales dropped 5.5%. CEO Hunt Hawkins, said: "With our new executive leadership now in place, 2017 will be a year of transition as we refine and organise around our strategies. Lessons learned from last year have us keenly focused on changes we need to make to our business to significantly improve management of our inventories and increase sales productivity." Weyco Group, Inc Weyco has booked a mixed fourth-quarter as earnings rose but sales fell. For the three month period, net income amounted to US$8.3m from $8.2m a year earlier. The 2015 figure included a $458,000 earnout payment relating to the company's 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. Without this, earnings would have been down 9%. Net sales for the quarter were down 6% to $82.1m. Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said it was pleased with its fourth-quarter, despite booking a mixed period which saw revenues rise but earnings fall. For the 13 weeks to 28 January, net income fell 30% to US$90.2m, compared to $129m in the year-ago period. Net sales increased 10.9% to US$2.5bn, while same-store sales were up 5.3%. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will "continue to be aggressive" and evolve its business.  Black Diamond, Inc. Black Diamond has narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter, to US$1.39bn from $31.7bn a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 29.1% from 33.5%, weighed down by foreign currency headwinds. Sales were down 6% to $41.4m, due to unseasonably dry European winter conditions impacting ski product sales and the company's measured approach to scaling back its apparel line. CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits." Sequential Brands Brand management company Sequential Brands narrowed its losses to US$980,000 in the fourth quarter, from $5.7m in the same period last year. Revenue for the three months to 31 December increased 44% to $45.4m, compared to $31.4m in the year-ago period. For the year ending 31 December, 2017, the company is expecting $170m to $175m in revenue. CEO Yehuda Shmidman said: "Looking ahead, despite a challenging macro retail environment, we will remain focused on growing our core business and maximising operating efficiencies, inclusive of new revenue initiatives already underway." Stage Stores Stage Stores moved to a loss in the fourth quarter and revealed a drop in sales. For the quarter ended 28 January, net loss was US$6.8m versus a profit of $21m last year. Net sales fell 9.6% to $454.4m, compared to $502.6m in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were down 8.5%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "Our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings reflect continued challenges in our oil impacted and border states, as well as the overall soft retail environment. Weak traffic led to heightened promotional activity and gross margin pressure in the quarter, yet we are pleased to end 2016 with inventory levels that are 6% lower than last year. In addition, our direct-to-consumer business grew at a double digit rate as we enhanced our customers' online experience."   Burlington Stores Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue incense in the fourth quarter, booking a 27.1% rise in net income from US$98.8m to $125.6m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 41.8%, driven by improved shortage results. Net sales were up 9.4%, or $144.9m, to $1.7bn from $1.5bn thanks to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and $82.1m in sales from new and non-comparable stores. For the full year, the company expects sales to increase in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%, and comparable sales to be up 2% to 3%. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Abercrombie & Fitch said its fourth-quarter results did not meet expectations, despite 2016 being a year of "significant progress" on each of its strategic priorities. Earnings were down 15.4% to US$48.8m, while gross margin narrowed 90 basis points to 59.3%. Net sales fell 7% to $1.04bn, with comparable sales for the quarter down 5%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 13% to $442.4m, while Hollister sales were down 2% to $594m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 8% to $688.2m in the US, and 5% to $348.2m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "We continued to proactively respond to the evolving retail landscape through our store closure and channel optimisation initiatives. While the environment is likely to remain challenging in 2017, we have a strong balance sheet and continue to aggressively manage costs … to position our business for sustainable growth." Croc's US footwear firm Crocs  booked revenue in-line with guidance at US$187.4m from $208.7m a year earlier. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 10.5%. The company reported a net loss of $40.6m, compared to a loss of $70.2m in the year ago period. CEO Gregg Ribatt said: "Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations while our adjusted gross margin rate improved by approximately 550 basis points versus prior year. This gross margin gain was less than previously anticipated due to currency and channel mix fluctuations and also to certain one-time events, however we are still on track to achieve our medium-term target for gross margins in the low 50% range." Crocs also revealed Ribbatt will step down as CEO but continue in his board role. Andrew Rees, who joined the company in June 2014 as president, will be promoted to president and CEO, effective 1 June. The company will also close aroundd 160 stores by the end of 2018, reducing its total store count from 558 to around 400.  American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a decline in both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, with net income slipping 33.1% to US$54.6m from $81.7m in the year ago period. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 35.4%, compared to 35.1% last year. Total revenues decreased 1% to $1.1bn from $1.11bn in the same period last year. Consolidated comparable sales were up slightly, following a 4% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "We've made great progress, yet we have much more opportunity across the marketplace. I'm confident that the strength of our brands and focused priorities will enable us to deliver long-term returns to our shareholders." Ross Stores Ross Stores booked fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat company expectations. Net profit grew 13.8% to US$300.6m from $264.2m last year, while total sales rose 8% to $3.5bn. Comparable store sales were up 4% versus a 4% gain in the prior year. CEO Barbara Rentler noted: "We are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multi-year comparisons and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continued to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home."For the year ending 3 February, 2018, the company has forecast EPS in the range of $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it is pleased with the momentum in its core business after delivering what it called "solid" earnings results in the fourth quarter. For the three months ended 31 December, earnings climbed 11.5% to US$28.7m from $25.7m last year. However, the company said overall sales declined "modestly" due primarily to softness in its private label footwear and cold weather accessories businesses. Sales were down 2.3% in the period to $336.4m, compared to $344.3m last year. Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 38.7% as compared to 36.1%. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said while the company is cautious about the overall environment, it is confident it can drive top and bottom line growth in 2017 and beyond. Target Corp US retail group Target has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its fourth-quarter on the back on soft store traffic declines and what it calls rapidly-changing consumerbehaviour. For the three months ended 28 January, net earnings tumbled 42.7% from US$1.4bn to $817m. Sales dropped 4.3% to $20.7bn from $21.6bn, reflecting a 1.5% decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 34% and contributing 1.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 26.9%, compared with 27.9% in the year ago period. The retailer said it will reveal a new financial model later today, designed to position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in "this new era in retail".  "Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behaviour, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores," said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. Foot Locker, Inc US footwear retailer Foot Locker has generated what it says is its seventh consecutive year of "meaningful" sales and profit growth as it revealed higher earnings in its fourth-quarter to US$189m from $158m a year earlier. Gross margin improved to 33.7% of sales from 33.6% a year ago, while total sales climbed 5.3% to $2.11bn. Comparable store sales increased 5%. CEO Richard Johnson, said: "Generating our seventh consecutive year of meaningful sales and profit growth is a strong testament to Foot Locker's solid position at the centre of sneaker culture. Due in part to the change in the cadence of income tax refund check distribution, we are facing a challenging retail sales environment as we enter 2017; however, we believe the strategic initiatives we have in place, coupled with our strong vendor relationships, will enable us to deliver another year of record performance." Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, reflecting what it calls "continuous improvements" to its operating model. For the period ended 28 January, net earnings were up 11.7% to US$201m, from $180m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.4% to $4.2bn compared to $4.1bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.9%. Gross margin, meanwhile, improved 112 basis points, reflecting strong inventory execution in addition to reduced competitive markdowns. For the full year, the company reached record sales of $14.5bn, up from $14.1bn last year. Carter's, Inc Carter's has had what it says was a "strong finish to another record year" as it revealed higher sales and earnings in its fourth-quarter. Net income was up 20% to US$87.1m, while operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.9%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 7.8% to reach $67.7m, thanks to revenue growth in nearly every business segment. CEO Michael Casey, said: "Our focus on providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel, extending the reach of our brands, and improving profitability enabled us to achieve our 28th consecutive year of sales growth, improve our profit margins, and increase the return of capital to shareholders. We are forecasting good growth in sales and earnings in 2017." Kohl's Department store retailer Kohl's has posted what it says are "weak" sales results for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic. For the three months ended 28 January, net sales dropped 2.8% to US$6.21bn from $6.39bn in the year-ago period. Net profit was also down, falling 15% to $252m, compared to $296 last year. Gross margin was flat at 33.4%. CEO Kevin Mansell, said: "Sales results were weak for the quarter in total, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic, and offset somewhat by strength in online demand. We saw improvement in merchandise margin, and our team continued to manage inventory and expenses extremely well. In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour in early March. We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home." L Brands L Brands booked a mixed fourth-quarter as sales climbed but earnings fell, albeit only slightly. For the three months ended 28 January, the owner of Victoria's Secret said net income fell 0.7% to US$631.7m from $636.0m a year ago. Meanwhile, the company reported net sales of $4.5bn, an increase of 2% compared to sales of $4.4bn for the year ago period. Comparable sales were flat for the period. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 2 percentage points and 4 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company said it expects first-quarter earnings per share to be $0.20 to $0.25, and $3.05 to $3.35 for 2017 full-year earnings. Iconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group booked a loss of approximately US$297.5m in its fourth-quarter, compared to a loss of around $263.0m a year earlier. Licensing sales fell 8% to $87.1m Revenue in the prior year's fourth quarter included approximately $1.3m of licensing revenue from the Badgley Mischka brand, Iconix said, for which there was no comparable revenue this year, due to its sale in the first quarter. The company also made an operating loss of around $385.8m, as compared to a loss of $398.2m in the year ago period. CEO John Haugh said: "2016 was a year of transition for Iconix. Our operating performance was in-line with our guidance. I believe the changes we have made over the past year provide a strong foundation to drive long term growth and shareholder value."  Chico's FAS, Inc Chico's says it is "extremely pleased" with its fourth-quarter results as it moved to a profit thanks to gross margin expansion and execution of its strategic initiatives. Earnings amounted to US$13.5m from a loss of $21.1m a year earlier, while gross margin expanded to 35.5% from 34.4%. Sales, meanwhile, dropped 4.9% to $600.8m as a result of the sale of the firm's Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business last year. Excluding this, sales dropped 2.3%, primarily reflecting a decline in comparable sales of 2.5%, comprised of reduced transaction count and an increase in average dollar sale. TJX Companies TJX Companies revealed an "above-plan" fourth-quarter, booking increases in both sales and earnings. For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income grew1.7% to US$678m from $666m in the year ago period. Gross profit margin was down 0.4 percentage points to 28.3%, versus the prior year. Net sales were up 6% to $9.5bn, compared to $9bn last year, while consolidated comparable store sales increased 3%.

"In response, we are ramping up our efforts to bring more distinctive brand and service experiences to Dillard's, both in-store and online," said CEO William Dillard. Earnings fell to US$56.9m from $84m a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations narrowed 73 basis points. Net sales dropped to $1.94bn from $2.07bn last year.

Net profit fell 17.9% to US$3.76bn, while total sales edged up 1% to $130.9bn. Comparable sales were up for the tenth consecutive quarter, at 1.8%.

Domestic sales were up 2.8% to $83.7bn, while international sales fell 5.1% to $31bn. Sam's Club sales were up 3% to $14.98bn. "We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve customers," says CEO Doug McMillon. "We had a very solid fourth-quarter. Our international business is consistently delivering solid sales growth in constant currency, and Sam's Club posted its best comp sales growth of the year." VF Corporation US apparel giant VF Corporation revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016. Net income fell 15% to US$264.3m in the three months to December, from $312.2m the year before. As a result of the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $98m in 2016, which also includes the operating results of the businesses, net of tax. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to a record 49.1% on a reported basis, while total revenues were relatively flat at $3.32 from $3.33. Brand revenue at Vans was up 14% and by 4% at Timberland, but fell 8% at The North Face. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade says it is exploring and evaluating "strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value" as it revealed higher fourth-quarter earnings and sales. Net earnings reached US$87m in the three months to the end of December from $62m a year earlier. Gross margin, however, narrowed to 59.2% from 60.2%, while net sales were up 9.8% to $471m.

Rocky Brands Rocky Brands has moved to a loss in both its fourth-quarter and full-year, after incurring non-cash impairment charges.

For the three months ended 31 December, Rocky Brands reported a net loss of US$0.6m from earnings of $1.4m in the year ago period. Excluding charges, the company recorded earnings of $1.3m.

In the three months ended 27 November, net income slipped to $96m, down 5% from $101m last year. The decline reflected investments associated with the expansion of company-operated stores network and e-commerce, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 50.7% from 51.2%. In Europe, net revenues were up 13%, while in both the Americas and Asia net revenues declined 1%.

However total comparable sales were flat, but were up 2% at the Urban Outfitters brand and 1.2% at Free People. Comparable sales decreased 2.9% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by lower retail store comparable net sales. Net income meanwhile, slipped 12.2% to $64m from $72.9m in the year-ago period. For the full year, total company net sales increased to $3.5bn or 3% over the prior year.

CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY MIKE SEGAR / REUTERS This week, The New Yorker published “Donald Trump’s Worst Deal,” an investigation into a hotel-development deal that the Trump Organization made with notorious Azerbaijani oligarchs tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. On Facebook and Twitter, we asked readers to submit questions they had after reading the article. (Questions were edited for clarity.) What governmental entity would normally be tasked with investigating this malfeasance? —@AgentMoore Any case brought in connection to the deal I described in my article would most likely be brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits American companies from benefitting, even unknowingly, from a foreign business partner’s corruption. Unlike almost all other federal crimes, F.C.P.A. cases can be prosecuted only with the consent of what is called “Main Justice,” meaning the Justice Department’s headquarters, in D.C. Normally, district-level U.S. Attorneys have enormous discretion over the cases they prosecute. But, with the F.C.P.A., they need permission from headquarters. This is done in deference to the possible diplomatic implications of an F.C.P.A. violation. By definition, every F.C.P.A. case involves a foreign government official, and investigating these cases often requires F.B.I. agents to fly to foreign countries, including allies of the U.S., and dig into political officials. F.C.P.A. enforcement is concentrated at Main Justice so that it can keep the State Department in the loop. One issue I heard about while reporting the story is that Main Justice tends to be more of a bureaucratic and political place than many of the U.S. Attorney offices. Many people believe that Main Justice is far too timid in its F.C.P.A. prosecutions, trying only for home-run cases that are easy to win. The Azerbaijan deal might also be looked at for possible violations of Iran sanctions, which would also be investigated by the Department of Justice, along with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control. Questions about money laundering could be investigated by a number of different authorities: federal U.S. Attorneys, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, the New York Attorney General, or the New York State Department of Financial Services. Since this was a global deal, involving partners in the U.K., Azerbaijan, and elsewhere, one could imagine prosecutors in those countries also looking into it. Why hasn’t he been charged and why haven’t there been investigations under the Foreign Practices law? —@m4ndypants If the Trump Organization were nothing more than a relatively small (though famous) development/licensing firm in Manhattan, it is highly unlikely that this case would ever be prosecuted. It’s an extremely difficult case to win, requiring a lot of investigation in a country—Azerbaijan—that has little incentive to help investigators. And it’s a relatively small-potatoes case, compared to the multi-billion-dollar examples of corruption that F.C.P.A. prosecutors typically go after. Several former D.O.J. prosecutors told me that if a junior prosecutor presented this case to her bosses at Main Justice, they would tell her to find an easier, more promising case to work on. My view is that Trump becoming President transformed this from a challenging, obscure case into a crucial one that requires a special prosecutor or other type of independent investigator. The point is less about whether or not the Trump Organization violated a particular law and far more about the nature of the company’s relationships with corrupt officials in countries all over the world. We know they have such relationships, but we don’t know much about them. Minor detail … but is there a reason @adamdavidson didn’t say Trump’s call re: bribes was referring to a Walmart case? #context —@bleu_ruby As I wrote in my article, Donald Trump discussed the F.C.P.A. during an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, in May, 2012, the same month that his company finalized its deal in Azerbaijan. It’s true that his comments came after other commenters discussed a case of Walmart potentially violating the F.C.P.A. in Mexico. However, Trump spoke broadly and clearly about the law, in general, and about how paying bribes was the cost of doing business globally. He voiced specific concerns about the law that suggest it was on his mind. That his comments came after a discussion of Walmart didn’t seem relevant to me. What happens next? How does this get put to rest legally? —@LGonzalez555 There is no active case (so far as I know), so there is nothing that needs to be put to rest legally. The question is whether or not the Department of Justice or another investigative body opens a case. It is, currently, fully at rest. I do hope that this story will encourage more journalists and government investigators to look into this deal, and others like it. If, as many suspect, the pattern of lax due diligence and unusually high risk tolerance is endemic in the Trump Organization, it seems quite possible there are many more cases as troubling as this one.

Beauty is increasing its shelf space in Target by 50% The retail industry may be distressed, but consumers still want to look their best judging by the positive fourth-quarter earnings results from beauty companies Ulta Beauty Inc. and E.l.f. Beauty Inc. Retailers, especially apparel retailers, are facing challenges from changing consumer behavior, including the shift to e-commerce. But beauty products are moving off shelves, both in stores and online. Ulta ULTA, -0.51% reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.58 billion, edging out the FactSet consensus of $1.54 billion. Earnings per share were $2.24, beating the $2.14 FactSet consensus. Same-store sales increased 16.6%. E-commerce sales were up 63.4% to $154.9 million. After trading down in late-Thursday and premarket trading, shares reversed losses and are up 3.9% Friday. See also: 11 retailers still thriving as Amazon threatens on all fronts “Not only has the company posted another record-breaking set of results but, across most metrics, it has managed to notch up sequential improvements from an already high benchmark,” said Carter Harrison, analyst at GlobalData. “Ulta is one of the clear winners of the holiday period.” Ulta announced 100 new stores in 2017, the majority of them in the second half. The company ended 2016 with 974 stores. Ulta will also introduce more Clinique and Lancome expansions than previously planned. And Chief Executive Mary Dillon announced on the Wednesday earnings call that Ulta has entered into a partnership with Estée Lauder Cos. EL, +0.29% to launch the popular MAC brand online in early May and bring the brand to stores starting in June. Analysts note that these investments could put pressure on expenses.

First-quarter sales in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.27 billion compare with the FactSet consensus of $1.27 billion. The same-store sales outlook is for growth between 9% and 11%.

Here's how the financial industry is making money on the surge. “Ulta has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since the first-quarter of 2010 as one of the best guiders we cover,” analysts said in a Thursday note. “We expect this to prove conservative yet again.” Instinet rates Ulta shares buy and raised its stock price target to $297 from $294. Wells Fargo analysts are excited about MAC’s arrival and the Clinique and Lancôme additions, noting that cosmetics was the biggest same-store sales driver for the quarter. “As the number one most requested brand and one of the best-selling brands in the country, this should continue to support store growth and attract customers,” Wells Fargo wrote in a note. “Similarly, better-than-expected performance at their boutiques are also leading the roll out of even more Clinique and Lancôme boutiques as these remain some of the top performing brands.” Wells Fargo rates Ulta shares market perform with a valuation rate of $278 to $280. Analysts rate Estée Lauder stock outperform. See also: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas E.l.f. reported earnings on Wednesday with sales of $76.4 million, exceeding the FactSet consensus of $74.5 million. Earnings per share were 19 cents, ahead of the 13-cents FactSet consensus. The company went public in September 2016. On the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer John Bailey said E.l.f. shipped product for an increased shelf space at Target Corp. TGT, +0.04%  stores of more than 50%. Shelf setting should be complete in the second quarter, according to the FactSet transcript of the call. E.l.f.

If Best Buy’s information is accurate, it means the new Alta will arrive in Canada slightly ahead of schedule. Fitbit told MobileSyrup it expected the wearable to become widely available in Canada in “early April.” We’ve reached out to the company to confirm the date. As previously reported, the Alta HR starts at $199.95 CAD in Canada. Several other major Canadian retailers, including Amazon.ca, Indigo, London Drugs, Sports Check, The Source and Walmart, also plan to carry the wearable. Featuring the same design and physical dimensions as the original Alta, the Alta HR adds Fitbit’s PurePulse heart rate sensor technology, a higher capacity battery capable of sustaining the wearable through seven days of continuous use and a new, more comfortable clasp design. The new Alta will also ship with several new and improved sleep tracking features. Fitbit will add those same features to the Charge 2 and Surge in an update to its mobile app, available on Android and iOS. Update 13/03/17: Fitbit sent MobileSyrup the following comment regarding Canadian availability of the Alta HR: “Alta HR is still slated to be available at all Canadian retailers in early April.” Source: BestBuy Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Featured Articles McDonald’s mobile app ordering geo-fencing feature is coming to Canada Netflix may experiment with mobile-specific cuts for content, says exec There are now new rules for recreational drone use in Canada Vancouver-based fintech app Koho launches exclusively across Canada The HTC 11 could be revealed on March 20 Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Thank you for your subscription Related Articles News Mar 16, 2017 9:57 AM EDT Google launches waiting list for the Canadian release of the LG Watch Style News Mar 6, 2017 9:00 AM EDT Fitbit’s new Alta HR is the smallest fitness tracker to include a heart rate sensor News Mar 16, 2017 11:47 AM EDT There are now new rules for recreational drone use in Canada News Mar 10, 2017 1:29 PM EDT TAG Heuer teases new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch Comments Categories News Reviews Features Resources Business Syrup Community Contact us About Us / Tips Contests Social Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Google+ Reddit Newsletter Signup Thank you for your subscription © 2017 mobilesyrup.com Privacy.

These days, hard-core riders are staying outdoors year round thanks to "fat bikes" that allow them to conquer winter's worst instead of staying indoors on a stationary bike. The bikes, with comically large tires, have come into the mainstream in the past couple of years, after being introduced about a decade ago. John Grondin, 48, of Scarborough, got his fat bike to kick the winter blues. "I wanted to get outside and ride in the winter," he said. "I like to ride, period. I'll ride a road bike. I'll ride a mountain bike. I just want to ride." The ginormous tires are wide enough to float over snow and bounce over obstacles. Groomed snowmobile trails provide miles and miles of winter riding. A fat tire bicyclist rides on a cross country ski trail during a race at the Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley, Maine. (Robert F. Bukaty/AP) Fat bikes represent the first major bicycle trend in several decades, after BMX bikes in the 1970s and conventional mountain bikes in the 1980s, said Jay Townley, partner in Pennsylvania-based Gluskin-Townley Group, a consultant and market research company focusing on the bicycle business. Growth in the segment has provided something to cheer about for bike retailers and has prevented a slide in bike sales, which number about 18 million units a year, he said. "The industry, quite frankly, needed something. If anything, the fat tire bike helped to keep a stable bike industry instead of losing volume," he said. The NPD Group, which tracks retail sales of bikes in the U.S., reports that fat tire bike sales have grown eightfold in the past three years, to $74.7 million in 2016. The growing popularity can be seen at fat bike races. Every weekend there are races and festivals across the nation's snowbelt. Dozens of riders braved single-digit temperatures in February for the "Sugarloaf Fat Tire Festival" at Maine's tallest ski mountain. The bikes aren't cheap. Purchased at an independent bike shop, they can easily top $1,000, and the price goes up from there. But less-costly versions are being sold these days at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart. Bike shops appreciate the extra business during what's typically a slow time of the year. The Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop used to close for the winter but is now offering fat bike rentals for riding inside Maine's Acadia National Park. Cyclists can ride their fat bikes even if there's a lack of snow that sidelines snowmobiles and cross-country skiers and others winter sports, said shop manager Adam Gariepy. A fat tire bike, right, is seen next to a mountain bike at the Gorham Bike and Ski shop in Portland, Maine. Fat tires have been around for a decade, but they've come into the mainstream in the past five years. (Robert F. Bukaty/AP) Range Morton, sales manager at Gorham Bike and Ski in Portland, said fat bike sales creep upward when there's a lack of snow that leads to a corresponding decrease in ski sales. "The fat bikes really help us to get through the winter," Morton said. "They were a big help last year and this year." David Crowell, of Laconia, New Hampshire, said riding takes him back to his childhood, except that he couldn't afford a $5,000 carbon-fiber bike when he was 12. Getting outdoors, there's a sense of freedom, and perhaps a bit of danger. After all, there's no way to avoid the occasional spill while bombing around in the snow. Thankfully, riders note, snow hurts less than pavement in a crash. "There's something about those big fat tires — they tend to put a grin on people's faces," Crowell, 47, said. "It's like being a kid. You're out there doing something. Maybe you shouldn't be doing it, but you're doing it anyway."

That company says it will also focus on adding more fresh items as well as removing added MSG, certified synthetic colors and partially hydrogenated oils to its products. Aldi plans to upgrade more than 1,300 stores by 2020. Aldi CEO Jason Hart says customer demand is driving both the remodel and the ingredient changes in its products. The decision appears to be paying dividends to the grocer: more than 40 million customers shop at Aldi each month, which is a nearly 60 percent increase since 2013. The changes at Aldi also highlight two growing trends in the retail and food and beverage industry that are leading to increased sales and cost savings: healthier, “sustainable” products and facilities. Customers want — and are willing to pay a premium for — more “sustainable” products. They also want to know what is in these products and are demanding increased transparency. Leading retailers Walmart and Target have committed to both. A second trend is green building, in both new and remodeled facilities, which not only reduces a store’s environmental footprint, but also saves money on utility bills and operational expenses and improves staff productivity.   Categories FacilitiesTags Aldi, Target, Walmart Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

(Citizens Bank of Edmond / provided) Heard on Hurd returns to downtown Edmond for a fourth year celebrating local food, drink and talent. The free street festival makes its 2017 debut 6 p.m. March 18 at the corner of N. Broadway and W. Hurd Street in Edmond. Heard on Hurd ​is 6-10 p.m. every third Saturday of the month from March to October. As many as 25,000 people show up on a good night, depending on the weather. Downtown Edmond’s hallmark event has become a popular draw for many different demographics. Jill Castilla, CEO of Heard on Hurd host Citizen’s Bank of Edmond, said there’s something for everyone. “It’s great to see the multi-generational aspect of [Heard on Hurd],” Castilla said. “My teenage daughter is checking to make sure she can meet up with her friends, but then I have her grandparents, too, that want to come hang out at it. It’s an event that, because of its wholesomeness, attracts a lot of different people.” The gathering has become known as one of the metro area’s premier events for live music, food trucks and local craft beer. Heard on Hurd partners with Bricktown Brewery and The Patriarch Craft Beer House & Lawn to bring a selection of seasonally appropriate, locally brewed craft beers to the festivities. The Patriarch also hosts an official Heard on Hurd after-party following each event. Drinkers won’t find any big-brand brews on festival grounds. “If we get a complaint, it’s that we don’t provide the national brands,” Castilla said. “This is all about supporting local, which is why we don’t have Wal-Mart with a pop-up shop. We want the beer selection to be reflective of that, too.” Though its craft-beer selection is certainly a highlight, Heard on Hurd is a true family event. The Citizens Bank of Edmond location at 1 E. First St. is opening up its newly renovated lobby to a revolving door of activities. In March, festivalgoers can visit the bank to play oversized versions of games like Jenga and tic-tac-toe. Heard on Hurd also welcomes more local street performers for 2017, ​burnishing its reputation for quality stage-dwelling musical acts. The event has become a regularly scheduled boon to the Edmond economy. Castilla estimates around $1 million of economic impact can come from a well-attended Saturday night. Even downtown businesses that don’t directly participate in Heard on Hurd often report their biggest sales days of the month during the festival. Castilla said the event’s great popularity has exceeded her own expectations. Heard on Hurd has drawn together not only different segments of the Edmond community, but people from outside Edmond and even out-of-staters. In the era of virtual communication, Castilla said there is still value in real-life fellowship. “We can all get so engaged using social media or using our phones,” she said, “but Heard on Hurd really provides that nostalgic, in-person engagement where you’re able to take social media relationships to meeting face-to-face.” Visit facebook.com/heardonhurd.   Print headline: Hurd mentality, Downtown Edmond’s popular street festival returns March 18 for another year of music, food trucks and craft beer.

Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch) Max Pizarro for Observer With Republicans in Congress moving ahead with their pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone is emerging as a leader in the fight to delay their efforts. The Asbury Park Press, meanwhile, reports what the GOP alternative planned, which the newspaper dubbed Trumpcare, will mean for New Jersey residents. The state’s two Democratic senators have split on President Donald Trump’s choice for Ambassador to Israel and Politico reports that while Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen might not be vulnerable in 2018, he most likely will face a serious re-election fight as the long-time U.S. representative takes heat in his district for his increasingly conservative voting record and his penchant for avoiding meeting with his constituents. Political battles continue in New Jersey, too, with Democrats vowing a court fight over Gov. Chris Christie’s move to loosen handgun regulations and historical preservationists vowing to fight on after the state demolished a historic structure. Quote of the Day: “The Republicans keep talking about what they don’t like in the Affordable Care Act, but they never talk about how what they’re proposing today is going to improve it. In almost every case I can tell you that what they’re going to do would make it worse.” – U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, on his efforts to block the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare hearing rolls past 24 hours. Meet the N.J. leader of Democratic resistance The Republican trying to shepherd the GOP’s Affordable Care Act repeal bill through a key committee got about eight words into his opening statement Wednesday when Democrat Frank Pallone interrupted.

Beneath those fingertips, they can feel that middle-class dream – the American dream – slipping right away from them. It’s time for President Trump to do something about it. I come from Ohio. It’s where I was born, and it’s where my roots run deep. We are humble, proud and hard-working people who’ve been battered by the twin storms of globalization and greed. This past weekend, I was in another state full of humble, proud, and hard-working people; I marched with workers from the Nissan plant in Canton, Miss. ADVERTISEMENT For decades, manufacturing provided millions of Ohioans and Mississippians a solid roadway to the middle class. A family breadwinner could work full time and earn enough money to buy a home, put the kids through college, and enjoy a secure retirement.   But today, 600,000 American manufacturing workers make less than $9.60 per hour – barely more than they could earn at a fast food joint. And their real wages dropped nearly 4.5 percent from 2003 to 2013. They are barely hanging on. We marched in Canton because Nissan isn’t giving its workers the dignity and respect they earn every single day along that assembly line. They are furloughed for the equivalent of months throughout the year, killing plans for homeownership. They don’t have a predictable schedule, putting college tuition for their kids out of reach. They’ve even had their pensions frozen, making dreams of retirement seem more like a cruel joke than an attainable goal. And that’s just the full-time workers. Nissan uses a temp company, Kelly Services, to fill almost half the jobs at the plant. Temp workers there receive $12 an hour plus the promise that after a certain time, they’ll become full Nissan employees. But many of them languish for years. To make matters worse, this poverty-wage business model is paid for by our tax dollars. In fact, Nissan and Kelly Services have scooped up more than $3 billion in federal contracts and loans. That means our government is helping keep American factory workers in poverty jobs while corporate executives get to pocket billions in profits. This isn’t just happening in Canton. Right now, the U.S. government is America’s No. 1 low-wage job creator, funding more than 2 million poverty jobs across the country through contracts, loans and grants with private corporations. That’s more than McDonald’s and Wal-Mart combined. And when federal contractors like Nissan and Kelly Services illegally violate the rights of their workers to organize, they’re passing poverty from generation to generation. So you can understand why Ohioans and Mississippians sat up and listened when Donald TrumpDonald TrumpState Dept: Israel will not see foreign aid cuts under Trump budget plan Maddow's Trump's tax return reveal delivers 4.1 million viewers for MSNBC Dem rep asks White House for Sebastian Gorka's immigration papers MORE promised that he would bring manufacturing back; that he would create more jobs and better wages. Everyday Americans took him at his word. And now it’s time to hold him accountable. It’s time for President Trump to guarantee that the only companies doing business with the federal government are the ones that pay living wages, provide safe work environments and benefits, and don’t fight their workers when they want to form a union. We know that he can do this, because he’s done it before. Workers at the Trump International Hotel – a federally owned property – were allowed to form a union shortly after President Trump was elected. It’s time to demand that other federal contractors do the same thing. Grandma was right. The truth always does catch up. And the truth of the matter is this: President Trump made us a promise. It’s a promise that we all need to ensure that he keeps – for our workers, for our families and for the future we all share.   Nina Turner is a former Ohio state senator and board member of Good Jobs Defenders.

Blue Shield of California wants to create “a tiered pharmacy network” in its 2018 small- and large-group plans, according to preliminary proposals the company submitted to the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a state health insurance regulator. If the proposal is approved by the department before the end of the year, it would affect the coverage of more than 1.8 million consumers, based on 2015 numbers from the regulator. Under Blue Shield’s proposal, consumers still would have a broad selection of pharmacies, but they would have to choose a “preferred” pharmacy to maintain this year’s copayment amount. Outside of that network, consumers could pay up to $50 more for the same prescription, the company document says. The move is part of a larger trend among insurers and other health care payers to narrow networks of providers to keep costs down, experts say. Consumers already are familiar with insurers steering them toward certain physicians and hospitals to save money. And narrower pharmacy networks are increasingly common in Medicare and employer-sponsored health coverage. But the Blue Shield proposal would expand pharmacy networks to commercial plans — something California regulators say insurers under their purview aren’t currently doing. Use Our Content This story can be republished for free (details). Nationally, insurers and their pharmaceutical benefit managers have been known to selectively contract with pharmacies, although it’s difficult to say how common that practice is. Pharmacy chain CVS Health expects to dispense tens of millions fewer prescriptions in 2017 as a result of being excluded from health plan pharmacy networks around the nation, according to news media reports. And late last year, because CVS was not included in a Blue Cross of Alabama network, hundreds of thousands of customers were notified that they should switch to a preferred pharmacy if they wanted lower prices. Raymond Brown, a clinical pharmacy leader at Mercer, a New York-based employee benefits consulting firm, says every health care payer — government, employers and insurers — scrutinizes the pharmaceutical supply chain to find places to control rising drug costs. “They’re saying, ‘What else can we do?’” he said. “To say ‘Can we do something on the distribution side?’ … I think is a natural additional step.” Blue Shield of California spokeswoman Molly Weedn said the preferred pharmacy network proposal is an effort to “stabilize the increasingly high cost of drugs for our members.” Blue Shield of California already has preferred pharmacies in its Medicare plans, including CVS/Target, Walmart, Costco and Safeway/Albertsons and some independent pharmacies. The insurer’s latest proposal would use that same network of pharmacies in its state-regulated commercial market. But some patient advocates and pharmacists say pharmacy networks can confuse consumers and interfere with patient care. Another major California insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, joined Blue Shield of California in proposing to create preferred pharmacy networks in Covered California policies for 2018. But in a letter in December to the health insurance marketplace, attorneys for low-income consumers and other advocacy groups objected. “We reject the allowance of tiered pharmacies as the right solution to our shared concerns about the ever-escalating prices of prescription drugs,” the letter said. Covered California staff decided not to allow the change in the 2018 health insurance marketplace, spokeswoman Amy Palmer said, because it wouldn’t have considerably brought down health care costs. Advocates with Consumers Union, which hasn’t taken a position on the most recent Blue Shield proposal, say pharmacy networks could create more complexity for lower-income people in an already complicated health insurance system, one that faces more uncertainty under an Obamacare repeal. “It’s really not a good time to add one more layer of information that [patients] have to deal with,” said Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union. “People will be befuddled.” Imholz said creating economic incentives to steer patients toward network pharmacies could inconvenience the most vulnerable patients. If the preferred pharmacy is farther away, or in a rural area, lower-income patients dependent on public transit could have a harder time reaching the preferred pharmacy, she said. “It’s going to add to your costs and your time, and if you have a medical condition, to get to … the cheaper tier of pharmacy, that can be a real burden,” Imholz said. Many pharmacists don’t like narrow pharmacy networks, either. Jon Roth, CEO of the California Pharmacists Association, says creating preferred pharmacies can sever long-term relationships that pharmacists have with patients. Pharmacists “may know everything about [a patient’s] health history, their medication use,” and help patients “adhere to their medication instructions,” Roth said. “It’s very distressing.” But Blue Shield, in its proposals to the DMHC, said its pharmacy network idea is intended to make “health care affordable for all Californians.” And the company suggests that almost all of its commercial plan members live close to a preferred pharmacy. Still, Katie Keith, a policy consultant and contributor to a recent report on pharmacy access, says the preferred pharmacy approach is not a panacea for rising drug prices. “It’s not going to solve everything or even get close to solving the whole problem,” Keith said. “It’s a trend to keep an eye on, but I’m not sure how far this will go.” This story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.

Barry Eichengreen Frustrated from implementing much of his economic agenda, the president can only continue lashing out at perceived enemies Donald Trump will have to keep Congress on side if he is to deliver his economic policies. Photograph: Reuters Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Friday 10 March 2017 04.16 EST Last modified on Friday 10 March 2017 04.25 EST Donald Trump took office promising a raft of sweeping economic policy changes for the United States. He has quickly discovered, like previous US presidents, that America’s political system is designed to prevent rapid, large-scale change, by interposing formidable institutional obstacles, from the Congress and career civil servants to state governments and the courts. Start with reform of personal income tax. This should be a slam-dunk, because the president and congressional Republican leaders are on the same page. Trump’s goal of removing the government’s groping hand from Americans’ pockets, by cutting the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 39.5% to 33%, is entirely consistent with mainstream Republican ideology, according to which high tax rates penalise success and stifle innovation. But, to be politically viable, significant tax cuts for the wealthy would have to be accompanied by at least token tax cuts for the middle class. And broad-based tax cuts would blow a hole in the budget and excite congressional deficit hawks, of whom there are still a few. Trump's border tax could damage the US a lot more than a wall | Kenneth Rogoff Read more One can imagine closing loopholes to render rate cuts revenue neutral. But one person’s loophole is another’s entitlement. Even if there are economic arguments for eliminating, say, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, imagine the howls of protest from homeowners, including many Trump voters, who borrowed to purchase their houses. Imagine the reaction of Trump’s friends in real estate. Cuts on the spending side would assuage the deficit hawks. And big cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Agency for International Development, and National Public Radio are high on the Republican hit list. But the vast majority of federal spending is on entitlements, the military, and other proverbial “third rail” items that elected officials touch at their peril. Simply put, broad-based spending cuts to match broad-based income-tax reductions are not politically feasible. Eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) would save the government a little over $100bn a year, about 3% of federal spending. But those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes. Moreover, Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done. Healthcare reform, as Hillary Clinton could have told them, is fearsomely complex. It is increasingly clear that the name will change (“Trumpcare”, anyone?), and it can be expected that the Republican plan will cover fewer people; but much of the substance will remain the same. Because corporate taxes are less significant in terms of overall federal revenue, rate cutting doesn’t pose a comparable threat to the budget balance. But here there is no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on the form such cuts should take. House Speaker Paul Ryan and others favour moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports. Others, such as treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, are evidently sceptical. And an important part of Trump’s business constituency – import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart – are actively hostile. Agreement on a plan won’t come easily. Trump’s other flagship proposal is a $1tn infrastructure programme. But this initiative will run headlong into deficit concerns, and it is fundamentally at odds with Republican scepticism about big government, and specifically about the public sector’s capacity to carry out investment plans efficiently. Trump will want to be able to point to a few signature projects. He will want his border wall with Mexico. But any new federal infrastructure spending is likely to be more symbolic than real. So what will an impatient president, frustrated and hemmed in on all sides, do? First, Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation, namely those affecting trade. He can invoke the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, restricting imports on the grounds that they threaten US “material interests”. He can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 on the grounds that the loss of jobs to Mexico and China constitutes an economic emergency. He can even invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 on the grounds that the US has special forces active in the Middle East. Second, Trump will respond, as populists do, by attempting to distract attention from his failure to deliver the economic goods. This means directing his ire and that of his supporters toward others – whether internal enemies like the press, the intelligence community, and Barack Obama, or external adversaries like such as Islamic State and China. It wouldn’t be the first time a politician used a domestic political crusade or a foreign policy adventure to divert attention from his economic failures. We have already seen Trump’s tendency to lash out at perceived enemies, foreign and domestic. And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers such as Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller. We can hope that cooler heads prevail. But, given the constraints on implementing Trump’s economic agenda, it’s hard to be optimistic. • Barry Eichengreen is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley; Pitt professor of American history and institutions at the University of Cambridge; and a former senior policy adviser at the IMF © Project Syndicate Topics US economy Project Syndicate economists Economics Donald Trump comment Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

A World War II vet that served his community, his country, and his family to the highest standard. I want to thank the staff of the Little Rock Veterans Administration for treating our hero as if he was their only hero. The Veterans Administration has taken some direct hits in the media, but we, as a family, have never seen it. This staff has never let him down, and as a wounded disabled veteran myself, they've never let me down either. He is currently in the hospice wing and may not have much time left, so I wanted to personally say thanks for all that you do for our veterans. Lastly, thanks and Godspeed to "Big Papa" for accepting the Mc-Kendrees into your family as if we've always been there. From the McKendree and McAllister families ... freedom is never free. CHAMBLISS McKENDREE Adona Free-market medicine Why replace Obamacare? Wouldn't it be better to set up a fund for those with pre-existing illnesses and those too poor to afford insurance? I believe a fund that is funded with tax dollars, contributions by the insured, and tax-deductible donations by the taxpayers allows a free-market solution. Patients could negotiate with doctors and hospitals. Doctors and hospitals could bid to perform their services. The program could be administered by a corporation or government. The administration could aid in negotiating contracts but would not be allowed to override the doctors' and patients' decisions due only to costs. Therefore, the doctor and patient could decide the value of a particular procedure on older patents. There is nothing better than the free market to provide quality products at the least cost. DON CROWSON Benton Brilliant performance An outstanding concert titled "Music of the Baroque" was performed brilliantly last Friday night by the U of A Monticello Chamber Choir led by Kent Skinner, who also conducts the Arkansas Choral Society biannual performances. It included choral works by Schutz, Buxtehude, J.S. Bach and Vivaldi. Each was performed with rare balance and precision by Arkansas Symphony first chairs and chorus. The soloists were also superb, especially alto Diana Salesky, whose rich clarity and projection could easily enhance concerts in New York and London. Unfortunately the audience was sparse. Hopefully in future this group will get more pre-concert publicity and a post-performance review by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette! JIM RULE Maumelle Stop lowering the bar I guess Pat Tillman set the bar way too high for his professional sports colleagues, huh? And another thing. You don't have a middle finger unless you have either three or five, except if you're counting your thumb as a finger, which of course it isn't. DON SHORT Farmington All politics are local While we're mesmerized by the events in Washington--the pledged militarization of deportation of 11 million immigrants and the promise of the destruction of each of our carefully built governmental institutions--our fine Republicon Ledge here in Arkansas is busy squeezing another drop of blood from the turnip. Now they are passing a bill (crafted in darkness of back rooms) that will tax all Internet sales into Arkansas. It seems these fine Republicons feel it is best to squeeze more taxes from the impoverished population rather than our fat-cat corporations, Cargill, Tyson, and Wal-Mart, among others. While corporate tax rates have remained the same low rate, Arkansas is one of the only states to tax food. Now any purchase made across state lines is a shiny dollar sign in the eyes of the Republicons. We have some incredibly wealthy corporations in Arkansas and some incredibly poor citizens. Arkansas ranks in the top 10 in poverty out of 50 states! Two out of 10 children in Arkansas go to bed hungry every night. Thousands of families remain below the poverty line. Our disability rate is one of the highest in the nation, probably from working on ever-speeding assembly lines, which creates ever-greater wealth for these corporations. It's time to focus some of that pent-up national anxiety on our state legislators. "All politics are local," said a very wise man. Laws that affect us every day are made right here in Arkansas by our Republicon-led state Legislature. SHERI HANSON Eureka Springs No need to rewrite it Few political subjects are as close to my heart as the Constitution of the United States, because this nation, as it is, depends on the Constitution as it was written. I am deeply concerned, shocked, and appalled by the conservatives who have fallen for the constitutional convention (con-con) con. I remind them that the other side, which apparently wants to rewrite the Constitution more than they do, will have delegates, too. I remind them that the states that sent delegates to the 1787 convention were unable to control them; the delegates were instructed to repair the Articles of Confederation; they tossed out the Articles and gave the states the Constitution. Could we somehow select and trust them, there are not 55 men in the whole world with the wisdom and experience, in just the right circumstances, to have written our Constitution. There never was before 1787. There never has been since. If we send delegates to the con-con with instructions to repair the Constitution, what will we get? No one knows. No one can know. It is likely to be something nightmarish. We do not need to rewrite the Constitution, but for us and the politicians to follow it.

The film played at last week’s True/False film festival in Columbia, Mo. Comments aAFont Size It doesn't always work this way, but sometimes when you go to film festivals you begin to see things in terms of overriding themes. It's a way to categorize the sheer volume of what you're taking in, I suppose, but, depending on the curation process, can also be a peek into the national zeitgeist, at least as far as the festival's programmers can ascertain. True/False, the annual festival in Columbia, Mo., is built on the rewarding premise that real-life stories -- and, in some cases, their proximities -- can be every bit as compelling as carefully plotted dramas. True/False has its own particular vision, paying particular attention to those films whose lines are blurred between objective documentation and narrative flights of fancy. Naturally, those blurred lines can also be problematic when assessing a film: determining which part of what you're seeing is factual and which is crafted is a big part of figuring out its intentions. At this year's festival, several films were specifically concerned with the dissolution and breakdown of family ties in the wake of tragedy. The most notable of these, Yance Ford's startling Strong Island, investigates the 1992 murder of the director's older brother. But this isn't an investigation to determine the killer or the motive -- he was immediately identified but claimed self-defense, which Ford hotly disputes. Rather, the film explores the reasons the killer was never brought to trial, and the palpable loss to the director's family, including his younger sister, his irascible mother (one of the stars of the interview sections), and his heartbroken father, who had a massive stroke soon after his son's death. Ford, who was born female but now identifies as male, paints a vividly confrontational portrait of the grief behind the unspoken, even in a family as open and emotionally salient as his. The film moves from interviews with family members, friends, and some of the police and legal officials who handled the case, to haunting images of the concrete parking lot where his brother died, and the surrounding areas. Ford uses a kind of visual poetics to further push the point, but it is his own confessions -- shot in almost painfully tight close-up -- that become the film's most searing moments. No less heartfelt is Travis Wilkerson's Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?, a kind of live, multimedia presentation -- at least until the final narrative track is recorded permanently. Wilkerson, a documentarian known for his humanitarian causes, sits at a desk in front of us, his laptop open, speaking into a microphone to tell us the story of his great grandfather, S.E. Branch, who in 1946 killed a black man named Bill Spann in Branch's rural Alabama store. As Wilkerson, who had long since left his hometown, returns to try and unravel the mystery of why this happened and, more significantly, why the murder charge was dropped against his great-grandfather, he is forced to confront the evil that lurks within his family's collective soul. Part of the project's effectiveness is witnessing the way Wilkerson twists and suffers with the material he's presenting, the agonies reflected in his quavering voice and hunched body language. It's white guilt made manifest, such that when he loudly joins in the chorus of the film's fierce song of remembrance as the last images play out on the screen, it's as if you are watching a man attempting to purge the demons from his bloodline. Fortunately, this year's lineup also included films with a more positive familial outlook. Quest, a film shot over a decade in the heart of North Philadelphia, tenderly follows the varied tribulations in the lives of Christopher "Quest" and Christine'a "Ma Quest" Rainey. Years ago, the Raineys built a home studio in their basement, ostensibly to give Quest an opportunity to hone his producing skills, but also as a means for the neighborhood cats to lay down some tracks and focus on a musical career. Initially, that's all director Jonathan Olshefski was intending to shoot, but over time, as the couple suffered through the life-threatening illness of their oldest son, and a severe shotgun wound to their younger daughter, P.J., Olshefski sagely just kept the cameras rolling. Kind, attentive, and preternaturally composed, Quest and Ma handle each of these horrific challenges with stunning grace. We watch the adorable P.J. go from happy, basketball playing imp, to severely wounded victim, to proud, fiercely intelligent young woman, as her parents continue to struggle through their difficult -- but beautifully complex -- lives. The film is sprawling and at various times suitably messy. Far more focused is Steve James' excellent Abacus: Small Enough to Jail, a film I had seen in Toronto, but happily watched again. It concerns the Abacus Savings and Loan Bank in New York's Chinatown, a small family bank run by the extremely dignified Mr. Sung and his four extremely capable and sharp-witted daughters, which was almost laughably the only financial institution indicted in the wake of the home mortgage crises of 2008. Instead of finding a passive lamb in the small bank, prosecutors came up against the Sungs, nearly all of whom are lawyers, who fought them tooth and nail -- with the state's star witness the very corrupt loan officer whose greed and malfeasance created the mess that got the bank in trouble. As the case stretches on for months, the family, even under this tremendous stress, still stays fiercely loyal to one another. It's a different sort of stress than what the Raineys endure, but it is met with no less determined poise. Somewhat more deliberate in their assembly and composition, a trio of the festival's films each confronted their subjects with a more measured gaze. Jeff Unay's The Cage Fighter opens with a scene that could have come straight from the Sundance narrative division. A large man grunts with exertion as he flips a giant truck tire over and over in the darkened, deep blue light of an empty parking lot. The man is Joe Carman, a thick-shouldered family man who works as a pipe fitter by day, but much against his wife and four daughters' wishes, continues to fight in amateur Mixed Martial Arts combat at night. Kind and gregarious, Joe, who seems otherwise deeply devoted to his children from two marriages, has the fight game in his blood. He needs these savage bouts -- many of which leave him beaten, bloody and bewildered -- as he explains it, to find a version of himself of whom he can feel proud. With a main character as rich and full-drawn as Joe, it appears that Unay is leading us to a Rocky-esque battle of redemption. Early on, the film identifies another, much younger and more chiseled fighter, Clayton Hoy, as the swaggering Apollo Creed to Joe's struggling Balboa. But just as things seem to be headed for an inevitable showdown, reality sets in to unravel the straightforward narrative kick of the beginning. Joe's family confronts him about his lying to them, and his wife leaves him. In the film's best and most unexpected scene, Joe meets with Hoy in a bar and the two hit it off like longtime best friends, comparing fighting notes, doing shots, and both lamenting the sad direction in which their crumbling marriages have led them. The film isn't about some sort of dramatic showdown for Joe's soul. Instead, we see an aging, battered man try to double-down on being the best father he can. Meanwhile, Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini's Dina, also shot in Philly, follows the forthcoming nuptials for its middle-aged heroine and her fiance, Scott. Dina is autistic and Scott has Asperger's syndrome and they want nothing more than to be together, but circumstances make that difficult. Dina has endured the death of her first husband and a subsequent boyfriend whose manic episodes escalated into his stabbing her multiple times, and she is still dealing with the pain. Scott, by contrast, is friendly, warm and almost entirely innocent. Working as a greeter for a local Wal-Mart, he is forever doting on his fiancee and listening appreciatively to her various diatribes (among other things, she's a devoted fan of reality TV's Keeping Up With the Kardsashians), but the idea of romantic passion and, indeed, sexuality, are still scary propositions to him, even after they wed. The curious thing is the mannered way in which the directors choose to shoot the film: It is composed entirely of locked-down camera shots, with the subjects entering and leaving the frame. It's not that the coverage is lacking, in fact, in numerous cases, it's clear they have multiple cameras covering Dina and Scott's lives, but it does greatly bring into question the legitimacy of its documentation. No film, even the most dispassionate of docs, is without its own subjectivity, but because Sickles and Santini shoot it as if it's a narrative feature, it adds a confusing element of intentionality to the story. Sweet as they are as a couple, you have to wonder what they did to amuse themselves during what must have been an arduous array of camera setups. Dina and Scott certainly stay with you, but you can't help but feel the saucy hint of exploitation. A far simpler camera line is established in Claire Simon's intriguing Recreations (part of the French filmmaker's retrospective as part of receiving the festival's True Vision Award). Originally shot in 1998, Simon filmed from about waist high, following several classes of French elementary schoolchildren, ages roughly from 4 to 6, as they spend their precious recess time on their school's courtyard playground. As can be expected, there's a wide range of dramas presented, including one in which a little girl collects a hefty roll of twigs together (oftentimes, the children treat them as a form of currency) only to fling them in front of her friends, so they can dance on them. In another, a round-faced boy tries to get everyone to play "barber" with him, only to have the game continually turned into a game of "prisoner" instead. At times, the kids are mean, and borderline cruel to one another -- a pair of boys square off about the ownership of twigs, but the larger one, by dint of a series of swift and punishing kicks, decides the matter for himself -- but also often sweet. The children are always quick to reassess and one gathers a sense of the unflappable elasticity of their relationships. Several minutes after the kicking boy has made his point, the two boys happily play together, calling each other "best friend." Appropriately, the last segment is also the film's longest and most uplifting: A very young girl is distraught that her peers are able to jump from a concrete step over a park bench and onto the cushioned ground while she is too scared to make the leap. The girls' reactions range from rubbing it in ("I'm younger than you and I can do it, it's dead easy") to comforting the sobbing child and offering assistance to help her make the jump. It's to the film's credit that the conclusion of her ordeal -- she finally figures out she, too, can jump successfully -- feels as if a massive hurdle has been made in this child's life. That was my last film of this year's festival, and a sweetly fitting note to close out on. As True/False so elegantly displays each year, the world is a strange, terrifying, and crushingly sad place, but there are also moments of grace and beauty, and triumph, and we can feel lucky dedicated filmmakers are there to document them.

Bukaty) PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Gone are the days when cyclists had to put away their bikes for the winter. These days, hard-core riders are staying outdoors year round thanks to "fat bikes" that allow them to conquer winter's worst instead of staying indoors on a stationary bike. The bikes, with comically large tires, have come into the mainstream in the past couple of years, after being introduced about a decade ago. John Grondin, 48, of Scarborough, got his fat bike to kick the winter blues. "I wanted to get outside and ride in the winter," he said. "I like to ride, period. I'll ride a road bike. I'll ride a mountain bike. I just want to ride." The ginormous tires are wide enough to float over snow and bounce over obstacles. Groomed snowmobile trails provide miles and miles of winter riding. Fat bikes represent the first major bicycle trend in several decades, after BMX bikes in the 1970s and conventional mountain bikes in the 1980s, said Jay Townley, partner in Pennsylvania-based Gluskin-Townley Group, a consultant and market research company focusing on the bicycle business. Growth in the segment has provided something to cheer about for bike retailers and has prevented a slide in bike sales, which number about 18 million units a year, he said. "The industry, quite frankly, needed something. If anything, the fat tire bike helped to keep a stable bike industry instead of losing volume," he said. The NPD Group, which tracks retail sales of bikes in the U.S., reports that fat tire bike sales have grown eightfold in the past three years, to $74.7 million in 2016. The growing popularity can be seen at fat bike races. Every weekend there are races and festivals across the nation's snowbelt. Dozens of riders braved single-digit temperatures in February for the "Sugarloaf Fat Tire Festival" at Maine's tallest ski mountain. The bikes aren't cheap. Purchased at an independent bike shop, they can easily top $1,000, and the price goes up from there. But less-costly versions are being sold these days at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart. Bike shops appreciate the extra business during what's typically a slow time of the year. The Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop used to close for the winter but is now offering fat bike rentals for riding inside Maine's Acadia National Park. Cyclists can ride their fat bikes even if there's a lack of snow that sidelines snowmobiles and cross-country skiers and others winter sports, said shop manager Adam Gariepy.

"The fat bikes really help us to get through the winter," Morton said. "They were a big help last year and this year." David Crowell, of Laconia, New Hampshire, said riding takes him back to his childhood, except that he couldn't afford a $5,000 carbon-fiber bike when he was 12. Getting outdoors, there's a sense of freedom, and perhaps a bit of danger. After all, there's no way to avoid the occasional spill while bombing around in the snow. Thankfully, riders note, snow hurts less than pavement in a crash. "There's something about those big fat tires — they tend to put a grin on people's faces," Crowell, 47, said. "It's like being a kid. You're out there doing something. Maybe you shouldn't be doing it, but you're doing it anyway." ___ Follow David Sharp on Twitter at https://twitter.com/David_Sharp_AP.

Luke Walsh-Mellet Friday, March 10, 2017 Workers in El Salvador won a big rise in the minimum wage on January 1 — in some cases doubling their pay. But before they had time to celebrate, the multinational companies who thrive on the country’s still-low wages counterattacked with mass layoffs, judicial manoeuvres and a bid to undermine the eight-hour day. “With the increases in the minimum wage, which are absolutely historic, we delivered an enormous blow,” said Estela Ramirez of the Textile Workers Union, SITRASACOSI. “Now part of their campaign is to fire people, to carry out a terror campaign that businesses will leave and people will be without work. I think that this year will be one of enormous struggle, and we hope to have the support of our international allies.” How the rise was won The National Minimum Wage Council, a regulatory body made up of government, labour and private sector representatives, sets minimum wages in El Salvador’s private sector. After the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) won the presidency in 2009, the possibility emerged that labour and the government could vote together against the private sector on the wage council for the first time in the country’s history and bring some long-overdue relief to working families. But union representatives had, for decades, been controlled by business interests and were notoriously corrupt. The depth of their betrayal was widely revealed last June when labour representatives sided with big business to approve a paltry minimum wage rise rather than the government’s much heftier proposal. Under the FMLN government, the Ministry of Labour has remained relatively conservative. Due to the continuing power of the country’s oligarchs, the FMLN has trodden carefully. However, outrage from large swaths of the population over the council’s decision gave new Minister of Labour Sandra Guevara the courage to hold new elections for labour representatives, opening up the process to public and private sector unions and ensuring a level of transparency that had never existed before. The progressive labour movement agreed on a common slate of candidates, and won. Seven years ago, recognising the historic opportunity the FMLN’s victory represented, progressive and left unions began to organise broad-based federations based on a shared class interest that would allow them to compete with the existing representatives. The new elections to the Minimum Wage Council created the opportunity they had been waiting for. The council moved quickly to approve a new minimum wage that took effect on January 1: $300 a month in commerce, service and industry; and $224 a month in rural agriculture. The largest rises came in the maquila or textile industry, notorious for low wages and difficult working conditions, where the minimum wage rose nearly 40% from $211 to $295 a month, and for seasonal coffee and cotton pickers, who will see their wages more than double from $98 to $200 a month. Employers respond Though the hike merely brings El Salvador on par with neighbouring Honduras and Guatemala, business is not accepting the change quietly. “At first the reaction was one of surprise,” said Wilfredo Berrios of the Salvadoran Union and Social Front. “Then it was recalcitrant and miserly.” The blowback includes judicial challenges, threatening to close factories and proposing their own labour “reforms” that would undermine the wage rise, specifically in the textile maquilas and call centres. Both sectors have become very important in the Salvadoran economy. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, right-wing governments and international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund decimated the country through privatisation and attempted to create an export-oriented economy dependent on foreign investment. Multinational corporations seeking low wages dominate the textile sector, which makes up 46% of El Salvadoran exports and employs more than 73,000 workers. The industry boasts that it makes up nearly half of all manufacturing jobs in the country; manufacturing overall represents 22% of workers in the formal sector. Factories run in large part by Salvadoran, Taiwanese and Korean owners produce for brands like Adidas, Walmart, and Hanes. Fruit of the Loom is the largest single private-sector employer in the country, employing an estimated 12,000 workers directly across four of its own plants, and thousands more through contractors. Call centres are a newer phenomenon, although they have grown exponentially by taking advantage of the influx of English-speaking deportees from the United States. As some of the largest private sector employers, maquila and call centre owners do not hesitate to throw their weight around. Eleven-hour day? Within weeks of December’s minimum wage victory, the private sector renewed its push to “flexibilise” the eight-hour day. Ramirez said this proposal was previously introduced — and defeated — in 2011. The “compressed week” proposal would change El Salvador’s Labour Code to allow employers in textiles and call centres to institute a four-day week with 11-hour shifts. Ramirez and SITRASACOSI say this schedule would functionally eliminate overtime pay, leading to a loss in monthly earnings and jeopardise other rights enshrined in the Labour Code, including paid holidays, which are based on an eight-hour day. But they are most concerned about the physical strain that an extended workday would push onto an already overexploited labour force. The change would also fall hardest on women, who are usually responsible for most of the domestic work in the home. It is unlikely that flexibilisation of hours would be confined to textiles and call centres, Ramirez said, calling this first attempt “a pilot program.” Employers have also pushed back against the minimum wage victory in and out of court. The National Association of Private Enterprise, the country’s main business lobby, challenged the election of the labour representatives to the Minimum Wage Council and asked the Supreme Court to overturn the rise. A number of large businesses announced layoffs, blaming the wage rise. SITRACOSI members said Textiles Opico, which produces sports apparel for Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Levi’s, GAP and Reebok, among others, used the new minimum wage as an excuse to sack more than 80 workers in one day, among them many union leaders.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. - Royal Dutch Shell Plc is selling nearly all of its Canadian oil-sands developments in deals worth $7.25 billion, deserting a region that has come to symbolize the risks for energy companies in high-cost, carbon-intensive sources of oil. on.wsj.com/2n5YcK3 - Dutch paints and chemicals maker Akzo Nobel NV said it had rejected a 20.9 billion euros ($22.15 billion) offer from U.S. peer PPG Industries Inc, setting up a trans-Atlantic standoff between two long-lived industrial giants amid a wave of consolidation in the sector. on.wsj.com/2n5Lyub - Americans now officially drink more bottled water than soda.

"Wife slams shocked scribe," he told me. "Turn to page 5." Headlines have been on my mind lately. It all started in February when there was a rash of headlines saying "Smoking Good For Health" after scientists revealed one tiny possible benefit of cigarettes (they prevented a case of anemia). The same week, this headline appeared in Time magazine: "America's Top Fortune Cookie Writer Is Quitting Because of Writer's Block." It seems to be Collectable Headline season around the world, so let's survey recent classics. Funny headlines come in four categories. First we have Deliberate Puns. The UK has been hit by a lettuce shortage. "LEAF IT OUT!" was the headline in the Sun, while the Guardian had the more predictable "Tip of the iceberg". The Times of London told the excitable British public to "Romaine calm". The Hong Kong Standard is known for its punning headlines, such as the one over a report on a poultry restaurant's legal troubles: "Court cooks their goose." When a giant bird escaped from its owner, Singapore's AsiaOne headlined the tale: "Ostrich runs afowl on Malaysian highway." The second category is the Oops Headlines, when the words are not wrong but accidentally offer an alternative meaning. "Trump campaign chief charged with battery", the New York Times reported last year, creating an image of an expired man being plugged into a recharger. "Undiscovered moons may lurk around Uranus", the Washington Post reported a few months ago, to juvenile snickers. When a food inspector left his job, a recent wire service report was headlined "Meat head resigns". The third category is Clickbait Cheating -- headlines which deliberately mislead the reader. In Nigeria last month, cheeky scribes titled their "Buhari undergoes penis surgery" to make it go viral. Buhari is the name of the country's president, but the story referred to a non-famous person with the same name. The fourth category is Grammatical Mistakes, which is when a problem like missing commas or bad grammar changes the meaning. News website The Hive last year featured a story titled: "Spotify founder gets married with Bruno Mars and Mark Zuckerberg". Bad sentence construction was evident in the title of a report by the Star-Ledger newspaper of Newark, New Jersey, last July: "Cops called to Union house where man was killed at least 30 times". This sort of error often creates interesting word-pictures. "Thousands of bees swarm an area Walmart, three recover in hospital", said a report on KFOR-TV, a US news website in August last year. So several thousand bees attacked a big store and three of the bees ended up in hospital beds, hooked up to drips and monitors, right? Since real news headlines are so entertaining these days, people who make their living creating fake ones (such as The Onion website or Andy Borowitz) are redundant. Meanwhile, I pledged to train my journalist friend to talk in human speech from now, instead of in headlines. "Scribe In Reform Pact", he replied. "Verdict Unsure".
