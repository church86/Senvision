Posted on October 31, 2016 By Dana Williamson BURNS FLAT—WANTED: Missionary. Must be friendly with outgoing personality. Must love people, know the Bible and yearn to share the love of Jesus with others, praying for them and inviting them to church. Apply at Walmart. While it is unlikely that Walmart or any retailer would pay for an ad like this. If they did, Hazel Fleming would fit the bill perfectly. A member of Burns Flat, First for nearly 30 years, Fleming spends a part of most days at the Walmart in Elk City, just a few miles down the road from her home church. “Because she’s done such a great job witnessing to folks there, we’re going to commission her as our ‘Walmart missionary,’” said Carl Thionnet, interim pastor. Carl Thionnet, director of missions for Concor-Kiowa Association, and interim pastor at Burns Flat, First, stands in front of the church building where he was baptized as an 8-year-old. The original structure was maintained as the church built on to it with a new worship center and educational space Thionnet, director of missions for Concord-Kiowa Association, has been interim pastor at Burns Flat, First since the first Sunday in July. During that time, Sunday School attendance has grown from about 30 to more than 70, and the church has baptized nine people, with Sept. 11 designated as “Baptism Day.” One of those baptized was a lady Fleming met at Walmart and invited to have coffee. Fleming asked her several questions, including if she liked Sunday School and if she was saved. Her answer to the latter question was “I try to be.” Fleming encouraged the woman, who was a Jehovah’s Witness, to attend Sunday School, which she did for a few weeks before coming to a Wednesday night service. After that service, Thionnet talked with her, and she accepted Jesus as her Savior. Some of the others baptized were preteen prospects who had made professions of faith at camp and Vacation Bible School, but who had never had any follow-up. “Our members started making follow-up visits and found several who wanted to be baptized,” said Thionnet. He said the mother of one of the boys who was baptized had just died, and he was crushed because she wouldn’t be able to see him baptized. “Church members stepped in and helped the family anyway we could, and since they didn’t have any place to hold the funeral, we had the services here at the church.” Fleming, who is the church’s pianist, said she started going to Walmart after her husband died, because “that’s where the people are.” “I would go drink coffee there and get involved with people,” she explained. “Everyone has a story, and God showed me how to pray for people in the check-out line. Everybody needs encouragement and a smile.” Fleming said she is especially drawn to women with broken hearts, those who have known tragedy.  One of the people she has been ministering to is a woman who works in the meat department and has cancer. Her grandson was recently baptized in the church as a result of Fleming’s witness. Occasionally the tables are turned on Fleming, and she is the one ministered to. She was recently on crutches, and a man in the congregation noticed her using her crutches to get to the piano. “Someone began taking out my trash, and I thought it was our pastor at the time,” Fleming recalled. “Then one day, while I was in line at Walmart, this man said to me, “I’m your mystery man.” “That turned heads in this small town,” laughed Fleming. “I didn’t know the man, but later learned he attended our church. He is a one-armed, born-again Catholic, and was helping me because I was on crutches.” Thionnet said since he has been interim, the church has been through the Connect>1 Evangelism Campaign’s 3151 Challenge, and he preaches a lot about reaching people. Thionnet has a special place in his heart for the Burns Flat church because that is where he was saved as an 8-year-old boy. He grew up in Burns Flat and attended school there. “There are enough people in Burns Flat to make a difference,” he said. “The success we’ve had over the last few months is because everybody is working together.” He said they are in the talking stages of starting a new Sunday School class for young adults, as a result of four young couples who have started attending. “I’m having fun, and it’s exciting to see people taking hold of what we are trying to do,” Thionnet said. Fleming gives credit to Thionnet for encouraging members to be involved with people. “He might be out driving around and stop and talk to someone and pray with them,” she noted. “Brother Carl is approachable. He listens to people, and they are comfortable with him.” The two seem to have a mutual admiration for each other. “Much of what has happened over the last few months is because God has gifted Hazel with a desire to talk to people and tell them about Jesus,” Thionnet said.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Washington Post Nov 10, 2016 at 4:04 pm | Print View Wal-Mart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Wal-Mart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Wal-Mart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Wal-Mart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this year. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Wal-Mart also is aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. Target and Wal-Mart will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that the nation’s retailers will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. Your next Business articles McDonald's tests Big Mac with a Sriracha ...

Welcome Home North Carolina – also known as NCServes – launched as a pilot program last year with the help of an initial $1 million grant from the Walmart Foundation. The foundation is contributing the extra money to expand the program because of its early success, foundation officials announced this week. The program has helped more than 450 service members, veterans and their family members. The latest money will support veterans in the western N.C. Piedmont, the N.C. coast and in San Antonio, Texas, officials said. [RELATED: $1 million gift to launch vet support plan] Welcome Home North Carolina is a three-year initiative guided by the Institute for Veterans and Military Families, a New York-based organization that solves issues facing former service personnel and their families. A national search by the Walmart Foundation revealed Charlotte is ahead of many other communities in its work to coordinate services for veterans, Kathleen McLaughlin, the foundation’s president, said when the program launched last year. She cited the work of Charlotte Bridge Home, a nonprofit created in 2012 to help recently discharged vets return to civilian life, and strong corporate support, particularly from Bank of America.

But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters. walmart black fridayMore (An employee adjusting a large ribbon on a television display at Walmart in preparation for Black Friday in Los Angeles in 2014.REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn) In preparation for this year's demand, the retailer has increased its Black Friday merchandise by 50% on Walmart.com over last year. "I said it before and I will say it again: We will win the season on price — on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday, and every day before and after," Bratspies said. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we're known for in stores, online, and on our app. And, we've secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Here's Walmart's top Black Friday deals that will be available in stores and online on Thanksgiving, according to the company:   11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings).

Woman allegedly tries to grab cop's gun during arrest Sara Nealeigh , Reporter 12:28 a.m. EST November 11, 2016 Zenobia D. Gore (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Ross County Sheriff's Office) 165 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CHILLICOTHE - Amidst an altercation with officers Wednesday, a woman allegedly attempted to grab an officer's gun and is now facing a felony charge. Chillicothe Police reports say the woman, 36-year-old Zenobia D. Gore, was detained in Walmart's loss prevention office during a theft investigation when the incident occurred. Gore was later charged with aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, and theft, a first-degree misdemeanor. The incident began when a Kohl's loss prevention officer alerted Walmart to the possible theft after seeing people open packages of fishing wire and line in the store and place the items in Kohl's bags, according to reports. An officer and detective responded to Walmart at 2:42 p.m. and spoke with loss prevention officials, Gore, and two men about the reported theft. The men, Shawn A. Snow and Stephen V. McComis, allegedly selected three packages of fishing line and two packages of fishing wire from Walmart, concealed them and walked out of the store without paying for the items, the reports said. While Snow and McComis were picking up the fishing items, Gore allegedly grabbed a package of toothpaste and a body spray. Gore was initially detained after she allegedly tried to return the fishing supplies to the Walmart service desk. McComis and Snow were taken into custody as they tried to leave the store after the return. Gore told police the men didn't say the items she returned were stolen, but she "kinda knew" they were and was going to be given money for making the transaction, according to reports. Following the officer's interview with Gore, she became upset and yelled that she didn't want to go back to jail, reports said. She was told to sit on the bench, to which she complied but became more upset. She screamed, grabbed a pack of toothbrushes officials said she attempted to steal from the store, and tried to brush her teeth, according to reports. As the officer struggled with Gore, the detective heard the officer yell "let go of my gun" twice. Once the detective detained Snow, who was also seated on the bench, the detective helped the officer secure Gore. Gore, Snow and McComis were eventually put into police cruisers and taken to the Ross County Jail. While in the cruiser, Gore began hitting her head, according to reports. Pepper spray had little to no effect, but when she was taken out of the cruiser was able to calm down. Chillicothe Fire Department EMS crews were called to treat a laceration. Gore refused to be taken to the hospital and was taken to jail, reports showed. McComis and Snow were both charged with one count of theft, a first-degree misdemeanor. Stephen V.

Walmart sells a variety of Egyptian cotton sheet sets. It used to sell more, but in September, the company pulled two brands' 400 thread count sheet sets off store shelves for possibly containing "non-Egyptian cotton fibers."  The two brands ��������� Better Homes and Gardens and Canopy ��������� had their sheets manufactured by Welspun India. Walmart offered a refund to any customer who had purchased the products. SEE MORE: This Hair Care Company Could Owe Its Customers Millions The class action lawsuit alleges Walmart "questioned the fiber content" of the products as early as 2008 but kept them on the shelves until this year. When Walmart pulled the sheets in 2016, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked the company about its 2008 investigation. A company spokeswoman told the publication, "Welspun was able to show us its supplies of Egyptian cotton were sufficient to meet all of Walmart's orders. At that time, we were reassured." But the woman alleges either Walmart did know about the lower-standard cotton in 2008, or it "did not conduct an adequate investigation or maintain sufficient quality control practices" at the time. The lawsuit claims Walmart only stopped selling the products after its competitor Target found in August that the Welspun-made sheets contained "inferior and less expensive cottons." The woman also accuses Walmart of violating the U.S. Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, because the sheets it sold falsely claimed to be "100% Egyptian cotton." The lawsuit seeks damages for any customers who purchased the linens.

But each year on Black Friday, Apple and its retail partners offer customers with the opportunity to take advantage of some discounts. This year appears to be no different. Many of Apple’s most popular products—including the company’s Macs and iPhones—will be on sale at select locations on Black Friday.

CST November 10, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST For Walmart shoppers, the post-Thanksgiving Black Friday shopping frenzy starts today, Thursday. After midnight, shoppers who have downloaded the Walmart app can grab some Black Friday specials, including a $79 seven-foot trampoline, an Acer laptop for under $300, and a 65-inch Hitachi 4K Ultra HDTV . The offerings are just a hint of what's to come. Most of the discounts will become available at 12:01 a.m. Thanksgiving day, with the in-store "doorbuster" specials kicking off at 6 p.m. that evening. With some shoppers griping about the bait and switch at some retailers that advertise a dea,l but have so few items they’re gone in minutes, Walmart says it will make sure it’s well stocked. The world’s biggest retailer says it will have nearly 2 million tablets and computers, 3 million video games and and over 1.5 million TVs at the ready for purchase in store and online. Though some retail watchers have said that Black Friday is losing some of its luster, with shoppers grabbing deals on Cyber Monday and even Thanksgiving Day, Walmart says that the traditional kick off to the holiday shopping season remains a main event. “I don’t expect to see any kind of decline (on) Black Friday,’’ said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S.  Though shopping via keyboard continues to increase, “traffic continues to grow in the stores while we continue to grow our online business.’’ CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS 4-year-old killed as mom is robbed Search for missing mother from Spring Mother accused of stashing exotic animals Woman accused of punching police horse faces judge HISD trustee's tweet compares Trump to Hitler Cy-Fair ISD teacher charged with sexual assault How Trump's immigration plan impacts Houston Trump gives first interview since winning presidential election More Stories Bishops elect Houston's Cardinal Daniel DiNardo to… Nov 15, 2016, 9:17 a.m. Robbers kill little girl, wound sibling and mom Nov 14, 2016, 9:11 p.m. Family disturbance, shooting kills 1 near Katy Nov 15, 2016, 10:05 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Lawyers for the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company and Liberty Insurance Underwriters asked a judge on Wednesday to enforce subpoenas served on Morgan and his fellow passengers for documents involving the settlement - rumored to be as much as $90 million - according to filings seen exclusively by DailyMail.com. Wal-Mart coughed up the sum after one of its truck drivers crashed into a limousine carrying 30 Rock star Morgan, his assistant, the driver, and comedians Harris Stanton, Ardie Fuqua and James McNair at the New Jersey turnpike in 2014. Scroll down for video  Morgan was spotted driving around New York in his Lamborghini in July 2015. Wal-Mart's hasty settlement has been blasted by its insurers who say the retail giant paid out without conducting proper checks One of Walmart's drivers crashed into Morgan's limousine (pictured in an image released by the NTSB to show the damage), leaving the comedian with a brain injury and fractures The insurers, who are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, believe Morgan's health problems can be disproved. Morgan is pictured in July 2014, one month after the crash McNair died in the crash, while Morgan suffered a broken leg, several broken ribs, and a brain injury. He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab before he could return home. He was also forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold. The star has spoken about how he had to learn how to talk and walk again following the medically induced coma doctors placed him in. But Wal-Mart's hasty settlement has been blasted by its insurers who say the retail giant paid out without conducting proper checks - including that Morgan was spotted walking around New York and driving through the city in his Lamborghini, as well as appearing at the Emmy awards shortly after the settlement. The DailyMail.com previously reported Morgan was refusing to release medical records subpoenaed as part of the legal battle over the Walmart settlement. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next 'Tonight will be magical': Tracy Morgan makes emotional... EXCLUSIVE: Tracy Morgan 'refuses to release medical records... Marijuana could be used to help NFL stars¿ pain: Players¿... Share this article Share The exact settlement figure has not been revealed but in court documents they call it a 'staggering and unprecedented' amount to cover Morgan's injuries and his loss of earning potential, and say they are not equipped with the proper information to pay out the sum. They accuse Wal-Mart of not getting their approval of the amount of settlement paid to Morgan and his friends, and therefore they don't believe they are responsible for the settlement payments. Last month, the insurers wrote a letter to the judge explaining they have an issue due to Tracy Morgan refusing to hand over his medical records to them, which they need to build their case in the legal battle.  In their latest missive they complain that subpoenas for the documents they requested were served over seven months ago and they have received nothing since then.  Comedian Tracy Morgan (pictured left in September) is accused of refusing to hand over medical records and other documents ordered as part of a legal battle over a multi-million dollar crash settlement paid out to him by supermarket Walmart In October Morgan hit the stage to a sold out audience at Dover Downs - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in the fatal traffic accident in 2014 Morgan (center) welcomed fellow comedians, Ardie Fuqua (left) and Harris Stanton (right), on stage with him. Fuqua and Stanton were involved in the fatal accident with Morgan in 2014 Prior to the October show starting, Morgan shared a photo to Instagram, where he is seen kneeling and bowing his head over the empty chair dedicated to McNair  Wal-Mart said they clearly had responsibility for the accident, which is why they did the right thing and settled the claims. They also say they were threatened with numerous legal actions including by the Estate of James McNair, noting that none of the claims against them went to trial because they chose to settle all of them as a 'business decision'.  The supermarket chain accuses their insurers of being 'unnaturally obsessed' with the case, and say they are dragging it out and looking for excuses not to pay the money. Wal-Mart said four of their other insurers paid out on their policies, with the only exception being Ohio Casualty. Ohio Casualty says it wants more information, including all documents related to the settlement between Morgan and Wal-Mart and all medical records following the accident.  They also want all Morgan's federal and state tax returns from 2009-2014, all documents showing his future earning potential, and ll financial documents that relate to his earning for the five years prior to the accident - plus the list of medicines he was prescribed after the crash and any examinations he received afterward, including financial records, bills and invoices related to his mental condition, illnesses and disability. In mid-October Morgan returned to the stage at Dover Downs, where he performed to a packed-out audience - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in the fatal crash. He also shared a photo to Instagram of himself kneeling and bowing his head over an empty audience chair dedicated to McNair.  Morgan's friend,  comic James McNair died in the crash when a tractor-trailer driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper slammed into the back of their limo van (pictured on its side) Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. Pictured is the Walmart truck after the crash But behind the scenes, the insurers are complaining that Morgan's lawyer is saying he has none of the documents they are requesting. The insurance company's attorney is demanding the judge either order them to search their devices again for the documents or they be made available for a deposition where they can be questioned why they have no responsive documents - which they believe is 'impossible'. 'They were provided important documents by Wal-Mart, they provided to Wal-Mart important documents, and Wal-Mart and its attorneys exchanged numerous emails', the insurance company explains in the court filings.  They are also on the hunt for documents related to any request that he appear on Saturday Night Live or The Emmys, as well as any relating to his ability to drive a Lamborghini after the accident 'without creating potential harm to the public'.  The insurers are demanding the judge order Morgan and his attorney to finally hand over the information, or be ordered to take a deposition and explain why there are no records.  Read more: Tracy Morgan 'refuses to release documents subpoenaed as part of legal battle with Walmart' | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 92 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Driving the growth is the ramp up of fast grocery delivery services by Amazon and others and the expansion of curbside pickup by Wal-Mart Stores. Also, tech-savvy consumers have an increased comfort level with buying fresh foods online and see ordering groceries through an app as a way to save time and avoid checkout lines. "Online grocery will take off this holiday season, with consumers buying more turkeys, cranberry sauce and stuffing online than ever, as a result of Wal-Mart, Kroger and others ramping up their e-grocery services," said John Mercer, a senior analyst and research head at Fung Global, a retail and technology think tank. Source: Walmart.com Employee fills online grocery order at Wal-Mart store Indeed, Wal-Mart has expanded the range of items this year so consumers looking to avoid crowds at the grocery store this Thanksgiving can order for curbside pickup not just a turkey and all the fixings but a roasting pan, gravy boat and other food prep items. With a minimum $30 grocery order, the pickup is free and available the same day. The Arkansas-based retailer sells upward of 30,000 food items — including fresh produce, meats, dairy, organic groceries and gluten-free items, among other things. It uses personal shoppers to fulfill the order and currently serves about 600 locations, including some just added within the last several weeks. "We've really expanded our footprint and our offering in a very aggressive way just this past year," said Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. "I would say we are probably one of the fastest-growing online grocers in the U.S., just based on the fact that at the start of the fall last year we were in five markets. Today we're in 100." "We believe that the grocery category is likely to be one of the next key areas of e-commerce growth" -Jessica Schoen Mace, Nomura analyst Online grocery purchases are expected to rise nearly 20 percent this year, according to market researcher Technomic. In contrast, the traditional brick-and-mortar supermarkets are projected to see just 2 percent growth in consumer spending. Analysts say the holidays are particularly important for the online grocery delivery sector because there may be more consumers using it not just for restocking the refrigerator and pantry but for fill-in orders when they forget something from the supermarket and don't have time to run out and get it. As it turns out, online grocery shoppers also spend more on average than regular brick-and-mortar store customers and are more apt to continue shopping in cyberspace after they've experienced the service, according to research group Kantar Worldpanel. "We believe that the grocery category is likely to be one of the next key areas of e-commerce growth," Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said in a research note last month. As of June, only about 1.4 percent of groceries in the roughly $800 billion grocery market were purchased online in the U.S., according to Kantar data. Fung Global expects that number to reach 2 percent or more in 2017. "Consumers are starting to get more exposure to produce that's selected by a third party — and there's more trust," said Erik Thoresen, a principal at Technomic. "I think this will be an important year for us to kind of get a sense of what consumer usage and adoption will be moving forward." Thoresen calls Amazon a "game changer" in terms of knowing what's possible when it comes to buying groceries and getting them delivered the same day. The e-commerce company offers grocery delivery services under several programs, including AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Prime Fresh. While Amazon's grocery delivery services are not available in all markets, the Seattle-based company has been expanding in the past year and its logistics system has enabled it to provide faster delivery of a large number of food items — both packaged and fresh. Also, Amazon lowered its grocery subscription fee last month, a move analysts saw as an attempt to stay competitive with Wal-Mart. "We're very happy with the Amazon Fresh and we have now expanded quite a bit," Amazon.com CFO Brian Olsavsky said last month in discussing the company's third-quarter earnings. Yet there are signs Amazon maybe seeing growing pains with its direct-to-consumer grocery deliveries. For one, AmazonFresh's website cautions, "Due to customer demand, delivery windows may be limited." Amazon did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Besides Amazon, other warehouse-based food delivery services include Peapod, Fresh Direct and MaxDelivery. Also, newer entrants have stiffened competition in the category "We will do nine figures of revenue this year," said Chieh Huang, co-founder and CEO of Boxed.com, a wholesale delivery service selling grocery products and other household items. Just 2 ½ years ago the business was still in Huang's New Jersey garage and now the company operates four fulfillment centers nationally and delivers in all the lower 48 states. At Kroger, the company's ClickList online grocery service is growing and allows consumers at more than 500 locations to select from more than 40,000 items and pick up orders at stores. Last week, the Cincinnati-based supermarket operator told analysts at its investor conference that the ClickList rollout is progressing well Also, Instacart, an app-based retail delivery service, has partnered with Kroger and several other major retailers including Whole Foods, Costco and Target, and this fall began expanding in key U.S. markets. "For the stores, it's a way to maintain their market share," said Patricia Orsini, an analyst at eMarketer. "That's why you're seeing all this growth happening." Target offers Instacart in three markets at present and the retailer also allows customers to select an Order Pickup option for packaged food items, or nonperishables. There's also a cash-back online service known as Shop.com, which has ties to Wal-Mart, Jet.com (recently acquired by Wal-Mart) and others. It gets a commission from retailers starting at 2 percent and sells over a million items, including snacks, beverages and baby foods, as well as other packaged foods and nongrocery products. "We stick to mainly the dry goods area," said Eddie Alberty, vice president of strategic partnerships at Shop.com. "For us it's kind of a walk, crawl and run approach."

"I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price – on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after," said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we’re known for in stores, online and on our app. And, we’ve secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Walmart Black Friday Hours In-store deals start at 6pm local time and, yes, you'll need to get a wristband well ahead of that time to get some of the juiciest doorbusters. However, if leaving your family Thanksgiving to score a cheap TV isn't your cup of tea, the majority of deals will be available online beginning at 12:01am ET on Thanksgiving morning. Walmart said in a Wednesday morning press call there will be 50% more deals on Walmart.com than last year. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz.

Fletes Jesselito Rectín, 45, of Overland, shops at Target in Brentwood on Thursday, Nov. 26, 2015. Photo by Cristina M. Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style.  Electronics retailer Best Buy says most of its store will open at 5 p.m. on the holiday, close at 1 a.m. on Friday, then reopen at 8 a.m. Friday. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy's, Kohl's and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be "dramatically increasing" the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. "We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers," said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.99. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the "10 days of deals" program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy's is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

Walmart’s Black Friday event will offer something for everyone - from $1.96 movies to a $30 Sharper Image Video Drone and a $798 65-inch Samsung HD-TV. Walmart is once again offering a simplified shopping experience for customers. Customers will be able to shop the majority of Walmart’s Black Friday deals early on the Walmart website beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thanksgiving morning. Then, Walmart’s Black Friday event will begin in stores at 6:00 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving Day. The retailer’s Black Friday circular is available starting today through the Walmart app. Walmart Black Friday deals Black Friday is just one day when Walmart is delivering for customers. Following the event, Walmart will kick off a week of savings on Walmart.com which supports the retailer’s broader effort to provide low prices throughout the entire season. “I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price - on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. “That means delivering the Black Friday deals we’re known for in stores, online and on our app. And, we’ve secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available.” Holiday shopping made easy Walmart is ensuring an easy shopping experience on Thanksgiving night. The retailer is also bringing back wristbands and interactive store maps. Walmart will once again offer wristbands for select in-demand items including the Phillips 55-inch Smart 4K TV, the HP 15.6-inch Touch Laptop and the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 so customers know when those items are no longer available. Some stores may begin handing out wristbands prior to when the event begins. Customers who receive a wristband can then shop the store and will need to return within two hours after the event start time to receive their item. As Walmart has done for nearly 30 years, the retailer will be open on Thanksgiving Day. Walmart associates serving customers on Thanksgiving Day this year will receive free dinner during their shifts and a 25 percent discount on an entire basket of goods this holiday season. Walmart’s annual wireless phone event Customers looking to take advantage of Walmart’s annual wireless phone event can make appointments while at the store on Thursday night beginning at 6:00 p.m. Walmart’s wireless offer includes a $250 Walmart gift card and $0 down when qualified customers purchase a Samsung or Apple phone and sign up for an installment plan with AT&T Next or Verizon Device Payment. Phone activations will begin at 9:00 p.m. on Nov. 24. The retailer is also bringing back its popular store maps which were accessed by millions of customers last year. These maps will highlight the locations of hot products like televisions, tablets, drones, toys, small appliances and kids clothing. Maps can be viewed at the Walmart site and on the app starting Nov. 17. Printed copies of the maps will also be available in stores.    Newegg Holiday Shopping    Olympus discount deals    Amazon Black Friday deals    Next  Black Friday Deals at Sam’s Club    Previous  Olympus discount deals on camera bodies and lenses    News by brand:Walmart    News by category:Actions & Discount deals    News by brand and category:Walmart Actions & Discount deals Latest Walmart announcements Walmart Holiday savings and discounts iPhone no-contract plans Walmart Cyber Monday Deals Wal-Mart Online Photo Service   Latest news headlines Leica TL camera system Leica D-Lux Explorer Camera Kit Sevenhugs Smart Remote control T-Mobile 4G LTE network launched at Guantanamo Bay CTA congratulates President-elect Donald Trump Best Buy Black Friday discount deals Connect your car with T-Mobile SyncUP Drive Nikon D5600 Dell Smart Laser printers Black Friday Deals at Sam’s Club Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals Olympus discount deals on camera bodies and lenses Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II body available this year Olympus STF-8 macro twin flash Canon Powershot G5X digital camera wins Award       Accessories Android Apps Camcorders Digital cameras Mobile phones Smartphones Software Tablets   CES CeBIT Gadgets IFA Photokina PMA

Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25, is now only 17 days away. While Black Friday is still the most famous day of the year to complete your holiday shopping, many of the sale events will actually begin on Thanksgiving, with others stating as early as Wednesday of that week. Ads have already leaked from a variety of major retailers, including Kohl’s, JCPenney, Costco, Sam’s Club, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Dell, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Even though those are important stores, shoppers are anxiously awaiting the ad releases for Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. Today’s election means none of those ads will be released today, but the good news is they all should be out by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, and Walmart, Best Buy, and Target should be added to the list within the next few days. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Walmart’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Walmart] Walmart’s ad was released on November 11 last year in the middle of the night. A mistake by Walmart actually caused it to be posted on their Twitter account earlier in the evening, but they officially released it on their app a few hours later. Since they usually wait until Best Buy and Target release their ads, Walmart is most likely targeting Thursday, November 10, or Friday, November 11, for their release date. Unless the ad is somehow leaked early, the best place to see it early is by downloading the official Walmart mobile app, via the Walmart website. Their sale is probably going to begin at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving again this year, with online sales potentially starting as early as the Wednesday before Turkey Day. Walmart is also probably going to bring back their “1-hour guarantee” for select doorbusters. This means that a select few in-store-only doorbusters will have their prices guaranteed from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving. If they sell out before the first hour is complete, you will be able to purchase the item in question at a later date for the Black Friday doorbuster price. Walmart is expected to have an abundance of online doorbusters this year, but their free shipping minimum is not exactly a desirable amount. As CNBC reports, you will have to spend at least $50 in order to receive free shipping. Target and Best Buy are both offering free shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, so it is something to keep in mind when shopping online on Black Friday this year. If you cannot wait until Thanksgiving and Black Friday, Walmart is currently offering a selection of early bird online specials on their website. While some of the offers may be enticing, you are much better off waiting two weeks. Best Buy’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Best Buy’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Best Buy] Best Buy’s ad was released on November 10 last year in the very early morning hours. While it has been leaked by third-party websites in the past, Best Buy has posted it on their website in recent years. It is usually only a preview copy of their ad, as the full print copy is not released until a week or so before Black Friday. Regardless, it will contain the majority of the deals. Based on previous years, Best Buy’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. Rarely has it come after Walmart’s ad, and it usually comes out right after Target releases their ad. While nothing has been confirmed, there have been rumors stating that Best Buy will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. That is the same time they opened last year, so it would not be out of the question. As they did last year, they will most likely offer an assortment of doorbusters on their website. Stores have been moving away from in-store-only sales, and Best Buy has been a willing participant. Additionally, Best Buy should also have a selection of online exclusives, which makes their sale even more intriguing for many shoppers. And finally, Best Buy is offering free shipping with no minimum order size for the duration of the holiday season, as reported by Time Magazine. Target’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Target’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Target] Target’s ad was released on November 8 last year. Rarely does the Target ad leak by a third-party website, as they will post it themselves on their website. In recent years, they have also started an early Black Friday sale on the day they release their ad scan. It usually only contains around 20 to 30 items, but it gives shoppers a taste of what they can expect on Black Friday. Target’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. It usually comes out before Best Buy and Walmart, so expect this one first. As Reuters first reported, Target will offer free shipping on all orders this holiday season. This matches Best Buy and is better than Kohl’s free shipping minimum of $75, Amazon’s free shipping minimum of $49, and Walmart’s free shipping minimum of $50. If you are behind on your Black Friday coverage this year, take a look at a few posts by the Inquisitr in order to get up to speed.

While leaks had been slow this year prior to Tuesday’s election, the past 24 hours have seen ads from Walmart and Target. As expected, Best Buy is never one to let their competitors steal the spotlight. The 49-page Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad can be seen on BestBlackFriday.com. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Best Buy’s Opening Time As they did last year, Best Buy will begin their Black Friday sale at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. This comes an hour earlier than Target and Walmart’s opening time of 6 p.m., and it is among the earlier openings for major retailers. Toys R Us and Macy’s will also open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year. While their retail stores will not open until 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, their online site will be open for business the entire day. The sale will continue throughout the night into Black Friday. If history repeats itself, Best Buy will likely have an assortment of sales on the Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday of Thanksgiving week too. It is unknown what time Best Buy will close on Thanksgiving night, but the ad states that Black Friday doorbusters will begin at 8 a.m., which is the same time as last year. Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Ad Important Information and Review [Image via Best Buy] As seen on the first page, Best Buy is offering an assortment of televisions. The most interesting one may be the Toshiba 49-inch Class LED 2160p 4K Ultra HD TV. It will be on sale for $199.99, which is a discount of $250 from its normal retail price of $449.99. This deal is in-store only, which is somewhat surprising with the trend of retailers offering many of their doorbusters online. Another intriguing deal is the LG 60-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4k Ultra HD TV for $599.99, which is a discount of $400 from its normal retail price of $999.99. This deal is not listed as in-store only, so there is a good chance that you can buy it online. While this will not be the cheapest price for a 60-inch 4K HD TV this year, it does come from a premium brand in LG. Sharp 55-inch Class LED 1080p Smart TV for $249.99 [Image via Best Buy] Best Buy will be selling a Sharp 55-inch Class LED 1080p Smart HD TV for $249.99, which is a savings of $250 from the normal price of $499.99. While this is not a 4K TV, it is still a solid unit. It is also unlikely that another store will beat this price for a 55-inch TV from a premium brand like Sharp. This TV is exclusive to Best Buy and will be available at 8 a.m. on Black Friday. Other Important Deals While these deals may not be as exciting as the ones listed above, they are ones that you should keep your eye on. Samsung 55-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4k Ultra HD TV for $479.99 (save $320) Popular Movies Starting at $7.99 Free $250 Best Buy Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR with Installment Agreement for a Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge Dell Inspiron 15.6″ Touch-Screen Laptop for $349.99 (save $150) Amazon Fire 7″ Tablet for $33.33 (save $16.66) Save $125 on All 9.7-inch iPad Pros Canon EOS Rebel T6 DSLR Camera Bundle with Free 32 GB Memory Card for $449.99 (save $250) Important Best Buy Shipping Information As reported by CNBC, Best Buy will offer free shipping on all orders with no minimum this holiday season, and that includes Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Compared to the competition, this is a great deal. Walmart currently has a free shipping minimum of $50 for online orders. Amazon has a minimum of $49, and Kohl’s will have a minimum of $75. Out of the major stores, only Target will also offer free shipping on all orders with no minimum. While it may not sound like a huge deal, paying shipping charges on Black Friday can kill an otherwise great deal. Since shipping charges at most stores will only be added to small orders, the chances of shipping costs offsetting the discount are extremely high. As usual, Best Buy’s Black Friday 2016 is already looking strong, and it is going to be a top place to purchase you electronics this year.

Like, really seriously. This year is no exception, and looking through Walmart's Black Friday deals right now, you can tell stores are going to go insane on Thanksgiving. Walmart has provided a list of all its biggest discounts already, even though Black Friday is still weeks away. The headline deals include some truly stupid savings on TVs, a couple cool gadgets that would look good under a Christmas tree, and a whole lot more. DON'T MISS: President Trump could be really bad news for T-Mobile Let's start with the TVs. The blockbuster deal here is a 55-inch Philips Smart 4K TV for $298, which is a very small amount of money to pay for something so big and with so many pixels. I actually own the 65-inch version of that same TV, and while the picture isn't anything to write home about, it's still a great TV for watching movies, and the smart features mean easy YouTube and Netflix. But really, for the price, it could call you names every time you turn it on and still be a great deal. There's other TVs that are going to be available, with most of the best deals on lower-end panels. There's a 60-inch Vizio for $398 and a 50-inch 4K Samsung for $398 as well. Video game consoles are also seeing good prices, with the PS4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 bundle set for sale at $249 (and a $30 gift card), and the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249. Those are equal with the best prices we've seen for console bundles. Drones are another category that Walmart is going big on, with the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369, Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99, and Sharper Image Video Drone for $30. More than just the price, though, Walmart execs are promising widespread availability on the best products. Steve Bratspies, the CMO of Walmart, said that "we’ve secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." To help curtail some of the mad rushes through stores we've seen, Walmart will be using wristbands for some of the more in-demand items. Customers can get a wristband for an item from an associate, then go find the thing, and make it to checkout in two hours. Sales will begin online at 12.01AM ET on Thanksgiving morning, with physical stores opening at 6PM local time on Thanksgiving Day. Sales aren't only limited to Black Friday, though. In the runup to the event, Walmart will be offering some exclusive sales through the Walmart app. Good deals include a 65-inch Hitachi 4K TV for $599, and the Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Console with an extra controller for $279. The full list of headline sales is below: · 11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings). Other television offers consist of a Vizio 60-inch HDTV for $398 (special buy), a 40-inch HDTV for $125 (special buy) and 50-inch HDTV for $225 (special buy). · Toys including the toy of the season, Hatchimals, for $48.88, Disney Princess Cinderella Royal Dreams Dollhouse with Furniture for $88 ($61 savings), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RC Mikey for $39 (a Walmart exclusive at a $10 savings) and Razor Hovertrax 2.0 Hoverboard for $273 ($125 savings). · Drones including the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369 ($130 savings), Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99 (a Walmart exclusive at a $49 savings) and Sharper Image Video Drone for $30 (special buy). · Connected Home items such as the Nest 3rd Generation Learning Thermostat for $199 ($50 savings) and Nest Cam for $149 ($50 savings). · Video Game Consoles and Games like the PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle for $249 ($50 savings) plus a $30 gift card and the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249 ($50 savings). Walmart will also offer nearly 90 video games starting at $8. · A $99 iPhone 5s 16GB on Straight Talk Wireless ($50 savings). · 10 Laptops and Tablets including the Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119 (special buy), HP 15.6-inch Touch Laptop for $249 (special buy) and iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 ($70 savings). · More than 750 DVDs and Blu-ray Movies starting at $1.96. Read More · Fitness Wearables including the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129 ($20 savings), Fitbit Alta for $99 ($30 savings) and Fitbit Flex 2 for $69 ($30 savings). · Pajamas and Slippers such as $4.75 Licensed Kids Pajamas and $7 Ladies’ Novelty Character or Emoji Slippers (special buy). · Home and Outdoor Favorites including $9.76 kitchen appliances (special buy), Hotel Style 1,100 Thread Count Sheet Set for $25 (special buy), Hotel Style Down Alternative Comforter for $20 (special buy) and Pioneer Woman 27-piece Porcelain Enamel Nonstick Cookware Set for $89 (special buy).

The 34-page Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad can be seen on BestBlackFriday.com. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. This comes after Target’s 40-page Black Friday ad was posted, as reported by the Inquisitr. Out of the major store ads, only Best Buy, Macy’s, and Toys R Us have not been released, but they should appear online within the next few days. Walmart’s Opening Time As Walmart has done over the past few years, they will start their Black Friday sale this year at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. With the exception of Macy’s, this has been par for the course with major retailers, and stores are reluctant to open earlier. The backlash has been strong against stores opening on Thanksgiving night, and Walmart will not be pushing up their hours this year. Shoppers that cannot wait until 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving can shop on Walmart’s website the entire day. While 12:01 a.m. on Thursday morning is the official start date for their online sale, they actually had a round of doorbusters on Wednesday night last year. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is a strong possibility that Walmart offers at least a few doorbusters on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving this year. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Important Information and Review [Image via Walmart] As seen on the first page, Walmart’s featured television deal is the Philips 55-inch 4K Class Smart TV for $298. The retail price is not listed, so the discount is currently unknown. Regardless, Philips is a solid brand, and the price of $298 is excellent for this television. For comparison purposes, the Target Black Friday 2016 ad, via Savings.com, is offering the Hisense 4K UHD 50″ Smart TV for $249. Hisense is an inferior brand, and Target’s deal is $50 cheaper for five less inches. As seen in the Kohl’s Black Friday 2016 ad, via Savings.com, they are offering the Haier 49-in. 4K Ultra HD TV + $75 Kohl’s Cash for $249.99, which is a discount of $100. The decision should really come down to Walmart and Kohl’s. While Walmart is offering the better television, it is $50 more. Kohl’s is offering a similar television for $50 less, but the brand is questionable. The fact that Kohl’s is also including $75 in Kohl’s Cash could make this the superior offer if you are a frequent Kohl’s shopper. This gives their TV a net price of only $174.99. Sony PS4 Slim Uncharted 500 GB Bundle + $30 Walmart Gift Card for $249 [Image via Walmart] As they often do, Walmart is including a $30 gift card with their featured PS4 Slim deal. While this bundle is available at most other stores for the same price of $249, which is a modest discount of $50, Walmart’s gift card addition makes it a much better deal. Regardless, Kohl’s still has them beat, as they are offering the same bundle for $249.99, but they are also including $75 in Kohl’s Cash. Factoring in the gift cards for each bundle gives the following net purchase prices.

Best Buy and Target are both offering free shipping with no minimum order size this year, but Walmart is holding out. As CNBC reports, you will have to spend at least $50 on Walmart’s website in order to qualify for free shipping this year, which is on the higher end among stores. The other option is to sign up for Walmart’s two-day free shipping program, which is called ShippingPass. Walmart is currently offering a free 30-day trial, but there is an annual fee of $49 after the trial ends. Since this will cover Thanksgiving and Black Friday, it is one option if you are looking to enjoy free shipping at Walmart this year.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack November 10 Follow @sarahhalzack A Black Friday event at a Walmart in Bentonville, Ark. (Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images) Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters.  Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.96.  Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy’s is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

The world's largest retailer said Thursday that its website will kick off its online Black Friday sale three hours earlier than last year, at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Thanksgiving Day. That's hours before its in-store doorbuster deals begin at 6 p.m. that evening. This is just the second year that Wal-Mart has offered the majority of its Black Friday promotions online, as consumers are increasingly dividing their budgets between stores and the web. To help accommodate this elongated shopping window, Wal-Mart has ramped up the amount of merchandise dedicated to filling online orders by 50 percent. Like Wal-Mart, Target is also offering certain Black Friday deals on its website Thanksgiving morning. Online sales across the industry are seen increasing 15.6 percent on Thanksgiving, to $2 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. "Our goal is not to advertise a great price and then not have the product for the customer," said Steve Bratspies, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer. That includes its stores. Wal-Mart will once again offer wristbands for certain popular products, guaranteeing every shopper who receives one will get that item. The retailer will also bring back its store maps, which highlight the location of in-demand products such as TVs and toys. These maps were accessed by millions of shoppers last year, the company said. Wal-Mart's stores stuck with their 6 p.m. start time — the same as Target — because it allows shoppers to scoop up last-minute groceries for Thanksgiving dinner in advance of the sale, Bratspies said. Wal-Mart has been open on Thanksgiving Day for nearly 30 years. The company also reiterated its promise to win on price. Black Friday deals include a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4K TV for $398 (or $230 off), a new shipment of the popular Hatchimals toys and the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129, a discount of $20. And for the first time, Wal-Mart will launch early Black Friday deals on its mobile app starting this Thursday. Wal-Mart's increased focus on the web comes as consumers are expected to allocate an equal amount of their budgets toward online and physical stores for the first time this year. It also follows the company's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, which was completed in September. That deal was meant to jump-start Wal-Mart's digital sales growth, which had been petering off. During the previous holiday season, Target's online sales shot 34 percent higher, while Wal-Mart's increased just 8 percent. Unlike Target, Wal-Mart did not offer free shipping on every digital order. It is sticking to those guns again this year, saying customers can get their orders for free by picking them up in store, or meeting a $50 minimum. Despite Wal-Mart's extra focus on the web, Bratspies reiterated the importance of in-store Black Friday shopping. He pointed to the retailer's recent spate of earnings results, in which online sales and in-store traffic both edged higher. In addition to its online push, the company is dialing up customer service and product demonstrations in its stores this season. "It's still the biggest day in retail," he said. Best Buy will also open on Thanksgiving Day, letting shoppers into its stores at 5 p.m. for the third straight year.

 Walmart is kicking off Black Friday immediately — but there's a catch Hayley Peterson Nov. 10, 2016, 12:01 AM 65,079 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is kicking off its Black Friday deals this week. AP Walmart just kicked off some of its Black Friday deals more than two weeks before the shopping holiday. But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters.

Walmart is joining in on the sale action, with the company offering its trademark discount on TVs — this year, offering several 4K models, along with deals on consoles and computers. Walmart is using a two-pronged strategy for its Black Friday sales this year: a first wave of deals that begins right now and runs until Thanksgiving, and a second set of Black Friday discounts that start on Thanksgiving Day. The big-box retailer is also making a strong online push, with extra inventory being dedicated specifically to Walmart’s website. The online sales begin at 12:01AM on Thanksgiving morning, while those planning to brave stores in person can start taking advantage of the deals on Thursday night at 6PM. Like last year, you’ll need to download Walmart’s app to take advantage of the online deals, which is also where you’ll be able to find the full list of discounts.

Business leaders at the event, hosted jointly by CDP and the We Mean Business coalition in partnership with the UN Global Compact and CGEM, agreed that with the Paris Agreement now in force, the priority was to move from adoption to speedy implementation. They also set out seven specific areas in which government action would help them. Business has a significant role to play in enabling the global economy to achieve – and exceed – its climate goals. As a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, the private sector is a crucial partner in securing a prosperous and sustainable low-carbon economy for all. Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group, which brings together 24 leading European businesses employing 2 million people worldwide, said: “With the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the world now has a legal mandate to bring about a zero carbon future. This is a fantastic business opportunity. What is now required from corporate leaders is a real step change in the way they deal with climate change. They must move from an incremental, compliance approach to a transformational   approach, the only one that can deliver a sustainable, prosperous world.” More companies are committed to leadership on climate action than at any time in history. But, there is more to be done to fully realize the global business potential to contribute to putting the world on track towards the Paris goal of limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. A recent report by CDP in partnership with We Mean Business revealed that the large majority of companies already have targets in place to reduce their carbon emissions, but that current business plans fall short of what is needed for business to deliver on the world’s new low-carbon goals. Frances Way, Co-chief operating officer, CDP, said:  “The race is on for global corporations to seize the opportunities presented by the sustainable transition. While the majority of companies are out of the starting blocks and on the low-carbon path, clear policy intervention is needed to spur even greater ambition and help drive business over the below-2˚C finish-line.”  Businesses are Committed to Ambitious Action on Climate Change The private sector is ready to partner with governments across the globe to deliver emissions reductions at scale. The number of companies making climate commitments through the We Mean Business coalition has more than doubled since COP21. In total 471 companies with over $8 trillion in market capitalization have undertaken well over a thousand ambitious commitments to climate action. These companies represent every sector and geography globally. Businesses Already Implementing Their Commitments The Science Based Targets initiative continues to see tremendous momentum since Paris, representing the clearest path for companies to support the Paris agreement. To date, almost 200 companies have joined the initiative, and in the past year, growth has been at a rate of over 2 new companies per week. Walmart, the largest company by revenue and the largest private-sector employer in the world announced its science-based target on the same day as the Paris Agreement came into force. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart said: "Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company's energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off US roads and highways for a year”. 70 companies across 20 sectors from nearly 30 countries have aligned with the Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing, a set of ambitious standards to help companies set, advocate and report on a price on carbon, developed by the UNGC together with UNEP, the UNFCCC secretariat and Caring for Climate partners – CDP, Principles for Responsible Investment, The Climate Group and UN Foundation. To promote business resilience to climate change, the UN Global Compact made a call for companies to commit to responsible corporate adaptation in June 2016. Adapting to climate impacts offers many benefits to the private sector, such as improving operations and competitiveness, leveraging new business opportunities, building corporate reputation and protecting value chains. To date nearly 10 companies have committed to promote business resilience to climate change. Business has Seven Specific Asks of Governments at COP22 To fully realize the private sector’s potential to deliver emissions reductions at scale, corporate action needs to be reinforced by sound national climate policies.  Many companies have committed to take action that supports the delivery of the Paris Agreement, moving further and faster than their government’s require. Their contribution will be vital to the delivery of the Paris goals. To fully realize the private sector’s potential to deliver emissions reductions at scale, corporate action will need to be reinforced by sound national climate policies.  In support of climate action and to harness their full potential, business leaders look to governments to: Scale up enabling policies through the Global Climate Action Agenda and the Technical Examination Process on mitigation to drive pre- 2020 mitigation ambition Fully implement NDCs through domestic legislation and regulation to incentivize an immediate response from the private sector to the ambition of the Paris Agreement Drive towards net zero emissions by communicating long-term low GHG development strategies Connect non-state action to an increase in ambition with every 5-year NDC cycle, starting in 2018 Mobilize climate finance at scale from public and private sources. Enact meaningful pricing of carbon Build climate-resilient economies and communities About the Global Climate Action Agenda France and Morocco's global climate champions have set out their detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. The action agenda is an important support and catalyst to the early and effective implementation of the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement. Message from the climate champions Hakima El Haite and Laurence Tubiana “A year after COP 21, the great dynamic of climate action is now growing strong. As we all gather to Marrakech time has come to start to take stock of what has been achieved during the last year. To be consistent with the long-term goals, all actors will have to work together, not only to achieve the national targets of the national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions), but also to go further and bridge the gap of emissions. This sense of urgency should guide us all in accelerating immediate efforts and delivering ambitious action. We must identify what concrete policy options and what tools we will have to mobilize in the short term. The science is clear: the path towards achieving the long-term goals should bring us to peaking greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. This is a challenge, and we are not there yet. On the current trends, we will be in 2030 between 11 to 14 GT above Paris-compatible pathways. The purpose of these events is to strengthen all efforts and take them to the next level to stay on track for the objectives: stay well below 2°C and if possible 1,5°C, increase adaptation and resilience capacities and reorient financial flows. It is our responsibility, as champions, to make the link between the real world and the COP process. Political leaders from all around the world should hear and be inspired by the solutions at our reach.” Hakima El Haité, Morocco, and Laurence Tubiana, France, are High-level Climate Champions Notes for editors About We Mean Business We Mean Business is a coalition of organizations working with thousands of the world’s most influential businesses and investors. These businesses recognize that the transition to a low carbon economy is the only way to secure sustainable economic growth and prosperity for all.

KNOXVILLE (WATE) – Every year the Tennessee Volunteers compete against the Kentucky Wildcats at Neyland Stadium to see who can donate the most blood to their local blood center. This year the competition begins November 14, the same day MEDIC Regional Blood Center said they will begin testing all donation for Zika. This the 29th year fans of the Vols and Cats have compted to see who can donate the most blood. For the past several years, The Vols fans lost to Kentucky, but this year MEDIC Regional Blood Center said they hope fans can turn the competition around. This year, the blood center is offering a t-shirt, coupon for a free pizza from Papa John’s, free Chick-fil-a sandiwch, free Wendy’s Frosty, free appetizer from Texas Roadhouse and free admission to Fantasy of trees for all donors. Since February, U.S. blood centers have been turning away people who have recently traveled to areas with Zika outbreaks, under a previous FDA directive. In August the FDA expanded their screening, asking all blood donation centers to start screening for Zika, a major expansion intended to protect the nation’s blood supply from the mosquito-borne virus.

The electronics department has also been updated and a remodeled pharmacy.  The Vestavia remodel includes a new produce section, hot meals and adding fresh donuts to the bakery offerings.  Both stores, after renovations, are now eligible for Walmart Pickup. The program is already available at four area Walmarts. The program works by visiting walmart.com/grocery or the Walmart Grocery app, selecting a store that has the program and building a shopping list. Then, customers choose a time to pick up their groceries. Workers shop the list, and customers pull up to reserved parking spaces and call a number to alert workers. An employee comes out and loads the groceries into a customer's car.  "We are looking forward to re-introducing our store to the community with expanded offerings and a fresh look," Vestavia assistant store manager Julie McCall said in a press release.

"The one-of-a-kind Patti LaBelle's talents in the kitchen are right up there with her talents on-stage," said Food Network and Cooking Channel’s SVP of programming Didi O'Hearn, said. "The happiness Patti gets from sharing her favorite dishes with her guests is a joy to watch." Walmart’s Patti LaBelle Sweet Potato Pie has us singing too That happiness is probably best immortalized in a 2015 viral video from Los Angeles-based singer James Wright Chanel. After picking up a handful of LaBelle’s Sweet Potato Pies from Walmart, Wright Chanel posted a video review where he belted his way to over five million views—while also chowing down on the sweet pie. Texas Walmart to open restaurant with deep-fried State Fair food The video catapulted the seasonal selection into the national spotlight with many Walmarts selling out of the pies ahead of Thanksgiving last year. LaBelle has since released two new cakes with the discount retailer. On her new show LaBelle will make Southern staples like fried chicken, braised brisket, greens and peach cobbler. She’ll also be whipping up some vegan dishes. “Patti LaBelle’s Place” debuts Dec. 3 with two back-to-back episodes.

L'ville's urban grocers falling like dominoes Jere Downs , @JereDowns 3:18 p.m. EST November 13, 2016 Grocery chains requiring higher household incomes and bigger stores to thrive are dwindling in the city's older, poorer neighborhoods Buy Photo (L-R) Trisha Acree and Thomas Dimartile purchase items from cashier Brandi Tyler at the Shively Kroger on 7th Street Road. The store will be closing soon. Nov. 9, 2016 (Photo: Sam Upshaw Jr./CJ)Buy Photo If you live inside the Watterson Expressway, prepare to drive farther for your groceries. Kroger closes its Shively store by month's end. Wal-Mart just abandoned plans for a super store on Broadway at 18th. The First Link grocery shut down last April in Phoenix Hill, and Old Louisville's Kroger on Second Street remains up for sale. While food deserts in the city's poorer neighborhoods expand, sales figures from the Shively Kroger reveal its fate. The Shively Kroger, across from the Krispy Kreme on Seventh Street, averaged about $7 in sales per square foot from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3, according to a Courier-Journal analysis of the weekly "Sales Recap" displayed on a public billboard adjacent to the store deli. That performance falls far below an industry standard of $8.50 per square foot that analysts say is required for grocery stores to survive. "I can see why they are closing. $8.50 is teetering on the edge of what is acceptable," supermarket analyst Ed Smith said of the Shively Kroger, which opened in 1962. "The bottom end would be $8." Two miles west on Dixie Highway, the brand new 124,000 square foot Kroger Marketplace is already drawing customers from inside the Watterson Expressway, Kroger spokesman Tim McGurk said. Data from store loyalty card purchases show 70 percent of Shively Kroger customers already shop at Kroger stores nearby, he added. At a mere 53,000 square feet, the Shively store "is losing too much money to keep open," McGurk said Monday upon announcing the upcoming closure Nov. 29. "It's not sustainable." ►READ MORE:  Trump's Ky victory a drubbing: What to know Driving traffic further down Dixie, outside the city's inner ring, to support the new Kroger Marketplace is a common strategy for mass retailers relying on high volumes to compete on razor-thin profit margins.  At the Marketplace store, sales of higher-profit items like furniture, housewares and clothing help support the bottom line, said Smith, a veteran supermarket analyst based in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Kroger is headquartered. Metro Louisville councilwoman Mary Woolridge picks up her prescriptions at the Shively Kroger, which hosted 15,000 shoppers during five days according to the store's sales figures. Sales data shows that customer mix runs heavy on people who need their medicine. Prescriptions accounted for 21 percent of $373,000 in sales at the Shively Kroger during Sunday through Thursday time period at the start of November. In this urban South End neighborhood, categories like flowers, deli foods and "Natural Foods" are luxuries, with each accounting for less than one half of one percent of sales. "It seems like this is happening more and more," Woolridge said of the store closure in her council district. "For people who don't have transportation, I wonder how that is going to work out. I am sad and disappointed to hear this news." Kroger associate Joyce Banks assisted Caroline Darden during a purchase at the Shively Kroger November 7, 2016.  (Photo: Jere Downs) Transportation is a challenge for disabled nurse Caroline Darden, who offered $31 in food stamps at the Shively Kroger on Monday to pay for bread, frozen meals and produce while shelling out $20 in cash for cat food and kitty litter. "I've been shopping here for 12 years," said Darden, adding she does not own a car. "The new Kroger Marketplace is nice, but I don't know how I will get there." If per capita income figures are any predictor, Louisville's poorest and working class neighborhoods won't be able to attract new grocers anytime soon, analysts said. As these smaller, older groceries in Louisville's urban core fall away, any neighborhoods hosting average median household incomes of $50,000 or less are unlikely to attract a new grocery, said supermarket analyst David J. Livingston. "You follow the money in the grocery business, that's been a trend for a long time," Livingston, a supermarket analyst since 1982, said from his base in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. "Kroger and Meijer are all migrating to the outer ring of cities.  Wal-Mart is always on the outer ring, while Aldi always goes where Wal-Mart is." A map of Louisville neighborhoods downtown, as well as those south and west of Interstate 65 show median household incomes mostly average $40,000 or less. In the neighborhood of Shively Park, for example, across from the soon-to-be-closed Kroger at Crums Lane and Seventh Street, median household incomes average $33,590. In St. Matthews, where a Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme, Rainbow Blossom and Trader Joe's compete for shoppers along Shelbyville Road, median household incomes range between $65,000 and $92,311, according to 2013 Census data. After the 73-year-old First Link supermarket closed at 431 E. Liberty St. east of downtown, there was talk a liquor store chain was eyeing the property. That prompted the Louisville Housing Authority to purchase the property last month for $3 million, to avoid damaging a neighborhood anchored by the Dosker Manor public housing complex across the street and the mixed use Liberty Green development to the west, made up of public housing and market rate apartments, Housing Authority director Tim Barry said. "We needed to protect the investment we already have," Barry said of the purchase financed with $2.7 million in federal funds and $300,000 from Metro Government. There are no plans for the property yet, he added. The Kroger in Old Louisville remains up for sale, a 26,000 square foot store at Breckinridge and Second streets frequented by college students, senior citizens and neighborhood families. From Broadway south to the University of Louisville, that Kroger occupies a census tract where the household median income runs $15,000 a year. The Old Louisville Kroger also operates at a loss, McGurk said. The store's lease expires at year's end. Kroger has an option to extend the lease through 2017, according to the real estate listing by CBRE broker Scott Gilmore.  Asked about prospects for a sale, Gilmore declined to comment on Tuesday. Losing the Old Louisville Kroger, Metro councilman David James said, "would be devastating. Old Louisville is the highest concentration of senior citizen living communities anywhere in the city." Alarmed at continuing public health impacts suffered by lower income residents without access to fresh produce, some Louisville activists have begun to organize a Louisville Food Co-op, a community grocery store model supported by members who volunteer. The second public meeting to gauge resident interest takes place Nov. 14 at Meyzeek Middle School at 6 p.m. So far, the concept has attracted 268 members to a group Facebook page and committees have been formed to study the need for capital and land acquisition. Lower incomes in the city and the trend of Kroger's recent investments, including a new Holiday Manor store in the East End and a Kroger Marketplace being constructed on the outskirts of New Albany, Ind., "make the co-op's work just that much more important," Co-op steering committee member Cassia Herron said. "I don't think anyone is paying much attention to this trend," Herron said. "We know that health equity is everything. But in terms of people following the trend and digging deep, I don't see anyone trying to attract something that alleviates the food deserts." By 2018, look for the new 30-story Omni Hotel to open downtown at Liberty and Third streets, where the city struck a deal with developers to include an "urban marketplace," said Jeff Mosley, deputy chief of Louisville Forward, the city's economic development arm. The identity of that grocery has not been announced, project spokeswoman Kerri Richardson said Tuesday. "There is going to be a grocery in that complex. Omni has committed to doing it," Mosley said of 20,000 square feet set aside for a specific purpose described in the agreement: "It will be a high quality, full-service grocery store selling prepared and unprepared food, other consumables and grocery items."

Tom Jewell/Special to cleveland.com  SOLON, Ohio -- After several years in the making, the Fountains of Solon rezoning proposal appeared to be on its way to a double-edged defeat at the polls by early Wednesday. With the initiative petition for rezoning 22 acres of land off Solon Road and Erico Drive requiring passage not only citywide but in "Home Ward Four" as well, an official precinct breakdown was not available at press time. But unofficial Cuyahoga County Board of Elections results showed the measure losing citywide by a 70-30 margin, with 8,606 against over 3,704 in favor. "As I digest the results, I want to thank the residents of Solon and our city officials for their support," landowner and prospective developer Nathan Lancry said late Tuesday. Lancry added that he would reserve further comment for a later date, but said an earlier statement by a spokeswoman that he would consider selling the land if it was not rezoned "multi-family residential" was incorrect and made without consulting him. The final campaign push by Lancry and his development team, seeking to build a 186-unit luxury apartment complex on land that is currently zoned commercial, truly had opponents up in arms. One of them, Don Gallo, arrived at Solon City Council on the eve of the election with what he called an "outrageous flier" urging voters to "Stop Walmart," as well as other uses that might be deemed permissible in a commercially-zoned district -- at least in other cities. It may never be known how many people actually voted to "stop Walmart," or for a ballot issue that earlier billed itself as not being a tax. "Your constituents have no idea how they're being hoodwinked," Gallo told council Monday (Nov. 7), arguing that the property is still too small for a Walmart, which already has a superstore in nearby Bainbridge Township. City officials have recommended office space on the land purchased by Lancry and his investment team for $2.35 million from University Hospitals in late 2014 -- after approaching the city prior to that with a high-end apartment concept. The spokeswoman for Lancry said Oct. 30 that Walmart was a purely "hypothetical" scenario, as were dollar stores, fast food franchises and check-cashing operations -- the last of which Solon does not permit by code. "Lancry and his cohorts have been trying to bully Solon voters into approving their zoning initiatives through a series of lies and devious statements like these," Gallo told council, accusing city officials of not taking a strong enough stand on the issue. While some council members took the advice of Law Director Tom Lobe to refrain from speaking out against the proposal, Ward Four Councilman Marc Kotora has been a vocal opponent from the outset. Kotora said Monday that he had been receiving a "plethora of phone calls" from concerned residents, adding that "this issue is not about Walmart." Marilyn Matia also chastised city officials for what she felt was a "lack of vision" on their part, although none have ever endorsed the project. Mark Haas, treasurer for the Issue 98 opposition group Citizens Against Rezoning Solon -- CARS -- spent much of Tuesday out at the polls, visiting three of Solon's seven precincts. "Their whole campaign has been based on misinformation," Haas said. Haas did point to the earlier "Vote Yes on Issue 98" signs that declared the initiative was "Not a Tax," adding "that may be one of the few things they said that was accurate." Another city issue appeared to be on its way to renewal Tuesday, this one involving Solon safety forces, a continued half-mill in the form of Solon Issue 97, which won 66 percent to 34 percent. The city also had a number of other zoning issues on Tuesday's ballot which were still being tabulated at press time. Final election results for all races and issues are available by visiting cleveland.com/election-results.

Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25, is now only 17 days away. While Black Friday is still the most famous day of the year to complete your holiday shopping, many of the sale events will actually begin on Thanksgiving, with others stating as early as Wednesday of that week. Ads have already leaked from a variety of major retailers, including Kohl’s, JCPenney, Costco, Sam’s Club, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Dell, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Even though those are important stores, shoppers are anxiously awaiting the ad releases for Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. Today’s election means none of those ads will be released today, but the good news is they all should be out by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, and Walmart, Best Buy, and Target should be added to the list within the next few days. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Walmart’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Walmart] Walmart’s ad was released on November 11 last year in the middle of the night. A mistake by Walmart actually caused it to be posted on their Twitter account earlier in the evening, but they officially released it on their app a few hours later. Since they usually wait until Best Buy and Target release their ads, Walmart is most likely targeting Thursday, November 10, or Friday, November 11, for their release date. Unless the ad is somehow leaked early, the best place to see it early is by downloading the official Walmart mobile app, via the Walmart website. Their sale is probably going to begin at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving again this year, with online sales potentially starting as early as the Wednesday before Turkey Day. Walmart is also probably going to bring back their “1-hour guarantee” for select doorbusters. This means that a select few in-store-only doorbusters will have their prices guaranteed from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving. If they sell out before the first hour is complete, you will be able to purchase the item in question at a later date for the Black Friday doorbuster price. Walmart is expected to have an abundance of online doorbusters this year, but their free shipping minimum is not exactly a desirable amount. As CNBC reports, you will have to spend at least $50 in order to receive free shipping. Target and Best Buy are both offering free shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, so it is something to keep in mind when shopping online on Black Friday this year. If you cannot wait until Thanksgiving and Black Friday, Walmart is currently offering a selection of early bird online specials on their website. While some of the offers may be enticing, you are much better off waiting two weeks. Best Buy’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Best Buy’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Best Buy] Best Buy’s ad was released on November 10 last year in the very early morning hours. While it has been leaked by third-party websites in the past, Best Buy has posted it on their website in recent years. It is usually only a preview copy of their ad, as the full print copy is not released until a week or so before Black Friday. Regardless, it will contain the majority of the deals. Based on previous years, Best Buy’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. Rarely has it come after Walmart’s ad, and it usually comes out right after Target releases their ad. While nothing has been confirmed, there have been rumors stating that Best Buy will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. That is the same time they opened last year, so it would not be out of the question. As they did last year, they will most likely offer an assortment of doorbusters on their website. Stores have been moving away from in-store-only sales, and Best Buy has been a willing participant. Additionally, Best Buy should also have a selection of online exclusives, which makes their sale even more intriguing for many shoppers. And finally, Best Buy is offering free shipping with no minimum order size for the duration of the holiday season, as reported by Time Magazine. Target’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Target’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Target] Target’s ad was released on November 8 last year. Rarely does the Target ad leak by a third-party website, as they will post it themselves on their website. In recent years, they have also started an early Black Friday sale on the day they release their ad scan. It usually only contains around 20 to 30 items, but it gives shoppers a taste of what they can expect on Black Friday. Target’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. It usually comes out before Best Buy and Walmart, so expect this one first. As Reuters first reported, Target will offer free shipping on all orders this holiday season. This matches Best Buy and is better than Kohl’s free shipping minimum of $75, Amazon’s free shipping minimum of $49, and Walmart’s free shipping minimum of $50. If you are behind on your Black Friday coverage this year, take a look at a few posts by the Inquisitr in order to get up to speed.

Published Nov 8th, 2016 4:40 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon recently laid out his vision to Millennials for the retailer’s effort to create a “new era of trust and transparency” for customers. McMillon spoke to 2,500 Millennials at the Net Impact Conference in Philadelphia on Friday (Nov. 4). In a 37-minute speech McMillon shared new environmental sustainability commitments in the retailer’s expanded agenda which began more than 10 years ago on the heels of Hurricane Katrina. He said Wal-Mart’s mission to be a more sustainable company is part of every aspect of the business and tied to the retailer’s mission of saving money so people can live better. The three main aspirational goals Wal-Mart set for itself in 2005 have not changed, and McMillon did provide an update on the progress since 2005. • Create zero waste in operation 75% of waste was being diverted from landfills last year in key markets. • Pledge to be operate with 100% renewable energy It’s now 25% of operations. • Pledge to sell products that sustain resources and environment 35 million metric tons of greenhouse gases have been removed from the supply chain. BENCHMARK GOALS EXPANDED McMillon said the progress is notable, but he extended the commitment. He said by 2025, Wal-Mart aims to achieve zero waste in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. Across the supply chain the retailer will work with suppliers on packaging and product design. Downstream, McMillon said the retailer also will work on “recycling concerns pursuing a more circular economy.” “As it relates to energy, by 2025 we are going to achieve 50% of operations (powered by renewable sources),” he said. McMillon also unveiled a new initiative to become the first retailer with approved science-based targets designed to achieve emissions reduction in its operations and the supply chain. That plan calls for Wal-Mart to reduce its own emissions by 18% no later than 2025. McMillon said Wal-Mart will work with its suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. An area McMillon said is exciting is finding ways to bring more sustainable products to customers at entry level prices that “even a student working their MBA can afford,” he said. McMillon displayed a cotton t-shirt that will sell for $3.88 beginning in February. He said this relates to new transparency and quality rules the retailer has set for itself for low costs. “Our apparel team set out to create a more sustainable garment but to do it at an opening price point, the lowest price point we have in a category … and they engineered a shirt,” McMillon said. He said 30% of the water used to make it is recycled, half of the energy used is from renewable sources, and the cotton is traceable back to the Mississippi Delta. “If we can do things like this in opening prices points we can do it in lots of areas,” McMillon said. OTHER GOALS He said the retailer also plans to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020 in key commodity areas like private label pulp and palm oil and also work on Brazilian soy and beef. “We need our forests and I don’t have to make that case with you,” McMillon told the Millennial audience. He also said Wal-Mart aims to become the world’s most affordable retailer of safe and healthier foods by 2025. Walmart U.S. will double the amount of sales of locally grown produce by 2025, and will reduce food additives and artificial colors and preservatives in its private label offerings. McMillon said its private label suppliers of pasta sauces, soups and salad dressing will be the first place Wal-Mart will begin in removing food additives. Wal-Mart will also reduce sodium and added sugars and fats in private labels foods and work with branded product suppliers to do the same. “Our private brand items in foods, consumable and health and wellness will have 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. We will start with our U.S. private brands,” McMillon said. McMillon said customers want to know more about the products they are buying and it’s Wal-Mart’s job to make that happen. He said as the e-commerce business continues to grow he has often wondered about the sustainability of sending boxes of just one item ordered online. He lauded Jet.com’s transparency pricing approach as online shoppers fill their carts and select the shipping option they want. “The transparent pricing approach combined with the outcome of a basket-driven business rather than an each-business is more sustainable. The more you buy, the less we charge, saving you money by shipping more than one item at a time. As we grow e-commerce we want to do the very best job we can not only in packaging and shipping, but the way we interact with customers to drive sustainability,” McMillon said. “We want to make e-commerce more sustainable as we scale it.” CRITICS WANT MORE Not everyone is impressed with Wal-Mart’s sustainability program. A 120-page report released in June 2015 by the Food Chain Workers Alliance looked at a number of specific foods suppliers to Wal-Mart and their unsustainable practices. Bananas, the top selling item at Walmart U.S. stores. was on the list. (Link here for a PDF of the report.) The “Walmart at the Crossroads” report said the the retail giant’s sustainability efforts were more akin to a public relations play than a program to improve food supply chain conditions. While the Report did applaud the more recent efforts Wal-Mart has made to raise employee wages, it also said demanding rock-bottom pricing from suppliers pushes pressure down the supply chain to manufacturing workers and farmers. The report said top banana suppliers have had a checkered past in terms of labor and environmental issues. Chiquita and Dole were linked to a military coup in Honduras in 2009 and Chiquita pled guilty to doing business with a Colombian terrorist organization. The report notes: “Walmart must insist that Chiquita meet its code of conduct and engage in fair treatment of its workers and not interfere in local political arenas.” Wal-Mart responded to the critics’ claims with this following statement to Talk Business & Politics: “We care about the men and women in our supply chain, and Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers lists our social and environmental expectations for our suppliers, specifically addressing working conditions, voluntary labor, pay, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association. Expecting our suppliers to uphold these Standards and local laws is one way we can be a more responsible company and make a positive difference for the global supply chain.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 18shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

USPS, FedEx, UPS Open November 11? BuzzWorthy 21 0 0 November 10, 2016 Veterans Day Post Office Hours: Is There Mail Delivery Friday? USPS, FedEx, UPS Open November 11? Cheryl P Is the post office open on Veterans Day and will USPS, UPS, and FedEx deliver mail and packages on Friday, or is everything closed on November 11? Although many retail stores, including Walmart and Target — and even a few banks — will be open on the federal holiday, there always seems to be a bit of confusion over whether the U.S. Post Office and other package delivery companies will be open for business. Veterans Day is one of 10 federal holidays in the United States and is always observed on November 11, and this year, it falls on a Friday, which means many federal employees have a three-day weekend to look forward to. If you need to mail a letter or are waiting for a package to arrive, here’s the scoop on what to expect when it comes to Veterans Day mail and package deliveries from U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS. This #VeteransDay honor veterans and military members with #ServiceCrossStamps! https://t.co/8gkzWpWfij pic.twitter.com/9NjCqMLJS4 — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) November 10, 2016 According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, most federal employees work on a Monday through Friday schedule. That means if the holiday falls on a weekday, most non-essential government personnel will get the day off, including the majority of postal workers and the person who delivers your mail. The U.S. Postal Service will be closed on Friday, November 11, in observance of Veterans Day, and that means all post office branches will be closed. Mail won’t be delivered to businesses and residences on Friday but will resume on Saturday, November 12. Check with your local USPS branch office for Saturday hours if you need to check your post office box or mail a package. Of course, you can always drop your mail or small package in a blue drop box found in various locations across the nation (use the USPS collection box finder here), but it won’t be on its way to its destination right away. According to the USPS, postal workers assigned to work on federal holidays may empty collection boxes “to avoid overflow conditions,” but mail won’t be processed through the postal system until the next business day. Of note, the U.S. Postal Service delivers many packages to Amazon customers, and users posting on this thread of the Amazon forum state that some customers have received packages via the USPS on both Sundays and federal holidays, but it’s best to check with Amazon to find out when your package is due to be delivered. What about the United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx)? Will these package delivery companies be out and about on Veterans Day? Glad UPSers and @RepPeteKing could be a part of @PVA1946's #OperationRampitUpforVeterans — helping veteran Jerry Gorski. @UPS_Foundation pic.twitter.com/j7agRxBmkX — UPS Public Affairs (@UPSPolicy) November 7, 2016 Both UPS and FedEx shut down on many federal holidays, but Veterans Day isn’t one of them. You’ll see white FedEx trucks and those familiar brown UPS trucks out and about on Friday, November 11 — drivers will be delivering package according to the normal weekday delivery schedule. According to Federal Express, the company provides normal pickup and delivery service on four federal holidays: Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Presidents Day, and Columbus Day. Most FedEx offices will be open on these holidays as well. United Parcel Service operates on a similar schedule and, according to the UPS holiday calendar, all packages will be delivered according to schedule on Friday, November 11. Most UPS stores will be open for business if you need to pick up a package that is on hold or ship one out. The next holiday observed by the U.S. Postal Service is Thanksgiving, November 24. FedEx and UPS will also be closed on the holiday. There is no doubt that postal employees and those who work for FedEx and UPS will be resting up that day ahead of what will be yet another busy package delivery season. #TreesForTroops is our way to say thank you to those serving our country. Retweet this post, and we’ll add this message onto a tree. ???? pic.twitter.com/6NwQ3065Dc — FedEx (@FedEx) November 7, 2016 If you plan on shipping out gifts and/or Christmas cards this year, the USPS has already posted its shipping cutoff dates for the 2016 holiday season: Domestic first-class mail (cards and letters) needs to be postmarked by December 20 to guarantee Christmas delivery, and the cutoff date for packages shipped within the United States via Priority Mail is December 21. According to UPS, the last day to ship 2nd Day Air packages to be delivered before Christmas Day is December 21. As far as FedEx goes, Packages that are shipped First Overnight, Priority Overnight, or FedEx 2Day will be delivered on Christmas Eve, December 24, but the deadline to ship your package out varies by zip code.

Thanksgiving Hours 2016 Here is when some of the best deals will begin Nov 10, 2016, 1:41 pm EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has announced its Thanksgiving hours for 2016. Source: Flickr The retail giant announced a slate of deals on this year’s upcoming Black Friday sale, along with the hours in which it will be open this Thanksgiving. Turkey Day seems to be pushed more and more into the background as a larger number of stores deem it OK to open up its doors on the most important holiday in the U.S. Starting early in the day — at 12:01 a.m. — on Thanksgiving morning, Black Friday deals will be available on Walmart.com. Stores will be available throughout the day, but the deals won’t be in effect until 6:00 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving Day. “I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price – on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. Specifying what he meant by that, Bratspies said that the company is known for its deals in stores, online and on its app. The availability of more items and the low prices that come along with them are two of the moves that will ensure the company performs well this year. Check out some Black Friday deals offered by Walmart, including a very affordable 4K TV. WMT shares surged 1% Thursday. Thanksgiving is only two weeks away now.

(Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse.) Print Email Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com By Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 10, 2016 at 11:30 AM comments Several major Black Friday shopping destinations have revealed their plans in the last 24 hours and it's no surprise they include Thanksgiving openings. Sears, Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart will be open on the holiday again this year with plenty of deals available for bargain hunters. Best Buy will open at 5 p.m., while Target and Sears will follow at 6 p.m. Wal-Mart is taking a page from Amazon's playbook and kicking things off early. Shoppers can get some deals starting today through the company's app, according to USA Today. Most of the chain's stores have been open 24 hours on Thanksgiving itself for years. This year, in-store deals will start at 6 p.m. on the holiday. Online sales start at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving. All four retailers had the same in-store hours in 2015. Although a handful of retailers have backed off from Thanksgiving hours in the last year or two, most of the big names are sticking with the holiday strategy. Experts say that as Amazon has pushed promotions earlier in the month, brick-and-mortar retailers feel pressure to keep pace. The effect has been to transform Black Friday significantly. Although it's still a big day for in-person shopping, deals and sales are now spread throughout the entire holiday weekend and season.

The first incident occurred shortly after 2 a.m. when police responded to a report of a man hitting and kicking vehicles on New South Street. The caller told police that she saw the suspect stand on the hood of her vehicle and kick the windshield, cracking it, Capt. John Cartledge said. The suspect, Daniel Cashman, 38, of 145 South St., told responding police that he was upset over the way the polls in the presidential elections where shaping up. Cashman was arrested and charged with malicious damage to a vehicle. The second incident occurred shortly before 7:15 a.m. when police received a report of a customer assaulting another inside the Walmart on North King Street. The alleged victim told police he was assaulted by a man who had been standing in one of the aisles. When the victim asked the suspect if he was going to move, he did so, but then hit the victim in the back of the head and he "saw stars, Cartledge said. The suspect, who had been crying, told a store employee that he was distraught over Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. "How do I explain to my daughter that we have a sexist bully as our president?" the man said, according to the police report. William G. Park, 51, of 8 Blackberry Lane, was arrested on a charge of assault and battery on a person older than 60.

Hilarious photos show how badly-spaced writing can turn innocent signs into something VERY rude Internet uses have been sharing their examples of  kerning gone wrong Many instances see a 'c' and an 'l' placed too close in the word 'click'  People called Clint have also found that their name can cause problems By Martha Cliff for MailOnline Published: 06:51 EST, 10 November 2016 | Updated: 13:05 EST, 10 November 2016 e-mail 950 shares 84 View comments At a first glance you wouldn't be blamed for thinking these signs were showcasing some very rude slogans. However, these seemingly insulting slogans are in fact the entirely innocent victims of badly laid out words. Kerning, or sentence spacing, is what helps identify one word from another in a sentence but it's obviously gone out of the window in these cases. In this case a pack of 'flickering' fairy lights rather resembled a pack of f***ering lights Netizens have taken to the web to share the most jumbled sentences that have ended up extremely offensive. In many cases a 'C' and an 'L' placed too closely together in the word 'click' has resulted in the sign appearing to refer to the male appendage.

Top Livingston County Area News Get the Latest on 93.5 FM Lyon Twp. Man Arrested After Hitting Elderly Couple, Fleeing The Scene November 10, 2016 Charges have been issued against a Lyon Township man who struck two elderly people with his truck and then fled the scene. Around 1pm Monday, deputies with the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office Lyon Township Substation and the Lyon Township Fire Department responded to the Walmart located in New Hudson for a pedestrian hit and run accident. Witnesses reported that a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck had struck two pedestrians who were walking from the Walmart in the parking lot pushing a shopping cart. The driver then allegedly fled the scene. The victims, a 74-year-old female and 82-year-old male both of South Lyon, were knocked to the ground and complained of injuries. Deputies were able to determine the identity of the driver, who is a 65-year-old male and a resident of Lyon Township. Officers located his unoccupied pickup parked nearby and searched the interior of the vehicle. Deputies contacted the registered owner who identified the driver. Deputies then called the driver, who agreed to come to the Lyon Township Substation several hours after the incident to speak with the officers. The driver, whose license is currently suspended, admitted to hitting the pedestrians. He has had a prior conviction for Driving While License Suspended. The driver was arrested and lodged at the Oakland County Jail for Leaving the Scene of a Personal Injury Accident, a second offense of Driving While License Suspended and an unrelated misdemeanor warrant for an alcohol related charge. Both victims were transported by paramedics to St. John’s Providence Park Hospital for treatment and are listed in stable condition. The incident remains under investigation.

The National Retail Federation expects industry holiday sales to grow 3.6% this year to US$655.8bil (RM2.79tril).  In order to avoid running out of stock on popular holiday items, which is a problem for many retailers, Wal-Mart has sufficiently stocked itself with items for Black Friday both in-store and online, Steve Bratspies, the company's chief merchandising officer, told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.  In an example of Wal-Mart's purchasing scale, the retailer has stocked more than 1.5 million televisions and 3 million videogames, Bratspies said.  In a briefing in October, Wal-Mart laid out plans for the overall holiday shopping season this year and said it will make tens of thousands more items from its online assortment available for same-day store pickup, and will offer more lower-priced items instead of deals.  Last month, Target said it will offer more deal-driven promotions and extend its free shipping window to January this year.  Wal-Mart and Target will kick-off their Black Friday promotions on Thanksgiving day at 6pm in their stores. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Dept: Need further studies on Malacca relics China held by Qatar in Lippi's first match in charge MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites S&P, Nasdaq higher as tech stocks recover; Dow pauses SP Setia’s sales spike to RM943mil in Q3 HSBC: China-led RCEP in focus as TPP fades MP Evans rejects KL Kepong’s sweetened takeover offer (Update) Most Viewed in Tech Best smartphones for the holidays Sex hook-up websites' login credentials hacked Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump WhatsApp adds secure video calling Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada Lenovo unveils the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube gaming PC Twitter gets new 'Sun and Moon' Pokemon stickers Snowden warns of increase in US domestic spying after Trump victory Nintendo Wii at 10: the iconic games Western Digital redesigns its external drives Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Driver in Tracy Morgan crash case due back in court Nov. 29 Suzanne Russell, @SRussellMyCJ 10:47 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 Defendant Kevin Roper, left, and his attorney, David Glassman, appear in Middlesex County Superior Court Roper previously pleaded not guilty to aggravated manslaughter and other charges in the killing of comedian Jimmy McNair and critically injuring comedian Tracy Morgan. (Photo: ~Patti Sapone, Patti Sapone/NJ Advance Media) Story Highlights Former Walmart truck driver Kevin Roper appeared in court Wednesday It was the first time in recent months Roper has been in court for the Tracy Morgan crash case Roper is scheduled to return to court Nov. 29 NEW BRUNSWICK - Kevin Roper, the former Walmart truck driver accused of causing the 2014 New Jersey Turnpike crash that seriously injured comedian Tracy Morgan and killed his friend is scheduled to return to court Nov. 29. Roper, joined by his attorney, David Glassman, appeared Wednesday afternoon before Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Michael Toto for less than a minute. Toto asked Roper to return to court on Nov. 29. Prior to the open court session, Glassman and Assistant Prosecutor Sheree Pitchford met with Toto in chambers for about 10 minutes. Toto announced the new court date when they emerged. Roper, 37, a Jonesboro, Georgia resident, did not attend court hearings involving the case in August and September. His appearance Wednesday was an indication a plea deal might be in the making. Glassman declined comment following the court appearance. In a television appearance last week, Morgan said he harbors no ill will toward Roper. On June 7, 2014, Roper was driving a Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike in Cranbury when it crashed with a limousine bus Morgan and others were traveling in following the comedian’s performance in Delaware. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury, in addition to a broken leg, nose and ribs. His friend, mentor and fellow comedian, James “Jimmy Mack” McNair, was killed in the crash, and two other passengers, Ardley Fuqua, of Jersey City, and Jeffrey Millea, of Shelton, Connecticut, were seriously injured. In an Oct. 1 Twitter posting, @RealTracyMorgan paid tribute to McNair. “RIP Jimmy Mac. Today is his birthday. I love and miss you my brother,” Morgan wrote on the posting that also featured a photo of Morgan and McNair. Roper has been indicted on first-degree aggravated manslaughter, second-degree vehicular homicide and third-degree aggravated assault charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A National Transportation Safety Board investigator’s report alleged Roper hadn’t slept for 28 hours before the crash and that he failed to slow down before the crash. Roper allegedly was driving 65 mph on the highway where there were signs for drivers to slow to 45 mph because of area construction. Glassman has disputed the finding about Roper’s sleep schedule. Morgan has credited the Center for Head Injuries at JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute at JFK Medical Center in Edison and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick for his recovery. He has returned to performing on television and comedy shows. Morgan reached a confidential settlement in his lawsuit against Walmart last year. Walmart also reached a settlement with McNair’s two children.

Kent County sheriff's detectives on Wednesday, Nov. 9 released a surveillance video that showed the men at a Grand Rapids area Walmart store. Police say one man acts as a lookout while the other sneaks into a restricted area to access registers in an apparent administrative area. Surveillance video captured the theft and the two men leaving a Walmart store. In a Facebook post, police noted that stores on 28th Street SE and in Comstock Park had been targeted. Anyone with information about the men can call Silent Observer at 616-774-2345 or message the sheriff's department through its Facebook page.

As she approached his vehicle to give him directions, she said she noticed he was masturbating. As she walked away and called police, the Hiram man, 27, followed her until officers arrived and arrested him for public indecency. Theft, Wilson Mills Road: A student at Mayfield High School reported Nov. 1 that over the previous two school days someone had stolen $182 in cash from her locked locker. School officials are reviewing surveillance video in an effort to identify a suspect. Body found, SOM Center Road: A woman reported at 6:30 a.m. Nov. 2 she pried up a bedroom door to a room where a man was staying and found him face down and not breathing. Responding officers and paramedics confirmed the Richmond Heights man, 39, was dead. There was evidence of drug abuse found in the room. The woman said he had a drug history and was staying with her while he was in rehab. The drug enforcement unit is investigating. Harassing communication, Wilson Mills Road: Officers responded to a doctor's office Nov. 2 for a report of a patient who was making harassing phone calls since he had been dismissed from the practice and refused treatment. While they were taking the report, the South Euclid man, 41, called the office eight times. Officers told him to stop calling and he said he would comply. Departmental information, Wilson Mills Road: A Mayfield High School teacher said Nov. 3 she received a phone call from a parent of a student the previous day. The parent was upset because she reported an incident to child and family services, which was now investigating it. Harassing communication, Aintree Park Drive: A woman reported Nov. 3 her ex-husband confronted her at her home and continues to harass her through phone calls and text messages. The man reported Nov. 7 the woman is also harassing him. The incident is under review by the prosecutor. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, Beta Drive: A Progressive Insurance employee reported Nov. 4 a customer refused to return a loaner car and the company had not since been able to get in touch with him. Officers also tried to contact him, but could not. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the 25-year-old Cleveland man. Suspicious activity, Aintree Park Drive: A woman called 911 around 1 a.m. Nov. 7 and said she was awakened by someone knocking on her door and what sounded like her door being opened with a key. She stayed in her bedroom and did not go to the door. Responding officers discovered the woman had left her keys in the door and they believed someone may have been trying to let her know. Everything checked OK in the home. See more Mayfield Village news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest. If you would like to discuss the police blotter, please visit our crime and courts comments page.

Kevin Roper, 37, of Jonesboro, Ga., made the trip up north to New Brunswick only to find out during his less than five minute appearance that the hearing would be rescheduled for Nov. 29. Roper's attorney, David Jay Glassman, and Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Sheree Pitchford met behind closed doors with Judge Michael Toto for approximately 10 minutes. When they emerged, Toto asked the two parties to return at a later date. Glassman declined to comment outside the courtroom. Roper was driving a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer on the New Jersey Turnpike near Exit 8A in Cranbury when he crashed into a limo bus carrying Morgan and others. Fellow comedian James "Jimmy Mack" McNair, who was riding in the limo bus with Morgan, died in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board determined driver fatigue caused the collision. Roper, who had not slept for more than 28 hours, was driving 20 miles an hour over the posted 45 mph speed limit in a construction work zone before the collision, which set off a chain reaction that involved six vehicles and 21 people, authorities have said. "The driver, already going too fast, was slow to react," NTSB Chair Christopher Hart said. A month after the NTSB report, Glassman asked a Superior Court judge to drop the charges of assault by auto and death by auto, because he didn't feel his client would get a fair trial. Glassman, in court filings, contended Roper would not be able to get an "impartial jury" due to extensive media coverage, civil settlements in the case and the NTSP report. A former star on "Saturday Night Live" and "30 Rock," Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury and broken bones in the crash. He settled a lawsuit against Wal-Mart for an undisclosed amount in May 2015. Wal-Mart reached a $10 million settlement with McNair's two children in January 2015. Roper has pleaded not guilty to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and eight counts of aggravated assault. Morgan has since returned to performing, making a guest appearance on SNL and embarking on the "Picking up the Pieces" tour. In April, the tour came to the State Theatre in New Brunswick, approximately 15 miles north from where the crash occurred.   Alex Napoliello may be reached at anapoliello@njadvancemedia.com.

Today we are featuring Design Agency, Anthem and featuring the brand, Unox.  Tell us about your agency?  Anthem is a global creative agency that actively connects brands with people by amplifying desirability—creating an insatiable thirst for brands from package design to brand campaign. Anthem sells brands to drive brand performance. Anthem is an SGK Group company and SGK is a division of Matthews International Corporation (NASDAQ GSM: MATW). How did all start?  Clarence W. Schawk founded the business in 1953 from the basement of his aunt’s home on the northwest side of Chicago. He was newly married, and with his tour of duty as a U.S. Marine in the Pacific Theater and a few years’ experience in the industry making printing plates behind him, he realized, as many entrepreneurs do, that he could make a better product. He invested the $500 he and wife Marilyn received as wedding gifts in himself and the American Dream. The business began to grow, and through the years the name Schawk became synonymous with superior quality and outstanding customer service. Like many entrepreneurs, Mr. Schawk was passionate about the business and setting new standards in the industry for both the products he produced and the people he employed. Following a four-decade period of acquiring more than 25 prepress companies in North America, the Company began expanding its capabilities to include design and technology and to expand its footprint into Asia Pacific.  In the mid 1990s, SGK began acquiring established award-winning design agencies in the U.S. and Canada. And in 1997, SGK created a global graphics management software service for brands, the first created for the graphics industry to meet the unique demands of consumer product packaging. In the late 1990s, SGK entered the Asian Pacific market and began serving the needs of global companies in the region with local insights. During the 2000s, SGK acquired additional branding and design agencies around the world, further expanding and deepening its competency in this area of the business and branded these Brandimage and Anthem. In 2014, SGK was acquired by Matthews International and the Matthews Brand Solutions Group was integrated into SGK.  What is your showcase? What can you tell us about it?  With the Unox Soup Portfolio & Range Architecture as starting point we’ve initiated to develop a specific Unox Design Architecture. The visual brand identity system that we created and build over the last 4 years has proved to be solid, effective and flexible. It consists of the Unox branding in combination with the beacon shape that allows us to express the specific characteristics of the different propositions whilst strengthening Unox’s brand equity. It respects the heritage of Unox and its well loved ranges like Stevige whilst providing a strong platform for new introductions like Proeverij aimed at attracting new consumers to the brand. Creative director: Sara Jones Senior designers: Merle Waterman, Kim Dero Design Strategy: Arthur Brandenburg van den Gronden Account: Monique Linders What was your solution? The main objective of the brief was to reflect the various propositions from value, lower & upper mass and premium. So the extensive soup portfolio becomes much clearer for consumers as client felt that the proposition differentiation was rather weak and confusing.  A visual brand identity system (Unox logo & U-beacon) has been created to:  Clearly identify and differentiate the various propositions Strengthen brand recognition and blocking on shelf Facilitate variety navigation The U-beacon can vary in size, colour and texture as well as in content. Also the background is flexible in colour, photography and texture. Within this system food photography is playing an important role to express the lead message of the proposition. Ie. in the recently introduced ‘Proeverij’ range the delicious, expertly crafted and artisanal recipes are being reflected by seductive & honest photography which is enhanced in the final execution by a combination of mat & gloss finish. Why is this work so special and what does it say about your agency?  The work for Unox represents our agency well because of the absolute attention to food appeal. We pride ourselves on being able to give Unox a real identity when it comes to the quality and depiction of the food & ingredients – from the way the shot is lit, to the  imperfections & rustic feeling of the backgrounds and the attention to typography. Even without the Unox logo we aim to breathe the brand through the remaining visual cues. Above all, we believe that photography is the 'make or break' of food packaging, it has the ability to create desire, make you feel hungry, make your mouth water – all without a single word. The special quality of this work is the flexibility of the Design Architecture – innovations and new varieties are all able to be encompassed under this true Unox signature.  Clear thinking, beautifully designed. What makes the design Dutch? Dutch design often is simple and powerful. No-nonsense if you like. Unox designs are always simple and always bold as a result of the visual architecture that is centered around the U-beacon that allows for a single lead message presented with impact. So in this sense one can speak about a design with a typical Dutch signature Although the brand is Dutch, the audience is Dutch, the design team isn’t.  For more than 25 years the design team consistently has been an Anglo-Dutch combination so in a way this typical  Dutch signature actually is an eclectic mixture of Dutch no-nonsense with the typical Anglo ability of creating food appeal that is aspiring and desirable. No-nonsense design that aspires to be desirable.  What way would you describe Dutch packaging design? Dutch packaging design is a reflection of Dutch culture that has a strong international orientation. Dutch people like being Dutch, no-nonsense and without unnecessary thrills. At the same time their orientation is beyond the national borders because of trade, travel and holidays. And with that one can clearly see that Dutch packaging design is characterized by a Dutch no-nonsense foundation that aspires to be international inspired or fueled by international (eating) cultures. BNO NEXTpack: the next step in packaging design BNO NEXTpack is the packaging design source of the Netherlands. Inspiring convincing and surprising information about the importance of packaging design in the daily lives of everyone. NEXTpack stimulates the imagination, provides insights into the discipline and responds to relevant developments and social discussions. BNO NEXTpack represents the main Dutch packaging design agencies: Anthem, Bataafsche Teeken Maatschappij, BooM creatives, Bowler & Kimchi, Brum Design, dBOD, Design Bridge, Dream Catch, FLEX / design, Millford, OD, PROUDdesign, Reggs, SOGOOD, VBAT and WAACs.

It simply makes sense.  Simplicity rules the day. In our über-branded world, we’re seeing a sea-change washing over the landscape. Some say it started with Google, sporting the cleanest user interface on the web at the time. (Interesting that Microsoft’s Bing is now trying to out-simplify Google on functionality.) Others say Target paved the way, with a simpler, cleaner shopper experience, utilizing design as a strategic advantage in its pitched battle with Wal-Mart. (Equally interesting that Wal-Mart is now trying to out-design and out-simplify Target.)  Other examples abound: Häagen-Dazs touts a few simple ingredients with its Häagen-Dazs five™ line. Pepsi creates Throwback versions, harkening back to simpler times. Coca-Cola renovates its trademark brands, eliminating gratuitous and superfluous design elements to express brand symbols more simply and compellingly. Volkswagen builds an entire design language around simple forms. Philips touts “Sense and Simplicity” as more than a tag line but as a corporate covenant. Countless other brands feature simple, back-to-basic value propositions that appeal to a seemingly endless desire for the honest, the true, the uncomplicated...in a word, SIMPLICITY. WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?  This is more than a trend, even though it’s clearly trendy. It’s a more fundamental change, a cultural shift, and one that the cultural anthropologists and semioticians will be studying for decades. And the brands that recognized it early are reaping the rewards of reflecting the values that are driving the culture, even as they accelerate the shift through their powerful brand expressions.  The shift has many parents: our increasingly fragmented culture, media overload, overextended brands, SKU proliferation, and of course, the current economic reversal that fosters a deep desire for simple value as a response to the excesses of the recent past. In The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, psychology professor Barry Schwartz argues that consumers today are faced with far too many choices, noting that consumers would be far better off with a few distinctly different options instead of the countless array of choices they currently have. Whether choosing an insurance plan, a can of tomato sauce, or even a pair of jeans, Schwartz shows that a bewildering array of choices is overwhelming, and paradoxically inhibits happiness instead of enhancing it. He debunks the notion that more choices will make consumers happier, offering instead the idea that having all these choices actually infringes on consumers’ psychological well being.  Author and consultant Jack Trout similarly contends, in The Power Of Simplicity: A Management Guide to Cutting Through the Nonsense and Doing Things Right, that simplicity is one solution for marketers who find it increasingly difficult to gain traction among consumers beset by too many complicated choices and options. He urges managers to “get back to basics” and use simplicity as an organizing principle to guide enterprises to success. Trout notes that simplifying the value proposition will reduce cost and increase sales and profits.  In our own practice, we’ve seen brand owners leverage the power of simplicity to strengthen their brands. Heinz, in its Australian market, launched a new line of frozen stir-fry vegetables with a fresh, confident look that communicates convenient, everyday cooking. Bright, complementary colors, ample white space, simple design, and appetizing photography suggest healthy, unprocessed, and easy to use benefits.  This trend toward simplicity and purity has also taken hold in the beverage category, where unsweetened flavored water beverages are growing faster than any other segment. Dasani Essence is an all-natural, no-calorie clear beverage that adds a hint of fruit to bottled water, including lime, black cherry, and strawberry kiwi flavors. The design took a straightforward, bold approach to the brand that conveys honesty and simplicity. The new packaging is clean, modern and stylish to help encourage a healthy lifestyle and attitude.  Gundowring Fine Foods’ design features a series of smart two-color labels; the restricted palette, minimal typography, and a handdrawn swirl create an appealing label design that conveys real food, few ingredients, and simple authenticity.  Features: ArticlesYour NameOctober 09, 20092 Comments Moodology Category: Fashion, Substrate: Paper, Paperboard, CardboardElizabeth FreemanNovember 09, 2016Moodology, Origami Owl, United States, essential oils, Jewelry SCRUB Body Scrub by Coffee Organics Category: Beauty HealthTheresa Christine JohnsonNovember 09, 2016body scrub, bath and body, scrub body scrub by coffee organics, coffee, australia, OCHO Creative Home About Awards Events Directory Jobs Submit Archive Advertise Subscribe First Name Last Name Email Address Sign Up Thank you!

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2016/11/09/whirlwind-election-night-ends-with-big-victories-cliffhangers/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly The Fly Whirlwind Election Night Ends With Big Victories, Cliffhangers By The Fly / November 9, 2016 6 TAKE TWO Ro Khanna easily won the rematch to unseat Congressman Mike Honda. (Photo by Jessica Perez) At the ConXion to Community center near the Story Road Walmart, a packed room awaited state Assembly candidate Madison Nguyen amidst a backdrop of egg rolls, paper lanterns, yellow and red flags and sash-wearing Vietnamese beauty queens. The former vice mayor of San Jose fell 365 votes behind Ash Kalra—with 52 out of 221 precincts reporting. “Oh my gosh, it’s so close,” she exclaimed, and it would remain so for the next few hours. Madison Nguyen’s party didn’t disappoint with live music. (Photo by Jessica Perez) Luckily, there were slushie machines with margaritas and what the bartender referred to as “some orange kind of alcohol” to ease the tension and medicate the shadow of some orange kind of Elephant in the Room. After all, weed legalization wouldn’t take effect until midnight, four long hours away. Broadcaster Bob Kieve, looking damn good in a bow tie at the young age of 94, predicted “it will be a terrible four years,” saying Donald Trump lacked the qualities one should look for “in a public servant—or a human being.” He should know. Kieve worked as a White House speechwriter for President Dwight D. Eisenhower and can remember the 1928 race between Herbert Hoover and Al Smith. Nonagenarian Bob Kieve (left) and Madison Nguyen’s 4-year-old daughter, Olivia, nine decades his junior. (Photo by Jessica Perez) Kalra briefly distracted himself from the tension of the dead heat by dancing to a live band at his campaign headquarters off Capitol Expressway. The soundtrack of “Uptown Funk” drowned out any conversation about Trump becoming the next commander in chief. Kalra’s campaign manager, Shay Franco-Clausen, took a break from the party inside the strip mall office to get some fresh air. “This has been a really great campaign,” she said. “That’s despite the aggression we experienced.” A member of the Nguyen camp was accused of throwing wet ramen noodles on the windows of Kalra’s campaign office. “Three times,” Franco-Clausen said, adding that signs also routinely went missing. Ash Kalra (center) tallies with his supporters in a race that remained too close to call Tuesday night. (Photo by Greg Ramar) Kalra, wearing a sleek blue suit with a yellow-and-black necktie, shrugged it off. “You just put out some more signs,” he said. Trailing his opponent by 49 votes hours after the counting began, he looked a little uneasy. “I wish they’d update the results,” he said. A few latecomers popped in once the band left, including county Supervisor Dave Cortese and Kalra’s City Council colleagues Raul Peralez, Tam Nguyen and Manh Nguyen. At Fremont’s Royal Palace Banquet Hall, we sneaked down a service hallway where Ro Khanna sat quietly in a room of gilded armchairs with his wife, Ritu. About to deliver a victory speech after beating Mike Honda to become Silicon valley’s newest congressman, Khanna granted a short interview before being interrupted by a congratulatory phone call from a supporter. “We’re going to win. Sixteen points,” he assured the caller. Khanna admits he’ll have some cachet in Congress after defeating a once-powerful incumbent, and because he’s been “branded as a tech candidate. That’s a huge responsibility, a huge honor.” As a member of the House’s minority party, Khanna said, he’ll be willing to reach across the aisle and engage in bipartisanship. But he doesn’t entertain any illusions. “Candidly, I think it’s going to be very divided going into Congress,” he said. “There’s going to be great division. I think what is pretty important is to articulate the progressive vision for this country, in contrast and in opposition to Paul Ryan and Donald Trump.” Khanna praised Honda’s service and his advocacy on behalf of minorities and transgendered communities. “I plan to reach out to him, extending friendship and respect,” Khanna said. Lee Wilcox (left) and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo were feeling good about the direction of the city. (Photo by Taylor Jones) In one of the more bizarre election night parties in recent memory, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and his council colleagues joined Police Chief Eddie Garcia, as well as members of the Police Officers’ Association, at Rookies Sports Lodge to cheer on Measure F, the city’s pension reform settlement. When the first wave of results came in, Liccardo began to shout and cheer before high-fiving Garcia. Councilmembers Peralez, Don Rocha, Johnny Khamis, Chappie Jones, Vice Mayor Rose Herrera and City Manager Norberto Dueñas joined the fun in a private party room, watching a flatscreen with national election results and noshing on chicken wings and pizza in between beverages—which they swore were soda waters. Unlike his 2014 mayor's race against county Supervisor Cortese, who didn’t concede until a few days after the election, Liccardo said he would hold off on going to bed Tuesday night to track results online. “No, I’m going to stay up,” Liccardo said. “We’ve got a lot at stake in this race.” San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia was all smiles after seeing Measure F returns. (Photo by Taylor Jones) Also ready to stay up late were Trump’s faithful, who waited for the outcome in a spacious warehouse at the end of a dark court in Sunnyvale. About an hour before the first polls closed, about 100 people dined on pasta and focaccia catered by Tony and Alba’s. Tables were set facing a giant projector screen tuned to Fox News. At a table near the back of the room, a group of Chinese Americans for Trump—the words were emblazoned on their T-shirts—traded anecdotes from the campaign trail. Saratoga resident John Cagliostro sported a black number that read, “Deplorable Lives Matter,” which he said was his way of reclaiming a word Hillary Clinton used pejoratively about her rival’s supporters. John Cagliostro says Donald Trump wasn’t his first—or fifth choice—for president, but he’s with the new POTUS. (Photo by Jennifer Wadsworth) “Trump wasn’t my first choice,” Cagliostro said. “He wasn’t my second, third, fourth or fifth. Ben Carson was my first. But this isn’t about one person, or even about Trump. This is bigger than him. We need to restore this country.” A man walking past took a dramatic spin on his heel and asked, “Did I hear someone say prison? You must be talking about Hillary. Put her in jail.” Cagliostro gave him a knowing nod. “United we stand, Obama we fall,” he later quipped. For San Jose resident Dilip Kumar, who owns a software company, his allegiance to Trump dates back to the first time he read The Art of the Deal in 2011. “He’s a good businessman,” said Kumar, who wore a straw fedora, a campaign shirt and an “I voted” sticker. “Because of his policies, we can bring jobs back to the U.S.” A Clinton win, he said, would perpetuate a corrupt status quo. In the Democratic Central Committee campaign hub at The Plant at Monterey and Curtner, the mood at the Dem HQ was considerably less buoyant, as the GOP nominee edged ahead in the “race for 270” electoral votes nearly an hour after the polls closed. About 200 people perched on folding chairs watched MSNBC coverage in horror. Randi Kinman, a West Valley-Mission College District trustee, shook her head recalling how someone had tried to reassure her that it wasn’t the end of the world. “But it is," she said. “It is the end of the world. It’s the end of the world where people can be safe. It’s the end of the world where women can be safe, and minorities.” Aimee Escobar, a county planning commissioner, said Trump’s bombardment into national politics marks the beginning of the end of civil discourse. “He made it OK to talk down to people,” she said. With results looking dismal for Clinton, the life-size cardboard cutout of her in a crisp pantsuit and winning smile began to feel cruelly out of place, someone remarked. As did the two-and-a-half-foot sheet cake with “Congratulations Madam President” inscribed in red-white-and-blue frosting. State Sen. Jim Beall (right) racked up another term with an easy re-election victory. (Photo by Greg Ramar) State Sen. Jim Beall, who held a strong lead over challenger Nora Campos by the time the second round of returns posted, walked in long after the mood had soured. A few folks congratulated him and posed for a picture, but most people’s eyes were glued to the TV screen. “This just seems just and right for this to be [Clinton’s] time,” Lynn Rogers said. “So I’m loathe to accept this.” Moments before, she said, she’d been chanting with a Buddhist about Clinton “giving a voice to the voiceless ones.” At the back of the room, a Trump piñata hung on the wall with his paper mache arms outstretched and a sticker demanding to “stop bigotry” on the left side of his tissue blazer. To round out the night, Fly made a brief stop by the South Bay Labor Council’s party to see what was cracking. Within two minutes a labor flak escorted a reporter and photographer out without any chance to negotiate. The banquet hall spread looked to be mostly finger foods, with a cheese and olive platter and salad bar, bottled IPA beers available—not for us, of course—and a lot of empty seats. It didn’t look like anyone had an interest in sticking around to see if Hillary would concede before the end of the night.

Not a very gracious comment in the least, especially considering that SJ Political Mail uploaded a video several days ago showing Kalra volunteers stealing flyers left by Nguyen volunteers. Signs go missing every election year. Did Shay miss the giant news story earlier this year about a massive high school senior prank to steal lawn signs? I have been involved with campaigns, and they have always had problems with signs going missing on both sides. For her to raise this as a criticism of her opponent’s integrity is not classy in the least. Reply Robert M Cortese Nov 9, 2016 @ 10:15 am We *could* have had Sanders as president last night… Democrats even voted for Trump. Why? * We saw how the DNC screwed Sanders out of the nomination. * Hillary’s handling of emails. * Her message that he’s creating “Divisive Politics” Politics by their very nature are divisive. (Condescending) * Some parts of Hillary’s campaign were hiring crazy people to start fights at trump rallies. As a former Democrat, I saw this “Buddy system”. I was asked by one local prominent Dem to “Attack” another Dem candidate. (I guess she thinks i’m nuts) I’ve had other candidates pay crazy people to slander me. I’m not a registered Republican, I am “No party” but I’ve been saying this for years. The Democrat party both locally and nationally have become so blinded by the desire to “Win” that all reason, logic, and decency has been thrown out the window. All I see in our local Democratic party is line of asskissing up to the next elected official on the ladder in a hope to get endorsements and support. I’ve been saying for YEARS.. Our local party needs to clean up its act. Same goes on the national level. Until that housecleaning happens, we won’t see Democrats holding any sort of majority over Republicans. If you didn’t get the memo last night, the American public doesn’t see enough difference between the parties anymore to even care. It’s not that we have willfully ignorant voters. Almost every voter knows this is going on now, and they’re pissed. When you call them “Ignorant” you are basically saying they are lesser than you. Don’t do that. Reply sjoutsidethebubble Nov 9, 2016 @ 8:05 pm > Democrats even voted for Trump. Why? A good analysis. I think another factor in Hillary’s underperformance was her health. She clearly has health issues, and it seems to be well known by insiders (but not the “little people”) that she is an alcoholic. Messages in the leaked emails suggest that she had to be sobered up for meetings, appearances, etc. I think her frequency of campaign appearances was about one fourth of Trumps. Reply Former Dem Nov 10, 2016 @ 9:54 pm @Robert M. Cortese – I agree with you. For decades I was a member of the Dem party – volunteering, donating when called during election fundraising – but no longer. After seeing how the SC County Dem party operates – not endorsing good candidates who would really represent the needs of constituents but instead endorsing their friends involved in the Dem county committee, and working to elect people who will represent the interests of and push the agenda of campaign contributors (such as labor) rather than represent all constituents. Voters do not know that at the Dem County committee level people who have never been elected (people voters have never even heard of) are behind the scenes pulling strings to control endorsements and support, and therefore limit voters’ choices. What played out at the national level in terms of how Sanders was treated by the DNC, and how Clinton was ‘anointed’ by the DNC, echoed what I have seen at the local level here in SC County. Reply Robert Cortese Nov 11, 2016 @ 7:27 am Ya I pretty much made the same analogy in Josh’s “Surviving 4 years under trump” story. http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2016/11/09/a-guide-to-surviving-the-next-4-years-under-president-trump/#comment-1639659 I don’t get why the Campos’s and Shirakawa were still “Annointed” after all the scandals came out, and much like you it left me with a sour taste for the SCC Dems. Reply PLigovskoy Nov 11, 2016 @ 12:27 am I agree on the points you outlined about Hillary, but Sanders likely would not have won either. He’s too liberal. I like Bernie, but I really doubt he could have won. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Latest Tweets Loading tweets by @sanjoseinside...

The question posed: “After the election is over, and the new administration takes office, what issues will you be focusing on with the greatest interest?” Mark and Michelle Luman Mark and Michelle Luman were enjoying lunch on the tailgate of their truck in the Walmart parking lot. “I’m interested in energy independence,” Mark said. “They need to legalize marijuana too, and stop wasting my tax dollars putting people in jail for marijuana use.” He also expressed concern about the borders and immigration, “No Syrian refugees,” he said. Meanwhile, Michelle said that, as a nurse, she is afraid of Clinton’s stand on abortion. “When you’ve seen an abortion go wrong in the 26th week, you never forget it,” Michelle said. Kerry Moore and Todd [auth] Alexander Todzilla’s truck was at Walmart on Tuesday for a Gary Johnson rally. Todd Alexander spoke about his concerns. “Neither of the candidates talked about issues,” Alexander said. “It’s been about morality. It’s very frustrating.” Alexander sees an over-arching problem that needs to be addressed soon. “Everyone is so polarized they’re forgetting that no matter how it all comes out, we’re all in this together,” Alexander said. Kerry Moore said her concerns were financial. “Taxes is a huge issue for me,” Moore said. “As a small business owner, we get no loopholes. We’re the little man and we’re barely hanging on to start with. I want to see less government and a balanced budget. Wouldn’t it be fantastic if the government had to operate like a business owner?” Moore also recognized that the younger generation has more power than they seem to know. “The Millennials have the numbers to change the entire political realm,” Moore said. Kathie Butts Kathie Butts was at The Gallery Main Street Arts at 223 N. Main St. She said her concern is pretty direct. “Peace,” Butts said, “in the country, in the world, in police departments, among the public, everybody … politically, publicly and in the world; if you can get that done, you’ve done a lot.” Butts expressed that if peace were achieved, then all political issues could be discussed civilly and progress would be possible. But she also has fears. “I’m worried that no matter who wins we won’t have peace,” Butts said. Don James Don James, owner of the lapidary store Ancients of Days said his biggest concern is jobs and the economy. “That has a direct effect on my store,” James said. He has two other concerns, however. “Something has to be done about terrorism and groups like ISIS,” James said. “Also abolish Obamacare. It was shoved down our throats and the premiums are going up.” Kim Folts Kim Folts is a millennial who works at Subway. She reflected a common view for many in her generation. “No matter who we get, we’re screwed,” Folts said. “Past presidents haven’t fixed anything.” On the issues, Folts said, “They need to end wars. Wars are stupid.” She also addressed a living wage. “They have to raise the minimum wage,” Folts said. “I work a lot of hours a week and can hardly afford to buy anything.” Chris Lewis Chris Lewis, who works at Kelley Pharmacy, said his main concerns are education related. “I can’t get scholarships because I’m white and male and a U.S. citizen,” Lewis said. He also expressed concern with the electorate. “I’d like to see people get more involved in government,” Lewis said. Matthew Shappard Matthew Shappard, a Farmer’s Insurance Agent, said his biggest concern was healthcare. “Premiums are going through the roof,” Shappard said. He also noted that health insurance options were getting scarcer as rates were going up. Shappard said he wants to see a market-driven resolution. “I want to see a free market in healthcare,” Shappard said. But even at that he’s concerned with the limits being placed on small businesses. “I’m concerned about regulations on small businesses,” Shappard said. “They’re imposing mandatory healthcare and a minimum wage hike. That could drive a lot of us small businessmen out of business.” Of the nine people questioned: Three expressed healthcare related concerns. Three expressed concerns about laws limiting small business. Two expressed concerns that people unlike themselves were a threat to their well-being. Features reporter Curtis M.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 9 November 2016 | MYT 12:17 PM Wal-Mart Pay in talks with several mobile wallet companies Ramping up: Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and will soon include third-party digital wallets on the retailer's website and app. — Reuters CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks with several mobile wallet companies to offer more payment options in its Wal-Mart Pay app, an executive at the world's largest retailer said, after signing up JPMorgan Chase & Co last week.  Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said.  Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card.  Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart US, said in an interview late on Nov 4 that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964.  "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said.  US mobile payments accounted for an estimated US$67bil (RM279.89bil) in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to US$83bil (RM346.73bil), or 24% of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data.  Apple Inc's Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and US retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years.  But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores.  Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 US stores.  Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register.  An e-receipt is sent to the app.  Eckert also said more than 90% of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month.  He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay.  Wal-Mart leads a consortium of US retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC.  The group, which includes Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Life & Style , Technology You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Dept: Need further studies on Malacca relics China held by Qatar in Lippi's first match in charge MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites S&P, Nasdaq higher as tech stocks recover; Dow pauses SP Setia’s sales spike to RM943mil in Q3 HSBC: China-led RCEP in focus as TPP fades MP Evans rejects KL Kepong’s sweetened takeover offer (Update) Most Viewed in Tech Best smartphones for the holidays Sex hook-up websites' login credentials hacked Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump WhatsApp adds secure video calling Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada Lenovo unveils the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube gaming PC Twitter gets new 'Sun and Moon' Pokemon stickers Snowden warns of increase in US domestic spying after Trump victory Nintendo Wii at 10: the iconic games Western Digital redesigns its external drives Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Ten residents competed for five, four-year seats on Nov. 8. Unofficially, Richard Rigoglioso (2,813), incumbent Joseph Delaney III (2,777), Erin Delaney (2,596), incumbent Frank Calandriello (2,493) and incumbent Louis Aloia (2,410) won the seats on the council. Mayor Gaetana (Tana) Raymond (2,383), Romi Herrera (2,278), incumbent Glenn Mati (2,083), Nikolce Milevski (1,745) and Tony Lio (1,486) fell out of the running. These are numbers are including mail-ballots but not provisionals. Aloia has served as mayor of Garfield from 1996 to 2000 and as a councilman from 2000 to present. He is married to his wife, Rosemarie, with six children and six grandchildren. He is the owner and manager of Aloia Funeral Home. Aloia said in the last four years he is most proud of the city's redevelopment including the General Pulaski statue at the new Garfield River Drive Park, Garden State Signature Place, Walmart, Applebee's, McDonald's and Wawa. Calandriello has served on the council for 20 years, including three consecutive terms as mayor. He is the president of Frankie's Express Moving and F&M Leasing, a 55-year family owned business. Joe Delaney said when he first became mayor four years ago his focus was increasing the redevelopment in the city. "The Passaic Street redevelopment was at a standstill with only the Walmart and Applebee's," Delaney said. "Within my first month as mayor, McDonald's called and after it being previously denied I was able to push it forward despite resistance from the planning board." After McDonald's came to the location, Delaney said other businesses like Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory and Pet Smart followed. "I don't want to wait another 10 years for redevelopment to move forward. I know government moves slowly but in Garfield sometimes it moves at a snail's pace and that's what I'm totally against," Delaney said. Erin Delaney graduated from Garfield High School in 2009 and was a member of the National Honor Society and Top 20 Seniors. She received her bachelor's degree in psychology and master's degree in public administration. She is the founder of the Garfield Stigma Free Committee and member of the Garfield Prevention Coalition and the Garfield Municipal Alliance. She has worked in the field of substance abuse for four years for Partners in Prevention, the Bergen County Office of Alcohol and Drug Dependency and The Center of Alcohol and Drug Resources. Delaney also has experience in grant work, community organization, community outreach, program development, coalition management and event planning. While working at The Center for Alcohol and Drug Resources, a five year $125,000 per year grant was secured for Garfield. She has been a volunteer in several community organizations such as Food for Thought Healthy Living, Garfield Clean Communities, and a volunteer coach with various youth organizations. Rigoglioso has served as the vice principal of Garfield Middle School for the last five years. He comes from a family of 10 and has lived in Garfield his entire life. He now has six children of his own who are the main reason why he is running for council. He said the town is changing and going in the wrong direction. "I take my kids to events in other towns but they are beginning to be more involved in the community with football and cheerleading," he said. Rigoglioso said he has worked in the school system for the last 20 years and sees things are changing and "not positively." "I think it's time for a different vision," he said. "The community needs to be more involved. If other towns can do it we can too if we reach out more." If elected, he said he would like to impose a term limit of three terms. Raymond, who was first elected to the city council in 2008, will not be returning to the governing body. The past four years she has been fighting illegal apartments in the city. She said more than $100,000 has been collected in illegal apartment fines. Mati, the deputy mayor, will also not be returning. He served one term on the Garfield Council as the deputy mayor and has served on the Garfield Planning Board for the last four years. He is a retired Garfield Police Department captain where he served for 34 years and is an active firefighter in the city for the last 43 years. He is currently employed as a safety officer with the Garfield Board of Education. Residents elect candidates to the governing body and those members pick a mayor and deputy mayor. The city council election was previously held in May with this year being the first one held in November.

George Yu, 26, pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a controlled substance. The prison sentence came with a recommendation for boot camp. Yu arranged to meet the undercover agent in the parking lot of a Mount Prospect Wal-Mart on June 20, 2014, to buy a kilogram of cocaine, said Cook County assistant state's attorney Denise Loiterstein. Police recovered a weapon from Yu, who did not have a Firearm Owners Identification card, and charged him with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, Loiterstein said. In exchange for pleading guilty to that charge, Yu was sentenced to three years in prison. Cook County Judge Marc Martin ordered he serve the sentences concurrently. "Everyone is entitled to a second chance," Martin said in recommending Yu for the Illinois Department of Corrections impact incarceration program, also known as boot camp. Boot camp consists of military-style training, substance abuse counseling, life skills training and education. Candidates must await an opening in the program and be approved for admission.

Journalist and Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King’s Twitter feed is filled with stories of intimidation from across the country, where the president-elect’s campaign rhetoric appears to be manifesting in ugly ways. At a Walmart, one Muslim woman said another woman pulled off her hijab and threatened to hang her with it. At New York University, the door to the prayer room for Muslim students was defaced. A young Muslim woman in Virginia tweeted that she was harassed by two people who told her she “wouldn’t be there for long.” Great way to start my morning, shoved when stepping out of my car and told by another person that I won't be here for long. Awesome— Hareem Mannan (@okhareem) November 9, 2016 Trump supporters in Simi Valley, California, followed an Asian-American man into a convenience store asking him if he spoke English. According to his Facebook post, they told him, “pure America is finally going to come back.” In Napa Valley, another man reportedly told an Asian woman pumping gas to “get the fuck out of my country.” A group of white men tried to touch a woman inappropriately on the subway — when she screamed, they laughed. At York Tech High School in Pennsylvania, students marched down the hallways holding Trump signs and chanting, “White power.” Another student reportedly grabbed a girl’s breast yesterday and said it was “his right.” Muslim women were targeted with hate speech and violence in Illinois and New York. Not even 24 hours yet. My friend's sister, who is Muslim, had a knife pulled on her by a Trump supporter while on the bus by UIUC campus.— Sarah A. Harvard (@amyharvard_) November 9, 2016 I have a scarf on. Passed by someone on the platform today and he says, "Your time's up, girlie."— Mehreen Kasana (@mehreenkasana) November 9, 2016 @ShaunKing Muslim student was strong arm robbed in San Diego State University while they insulted her for being a Muslim. pic.twitter.com/LzH5jcp2sC— need bday money (@merbae_) November 10, 2016 And black women were targeted in Indiana, Delaware, and Atlanta, Georgia. This just happened in Indiana. "Fuck you nigger bitch. Trump is going to deport you back to Africa." Day 1 of Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/KtAhZu1XKA— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 10, 2016 She was pumping her gas in the "nice" Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs when this happened yesterday. Trump has EMBOLDENED racists. pic.twitter.com/hvvuhdfYQn— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 10, 2016 In North Carolina, a same-sex couple found a threatening note on their car. Placed on their car in NC. "Can't wait until your 'marriage' is overturned by a real president. Gay families = burn in hell. Trump 2016" pic.twitter.com/jyBjUSS2TI— Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 10, 2016 And in a letter to parents, the superintendent of Council Rock High School North in Pennsylvania said a number of incidents had occurred at the school that day, including two swastikas being drawn on a bathroom stall, a note in another bathroom that read “I love Trump” and included a gay slur, and a Latina student finding a note in her backpack that told her to go back to Mexico. From the Superintendent of Council Rock, a school district in an affluent, largely white area of Bucks County, PA, where I grew up: pic.twitter.com/nbXqqLP8tT— Mike Sacks (@MikeSacksEsq) November 10, 2016 The female friend of a San Francisco Chronicle reporter was on the subway when another woman heard her speaking Assyrian on the phone. The woman repeatedly called her a “stalker” and said she hoped she would get deported. From friend of a friend: I was on the BART and this lady right here heard me talk Assyrian on the phone. You can see what happened next... pic.twitter.com/zOJe8iNt8e— emilytgreen (@emilytgreen) November 11, 2016 At Wellesley College — Hillary Clinton’s alma mater — two white male Trump supporters who attend Babson College, a private business school next to Wellesley, reportedly drove around campus in a pickup truck with a Trump flag yelling “make America great again.” “This is not my America,” one Wellesley student wrote. “This is Trump’s America filled with hatred and bigotry. This is what he has provoked.” This post has been updated throughout.

Technological improvements in hearing aid circuitry improve sound quality, immediate post-fit satisfaction and provide new features. These features also increase the power demand from the battery and therefore are also driving sales slightly. In addition to increased power supply, these features encourage hearing aid purchases and therefore help drive market growth for hearing aid batteries. Furthermore, hearing aid battery manufacturers are packaging their products in way that helps users change the batteries more easily. There has also been an increase in the proportion of private label batteries which are sold at a lower price point;, further facilitating the decrease in ASPs. There has also been an increase in retail channels such as Costco, Wal-Mart and the internet. Price per individual battery pack is expected to remain relatively constant until the end of the forecast period, but because of bulk sales and the increasing number of batteries included in a package, the average price per individual battery is expected to decline slightly. Growth in this market is due to a few major trends. The first is increasing aging population, which drives the demand for new hearing aid installations and consequently increases the installed base of devices requiring batteries. The second contributor is that manufacturers offering private label hearing aid batteries have been offering an increasing number of batteries per pack.

Don't Miss: Black Friday 2016: Everything You Need to Know Now Many are scared of the views of the new regime and even fearing for their rights and lives and their futures. Many people have come out to protest the outcome of the election while many other are even contemplating leaving the country. In this time, Run The Jewel decided to drop their brand new track “2100” featuring Boots. The rap duo Killer Mike and El-P said that they had penned the track months prior and it was supposed to be a part of their upcoming album Run The Jewels 3. They said in a statement that, "For our friends, for our family. For everyone who is hurting or scared right now. Here is a song we wrote months ago. We weren't planning on releasing it yet, but … well it feels right, now. Releasing the track on Soundcloud, the duo made a statement which said that, "It’s about fear and it’s about love and it’s about wanting more for all of us. It’s called 2100. We hope it finds you well." With an opening organ music, Killer Mike raps, "How long before the hate that we hold lead us to another Holocaust?" He questions and later adds, "Say the revolution's right here/ Right now and they ain't calling off." The song is encouraging people to rise in face of hate and fight for their right and differentiate what is right and wrong. The song is empowering the masses who feel let down by the election results. The song was produced by El-P with co-production from Little Shalimar and Wilder Zoby.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     USB Stick Can Accurately Test HIV Posted: Nov 10 2016, 8:44am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Nov 10 2016, 8:47am CST, in News | Latest Science News   USB stick that tests for HIV. Credit: Imperial College London / DNA Electronics You Can Now Perform HIV Test on a USB Stick Gallery 3 images   Finally, an HIV test has been made possible by simply using a USB stick. Science truly knows no limits. Limits, as they say, exist only in the mind. In reality there are no limits, only plateaus. Scientists have now built a USB stick that tests whether you have HIV or not. This is a revolutionary invention. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals The contraption employs a drop of blood to find out whether the AIDS virus is present in it or not. The complex electronic signals generated by this special USB stick allow for the relevant information to be deciphered by a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone. Can things get more convenient than this? This test could come in handy for HIV patients who want to monitor their terminal illness. Especially, now that we are as close as we have ever possibly been to a vaccine for AIDS, this test is crucial. Also patients who exist in far off locations can benefit immensely from this device. The gadget is not only very efficient but can deliver results in as little as half an hour, according to a new research, published in the journal Scientific Reports. This technology gauges the virus in the bloodstream of the patient so that he or she can better monitor the progress of his or her treatment over time. At present most AIDS tests take up to three days to be completed. Sometimes they take an even longer time which is very inconvenient. Blood samples have to be sent to a lab. Many underdeveloped parts of the globe lack labs to test for HIV. At present retroviral treatments can take the amount of viruses in the blood of AIDS patients to virtually zero levels. Yet here is the rub since the medicine may stop working. That is because that particular HIV strain may develop a resistance to the drugs.  Thus the virus again starts multiplying in the cells. Also checking for the virus on a regular basis is an excellent way of keeping track of the fact whether the patient is taking his or her medicine or not. Besides this, routine tests never tell exactly what the nature of the virus may be so they are for all purposes defunct. With HIV treatment showing progress over the past generation or so, this USB stick is the latest welcome addition to the palliative measures against the nasty disease. The technology will come in handy in Sub-Saharan Africa where AIDS is such a common occurrence even today when the main tide of the fatal illness has passed with the passage of time.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     A Soft Drink A Day Raises Diabetes Risk By 50% Posted: Nov 10 2016, 10:45am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Cars & Vehicles   Getty Images   Apparently, a soft drink a day allows diabetes a way into your body. Just a single can of soda pop imbibed on a regular basis can increase your chances of contracting diabetes by 50%. This is a sad and dismal fact and the sooner we digest it, the better our collective health as a global village would be. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Those who took as little as a single can of Coke or Pepsi (or any other soft drink for that matter) per day ended up facing a lifetime of pre-diabetes. This nascent illness later on developed into even more deadlier manifestations of the disease. The blood sugar levels rose over time and within a few years the soft drink imbibers faced the onslaught of a 50% greater chance of developing full-fledged diabetes, according to DailyMail. If this condition is detected at an early stage, it can be offset via a good diet and vigorous exercise not to mention other lifestyle changes. Yet if it is neglected, type 2 diabetes is the usual result which is not a good sign. Among some of the fatal consequences of type 2 diabetes is cardiac arrest.  Sugary drinks can cause insulin resistance. That is where things start to go very wrong. Once the blood becomes glucose-infested several problems start to occur since this is a disease of the metabolism. The worst offenders as far as diabetes is concerned are liquid calories especially fizzy drinks. These are something that the market is filled with. Enter any superstore and you see rows upon rows of soft drinks. They are playing havoc with the bodies of children, teenagers and adults. About 1685 middle-aged people were  monitored over a period of 14 years. They did not have diabetes in the beginning of the survey. Yet they consumed sugary drinks on a regular basis. Those who drank the most quantities per weekly basis suffered the most from diabetes in the long run. It seems sugar is the ultimate culprit when it comes to the diseases of civilization. All these degenerative diseases that cause a ruined metabolism and an old age that is only relieved by a death that comes as a welcome relief from the pain and suffering, are a result of one ingredient in our diets: white sugar. An overall restructuring of one’s lifestyle is necessary if one wants to reverse this trend towards type 2 diabetes.

Kirshner's company has experienced delays due to the Hanjin Shipping bankruptcy. Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times Stores hustle to get holiday goods as fallout from shipping mess continues By Natalie Kitroeff | Los Angeles Times Updated Nov 11, 2016 (…) Todd Kirshner, President and CEO of Punch Studios, a supplier of stationary and gift supplies, stands in the warehouse of his business on Nov. 2 in Culver City, Calif. Kirshner's company has experienced delays due to the Hanjin Shipping bankruptcy. Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times LOS ANGELES – The last Hanjin Shipping vessel dropping off goods in California has set sail from the Port of Long Beach, finally clearing the many ships left stranded by the company's sudden collapse two months ago. But in its wake, the giant shipping line has left a mess that retailers across the country will be sorting out for weeks. The South Korean company's bankruptcy is forcing big chains to spend piles of cash to get their goods through ports to warehouses in time for the busy holiday shopping season. Some mom-and-pop shops will have less to offer this year. Wholesalers pay additional transportation costs And once again, an unexpected disruption has pointed out the intricate links of the supply chain that feeds America's consumer machine. For some wholesalers and retailers, the impact continues. Ashley Furniture, which supplies couches, beds and dressers to the likes of J.C. Penney, Target and Wal-Mart, had the misfortune of being on the receiving end of 900 containers set to be transported by Hanjin. After Hanjin cancelled its "port-to-door" delivery, Ashley executives hustled to fill the gap, hiring trucking companies to haul the wares from ports and contracting with new vessels to bring containers stranded in Singapore. So far, the company has spent more than $1 million to retrieve stranded containers and get the ones that have arrived in Los Angeles out of the ports. It managed to get clients their furniture on time, but making that happen will dent Ashley's profits. Empty containers tie up chassis at warehouses Normally, when truck drivers drop off containers at Ashley distribution centers, they unload the goods and then take the containers back to the ports to be collected by the shipping line. But Hanjin vessels haven't been making return trips to pick up their boxes. So drivers are simply unhooking their big rigs from the chassis, the metal frames used to haul the steel boxes, and leaving the empty containers and chassis behind. Now, Ashley is desperate to figure out what to do with hundreds of empty containers. It has returned some to port terminals, but it has had to pay Redlands trucking company $125, on top of the normal trucking rate, for each empty box it has transported. For more than a month, those empty containers and the chassis they were tying up left the port complex in Los Angeles reeling. In all, 6,000 vacant boxes that arrived on Hanjin ships remain in the country, and the vast majority of them are still sitting on chassis. Stranded chassis are needed at the ports Idle chassis are "the top issue" that retailers are worried about, said Jonathan Gold, the vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. "They need those chassis back on the ports to get the full load of containers back out" of the ports, Gold said. "The longer this goes on, it continues to be a concern." The strain is showing across the supply chain, said Noel Hacegaba, the chief commercial officer at the Port of Long Beach. But fixes, he says, are on the way. Hacegaba helped persuade Hanjin to take more than 2,000 empty containers back on the Hanjin Seattle, the vessel that left Oct. 27. Last week, the Port of Long Beach announced that another Hanjin ship would return to pick up 4,300 containers. Samsung, Hanes, J.C. Penney, Microsoft and Kmart affected That will be welcome news to some of the biggest names in consumer products. Samsung had the most cargo on Hanjin ships by a long shot, with more than 8,000 container units of goods stacked on the vessels from August through the end of September, according to Datamyne, which tracks trade data. Other big names included Hanes, J.C. Penney, Microsoft and Kmart. Online Poll Do you think the U.S. should abolish the Electoral College system?

Tips for getting deals for the Black Friday weekend World by Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Posted Nov 10, 2016 10:01 am MST Last Updated Nov 10, 2016 at 11:00 am MST NEW YORK, N.Y. – Serious deal-seekers are already planning their Thanksgiving weekend shopping, and experts believe that once again the holiday itself may offer better deals than Black Friday the day afterward. Amid the clutter of deals clamouring for attention, smart and careful shoppers can come out ahead. Many stores are increasing their inventory so as not to frustrate shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 per cent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. “Start researching and planning,” says Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews.com, a deal comparison website. Here are four ways to get the most out of Black Friday weekend — and beyond. STUDY UP: Make a comprehensive list of what you plan to buy, research what those items usually sell for at full price and on sale, and figure out how much you want to spend. Also check out store flyers from previous years online, since many retailers repeat the same deals at the same price. Eighty per cent of the products and 43 per cent of the prices highlighted on the front pages of the 2015 and 2014 Black Friday flyers of Best Buy, Macy’s, Target, Kohl’s, Walmart and J.C. Penney were the same, says Market Track LLC, a price tracking firm. Make sure to note at what times different stores plan to start their Black Friday deals — both online and at the store. For example, J.C. Penney is making its deals available on its website on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for the first time. It will open its doors on Thanksgiving at 3 p.m., the same time as last year. Kohl’s offered last Thursday a subset of the Black Friday deals that will be available for Thanksgiving, when it opens its doors at 6 p.m. For the first time, it will offer “doorbusters” online starting on Thanksgiving while supplies last. In the past, doorbusters were only at the store. Wal-Mart and Target will again start their sales at their stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, the same as last year. Best Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m., also the same. And they’ll all offer their deals earlier that day online. Wal-Mart’s will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving, earlier than last year. Target says that starting this Wednesday through this Thursday, its Black Friday early access sale will allow customers to shop a selection of Black Friday deals on its website; new this year, shoppers can get them in all stores via its Cartwheel savings app. LOOK AT THE WHOLE SEASON: Retailers have been starting to spread their offers out, with some starting well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com both kicked off holiday deals on thousands of items. Still, there’s a good chance you can get a better deal on Thanksgiving for certain items. DealNews.com says 38 per cent of the specials pushed on the holiday were what the site considered top deals, compared to only 31 per cent for Black Friday. But not every deal is the best on Thanksgiving. DealNews.com says it’s likely better to buy cameras, TVs, tablets and major appliances on Thanksgiving, and tools on Black Friday. On the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday, is also a good day for shoppers to get deep discounts on clothing and laptops. Traci Gregorski, senior vice-president of marketing at Market Track, says that Monday is also a good time to buy laptops, small appliances and toys and games, based on an analysis of more than 1,400 listings across Amazon, Best Buy, Kmart, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart. “It’s to the shoppers’ benefit to do their homework to ensure they are getting the best deal,” Gregorski said. USE APPS AND REWARDS: Strategize how to leverage the store rewards points you already have or holiday bonus offers. Look for the apps that work well for you. For example, Flipp recreates the traditional print flyer experience so you don’t have to sift through all the weekly store flyers — and not just on Black Friday. DealNews Black Friday keeps track of specials throughout the holiday season too. Plenty of retailer apps offer customers special discounts. Customers who use the Staples app will have gotten a sneak peek of the Black Friday deals, which started Sunday, and will be able to see the latest specials throughout the season. And Wal-Mart is making its Black Friday circular available starting this Thursday through its app. THINK PAST THE HOLIDAYS: If you don’t need items by the holiday — or aren’t seeing some friends and relatives until afterward, shoppers might do better waiting to buy toys and clothing like sweaters and coats until the end of the season. That lets them take advantage of clearance sales, says Glaser. For clothing, discounts are on average of 40 per cent over the Thanksgiving weekend, but at the end of the season, they go to 70 per cent. ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Next Story Movie Trailers November 11, 2016 to November 17, 2016 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Inferno (14A) 3:00pm / 6:15pm / 9:45pm Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (14A) 3:20pm / 6:45pm / 9:55pm Ouija: Origin of Evil (14A) 3:40pm / 7:10pm / 10:15pm Keeping Up with the Joneses (PG) 3:10pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm The Accountant (14A) 6:00pm / 9:20pm The Girl on the Train (14A) 10:05pm Deepwater Horizon (PG) 7:00pm   660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL German authorities raid over 200 sites of Islamic group Today at 3:29 AM City councillors discuss Green Line details Today at 2:14 AM Now you can visit the Rolling Stones’ 1962 apartment Today at 1:39 AM China says aircraft carrier now ready for combat Today at 1:37 AM Mexico weighs grim prospect of deportation wave under Trump Today at 1:03 AM City’s integrity commissioner deems no sanctions for councillor after calling out police chief Today at 12:56 AM Royal Bank of Canada to increase fixed mortgage rates as of Thursday Nov 15, 2016, 7:12 AM Man tells trial of teenage stripping game, sex at Hawkes' N.S. home in 1970s Nov 15, 2016, 6:35 AM Wildfire recovery to spur $5.3 billion in spending by end of 2019 Nov 15, 2016, 5:30 AM Report suggests more Canadians are using food banks Nov 15, 2016, 3:35 AM Researchers call for more science be put into environmental assessments Nov 15, 2016, 2:10 AM Canada still committed to NATO, Sajjan says, after Trump's campaign threats Nov 11, 2016, 3:45 PM BUSINESS SPORTSNET OIL & GAS ENTERTAINMENT US retail sales jump 0.8 pct. in sign of consumer health Nov 15, 2016, 6:48 AM Mazda recalls nearly 70K cars; fuel leaks may cause fire Nov 15, 2016, 6:43 AM Manufacturing in New York picks up slightly Nov 15, 2016, 6:35 AM TransCanada ends Mainline open season, open season bids fall short Nov 15, 2016, 6:01 AM India struggles as millions throng banks to swap currency Nov 15, 2016, 1:36 AM Eric Lindros finds peace upon entering Hockey Hall of Fame Nov 14, 2016, 10:58 PM Blue Jays transformation underway as two franchise icons depart Nov 14, 2016, 8:37 PM IIHF will come up with the 2018 Olympic money for NHL players Nov 14, 2016, 9:24 PM Bautista and Encarnacion reject qualifying offers from Blue Jays Nov 14, 2016, 6:45 PM Corey Seager, Michael Fulmer earn Rookie of the Year awards Nov 14, 2016, 7:48 PM Environmental groups concerned pipeline project will increase tanker traffic Jul 26, 2016, 8:20 AM Oil prices poised to slide, crude glut continues Jul 26, 2016, 7:33 AM "Distasteful" ad prompts Canada Action to further distance itself from former volunteer Jul 25, 2016, 2:35 PM Oil spill forces Prince Albert to shutdown water intake Jul 25, 2016, 10:11 AM ConocoPhillips Canada plans to cut upwards of 300 staff, mostly in Calgary Jul 22, 2016, 1:01 PM New exhibition celebrates the style of Princess Diana Nov 15, 2016, 7:24 AM 'Making a Murderer' nephew must say Tuesday where he'll live Nov 15, 2016, 7:10 AM Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson named People's 'Sexiest Man Alive' Nov 15, 2016, 6:45 AM Former soap actor Corey Sligh charged with child molestation Nov 15, 2016, 6:42 AM Election mourning and empowerment at Women of the Year event Nov 15, 2016, 2:59 AM Home About Us Contact Us Breaking News Alerts Advertise with us Advertise with us Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service 9912 Franklin Ave, Fort McMurray, Alberta T9H 2K5 © 2016-2016 Rogers Media.

Sharles Johnson, 51, was charged with theft after investigators say he stole the battery from the location in Turkey Creek on November 11, 2014. According to the report, Johnson wanted to confront loss prevention employees. Investigators say the suspect put the battery in a shopping cart and took it past the cash registers. The report claims Johnson admitted to taking the battery when employees stopped him and said he wanted to find out if he would be caught. The suspect said he was being profiled and harassed, according to investigators. Johnson will appear in court for sentencing on January 26.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Video Tips for Getting Deals for the Black Friday Weekend By anne d'innocenzio, ap retail writer NEW YORK  Nov 10, 2016, 11:59 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Serious deal-seekers are already planning their Thanksgiving weekend shopping, and experts believe that once again the holiday itself may offer better deals than Black Friday the day afterward. Amid the clutter of deals clamoring for attention, smart and careful shoppers can come out ahead. Many stores are increasing their inventory so as not to frustrate shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. "Start researching and planning," says Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews.com, a deal comparison website. Here are four ways to get the most out of Black Friday weekend — and beyond. STUDY UP: Make a comprehensive list of what you plan to buy, research what those items usually sell for at full price and on sale, and figure out how much you want to spend. Also check out store flyers from previous years online, since many retailers repeat the same deals at the same price. Eighty percent of the products and 43 percent of the prices highlighted on the front pages of the 2015 and 2014 Black Friday flyers of Best Buy, Macy's, Target, Kohl's, Walmart and J.C. Penney were the same, says Market Track LLC, a price tracking firm. Make sure to note at what times different stores plan to start their Black Friday deals — both online and at the store. For example, J.C. Penney is making its deals available on its website on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for the first time. It will open its doors on Thanksgiving at 3 p.m., the same time as last year. Kohl's offered last Thursday a subset of the Black Friday deals that will be available for Thanksgiving, when it opens its doors at 6 p.m. For the first time, it will offer "doorbusters" online starting on Thanksgiving while supplies last. In the past, doorbusters were only at the store. Wal-Mart and Target will again start their sales at their stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, the same as last year. Best Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m., also the same. And they'll all offer their deals earlier that day online. Wal-Mart's will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving, earlier than last year. Target says that starting this Wednesday through this Thursday, its Black Friday early access sale will allow customers to shop a selection of Black Friday deals on its website; new this year, shoppers can get them in all stores via its Cartwheel savings app. LOOK AT THE WHOLE SEASON: Retailers have been starting to spread their offers out, with some starting well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com both kicked off holiday deals on thousands of items. Still, there's a good chance you can get a better deal on Thanksgiving for certain items. DealNews.com says 38 percent of the specials pushed on the holiday were what the site considered top deals, compared to only 31 percent for Black Friday. But not every deal is the best on Thanksgiving. DealNews.com says it's likely better to buy cameras, TVs, tablets and major appliances on Thanksgiving, and tools on Black Friday. On the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday, is also a good day for shoppers to get deep discounts on clothing and laptops. Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, says that Monday is also a good time to buy laptops, small appliances and toys and games, based on an analysis of more than 1,400 listings across Amazon, Best Buy, Kmart, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart. "It's to the shoppers' benefit to do their homework to ensure they are getting the best deal," Gregorski said. USE APPS AND REWARDS: Strategize how to leverage the store rewards points you already have or holiday bonus offers. Look for the apps that work well for you. For example, Flipp recreates the traditional print flyer experience so you don't have to sift through all the weekly store flyers — and not just on Black Friday. DealNews Black Friday keeps track of specials throughout the holiday season too. Plenty of retailer apps offer customers special discounts. Customers who use the Staples app will have gotten a sneak peek of the Black Friday deals, which started Sunday, and will be able to see the latest specials throughout the season. And Wal-Mart is making its Black Friday circular available starting this Thursday through its app. THINK PAST THE HOLIDAYS: If you don't need items by the holiday — or aren't seeing some friends and relatives until afterward, shoppers might do better waiting to buy toys and clothing like sweaters and coats until the end of the season. That lets them take advantage of clearance sales, says Glaser. For clothing, discounts are on average of 40 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend, but at the end of the season, they go to 70 percent. ——— Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio 0 Shares Email Star Comments Tips for Getting Deals for the Black Friday Weekend " Obama Says He Knew Americans Were Angry Before Election " Obama: World Leaders Must Heed People's Economic Fears " Obama Says Trump Told Him He Would Support NATO, After Threats to Abandon It Official in West Virginia on Leave After Racist Obama Post Hollande: US Must Respect 'Irreversible' Climate Deal " Russia Launches New Offensive, Airstrikes Hit Syria's Aleppo " Escaped Murder Suspect Who Fled Through Open Door in Missouri Back in Custody " ICC Prosecutors: US Forces May Have Committed War Crimes " 5 Takeaways From Donald Trump's '60 Minutes' Interview " GOP Lawmakers Struggle to Respond as Democrats Denounce Bannon Hire " Trump Tells Putin He Wants 'Strong' Relationship With Russia " Could Trump Really Dismantle the Iran Nuke Deal?

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Thanksgiving Day Shopping Is Here To Stay -- With Some Tweaks By Anne DInnocenzio PUBLISHED: NOVEMBER 10 2016 Thanksgiving Day shopping -- a delight to some, an anathema to others -- isn't going away, but some stores are rethinking their strategies on whether it makes sense to be open on the holiday itself. Many of the nation's major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney, and Macy's, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. "Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it's hard," said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. "More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it's not making much business sense." Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy's, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers' time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it's all about stealing share in a market that isn't growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl's and Macy's. That may have hurt Macy's, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy's decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl's will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. -- the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn't open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. But all indications are they'll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. AlixPartners also found for that some retailers who did open on Thanksgiving were simply pulling Friday sales a day earlier and their profit margins took a hit. Bob Riesbeck, president and CEO of hhgregg, says business on Thanksgiving actually declined over the previous two years when it opened at 4 p.m. CBL's Lebovitz says when he surveyed stores in the company's malls this year before deciding to close, the reaction was "overwhelmingly positive," particularly with the specialty stores. The big anchors plan to stay open. Last year, the reaction was different. Most of the specialty stores wanted to be open. "They didn't have enough data" to make the decision," he said. Andy Mantis, executive vice president of NPD Group Checkout Tracking, says stores should open on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday to maximize their sales. The company, which analyzes receipt data to understand consumer behavior, found that the share of buyers who shopped on both days declined, while the number who shopped only on Thanksgiving Day or on Black Friday increased. Mantis believes specialty retailers, especially those near big stores like Macy's that are open, should think again about whether to stay closed. "It is a heavy promotion time," Mantis said. "People are buying, and they're not always willing to go to multiple stores." © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Photos Fashion Shopping Music Movies TV Share < br />this article: Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and More React to Donald Trump’s Presidency Nick Mangione | November 10, 2016 - 10:37 am Share < br />this article: View the Gallery / 8 Photos Bernie Sanders Comments on Donald Trump’s Shocking Win Every American is dealing with it in their own way MORE >> The election is over, but the late-night jokes don’t stop for anything. And now that we know definitively that Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States, we get to see how each late night host reacted to the news. James Corden reminded us that no matter who we voted for, the important thing is we all got stickers. Corden threw in a jab at Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson before launching into an uplifting monologue about how excited his 3-year-old son was when he first learned they were moving to America. “Somehow he knew intrinsically that this was a fantastic place to live. It’s a country of opportunity and diversity and hope, and that will never change.” Jimmy Kimmel reminded us that at least the election is over and done before wondering what kind of future each political figure will have now. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will be a tollbooth operator, Bernie Sanders is a Wal-Mart greeter and Hillary Clinton is screaming into a pillow. Jimmy Fallon, who was criticized earlier this year for his light treatment of Trump in an interview kept things characteristically light on The Tonight Show, according to Us Weekly. “That’s right, Donald Trump is going to be president. Republicans hope that he will keep his promise to build a wall and Democrats hope that he’ll keep his promise and not accept the election results.” He cracked jokes about Trump being the first president to hang his own portrait and how “he couldn’t do it without the love of his life, his rock, his better half, FBI director James Comey.” Fallon also joked about how President Barack Obama is dealing with all this. “President Obama called him last night to congratulate him and even invited him for a meeting to the White House. Of course, it was hard to understand Obama because at the time he was chewing 80 pieces of Nicorrette. Celebs Who Aren't Afraid to Bash Donald Trump 12 Photos » Conan O’Brien, meanwhile, admitted that yesterday was a really strange day. O’Brien offered the comforting thought that we’ve been here before, but “in America, we get to choose who’s going to ruin our country and that’s a privilege.” Samantha Bee was more pointed in her commentary. “How did everyone get this so spectacularly wrong?” she asked. She confessed that, being born in Canada, this was her first election as a U.S. Citizen. “I voted in an American election for the first time and I broke America.” She continued to say that America is still a great country that’s worth fighting for. Finally, Seth Meyers kicked his show off on a hopeful note, reminding us the first woman president is still out there right now. “Whoever you are, I hope I live to see your inauguration,” he said. Meyers also went over how wrong he was about his Trump predictions every step of the way and says that if the pattern continues, Trump is probably going to be a great president.

Why is there some kind of unspoken law in the mainstream consciousness that to have a “noble” profession you need a four-year Bachelor of Science degree just to get out of bed in the morning and not be doomed to the cash register at Dollar General for the rest of your life? I am not saying this to criticize working at retail jobs, or Dollar General, or Walmart, or any other unskilled job out there. There is a valuable place in the career path of someone working these jobs, and most of us have done them. I’m old enough to have pumped gas at a gas station, I’ve been a busboy in a kitchen, was a helper on construction sites, hauled shingles for roofers, and swept floors in body shops. All those low-paying jobs gave me experience, perspective, and a little scratch (but not much, which inspired me to get a better job). Entry-level jobs are a “dues paying” segment in one’s life, and part of a skilled trades vocational pathway. Trades are noble careers in and amongst themselves that one can build a successful life upon. Without a skill you can’t be an HVAC contractor, open a tune-up shop, bodyshop, or cabinet shop. Master a trade and a business is born. American small business is the largest tax generator in this country. Politicians choose to call taxes “revenues,” but like it or not, our society runs on taxation so let’s call a thing a thing. Nobody pays more tax than small business, and small business is skilled trades. A career in a skilled trade is a way of life for the vast majority of Americans. So why is this not in the dialog of mainstream America? The saying goes, “you are what you do.” I am an automotive technician because I repair cars, but that’s not where it ends … I’m a journalist because I’m a repair technician, video producer, TV personality, TV producer, public speaker, entrepreneur, patent holder, car designer, and skilled trades instructor … all built on the foundation of an automotive repair technician. Working with your hands does not keep you from dreaming big, and a foundation in the trades does not limit ones future. It pisses me off to see skilled trades represented as a second-class existence. Once, I stopped an argument with a former brother-in-law by whipping out paycheck stubs when I was a collision shop painter. That I was making $20K more a year than him, with his two bachelor’s degrees and a master’s degree, shut him right up. Skilled trades workers built this country (and every other country) and should be recognized and celebrated. Having a trade should be a logical and intelligent career path alternative that can give you the tools to move on to your ultimate destiny. Wake up, America! Wanna “make change?” Wanna change the direction of our country and this stagnant economy? Change this ridiculous stigma placed on skilled trades careers and let’s change the conversation. Wake up, America! Wake up, politicians, and speak up if you’re a proud tradesman! My collar is blue. Just sayin.

Ten members of the Nederland Board of Trustees, Downtown Development Authority and Planning Commission and about 25 members of the public listened to the presentation and then participated in a joint work session. The presentation was brought to Nederland by Downtown Colorado, Inc., a nonprofit, membership association committed to building better communities by providing assistance to Colorado downtowns, commercial districts and town centers. Minicozzi gave a slide presentation explaining how cities increase property tax revenues by increasing the density of downtown areas. He said he wanted to explain how taxation works because the policies run counter to smart growth. “You have to be careful of the questions you ask,” Minicozzi said. “Make sure your gathering all the data you can.” Minicozzi is a founding member of the Asheville Design Center, a nonprofit community design center dedicated to creating livable communities across Western North Carolina. Before moving to Asheville, he was the primary administrator of the Form Based Code for downtown West Palm Beach, Florida. Minnicozzi has developed award-winning analytical tools that have received national attention, and he is sought after as a lecturer. Minicozzi told the residents and Board members that most of the buildings in downtown Asheville had become so dilapidated they needed to be torn down. A man came along and invested $15 million into the downtown buildings and infrastructure, and the Town benefited from his investment through increased property taxes on the buildings, which had increased in value. The more the city and residents added businesses and improvements to the downtown district, the better the city did financially. Minicozzi compared property taxes from a heavy downtown area with an area covered with a big box store, such as Wal-Mart. The downtown area made considerably more in property taxes than a big store and parking lot because of the density of the occupants. “You have to keep it in balance,” Minicozzi said. You have to have a lot of single family residential areas and this business stuff. From a land use perspective, what use of your land has the greatest potential? Minicozzi said he was going to Clear Creek tomorrow. The Henderson Mine is closing in the area, and it brings in 30 percent of total property taxes, Minicozzi said. “Most of these folks don’t know how bad it’s going to be when it shuts down.” Idaho Springs is a little bit ahead of Nederland as far as downtowns go, Minicozzi said. They have a downtown business district valued at $4.6 million an acre, and they have residences right across the street from Starbucks. Minicozzi also did a study of Durango last year. The town is a lot more isolated than Nederland, which has traffic coming up from Boulder and Denver. They push for a lot of open space so less than 50 percent of the land is taxable, and 45 percent has to pay for the rest. About 1 percent of the acreage provides about 35 per cent of the property tax income. City residential is more potent that Home Depot for property taxes. “Start with your data and then add your value statements on top of that,” Minicozzi said. After the presentation, Mayor Kristopher Larsen said that since so many people attended they would throw it open to questions from the public. Local Business Owner Ron Mitchell said he was a major business owner in the downtown area and wondered if Minicozzi had any recommendations of what might work here. Minicozzi said that he doesn’t have the financial pictures of where the Town is. “You guys need to develop. I’m familiar with your plan and your project,” Minicozzi said to Mitchell. “It’s a very big project that would have dramatic change to your community. “If you’re going to have change, how you do that is something you guys are going to have to have a conversation about. I can’t solve it after one conversation,” Minicozzi said. He said the town needs to have a style and design conversation, saying the Katmandu Restaurant is just a box with a weird thing around it. “You could be in worse spots. You could be Missouri.” After questions, the work session began among Nederland Board members with the intention of discussing density and how Nederland will approach downtown development and identifying the next steps to get past the obstacles. The next meeting of the Nederland Downtown Development Authority will be at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, November 16, 2016, at the Nederland Community Center.

Home News Community Opinion Sports Obituaries Public Notices Photo Gallery Classifieds Special Publications Athletes of the Week Business Directory Beauty Spot Pets of the Week Rack Locations Subscriptions Contact Tuesday, November 15, 2016 MARC HOOVER The season to be jolly November 10th, 2016    Author: Administrator    Filed Under: Opinion Marc HooverEveryone knows the holidays are officially here when large box stores began setting up their Christmas displays. For instance, while at Walmart, employees had pushed the Halloween leftovers into the center of the store and reduced prices for an easy sell. People were picking through them faster than a Turkey Buzzard devouring roadkill. Meanwhile, in another section of the store, the Santa and reindeer displays had occupied their own real estate. After Walmart, I went to Toys R Us to find a train set for my grandson. He loves trains, which he refers to as “Choo Choos.” While at Toys R Us, Santa Claus sat near the bikes. He was asking a precocious child what he wanted for Christmas. And when Santa Claus begins ringing bells and taking requests from children, Christmas is near. Since the dawn of time, people have always used landmarks to figure the time. For instance, after a long day of hunting for food, the Neanderthal man didn’t wear a watch or have a cell phone. They used the sun, moon and climate changes to decide the seasons. If it was cold outside, cave-dwellers knew this meant they needed a new coat. Too bad they didn’t have big box stores available. It would have been easier to buy a coat at a box store than to kill an unsuspecting animal for his fur. Today, you can tell the season based on what’s on sale at the box stores. Pumpkins, advertisements for pumpkin farms and haunted houses suggest cool fall weather. Also, you have school supply sales and clearance on children’s clothing to signal that summer is over and kids are returning to school. When we see fireworks, we know we are 14 days into summer. Living for the holidays makes America great. Even better? The next one. Holidays bring families together for meals, shopping trips, vacations, infighting and memorable road trips. Who else can remember mom or dad threatening to “turn this car around” if you and your siblings didn’t stop raising a ruckus in the backseat? Unfortunately, the holidays arrive and leave so quickly, we never enjoy them. As you celebrate them, you’re already preparing for the next one. Thanksgiving has always been my favorite. What is better than a lazy day at home eating turkey and watching NFL games? That’s life at its best. After Thanksgiving, people will engage in mortal combat on Black Friday. Somewhere in America, a television or blender will soon incite people to engage in fisticuffs and tomfoolery. Here’s what’s funny about Black Friday. Washcloths are one of the most popular items sold on Black Friday. A few years ago, I had read that Walmart “cleans up” on selling them. It sounds great because washcloths will never go out of style. Besides, cleanliness is next to godliness. So if you stock up on enough wash clothes, you won’t need to buy any more until the next Black Friday. People buying and using wash clothes is good for sales and noses everywhere. Marc is a grandparent and longtime resident of Clermont County.

Credit: Alain Herzog / EPFL Cerebral Implants allow Primates afflicted with Paralysis to Walk once Again   Apparently, cerebral implants have allowed primates afflicted with debilitating paralysis to walk once again. This is nothing short of a scientific miracle and the technology may someday work in humans too. A group of researchers has managed to employ a wireless implant that allows rhesus macaques to walk despite suffering from paralysis. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals The work of these dedicated scientists was published in the journal Nature recently. This is the first time a neural implant has made locomotion possible in monkeys that had been immobile due to disability from the waist down. This effort is based upon neural technologies that had been developing side by side and keeping pace with the changing times. Signals recorded from the motor cortex of the brain are used to stimulate coordinated action potential in the nerves of the spinal column. This then gives the monkeys a chance to walk despite being paralyzed. When the procedure was applied in the lab, the monkeys regained normal locomotion like they had not been paralyzed at all. It just goes to show you that science has a lot of surprises up its sleeves. Later on in the future, this system could be modified so that it becomes applicable to human beings too. Some preliminary testing will be needed before the nascent technology becomes viable in human beings. A few challenges do lie ahead since it is a large leap from primates to people. The complex brains of homo sapiens demand that greater care and precision be used in building the brain implant. Walking is essentially a coordinated effort made possible thanks to the brain and the spinal column working in harmony. In the lower lumbar region, the signals of the nerves lead to a promotion of activity in the legs. Injury to the upper spine may lead to disruption of nerve signals and so walking may become an impossibility. It is this exact neurological glitch that the brain implant rectifies. The re-establishment of communication between the brain and the spinal cord is the goal of this revolutionary technology. The electrode that is implanted in the brain is about the size of a pill. So far the experiment has been a success in monkeys. The fact that it is wireless in its operations makes it even more of a wonderful surprise for the layperson who is unaware of the bonanza that modern science has access to. The rest of the work is all about finetuning this technology so that the primates can walk in a more balanced manner. This will take time and effort.

Seattle, Washington (PRWEB) November 10, 2016 BooginHead, founded by seasoned executive and award-winning working mother Sari Davidson announces the official expansion of the company’s line of innovative children’s products with the launch of five new products: PaciPal, PaciPurse, a new Silicone version of the original PaciGrip, Monster Bibs, and Teether Bibs. All products were introduced to the market at the recent All Baby & Children’s annual industry trade show, and are available to the marketplace both online and through various retailers including Target.com, BabiesRUs, BuyBuyBaby, Walmart, HEB, Burlington Coat Factory, Amazon, and more. PaciPal is a universal pacifier holder designed as a plush animal. Unlike other plush pacifier holders in the marketplace, PaciPal doesn’t limit the baby to a specific pacifier, but instead allows the parent to choose any pacifier or teether to the plush character that they see best suitable for their baby. Furthermore, when the baby is no longer using a pacifier, the four Pals become a toy that is soothing and comforting, making it a product that goes well beyond the first few months. The new PaciPurse helps ensure that parents always have a clean pacifier on hand whether moving through everyday life, or traveling. Designed similar to a coin purse, the PaciPurse is easy to open and includes a swivel snap hook and kiss lock that allows for easy attachment to a stroller or diaper bag and ensuring easy, one-handed accessibility. Currently there are two designs that are durable and non-toxic for the modern parent. Adding a new twist on an original, the team also introduced a food-grade silicone version of the classic PaciGrip which is textured for teething babies. As with the original, this PaciGrip allows a parent to use the pacifier of their choice while ensuring that it doesn’t’ fall to the ground and get dirty or lost. In this version, the pacifier is an added feature with the texture which is great for sensory as well as teething, letting the product serve dual purposes. Two new bibs are also available from BooginHead this year. After much research, the team has now launched Monster Bibs and Teether Bibs. Monster Bibs are made of 100% quick-drying polyester and are designed with a velcro-closure and a zipper pouch that allows for on-the-go storages of utensils or snacks. They come in two fun “monster” designs and also serve to catch any food that doesn’t quite make it into the toddler’s mouth. The Teether Bibs were designed for babies that have excessive drool due to teething or other common issues. The super absorbent cotton bib helps prevent drool rash, keeps clothing dry, and also has an attached food-grade silicone teether that massages baby’s gums. It’s available in four patterns, all of which are BPA, PVC, and Phthalate-free. “Expansion of the line is always exciting for us,” says Sari Davidson, Founder, CEO and Chief BooginHead. “We are constantly researching the marketplace, working with actual parents, and investigating new materials and options that will align with our consistent mission of offering parents products that are useful and also stylish while remaining affordable.” Images and samples available for media. About BooginHead Founded in 2007 by a seasoned executive and busy working mother in San Ramon, California, BooginHead has always been a company set out to create functional products that solve a problem at a price they can afford. The first product introduced to the juvenile space was the original SippiGrip; an invention Sari Davidson created after one too many throws of a sippy cup by her toddler. The brand has now expanded to include more than 19 products including the celebrity-loved PaciGrips, BlanketGrips, feeding sets and related accessories, refillable food containers and other storage items that are beautiful, affordable, and most of all useful to parents.

Another brother toiled for decades in the housekeeping department at our hometown hospital; it closed two years ago. A nephew has a job at Walmart. Presidential Race Riordan: After Trump victory, stronger together Trump lands knockout blow to establishment Inquirer Editorial: With the presidency decided, time for Americans to come together So I know a bit about the "working-class whites" who are being credited with/blamed for electing the detestable Donald Trump. And while no Trump ballots were cast among my five siblings and me, some extended family members may have voted for him. I'd like to think they were no more motivated by racism, xenophobia, or ignorance than were my middle-class gay white Republican friends - good people who see their guy's triumph ushering in "a whole new world," as one of them Facebook-messaged me Wednesday morning. As for what such a world might look like, Trump's campaign trail is littered with ugly hints and uglier threats. His belligerence is troubling, and so are his promises about jobs for working-class people, because they're as empty as the husks of casinos he used to own in Atlantic City. Garish and enormous, those vacant structures, and the thousands of lost jobs they represent, remind me of the blank faces of the factories in the New England town where I was born. When I was growing up in North Adams, Mass., in the 1950s and '60s, the paper, textile, and footwear mills that had sustained generations of mostly white ethnic families were fading fast. Almost every one of those jobs has since disappeared. And no matter what size a rhetorical sledgehammer the new president uses on the trade agreements he blames for robbing Americans of employment opportunities, they're not coming back - any more than they're coming back to Camden. It was there, about 15 years ago, that I attended a news conference in the shuttered headquarters of what was once a major local bank. For some reason the event was staged in the former company cafeteria, where the sight of vintage commercial kitchen equipment gathering dust startled me into realizing just how many sorts of jobs had vanished when the bank was acquired, merged, moved, or closed. Such decisions weren't made by the employees, any more than the mill workers in my hometown decided to shift their plant's operations to nonunion states. Owners and top management - people like Trump, in other words - made those decisions, driven by concerns far more compelling to them than the fate of some anonymous burger-flipper or machine operator. As for the fate of the families whose heads of household became jobless due to front office politics and boardroom machinations? Sorry. Those are the breaks. Along with magical vows to create jobs, Trump's campaign served up plenty of red dog-whistle meat to mollify not just members of a formerly more prosperous working class, but all sorts of people hungry to have their real and (more often) imaginary resentments acknowledged. If not inflamed. But the boilerplate on our president-elect's campaign website, with its bullet points and polished aura of seriousness, is nearly fatuous. His denunciations of the (fill in the blank) people supposedly filching jobs that rightfully belong to the (presumably white) American working class are misleading and repellent. The hope I hear people express on social media about what Trump's victory will mean for America makes me deeply sad. The notion of a leader shaking up or even laying waste to "the system" from which the little people understandably feel disenfranchised - including a mass media that ignores or treats them as an anthropological curiosity - has an appeal I can appreciate. But in the towns where Walmart is the biggest employer and folks are barely getting by, in the impressive array of Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that helped put him over the top, the impact of Trump's job creation fantasies will be less than zero. In voting for this singularly unqualified real estate developer/reality TV host, who has gut-level disdain for the institutions and mechanisms of governance, working class white people - my people - and many other good and not-so-good people have been fooled.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Donald Trump is the president-elect of the United States, even though political pundits predicted that he would not even win the Republican presidential nomination. In the end, more 59 million Americans voted for him. On inauguration day in January, many of Trump’s voters will be looking forward – among other campaign promises – to the construction of a wall along the Mexican border. This means a physical barrier over 3,000 kilometres in length, on a border that one million people legally cross on a daily basis, producing half a trillion dollars in annual trade. The promised wall Trump compared his projected border barrier to the Great Wall of China. The wall, as Trump has dreamt it, will be as high as 17 metres. It will have a “big, fat, beautiful door” that will only let legal migrants enter the US. The wall is supposed to keep Mexican and Latin American “bad hombres” – who Trump generally conceives as drug traffickers, criminals and “rapists” – away from the US. Trump has promised that Mexico will pay for the wall. When he has been asked about how he is supposed to make Mexico pay for it, he has threatened either war or cutting off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that Mexican migrants send to Mexico. The wall was central to Trump’s campaign. He now has to deliver on his promises – however outrageous or irrational they may have been. The time for Mexico (and the rest of the world) has thus come. The sheer fact of Trump’s victory sent the Mexican peso plummeting in global markets. Mexico is officially the first victim of the Trump effect. The wall that is already there Ironically, Trump’s wall is already there. Its foundation stone was laid as early as 1848. In 1845, the US annexed Texas, which Mexico considered part of its territory. Mexican claims over Texas prompted the US to invade Mexico in 1846. The military campaign was finalised by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which established the US-Mexican border at the Río Bravo, and ceded more than half of Mexican territory to the US. A marble monument built in Tijuana commemorates the day Mexico and the US agreed to the current border lines. The territorial spoils of the Mexican-American War allowed the US to emerge as a world power in the late 19th century. The peace that followed the war, from a Mexican perspective, established a bitter pattern of political, economic and military inequality between the two countries. This asymmetrical relationship has haunted Mexican-US relations ever since. Enter globalisation. Wall construction along the Mexican-American border began during former president Bill Clinton’s administration, 21 years before Trump’s wall-building promise. The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 displaced hundreds of thousands of Mexicans as small business owners and farmers were crushed under the corporate muscle of giants such as, for example, Walmart or Cargill. American officers foresaw this collateral effect of NAFTA, and rushed to harden immigration laws. In 1996, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The act approved the construction of a 22.5km fence near San Diego. Clinton thus replaced the barbed-wire fence at the border with an iron wall. The metal sheets that make up the fence were originally used by the US military to land planes during the Gulf War. President George W Bush continued Clinton’s work. In 2006, the Secure Fence Act – signed on the wave of post 9/11 security panic – resulted in setting aside of several laws to build almost 1400km of fencing in the border. Legal impediments on water and air pollution, endangered species and Native American heritage, among other matters, were waived to allow the construction of the wall. When the history of the physical barriers constructed along the Mexican-American border is read in these terms, it is preposterous to pretend that the wall-building techniques used by the Chinese in the eighth century to control their borders will still be useful in the 21st century. Borders are meant to be crossed by people who do not necessarily have the resources to pay a visa. Nobody leaves his homeland without a reason. If Mexicans and Latin Americans could find the same economic opportunities they search for in the US in their countries, they would probably not leave. Trump’s promised wall has hence only made evident the hypocrisy of the supposed defenders of Latin American migrants in the US. Trump has explicitly said that the American Dream is not meant for everyone. His predecessors – including Barack Obama, the American president who has deported the largest number of undocumented migrants (2.6 million) in American history – simply preferred an inconspicuous style of getting things done. Another brick In 1848, article XI of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo gave the US responsibility for controlling “hostile Indian incursions” in Mexico. Today, it is Mexico that watches over the border for the US, preventing Central and South American migrants from crossing it. On August 31 2016, Trump hastily visited Mexico and met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. The meeting was deemed a major political failure in Mexico. Mexicans felt betrayed because Peña Nieto did not comment on Trump’s repeated insults against both Mexico and Mexican people. There was little reflection, however, on Peña Nieto’s claims about Central and South American migrants. Peña Nieto referred to a “humanitarian crisis” caused by “an increasing number of non-Mexicans” crossing the Mexican-American border. He also advocated for a bilateral agenda on “national security”, aimed at controlling the flow of “undocumented people and illegal drugs and weapons”. There was not a single mention to the dangers that Central and South American migrants face in Mexico as they ride “The Beast” – that is, the Mexican network of freight trains. Central and South American migrants “ride The Beast” atop the moving trains because there are no passenger railcars. They face obvious physical dangers that range from amputation to death, if they fall or are pushed. Beyond the dangers of the trains themselves, migrants are subject to extortion and violence at the hands of the gangs criminal groups that control the routes into the US. Migrants in Central America take on ‘The Beast’. Reuters After visiting Mexico, Trump ridiculed Peña Nieto in his infamous Phoenix speech on immigration policy. He smugly used the Mexican president to boost his campaign. His major triumph, however, was the adoption of his views on immigration by the Mexican government. On Trump’s side, there was an unsurprising lack of empathy. On the Mexican side, however, there was a shameful lack of courage in acknowledging the role that Mexico plays in enforcing on non-Mexican migrants the harsh immigration policies that Mexicans loathe and fear from the US. All in all, as Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli has suggested, the Mexican government became that day just another brick in Trump’s wall. Taming the beast On 15 August 2016 – just a few days before Trump’s visit – article 11 of the Mexican Constitution was amended to grant refugees the right to both seek and be granted asylum in Mexico. In similar terms, the draft Constitution of Mexico City defines Mexico’s capital as refuge and destination of migrations and exiles. A sensible response to Trump’s international bullying demands Mexico to take these principles and ideals seriously. If Mexico wants to escape Trump’s asphyxiating grasp, it needs to tame “The Beast” by protecting the non-Mexican migrants who cross into its own territory and treating them with the dignity they deserve. For Mexico, the only way to overcome Trump is by showing him that he may have the power and the money to build a huge wall, but he has neither justice nor reason on his side.

By Michael Liedtke, Associated Press and Associated Press PUBLISHED: August 31, 2016 at 12:00 am | UPDATED: September 5, 2016 at 12:18 pm SAN FRANCISCO — Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The plans will build upon a test service that Google’s navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn’t trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider’s work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers’ belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet, was among Uber’s early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber’s board because of potential conflicts with Google’s ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond’s departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to “continued cooperation and partnership” with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze’s carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple’s board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google’s Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple’s iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone’s software to create Android.

Downing says he believes open store space and clean shelves make for a more comfortable experience for customers and emphasizes the fact that inventory rotates constantly and products are sold at up to half off retail price. × 2 of 2 Expand Photo by David Colburn A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the store. Prev Next GRANITE CITY — In the past six months, Sean Downing’s life has changed considerably. With a history in the criminal justice field and experience as a district manager in the restaurant industry, a mentor recently led Downing down a new path. “I buy close-outs and discontinued items from all the well-known big box retailers, such as Walmart, and I’m able to sell them at a reduced price,” Downing says. Discount Liquidation Products, 3667 Nameoki Road, is what Downing describes as “an independently owned Big Lots.” With a keen eye toward products that sustain only superficial box damage, Downing ensures each item passes a safety inspection and sells it to the public at a discount price. “Everything is sold at up to 50 percent off its retail cost,” Downing says. “No one can beat our prices.” Downing says setup of shelf space and inventory plays a major role in customers’ comfort. “Customers don’t like to wade through boxes,” he says. “I could fit more rows in the store, but that would make for a less comfortable shopping experience. There’s an appeal to a nice clean shelf.” Alongside its low prices and open store space, Discount Liquidation Products promises a memorable shopping experience with each visit. “Every three or four days, there’s a new mix,” Downing says. “We rotate inventory constantly, from everyday items, home appliances, hotel sheets, comforter sets, blankets and our special ‘99 cent’ wall full of unique trinkets. Once a section’s gone, we build a new display.” In the center of the store are displays Downing deems “one-time blowouts,” featuring specialty items that may not be available again. As a new business — situated between K-Mart and Goodwill on Nameoki Road — Downing says his goal is to build a relationship with customers and the community. “Customer service is our big focus,” Downing says. “After all the standard opening tasks — vacuuming the floor, turning the lights on and daily operations — it’s all about customer service, from greeting each customer, waiting at the cash register, holding the door, you name it.” Even with the doors of Discount Liquidation Products only open for a year, Downing has already had his share of memorable experiences. “A family recently came in that didn’t have much money and a newborn,” he says. “They were looking at two strollers but didn’t have quite enough money for both, so I told them that there was a special deal that day: the 99th customer would get a huge savings discount.” Downing says he believes putting the philosophy of “above and beyond” in action separates Discount Liquidation Products from its competition. Through a commitment to customer comfort, service and satisfaction, residents are beginning to take notice. “Some of the ladies that stop by to shop on a regular basis call us ‘the cute, neat store,’” Downing says.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Amway Review – The Pros and Cons of Running an Amway Business Posted on November 9, 2016 by admin Amway Review Before I get into this review of Amway let me introduce myself. My name is Ben Biel and I’ve been involved with the network marketing industry for over 20 years. My summer vacations were spent at network marketing conventions as a kid and my parents have been involved in over 20 different companies. I’ve had a love – hate relationship with this industry which, I think, gives me the ability to offer a balanced perspective of the companies I review. I use a simple pro/con method of evaluating that is by no means exhaustive but will hopefully help you to confirm any research you’ve already done on Amway. Amway Corporate Pros and Cons Pros– Amway is the oldest and largest network marketing company in the world and does over $9 billion in annual sales. If you decide to build an organization with Amway you can be sure that the company isn’t going to file chapter 11 and destroy all your hard work. Cons– Amway’s reputation. Almost everyone has heard of Amway and those who haven’t will undoubtedly have someone in their life you will gladly offer their opinion. In some respects Amway has earned it’s bad reputation because of it’s cloak and dagger marketing techniques but on the other hand most of the people with a real bad opinion of them think it’s a “pyramid scheme” which gives away their ignorance. Amway Product Pros and Cons Pros– Amway has a large range of products including nutritional supplements, cleaning products and cosmetics. All of their products are well made and would certainly rank in the top 10 for each of the products they sell with many in the top 3. For example you would be hard pressed to find a better laundry soap than SA8 and it is considered a high efficiency, concentrated and green and it’s been on the market for decades. Cons– Although the products are high quality most of them are overpriced. Even if they are not overpriced (i.e. the quality of the product justifies the higher price) it is difficult to convince people that they should switch mail order product that they used to buy at the grocery store or Wal-Mart for half the price. There is also a ton of competition. 90% of the other network marketing companies out there have products that compete with one or more of Amway’s product lines, often at a more attractive price. Amway Business Pros and Cons. Pros– The main pro to doing the Amway business is it’s commitment to personal development. The level of mentorship is extremely high and they focus a lot on building community and support for it’s Independent Business Operators. Another pro is the profit sharing which is huge but you have to be a Diamond before you qualify which less than 1% of IBO’s do. Cons– All the personal development costs a fortune. Most of the people I know who have started an Amway business quit because they couldn’t afford the personal development. They amount of product you must personally consume or sell is also a deterrent, over $500/mo. Another con is it’s marketing approach. People are trained not to tell people it’s Amway and often told to lie if someone asks if it’s Amway. This tactic leads to mistrust and resentment and adds to Amway’s poor reputation. Their marketing plan has not been updated in over 21 years. I found an old Amway business plan in my Dad’s office from 1989 and it had the exact same plan that a friend of mine pitched to me when he tried to get me to join his Amway business in early 2010. Most of it was word for word. They have not changed anything to new technology, the internet or social media. Amway’s compensation plan highly favors the top earners and doesn’t give a great platform for new people to earn money quickly. Dollar for dollar most other companies do much better. For example my fiend in Amway has an organization that does about $120,000/mo in sales and he earns about $1500/mo. I have friends in a different company that do $60,000/mo in sales for their whole team and they earn about $3,000/mo. That’s a 400% difference. Amway Review Conclusion Amway is a great company that helps a lot of people. Everyone in this industry owes a lot to them for blazing the trail for all the other great companies that followed in their footsteps. That being said I think the time for making big money with Amway is over. There are lots of good networking companies with comparable products and better compensation plans that it would be easier to build a business with. Now, those of you who are passionate about Amway’s products or business it can still be done. I know of a guy who is sponsoring 10 people a week into his Amway business but he is not following the corporate business model at all. He uses purchased phone leads and calls over 300 people a day!

Mark Hicks, The Detroit News 10:56 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 Oakland County Sheriff’s officials arrested a 65-year-old driver accused of striking two pedestrians Tuesday at a Wal-Mart parking lot in Lyon Township. Oakland County Sheriff’s officials arrested a 65-year-old driver accused of striking two pedestrians Tuesday at a Wal-Mart parking lot in Lyon Township. Witnesses told investigators that a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado pickup fled after hitting the pair at about 1 p.m. as they pushed a shopping cart from the store in the 30000 block of Lyon Center Drive, sheriff’s officials said in a statement. Both victims, identified as a 74-year-old woman and an 82-year-old man from South Lyon, “were knocked to the ground and complained of injuries,” the release read. Paramedics transported them to St. John Providence Park Hospital in Novi, where they were listed in stable condition. Meanwhile, deputies found the unoccupied pickup parked near the accident scene and contacted the registered owner, who identified the driver, according to the release. They called the Lyon Township man, who talked with investigators at a Sheriff’s Office substation. That’s where he admitted to hitting the shoppers in the truck. Deputies also learned that the Secretary of State had suspended his driver’s license and he “had a prior conviction for driving while license suspended,” officials said. The driver was arrested and held at the Oakland County Jail for leaving the scene of a personal injury accident; driving while license suspended, second offense; and an unrelated misdemeanor warrant stemming from an alcohol-related charge, the Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday.

The immediate challenge is in trying to figure out what type of president he will be. His campaign was so improvised and make-it-up-as-you-go-along that it’s difficult to know what he will really do once he’s in the White House. For Nigeria and Africa, it is even worse – he hardly ever spoke about them during his campaign, if at all. So how does one even begin to think about what a Trump presidency means for Nigeria? Let’s try a mixture of educated guesses and speculation. Nigeria’s $1bn Eurobond Nigeria’s plan to borrow money from the international bond markets has been known for more than a year. Somehow, the government has contrived to delay the process to the point where all we’ve heard now is that it will happen in December. It is bad enough that Nigeria was planning to ‘disturb’ the markets for only $1bn when Argentina and Saudi Arabia have raised over $30bn this year alone. What’s worse is that the markets are likely to shut up shop for the next 3 months at least until people figure out President Trump’s direction. He’s known to not be a fan of the Federal Reserve Governor, Janet Yellen, so if he finds a way to get rid of her, that will likely signal change in direction for interest rates. Foreign investors are unlikely to have time for Nigeria while they are still trying to figure out President Trump’s policy direction. Which means Nigeria’s desperately needed Eurobond issue will be delayed possibly till Q2 2017. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) The good thing about AGOA is that it was renewed in 2015 for 10 years. It is currently the centrepiece of America’s trade policy with Africa and has delivered many benefits especially around textiles. Walmart, for example, now sources a lot of its trousers from Ghana. The fact that African goods under AGOA can get into the US market tariff free helps to make them competitive. But if there is one thing everyone is clear about President Trump, it is his views on international trade. To put it simply; he’s not a big fan of international trade and he wants to take jobs back to America for Americans. If and when African exports become large enough to cause job losses in America (e.g. American firms setting up in Nigeria to produce and export to America), a President Trump is likely to take notice and do ‘something’ about it. But there is another threat to AGOA – the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Barack Obama likes it and wants it to be his legacy but President Trump thoroughly dislikes it. If it doesn’t get passed before Mr. Obama leaves office, it might be a good thing. But if it does, the Asian countries that are part of the TPP agreement will get the same benefits that African countries get through AGOA. In such a scenario, Africa will lose jobs and trade to Asia almost certainly. If we work on the assumption that President Trump won’t sign the TPP and won’t scrap AGOA, then he might actually be good for Africa and Nigeria. Drill Baby, Drill! President Trump’s stated goal is to Make America Great Again. One of the ways in which he plans to do that is by making America ‘energy independent’. He also doesn’t care about or believe in climate change. Taken together, you can expect America to be relaxed about obtaining its energy from fossil fuels. The shale industry is also likely to receive a boost. One of his top advisers during the campaign was Harold Hamm, a billionaire who made his fortune from fracking. He has been tipped to be Energy Secretary in a Trump government. Mr. Hamm grew up poor and only learnt how to speak English properly after he became a millionaire. He is a big believer in the shale and will certainly favour the industry as energy secretary. One immediate effect of President Trump’s win has been a drop in the value of the US dollar. This automatically makes US exports cheaper. Combine that with friendly policies for the shale industry and you’re looking at a potential disaster for Nigeria. As though things weren’t bad enough already. A More Muscular America Ultimately America cannot be ignored in the world. Even if President Trump’s administration is more focused on domestic matters, there will always be opportunities to engage and do deals with America. But it might be better to ask than wait to be given anything. These are the times we now live in. Will President Trump launch a programme like the amazing President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that George W. Bush enthusiastically push? It’s unlikely. Or Barack Obama’s Power Africa? I doubt it. But the man likes a deal and if there is business to be done that will benefit America and Nigeria at the same time, he will probably do it. He won’t do charity – a recent Washington Post article investigated all the claims of charitable giving he had made over the years and found very little evidence. He is a businessman without zero experience of government. He will not run America all by himself and the country has strong institutions that can withstand the executive. But he will set the tone of his government. Maybe Nigerian diplomats and ministers should buy a copy of his book – The Art of the Deal – and start reading it.

On trade, you forgot the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by Canada, Mexico and the United States to create a trilateral trade bloc in North America. Although the PM of Canada has said he would open talks on the idea, a donald trump presidency would likely kill such an idea following his stance on Mexico.

Photo by Cristina Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com LOS ANGELES • Voters in four states raised minimum wages on Tuesday even as Republicans who oppose such increases won nationally, indicating that workers may still be able to improve compensation at the expense of restaurants, retailers and other employers. Pay hikes appeal to working-class voters who lifted Republican Donald Trump to a decisive win in the U.S. presidential race, and also to liberals who voted for Hillary Clinton, worker advocates said. "This could be a uniting issue," said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley. Voters in Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wages to $12 by 2020. Washington State agreed to take the minimum wage to $13.50 in the same time span. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has supported minimum wage campaigns across the United States, said any near-term federal action was unlikely under Trump but activists were considering a minimum wage campaign in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie vetoed a $15 per hour minimum wage bill this year, calling it a "radical increase." Christie, a stalwart Trump supporter, could have a place in the new administration. "For the next four years ballot initiatives are going to be the only way forward for us to be able to raise the minimum wage for working Americans and their families," Schleifer said. The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union President Marc Perrone said stakeholders of the minimum wage movement, including different labor unions and worker groups, are also looking at Pennslyvania, New Mexico, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for state ballot initiatives. "By January, February next year we are going to start to research so we can prep for the next election cycle." Perrone said selection of states will ultimately depend on what the electorate in each state wants. Restaurants and retailers are most exposed to minimum wage hikes, as the two largest U.S. employers of low-wage workers. Stephen Anderson, restaurant analyst at Maxim Group, said the latest state minimum wage increases will affect Chipotle Mexican Grill, Jack in the Box and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers the most. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest retailer and private sector employer in the United States, raised its minimum wage for store workers to $10 per hour in 2016. Its rival Target Corp. also raised floor wages to $10 an hour. Anderson said the added cost of wage increases might be offset significantly by business-friendly policies championed by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. These could include changes to the "Obamacare" health care law and a rollback of new rules broadening overtime eligibility.

The NLRB is considering, for instance, whether McDonald's Corp. is liable for labor law violations by franchisees, and could be required to bargain with workers who unionize. Dan Schlademan, co-director of OUR Walmart, a worker group seeking higher wages and better benefits at Walmart, said: "The bigger concern here for us is what happens with the labor board and the Department of Labor, where Republican control can change important things for workers and make them detrimental." Trump has said he would support a $10 federal minimum wage, adding it should be left up to the states to lead on the issue. The new Washington and Arizona laws also require employers to provide paid sick leave. Maine's successful initiative also would increase base pay for tipped workers. California and New York already passed laws to raise state minimum wages to $15 per hour over time. The results on the minimum wage ballot initiatives show voters are angry and demanding change, said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. "Voters in red, purple and blue states across the country decisively backed raises to the minimum wage, delivering badly needed raises for 2.3 million workers," she said.

Pakistan, Canada should further promote trade cooperation: CM 15-Nov-16   LAHORE: A delega ... 50 years ago, the UN General Assembly created the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). The organisation quickly grew to its current size of 170 members. As we look back on our 50 years, there is no doubt that UNIDO is still as relevant as it was when it was created. In the early 1970s, when Pakistan’s leather industry was in its infancy, UNIDO started to play a catalytic role in building capacity to create the conditions for the rational progression of that sector. Since then, UNIDO has been diversifying and significantly increasing its activities into multiple areas in various productive sectors. As a result, we can say that UNIDO in Pakistan has been actively working to improve the country’s industrial development, trade capacity, access to renewable energy and environmental protection. While it is beyond UNIDO’s mandate to address all economic and social challenges faced by a country like Pakistan, the impact of UNIDO’s interventions are already showing multiple effects, which will be instrumental in boosting job opportunities, reducing poverty and enhancing the country’s overall economic growth. The salient achievements in the past can be seen in various sectors. It is particularly worth mentioning UNIDO’s efforts in building Pakistan’s trade capacity, and how that enabled many sectors to meet global market requirements. This was a multidimensional and intensive task. For example, UNIDO helped with the establishment of a comprehensive food safety system, starting with the passage of Pakistan Food Safety Bill developed by UNIDO over more than three years in cooperation with more than eight ministries. In the process, UNIDO helped 40 laboratories get accreditation, and more than 120 food inspectors and master trainers gain internationally recognised qualifications. Setting up the first laboratory of its kind in the region for dioxin-testing is yet another good example, and facilitating the resumption of fish exports to the EU market after a seven-year ban is another. Thanks to UNIDO, mango farmers of Multan have now received sufficient training so that they can export their products directly to high-end markets, such as Walmart in the United Kingdom. Similarly, the certification of CE Marking was a gateway for accessing the EU market for various industrial products like surgical instruments, electric fans and cutlery, which will go a long way in boosting exports by capturing a niche in the global market. In a country like Pakistan where there is a dearth of encouragement of innovation at the state level, UNIDO has been a flag-bearer supporting youth who have innovative ideas, especially in clean technology, and enabling them to access and compete at global arenas like Silicon Valley, USA. Back in the 1980s, UNIDO started addressing the prevailing environmental issues in Pakistan by establishing the first combined effluent treatment plant at Kasur, a city in Punjab. The plant helped minimise the pollution generated by tanneries that were dumping production waste in adjoining water bodies. Some personal success stories can also be highlighted. Asra, a young lady from Lahore, was shocked to hear her name announced by the jurist at the National Cleantech Award Ceremony, which was held in Pakistan last year. Asra was the only woman among the five winners who were selected from more than 450 contestants. Her idea was to create a hybrid technology to power bicycles by using the energy generated and stored while pedalling. The idea was further polished and developed with help from UNIDO’s Cleantech Project. Similarly, Faisal, a young engineer, won the runner-up in the competition of the 2015 Cleantech Global Prize held in Silicon Valley. His novel idea was for a gasifier that runs on agricultural wastes and is mounted on the tractor that it drives. These are but a few of UNIDO’s groomed innovations that were built up to international standards. These endeavours have recently been acknowledged at the government level, a move that could pave the way for thousands of other innovations to grow into viable and successful businesses. Last but not least, UNIDO has given a lot of emphasis to gender mainstreaming. One example is the story of Fakhra, a women hailing from Rawalpindi, who saw her family left helpless when her husband got acutely sick and lost his source of livelihood. She undertook training in fashion design under a UNIDO project entitled “Women’s Entrepreneurship Development.” She subsequently has become a successful businesswoman, running an enterprise that hires more than 10 women. The gist is that UNIDO’s portfolio is diverse and dynamic in multiple areas. These achievements also clearly depict the inclusive and sustainable industrial development spirit, and are very much in line with the government’s “Vision-2025” for Pakistan. The guiding principle for UNIDO’s concrete role in the future lies in promoting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), and contributing to other SDGs. Following the development path that Pakistan has embarked upon, UNIDO will continue to advance and diversify its focus in targeted areas without losing sight of the need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, create jobs and combat poverty.   The writer is Director General United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co
