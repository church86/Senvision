By: Staff TC Media Published on There was no Sunday shopping happening Sunday afternoon at the Walmart in Digby. Shoppers and staff were evacuated from the building due to a bomb threat. Cpl. Rob Lewis of the Digby RCMP confirmed the bomb threat. Late Sunday afternoon the parking lot was empty except for what appeared to be staff vehicles off to the side. The parking lot was later cordoned off with police tape and pylons to prevent access to it. The RCMP, the Digby Fire Department and EHS were on scene. The fire department had been paged to the scene at 3 p.m., which was the same time other first responders were heading to the site. Other businesses in the vincity were still open at the time. Police said in a release they were staying on scene until the all clear was given.

The attack started as a flash-in-the-pan road rage incident about 5:45 p.m. Saturday in the West Lafayette Wal-Mart parking lot in Indiana and ended in the his driveway, where a man punched and kicked the professor while the woman yelled from the driver's seat, “Kill him! Kill him!" “They chased me until my driveway,” said the victim, who asked that his identity be kept private, “and they attempted to kill me on my driveway.” On Saturday, police arrested 21-year-old Austin Bradley Gregory on preliminary charges of misdemeanor battery. He was released Sunday morning after posting a $250 bond. The woman, who the Journal & Courier will not identify unless she is charged with a crime, went free, according to court documents. The professor, however, compares her culpability to that of a person who drives the getaway car for a bank robbery. In a brief interview with the Journal & Courier on Wednesday, Gregory said the professor walked up to the car he was in and reached inside. Gregory said he was protecting his family and that's when the fight started. But two witnesses cited in the probable cause affidavit said the professor never made it to the car before Gregory punched him. A third witness said the professor reached inside the car but did not know if that was before or after Gregory punched him, according to court documents. The attacks have caused the victim to reconsider his employment in the United States. He fears for the safety of his wife, his children and himself. Whether he remains here after the school year will depend on whether Gregory and the woman are formally charged. “I will not stay here if I don’t see justice,” he said. “This country is not safe. There is no justice now.” The victim shared his experience with a Muslim friend, who reported it to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization for Muslims. That organization on Wednesday called for the woman’s arrest. The council also called for Indiana to adopt hate laws that enhance sentences for crimes that target victims based on their religion, race or sexual orientation. The victim, who did not want the council contacted, does not want hate laws pushed here. “I don’t want to take it to the political side,” the professor said (Votes: 0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

More recently, Walmart acquired e-commerce innovator Jet.com in a deal valued at $3.3 billion that also gives it the ability to reach more customers in new ways. Prior to these deals, Walmart had acquired more than a dozen smaller companies in Silicon Valley to gain talent and technology.   Acquisitions in the digital world garner lots of attention, but the story of how Walmart positioned its U.S. business for renewed growth in sales and customer traffic is not easily condensed to a headline. It begins with a simple philosophy.   "We want to be the very first place customers think of when they want to save money and time," says Walmart U.S. President and CEO Greg Foran. "We've got a plan to win and it is pretty simple: win with stores, makes sure that we deliver value, make sure we are great merchants and make sure we provide convenience."   If that sounds like a simplistic plan, it's because Foran is a believer in simplicity and an adherent to Walmart's long-standing approach to retail and putting employees in stores in a position to win.   "The plan is built on a pretty simple principle I refer to internally as the Walmart wheel. We drive sales, we buy better, we take those savings and we lower our prices, we leverage our costs and we sell more units," Foran said recently during a rare public speaking appearance at the Grocery Manufacturers Association's Executive Forum To read the full story click here.

Shoppers can use a mobile app to place their orders. Kroger ClickList selector Debra Cross, from left, and e-commerce manager Corey Thurmond deliver an online grocery order to Evans resident Jennifer Speer and her son Brayden at the new Grovetown Kroger store Thursday morning.

Kroger e-commerce division field specialist Shelia Brick, left, and Grovetown e-commerce manager, Corey Thurmond, check on refrigerated items awaiting delivery to ClickList online grocery customers Thursday. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart's regional e-commerce market coach, shows the area of the parking lot designated for online order pickup at the Evans Wal-Mart Supercenter.   Pushing around a grocery cart with her 8-year-old son in tow was not something Jennifer Speer wanted to do Thursday morning. Thanks to Kroger’s new online grocery ordering service, ClickList, she didn’t have to. Employees at the new Kroger Mar­ket­place in Grovetown had Speer’s shopping list checked off and loaded into her SUV without her or son Brayden ever leaving their seats. “This really made my day because I’ve been sick all week,” said Speer, who heard about ClickList from mothers in her home-schooling network. “I’m just now starting to recover, so it was nice to just pull up and have everything ready.” The Cincinnati-based chain isn’t the only supermarket offering online ordering in the Augusta market. This past week, Wal-Mart brought its online grocery service to two of its area stores: the Evans Supercenter on Washington Road and the Hephzibah Neigh­bor­hood Market on Windsor Spring Road. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart’s regional e-commerce market coach, said local customer feedback has so far been in the 90 percent positive range. “Obviously, we want to be 100 percent every single time,” Hendry said. Though e-commerce is in its second decade, using computers or smartphones to buy groceries is a fairly recent phenomenon outside America’s largest cities, where internet giants such as Amazon and Google have been busy expanding their AmazonFresh and Google Express grocery delivery services. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s curbside pickup services are more closely aligned with what analysts call the “click-and-collect” model – also called “BOPUS” for buy-online-pick-up-in-store. Non-grocery brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and The Home Depot, have been doing it for years as more shoppers embrace e-commerce. More than one third of shoppers made click-and-collect purchases during the 2015 holiday season, according to an International Coun­cil of Shopping Centers’ consumer purchasing trends survey. Market research firm IBISWorld projects online grocery shopping sales will increase 9.5 percent to $9.4 billion in 2017. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s online grocery programs were launched in select markets starting in 2014, and the two operate in a similar manner. Shoppers fill their virtual carts by choosing from tens of thousands of items – including fresh meats, dairy and produce – found on the stores’ websites and smartphone apps. Shoppers then select a store location and pickup time, along with any special requests. “They can tell us whether they want ripe avocados or green bananas,” said Sheila Brick, Kroger’s e-commerce field specialist for the Atlanta division. “They can tell us how thick they want their steaks cut.” Specially trained employees handpick the items and store them in a special staging area with refrigerators and freezers until the customer arrives, pulling into one of the specially marked pick-up lanes and signaling their arrival via cellphone. Items are then brought to the customer’s car and the order is completed when the customer signs off on the charges on a handheld device. All items ordered online are priced the same as they are in the store. Kroger, however, charges a $4.95 convenience fee that is waived for the first three orders. Wal-Mart has no fee but requires a $30 minimum on online orders. Hendry points out that Geor­gia state law prohibits “curbside” alcohol delivery, and that Wal-Mart doesn’t allow apparel purchases through the online grocery. “Everything else – dog food, health and beauty supplies, electronics – all the good stuff in here can be delivered right to your car,” he said. The target online grocery shoppers are convenience-seeking moms with toddlers and young children. But the store employees say the service also appeals to dads who aren’t adept at grocery shopping, along with the elderly, the infirm and people who simply don’t like going shopping. Parents are finding out it is also a good way to purchase grocery items for their college-age children, Hendry said. “This is better than just handing them a twenty,” he said. “This way you know they’ll actually get groceries instead of just beer.” Wal-Mart and Kroger, the No. 1 and 2 grocers in the Augusta market according to Chain Store Guide, are so far the only traditional grocery chains to offer local online ordering. Warehouse membership stores, such as Sam’s Club and Costco, have online ordering options but no pure “click-and-collect” service. Whole Foods Market has a partnership with grocery delivery company Instacart, but there is no timeline for when the service will be available in Augusta, Whole Foods’ Atlanta spokeswoman Lauren Bernath said. Food Lion spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said the company is “currently exploring a number of options for both in-store grocery pick-up and home delivery” but has no timetable for service in Augusta. The Salisbury, N.C.-based retailer offers Instacart service in select ZIP codes in Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C. Discount grocer Aldi has an online presence and mobile apps, but no plans to take online orders at any of its locations. Southeastern Grocers, owner of the Bi-Lo chain, said in a statement that it is always looking for ways to improve customer service. “We’re always listening to our customers and looking into new ways to offer both convenience and value for an enjoyable shopping experience,” said Joe Caldwell, the corporate communications manager for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based chain. “As new technology and services constantly develop, we carefully evaluate each opportunity for our network of stores. We will certainly update our customers if we unveil any new services.” Lakeland, Fla.-based Publix Super Markets Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.

According to Bloomberg, it was roughly a month ago that Target announced they would be pulling Welspun’s line of premium Egyptian cotton bed sheets from their shelves and giving customers who purchased the sheets a refund. Walmart has recently made the decision to join Target in both pulling the product and offering the refunds. A spokesperson from Walmart claims the customers of the retailer trust the company to provide products as promised by the labels printed on them. When Welspun, the manufacturer of the bed sheets, was unable to assure Walmart – or Target – that the sheets were actually 100 percent Egyptian content, as described by the label, both companies made the decision to pull the products and offer the refund. “Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund.” Any Walmart customer who would like a refund can bring their bed sheets back to any Walmart location and receive a refund. Walmart has also pulled all of the unsold Welspun products from the shelves with the intention of giving them to Good360. Good360 is an organization that donates all companies’ extra merchandise to a number of different charities. [Image via ShutterStock] Business Insider reports that Bed Bath & Beyond and J.C. Penny are also looking into how credible the Welspun Egyptian cotton products on their shelves currently are. Business Insider goes on to speculate that the latest Welspun scandal involving Egyptian cotton bed sheets only supports the theory that a very large percentage of the 100 percent Egyptian cotton products sold in the United States are actually cheap knock offs. While, technically, high-quality cotton can be grown in just about any part of the world – the cotton has to be grown in Egypt in order for it to be considered 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Cotton grown anywhere else in the world is not authentic, regardless of how great the quality may or may not be. [Image via ShutterStock] “When you think about it, 1 percent of the world’s crops are Egyptian cotton. You walk into any store, or look at any one of these websites and see they’re all selling Egyptian cotton — it just doesn’t add up,” Scott Tannen, founder of luxury bedding startup Boll and Branch said. He went on to say he believes the case Target and Walmart have against Welspun for not selling authentic products is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the bed sheet industry. While there is certainly no question that Tannen is interested in exposing all of the fake Egyptian cotton manufacturers, he is certainly not the only one who is suspicious of this particular industry. In fact, the Cotton Egypt Association conducted a study on Egyptian cotton sold by retailers in the United States. Using a DNA-based authentication program, the study determined 90 percent of the products did not contain any cotton produced in Egypt at all. At the time, this was an association that had supported Welspun as a symbol of success in the Egypt cotton industry. Naturally, this is something that has been called into question given the current situation with Target, Walmart, and a number of other industries. #EgyptianCotton Are we to believe that someone at $TGT $JCP $WMT wasn't aware all along? #Wellspun https://t.co/FThh8bbu9f — Maglan Capital (@MaglanCapital) August 25, 2016 Do you think it is fair that – right now – the only stipulation is that the retailers are giving refunds and pulling the products off the shelves? Should Welspun be held responsible in some way for attempting to trick customers into purchasing sheets that were not really 100 percent Egyptian cotton?

Whether shopping online or in your local brick and mortar store, you’ll find plenty of sales and deals to help save money. Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy are just a few retailers kicking off the new season by slashing prices. You’ll find savings for upcoming holidays such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, fall decor and home interiors, clothes, and accessories as well as end-of-summer clearance deals. Additionally, Best Buy will sell the new iPhone 7 beginning Sept. 16, and it’s now available for pre-order. Here’s a roundup of the best fall sales to get you started. Fall means back-to-school and Amazon has sales running to help children and adults of all levels have a smooth transition this school year. The main back-to-school sale is geared towards parents and their elementary age children. The sale features deals on grocery items, uniforms, school supplies, and much more. The back-to-school sale runs until Sept. 26. In addition to the main back-to-school event, Amazon is running deals for college students. This sale also expires on Sept. 26. Amazon has stocked their Halloween store with costumes, supplies, candy, and decorations. Some of the top Halloween costumes for 2016 include Avengers, characters from Finding Dory, Joker and Harley Quinn, Star Wars characters, LEGO, and comic book heroes. Many are shopping early for Halloween costumes to ensure they get a great deal before they sell out. Amazon holds sales every day including daily deals, goldbox deals, and lightning sales. These sales are often time sensitive and run out quickly. Many lightning deals will continue to sell at a lower price after the end of the deal. If you miss a lightning deal, don’t give up. Typically, you can still save on the item price. The best daily deals are those that are marked down 70 percent and more. #GrandparentsDay is 9/11 Save 15% on #Flowers & #Gifts Use code GRNDPRNT15 #sales #deals https://t.co/lIjySgHkt6 pic.twitter.com/F0PyyFlU6j — Holiday Helper (@HolidayHelperUS) September 10, 2016 Wal-Mart was recently under fire for a Florida store’s promotion of a sale using the Twin Towers and 9/11 as a marketing ploy. Some found the display so despicable, they’ve vowed to boycott Wal-mart. Others consider it a tasteless mistake. Wal-Mart has a number of fall sales going on that have nothing to do with the September 11 terrorist attacks. Are you protesting Wal-Mart for their display?

Best Buy has a sale on televisions under 50 inches. There’s also an appliance sale with up to 35 percent off major appliances Target is also running several fall sales.

Eric Flowers, spokesman for the Indian River County Sheriff's Office. A Wal-Mart delivery truck driver pulled in behind the store in the 5500 block of 20th Street when he smelled a terrible smell, Flowers said. The driver walked into the woods on the side of Wal-Mart, found the body and called 911 at 4:30 p.m. The wooded area also is behind the Applebee's restaurant. No signs of foul play are reported and the body is too decomposed to determine a cause of death, Flowers said. The deceased appears to be a homeless man from the clothing found on the body, Flowers said. An autopsy will be performed on the body next week.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Brooklyn completes Route 6 sidewalks, school roof project Saturday Sep 10, 2016 at 6:50 PM Sep 10, 2016 at 6:50 PM Francesca Kefalas For The Bulletin BROOKLYN — First Selectman Rick Ives can’t help but smile when he’s asked about two projects the town has been trying to complete for years. For the first time in a long time, Ives doesn’t haven’t to explain the latest delay in completing 900-feet of sidewalks to connect Wal-Mart to the rest of the Route 6 commercial district or the issues with putting a new room on the Rose Wing roof at Brooklyn Elementary School. “They’re done,” Ives said. “And they both came in under budget.” Ives is coming to the end of his third year in office. The sidewalks have been on his agenda since he took office, but they discussed before the Wal-Mart was built. Wal-Mart opened in November 2013, the same month Ives was elected. Between the time the store opened and Christmas of that year, three pedestrians were hit in the area. None of the accidents were serious. The sidewalks are on a state road and in early 2014 the Northeast Connecticut Council of Governments won a $300,000 grant for the project. Ives said the bid for the project came in at $98,000. “It’s actually a little embarrassing how off the estimate was,” Ives said. Selectman Joe Voccio said he’s walked to Wal-Mart three times in the two weeks since the sidewalks have been completed. “The nice thing is I saw my first person in a wheelchair using the sidewalk and they didn’t have to be in the road,” Voccio said. “It's doing exactly what we hoped it would do.” “I just saw my first baby carriage being pushed along the sidewalks,” Ives said. “It’s good to see.” Laura Santos said she’s happy the sidewalks are done. She has teenagers at home and it’s nice to know they can walk safely to the store. The Rose Wing roof was completed just before school began Aug. 31. In June 2014 the annual town meeting approved a $65,000 allocation for the project, yet it languished because of changing state regulations. Selectman Bob Kelleher became chairman of the building committee and was able to guide the project through the state regulations. Ives said the final inspection for the roof has not been done, but he expects the final cost of the project at about $35,000. “And we got a little extra work done than we had first intended,” Ives said.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Customer Service Place an ad Purchase a photo Archives Advertising/Classified Cars Homes Today's Ads Classifieds Obituaries Find Norwich jobs Community Info CtSunlight.org Connecticut tourism The Last Green Valley Sex Offender Registry Gas Buddy DOT traffic cameras Comcast Public Access Television Local Business Northeast Chamber of Commerce Greater Norwich Area Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce Inc.

Sunday marks 15 years since two hijacked planes flew into New York's tallest buildings, bringing them to the ground and killing thousands. A photo of the display shared on Twitter quickly gained thousands of retweets and outraged reactions that the tragic event was being used to sell Coke. A banner above the stack of soft drink boxes, with the Walmart and Coca Cola logos, said: "We will never forget." The display, which has been removed, was designed and created by Coca-Cola, Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson told local media. "This display was meant to honor local firefighters and to support their organization's upcoming event," Coca-Cola spokeswoman Kimberly Kuo told CNBC. Walmart has been known for its questionable US holiday displays. One store marked Independence Day with a battleship made of Bud Light beer boxes, and for Veteran's Day another store made a soft-drink display in the shape of a bald eagle. Newshub.

By: PTI | Mumbai | Published:September 10, 2016 8:44 pm The Amercian retail giant was quick to add that it isn’t cutting ties with Welspun. Instead, it is working with Welspun to implement strong controls and better label the products. (AP Photo File) Home linen major Welspun, which was caught in trouble recently after some of its major US clients stopped sourcing its products, on Saturday said Walmart will continue to source from it barring those products made of Egyptian cotton. Walmart in August followed fellow US retailer Target in recalling Welspun bedsheets and pillow covers after it came to light that the home linen it sold saying as made of Egyptian cotton were not in fact made from the premium yarn typical of the West Asian nation. Walmart used to sell Welspun’s sheets and pillow cases under the labels of Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy. In a BSE filing on Saturday, Welspun India, which has appointed consultancy firm E&Y to look into the alleged lapses, said, “Walmart has assured us to do business together. We are working to implement stronger controls and to better label the products we supply to them.” The B K Goenka-led company further said, “The product line in question with Walmart accounts for around 1.5 per cent of our business.” “We take the current traceability concerns around some of our product lines very seriously, and have been working closely with our retailer partners to support their actions towards a comprehensive resolution programme,” Welspun said.

While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund.” The Amercian retail giant was quick to add that it isn’t cutting ties with Welspun. Instead, it is working with Welspun to implement strong controls and better label the products. The Egyptian cotton product portfolio accounts for 6 per cent of Welspun’s annual business. The company posted total net sales of Rs 5,387.66 crore in 2015-16. The problem started after Egypt began to report massive drop in cotton production. As per reports, it produced just 1 per cent of the global cotton last year. The US-based retail chain Bed Bath & Beyond and JC Penny are also conducting third-party audit of items sourced from Welspun, following lapses in supplies by the Gujarat-based firm to Target.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Walmart sourcing non-Egyptian cotton products: Welspun Press Trust of India | Mumbai Sep 10, 2016 09:10 PM IST Home linen major Welspun, which was caught in trouble recently after some of its major US clients stopped sourcing its products, on Saturday said Walmart will continue to source from it barring those products made of Egyptian cotton. Walmart last month followed fellow US retailer Target in recalling Welspun bedsheets and pillow covers after it came to light that the home linen it sold saying as made of Egyptian cotton were not in fact made from the premium yarn typical of the West Asian nation. Walmart used to sell Welspun's sheets and pillow cases under the labels of Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy. In a BSE filing on Saturday, Welspun India, which has appointed consultancy firm E&Y to look into the alleged lapses, said, "Walmart has assured us to do business together. We are working to implement stronger controls and to better label the products we supply to them." The B K Goenka-led company further said, "The product line in question with Walmart accounts for around 1.5 per cent of our business." "We take the current traceability concerns around some of our product lines very seriously, and have been working closely with our retailer partners to support their actions towards a comprehensive resolution programme," Welspun said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart on the other hand said in a separate statement that Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. "While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund," it added. The Amercian retail giant was quick to add that it isn't cutting ties with Welspun. Instead, it is working with Welspun to implement strong controls and better label the products. The Egyptian cotton product portfolio accounts for 6 per cent of Welspun's annual business. The company posted total net sales of Rs 5,387.66 crore in the financial year 2015-16. The problem started after Egypt began to report massive drop in cotton production. According to reports, it produced just 1 per cent of the global cotton last year. The US-based retail chain Bed Bath & Beyond and JC Penny are also conducting third-party audit of items sourced from Welspun, following lapses in supplies by the Gujarat-based firm to Target. Last month, Target Corporation, after extensive investigation, confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing bedsheets and pillow cases between August 2014 and July 2016. The retailer had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com and offered the customers full refund. Target said it would end all business with Welspun, one of the world's biggest textile manufacturers, as the vendor was sending it phony Egyptian-cotton sheets. Sales to Target was around $90 million in the FY 2015-16 for Welspun and accounted for almost 10 per cent of its overall business. A Welspun spokesman said on Saturday that the total Egyptian cotton-based sales constituted only about 6 per cent of its $900 million sales. Others among top five of Welspun's customers like Bed Bath and Beyond and JC Penny had said they would also review the matter. Welspun is the biggest exporter of terry towels and bed linen to the US and the company says every fifth towel sold in the US is made by it and two-thirds of its total business comes from the American markets. After Target's recall in mid-August, Welspun's shares tanked by 47 per cent and touched a low of Rs 46.50 on August 30. But since then it has recovered to Rs 59.10 and the share closed at Rs 56.60 on Friday on the BSE. Customers pay a premium for Egyptian cotton products because they are perceived to be softer and more durable. Sheets made from cotton grown in other countries don't always carry the same cachet among Americans. Walmart is one of Welspun's largest customers, while Target, JC Penney, Macy's Inc, Bed Bath and Beyond Inc are also leading customers. According to the US agriculture department, Egypt produced just under 1 per cent of global cotton last year. According to the Egypt Cotton Association, which licences the trademark and certifies suppliers, 90 per cent of products labelled as 'Egyptian cotton' are inauthentic. The $3-billion Welspun Group has interests in textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in New documents detail Wal-Mart killing of suspected shoplifter Friday Sep 9, 2016 at 8:35 PM Rebecca Baggett told detectives she saw three people running through the parking lot at Wal-Mart just after 3 the morning of Feb. 7. By John Chambliss The Ledger LAKELAND — Rebecca Baggett told detectives she saw three people running through the parking lot at Wal-Mart just after 3 the morning of Feb. 7. "The lady caught up with him, jumped on his back, he fell to the ground and she was punching him in the head, closed fists, um, the gentleman never punched back, he was holding his hands over his head, fell to the ground, got back up, the lady was still punching him, fell back down again, and that's when the third man with the limp came and put his, um, knee in his back," Baggett, a nurse at Lakeland Regional Health, told Lakeland police during an interview. Authorities say that the third man, Randall Eugene Tomko, 58, of Winter Haven, a loss prevention worker, and Crucelis Nunez, 23, a customer service manager at Wal-Mart who lives in Lakeland, killed Kenneth Wisham, of North Lakeland, with help from Nathan Higgins, 35, of Lakeland. Higgins is accused of holding Wisham by the ankles, and pushing his legs up against his buttocks. Higgins' lawyer, Rusty Franklin, has said Higgins played a minor role in the death of Wisham. Charged with manslaughter, the three are out of the Polk County Jail on bail. Nunez, Tomko and Higgins no longer work at Wal-Mart, Erica Jones, a spokeswoman with the company, said in an email. The State Attorney's Office recently released hundreds of pages of documents in the case, which includes interviews from Lakeland Police Department detectives with the defendants, witnesses and the medical examiner's report. According to the investigation, employees chased Wisham outside the U.S. 98 North Wal-Mart and caught him in the grass in the southeast corner of the parking lot before the struggle ensued. Tomko's lawyer, Jeffrey Holmes, said Wisham was committing a strong armed robbery when his client intervened. "He was just doing his job," Holmes said. Holmes said Wisham suffered from numerous ailments that likely contributed to his death. "The bottom line is he was 64, had a heart condition and emphysema," Holmes said. "This guy might have died if he had just fallen down and was held for 30 seconds." Richard McCluskey, a lawyer for Nunez, said he doesn't believe criminal charges should have been filed against his client after the scuffle. He added that Nunez told him that employees called police several times before authorities arrived. 'Let me go, Let me go' The three were charged months after the incident following the release of a medical examiner's report that defined Wisham's cause of death as mechanical asphyxiation. In addition, Wisham suffered 15 broken ribs. District Medical Examiner Dr. Stephen Nelson has said the term ''mechanical asphyxiation'' is used when victims are unable to expand their chests to breathe. In an interview with police, Erica Emerling, an assistant manager at Wal-Mart, said she told her associate to let Wisham go after he was stopped for shoplifting about $400 in DVDs, video games, medicine and a toaster. Wisham grabbed his jacket and began to leave without the cart, while Tomko came out of his office in the store and started to chase Wisham after associates had told him about the shoplifter. During the interview, Emerling told Lakeland Police Detective Stacey Pough she followed Tomko and Nunez outside as they chased Wisham until she reached them and saw the two on top of him with Tomko's elbow on Wisham's back as he pinned him down for about four to five minutes. "He was screaming, 'Let me go, Let me go,' and wiggling," Emerling said. "Then I noticed he went silent." Tomko told police during an interview that Wisham's resistance slowed. "First he was really more physically resistant," Tomko told police. Pough asked how Wisham slowed in his resistance. "He wasn't really saying much," said Tomko, who added he slid off of Wisham as people began to check on him. Emerling asked her employees if Wisham was still breathing. Nunez felt for a pulse, told Emerling she didn't feel anything then Emerling told an associate to call 911. Another employee turned Wisham over and a 911 operator instructs him to perform chest compressions on Wisham until police arrive and continue the chest compressions. An ambulance arrived and emergency technicians rushed to Wisham. Wisham's ribs could have been broken while Tomko was on top of him. Jeremy McCutcheon, a firefighter EMT, told police Wisham never spoke while he attempted to revive the man. McCutcheon said it's common for ribs to break during CPR and chest compressions, but that it appeared Wisham's ribs were already broken. In a separate interview, Andrew Rodriguez, a Polk County Emergency Medical Services firefighter paramedic, agreed that Wisham's ribs were already broken when he attempted CPR. "I know the sensation of breaking ribs and they were already broken when I did 'em for sure, I know that, because it was just very easy to compress," Rodriguez said. The three defendants each face up to 15 years in prison. Higgins is scheduled to be in court for a hearing on Oct. 7. Nunez and Tomko had status hearings in late August. — John Chambliss can be contacted at john.chambliss@theledger.com or 863-802-7588.

But if you're shopping around for good customer service a recent study from Columbia University says it'll be hard to spot in Walmarts based in poor or minority communities. The 'study', which looked at about 35,000 Yelp reviews, apparently discovered that the lowest Walmart location ratings came from black or latino neighborhoods. In majority Black zip codes, customers were more likely to use words like "nasty", "unorganized", and "slow" to describe their shopping experience. But, it was opposite with Walmarts in neighborhoods that are the majority white. Reviews there claimed their local Walmart was "friendly" and "clean". In a statement to NewsFix, Walmart says they found the study to be "flawed and without merit." The company also added that they're proud to "provide communities across the country, regardless of social or economic background, access to affordable goods and career opportunities." Whether you take Walmart's word on this or a study based on Yelp reviews - it's kind of hard to just throw this one in the bag!

These are the women that call the shots, and are currently building billion-dollar brands, as well as much more. The Most Powerful Women in Business list is compiled by Fortune editors, who consider four criteria: the size and importance of the woman's business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman's career and social and cultural influence. There are 22 CEOs on this year's list who together control $1.1 trillion in market capitalization. Beyoncé (No. 51) is the youngest person on the list at 35, followed by Amy Hood (No. 31), CFO of Microsoft, at 44. Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, EVP of CVS Health, CVS Health, landed on the list at No. 12, making her the first woman in retail to make the cut.   Here are the 8 Most Powerful Women in Retail:   1.Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, EVP of CVS Health, CVS Health Helena Foulkes, led CVS Health’s retail business to new revenue heights—up 6.2%, to $72 billion in 2015. Foulkes is also hoping to lift sales of general merchandise with initiatives like CVS’s new mobile payment app and upgraded beauty sections, scheduled to be in 4,000 CVS/pharmacy stores by the end of the year. 2.Angela Ahrendts, SVP, Retail and Online Stores, Apple Angela Ahrendts is responsible for some 12% of the company’s $233.7 billion in sales. Her first big retail project was the Apple Watch, even though it had mixed reviews. Now she is introducing a new store look, which includes a new landscaped help desk called the Genius Grove, movie-theater-size video screens, and a boardroom where app developers can share advice with small businesses. 3.Rosalind Brewer, CEO and President, Sam's Club, Walmart   Rosalind Brewer is investing in food offerings (more organics), remodeling stores, and locating new ones in higher-income areas. She’s looking for an edge through e-commerce, implementing in-store pickup for online orders and launching an app that lets customers pay without going through checkout.   4.Ann-Marie Campbell, EVP, U.S. store, Home Depot In January, Campbell was promoted from her role as head of the southern division of the home-improvement retailer to run all of Home ­Depot’s U.S. stores, which makes her responsible for some 90% of the company’s $88.5 billion in 2015 revenues and 350,000 employees. 5.Judith McKenna, EVP and COO, Walmart U.S., Walmart McKenna has been key in the company’s decision to invest $2.7 billion in training programs and raises for some 1.2 million U.S. store employees. She’s also pushing tech. Now all store and department managers get mobile devices so that they can spend more time on the floor rather than in the back room. 6.Barbara Rentler, CEO, Ross Stores Barbra Rentler opened 84 new stores in the company’s fiscal 2015 and has 90 in the pipeline this year. In the most recent quarter, the company beat expectations and upped its guidance. Ross Stores thrived in a competitive retail environment last year, with sales up 8%, to nearly $12 billion, and profits that passed the $1 billion threshold for the first time. 7.Crystal Hanlon, President, Northern Division, Home Depot Crystal Hanlon continues as president of the northern division of Home Depot, the company’s single largest unit, with $29.5 billion in revenues, some 800 stores, and 110,000 employees. Home Depot’s stock is up 16% in the past year, outpacing the surging S&P 500.   8.Shari Ballard, Senior EVP and President, U.S. Retail, Best Buy In May Shari Ballard was named senior executive vice president, shedding her HR role but adding the Mexico business as well as real estate to her purview. Ballard, who started as an assistant store manager, now oversees some 1,400 Best Buy stores, accounting for over 80% of the company’s overall revenues.   Click here to view the full Fortune's "Most Powerful Women 2016" list.

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Thursday 3rd December 2009 by Elliott King Virtual Gets Real with Augmented Reality Augmented reality (AR) has become a hot topic among marketers, particularly in light of the release of Yelp’s Monocle app that allows users to see location-based reviews hovering on their iPhone screens. The technology has provoked repeat interest from Mashable, Wired, Fast Company, and ReadWriteWeb, while companies like IBM, GE, Best Buy, P&G, and Wal-Mart are moving beyond pure gimmick to truly connect with consumers via AR. The seminal promise of AR is as the touchstone technology allowing social networks, geo-based tracking, and the semantic web to converge. Put less geekily, think of AR as your personalized digital butler, who will get to know your behavior so specifically that it can prethink your choices based on your friends, location, and how you search online. The cyberpunk fictions have come to reality with AR, and the cultural ramifications are as powerful as the marketing opportunities. In this article, we’ll take a look at the fundamental ways in which augmented reality will reshape consumer behavior and interactive marketing, as well as a few companies and applications that are leading the way. From map to mindset What’s your relationship to the GPS unit in your car? Do you lament the loss of serendipity that resulted from depending on the tinny voice on your dash? More likely, you’ve learned to lean on your satellite siren and have blissfully embraced paperless travel. This adjustment to technology represents a step toward artificial intelligence, in which machines can learn our behavior and improve the way we live. Adopting GPS not only saves us time in our travels, it lets us clear our mental palette to make space for other thoughts, a “prethinking” process mirrored in augmented reality. Still in its nascent form until the majority of the public owns enabled smartphones, AR’s ability to layer 3-D images on a phone’s screen in the context of a person’s actual location makes it the touchstone technology galvanizing artificial intelligence and the promise of social marketing. The tech you shouldn’t see The trailer for Microsoft’s Xbox Project Natal announcement provides a key insight into the future of augmented reality, human behavior, and commerce. Noting from the outset that “no controller is required,” a typical family runs through a set of game scenarios based on their varying interests. A teenage boy karate-kicks an avatar, his older sister video chats with a friend who recommends a virtual dress to wear, and so on. Although facial and voice recognition enhance the game, we’re reminded that to enjoy the Xbox, “the only experience you need is life experience.” This idea is key — like your GPS, you forget about the tech and focus on the benefits. You augment your reality in the context of what you’re presented. Skewing social Augmented reality assigns relevance for users of the “outernet” via AR applications like Yelp’s Monocle that allow you to see location-specific user reviews on the screen of your iPhone by simply pointing your camera and clicking on links. The process is faster than looking online, especially once users search via multiple AR services that aggregate relevant data for their location. The result is crowd-sourced commerce and a prethinking reliance of users to make purchasing decisions once they’re nearing their destination rather than at home. Social networks take on a new and more immediate relevance when posts are seen in the context of physical space. Tagging taxonomies Geo-tagging lets you create text, audio, or video you can assign a physical location to via AR-enabled smartphones. When others come to that spot in the future, they’ll be able to experience the content you’ve left behind. This communal prethinking in relation to location will become commonplace, as will the virtual offers pushed our way when we’re in the vicinity of local stores. Prethinking via dating services like Match.com combined with geo-enabled tweets will alter cultural behavior as well. The sublime search Prethinking also applies to how we tag ourselves, an act that has direct repercussions on semantic search. Instead of relying on keywords that have multiple meanings depending on context and native language, search powered by augmented reality assigned to specific geo-locations will have the relevance of our physical actions. Taxonomies relating to our actual locations will transform reliance on clumsy search algorithms in lieu of actual behavior. This aggregated data will provide a wealth of information to marketers in terms of when to deliver key messaging and relevance to geography. And as identity standards like Open ID continue to evolve, consumers can set their geo-privacy preferences to avoid unwanted airvertising to create standards for outernet etiquette as well. Augmented reality becomes a transformative technology when campaigns move beyond Flash to demonstrate utility. Gimmicks can be useful to attract user attention, but AR needs to lead to relevant social or commercial connections. Georgia Tech’s zombie game provides an example of flash and function that can move the needle for commercial adoption of AR. We all enjoy slaughtering the undead, and moving around a placemat-like game board to see 3-D action via our smartphone screens is sweet. But when an actual Skittles candy is placed on the game board and game characters react to its presence, the applications for marketing become readily apparent. Virtual aisles in retail environments can be festooned with interactive characters or videos. Beer goggles take on a literal angle, and placemats will provide games that respond to various bottles or cans maximized for AR. Other services like Zugara’s Webcam Social Shopper let people virtually try on clothes, and users can take pictures of themselves to send to their friends on Facebook. Combining the AR app with crowd-sourced opinions from social networks provides utility along with the benefit of collaborative shopping. USAA has also proven that non-sexy AR applications can gain more traction than gimmicky campaigns. Its iPhone app allows people to take a picture of their checks for instant deposits, a simple yet profound action inasmuch as it engenders ease of financial transaction. As reported by eWeek in an article about the application, “USAA’s customers have conducted more than 13.3 million mobile transactions in 2009.” Prethinking leads to profits via AR-enabled utility. Jamais Cascio, the popular ethical futurist that regularly writes for Fast Company and other publications, dovetails the notions of prethinking combined with AR in his notion of “focus assistants,” or filtering tools that screen content you don’t want to receive. In his article for the Atlantic, “Get Smarter,” he notes that, “as our capacity to provide that filter gets faster and richer, it increasingly becomes something akin to collaborative intuition — in which everyone is effectively augmenting everyone else. This process of collective intuition is amplified by AR applications like Pelago’s visual storytelling tool, Whrrl. The service, according to CEO Jeff Holden, is a “real-time storytelling product for people’s daily lives,” which aggregates multiple tweets, posts, and updates to form a kind of visual Twitter. These communal events are also shared to the larger community, which can comment while stories take place. This process creates a form of public prethinking known as group awareness. And it’s the data culled from these multiple communal stories that will form the basis of future interactions in commerce and culture at large. More stories at Pike Place Fish MarketPowered by Whrrl Conclusion Augmented reality offers multiple touchpoints to interact with consumers in an intimate and impactful virtual landscape. When commercial experiences in the outernet honor consumer privacy, are relevant to location, and embrace communal group experience, marketers will benefit. But like GPS and our Xbox family demonstrated, AR is just a few steps away from being invisible. No experience is required and prethinking will become a habit without our realizing its taken place. Just remember that, like the mom at the end of the video, you can always turn the AR technology off. And unless marketers collaborate with consumers on their virtual sojourns, they’re likely to do the same to us.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - A woman has been released from the hospital and a good Samaritan who came to her aid is recovering after a suburban Kansas City Wal-Mart parking lot attack in which a suspect was killed. Police said the Kansas City, Kansas, woman was putting her baby in her car Sunday afternoon in the parking lot of a Walmart in Shawnee when two suspects hit her in the head from behind. Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis said a Kansas City, Missouri, man in the parking lot who tried to help was shot several times and is recovering after undergoing surgery. "They didn't know one another. He saw her and tried to help," said Tennis. Another good Samaritan from De Soto, Kansas, has been interviewed and released after fatally shooting 28-year-old John Simmons III, of Kansas City, Missouri. On Tuesday, Shawnee police said Arthur Fred Wyatt III, 27, of Overland Park, Kansas, was arrested. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping, and attempted aggravated robbery in connection to the incident at the Shawnee Walmart.  Shoppers at the Johnson County super center were disappointed by the violence, but said it could happen anywhere. "It makes me wonder about coming here at night though, but it happened in broad daylight on a Sunday.

A new study finds on average counties with Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. Azzam Study: Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation benefits counties NICHOLAS BERGIN Lincoln Journal Star Sep 11, 2016 (…) Kristin Streff, Lincoln Journal Star file Cattle graze at a feed yard outside Seward, Neb. in an undated file photo. A new study finds on average counties with Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. Azzam "That is all we have here," said Jeff Metz, a rancher and county commissioner. "We're never going to get a large Wal-Mart or a Kawasaki. We're ag. And we want to tell everybody in this state or anybody that passes through, livestock is very important to us." That's why in 2005 Metz asked county leaders to have Morrill designated as Nebraska's first livestock friendly county through a program created by the Legislature two years earlier. Metz said he likes to think the designation has helped influence people to work and do business in the county, but he can't point to a direct link. It's a point that researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Oklahoma State University attempted to address in a recently published that found on average counties with the designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. The 37 counties that have earned the voluntary designation include northeast Nebraska's Dakota and Wayne. The study doesn't prove the designation leads to livestock expansion, said UNL agricultural economics professor Azzeddine Azzam, one of four authors, but it does show counties with the designation are doing better than their counterparts. "We're not studying cause and effect," Azzam said. Rather "it seems like those that have the designation have experienced in the case of cattle larger farm numbers and in the case of hogs it slowed down the exit of farms." Nebraska Farmers Union President John Hansen criticized both the program and the study saying it proved nothing. Hansen said there are no tangible benefits to the designation and counties that have sought it already were livestock-centric. "We have some serious concerns and issues with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture relative to how they have been administering the livestock friendly counties programs," Hansen said. He went on to say the department has shown a bias toward massive, corporate-owned facilities over local control. Mat Habrock, assistant director of the state Ag Department, responded that the designation is entirely voluntary. "Local control is still very much tied into this, because it is the county's decision to go through the review process," Habrock said. The state Ag Department reviewed the professor's study before it was recently published in the . The major benefit of the designation is bragging rights. The designation is used on signage and marketing sites within the livestock industry. "It's a willingness from the county to show that they're open for business, and they recognize the important role animal agriculture can play," Habrock said. Habrock added that many factors account for livestock expansion and that there are counties friendly to agriculture that have not sought the designation. The study based its findings on the number of cattle and hog farms reported in each of Nebraska's 93 counties in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's census in 2002, 2007 and 2012. The study did not look at the number of animals or the size of the farms. For cattle, before 2007 nearly all counties lost farms. But from 2007 to 2012 16 of the 21 counties with livestock friendly designations reported more farms. Counties with the designation increased their overall cattle farm numbers by 12 percent, while those not designated saw increases of 8 percent. One surprising finding was a negative effect on cattle farms in counties in the program the longest. Morrill County, for example, lost 11 cattle farms from 2007 to 2012. "One possible explanation for this would be that those counties that joined early have other unexplained factors leading to the decrease in cattle numbers. These factors may have been one reason that led to the county joining the program," the paper says. For hog farms from 2007 to 2012, counties with the designation saw a 16 percent drop, meanwhile counties without it lost 38 percent of farms, the study shows. To earn a livestock friendly designation, a county must hold a public hearing and adopt a declaration acknowledging the importance of livestock to the well-being of the county and provide the state copies of its livestock zoning requirements, among other things. To date, 37 counties have received the designation. The designation doesn't guarantee livestock expansion will happen without controversy. In Gage County, designated livestock friendly in 2012, the board of supervisors this summer rejected a special use permit for a poultry farm that would have housed 150,000 birds east of Cortland. Board members said too many variables came with the project related to manure storage and disposal of dead chickens. Habrock said the state Ag Department is watching the situation but has not yet taken a position on whether it will affect the county's livestock friendly designation. Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said the study demonstrates the value of embracing livestock as an economic development tool. "Nebraska Farm Bureau was very supportive of the legislation that created the Livestock Friendly County program and we've had numerous County Farm Bureaus that have worked with their local elected leaders to secure the Livestock Friendly designation for their county," Nelson said. "It's our hope the study will encourage additional counties to give consideration to the program."

The store put up a display that used Coke and Sprite boxes to create an American flag backdrop. In front of it, Coke Zero packages were stacked to resemble the towers. A banner above read, “We will never forget.” A photo of the display was posted on Twitter earlier this week and it quickly drew condemnation from social media users. Wal-Mart said in a statement the display was removed Wednesday. “We hold this moment in our country’s history in the highest regard, and there was nothing disrespectful intended by the display,” it said. The company said the design for the display for the store came from the supplier and was approved by its store management. The Coca-Cola bottler for the region said the display was meant to honor local firefighters and support an upcoming event for their organization. “We sincerely apologize that anyone was offended or misunderstood its intent, and we have replaced the display,” the bottler said.

McIntyre September 11, 2016 9:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) have jockeyed for the lead as America’s most valuable company, each with a market cap of about $550 billion. One tech giant vs. another. A look at the top 20 American public corporations reveals several other close comparisons One note is that the top five positions on the market cap table are tech companies, and have left large energy companies behind. After Apple and Alphabet are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) at $435 billion, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) at $364 billion, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) at $360 billion. All five companies are trying to play in at least one of the others’ backyards. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are among the cloud computing leaders. Amazon and Apple continue to fight each other for dominance in the streaming media market. Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the mobile OS market. The only company on the list without a significant challenger is Facebook, one of the reasons its market cap is so high. Exxon Mobile (NYSE: XOM) is tied with Amazon in market cap, at $360 billion. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is also on the list at $191 billion. Big oil has not been entirely kicked off the list Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is on the list at $217 billion. Investors in rival Amazon and Walmart cannot help noting how far bricks and mortars have fallen behind e-commerce. Walmart is trying to catch up, piecemeal, most recently with its $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Two major banks are on the list, with market caps fairly close to one another. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) at $240 billion and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) at $245 billion. And, finally the two largest phone companies and wireless providers in the U.S. AT&T (NYSE: T) at $244 billion, and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) at $211 billion (Notably, no car companies are on the list, a departure from decades ago Top 20 market cap companies, courtesy of The Online Investor Large Cap Company                       Ticker    Market Cap ($in billions) Apple Inc                                          AAPL      555.71 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOGL     541.90 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOG      522.09 Microsoft Corporation                   MSFT      438.02 Facebook Inc                                   FB        364.99 Amazon.com Inc.                          AMZN      360.36 Exxon Mobil Corp.                       XOM       360.10 Johnson & Johnson                     JNJ       323.46 General Electric Co                      GE        269.82 Wells Fargo & Co.                        WFC       245.82 AT&T Inc                                       T         244.30 JPMorgan Chase & Co                  JPM       240.74 Procter & Gamble Co.                   PG        230.21 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.                   WMT       217.46 Verizon Communications Inc             VZ        211.23 Pfizer Inc                                         PFE       206.84 Visa Inc                                            V         191.94 Chevron Corporation                     CVX       191.05 Berkshire Hathaway Inc                 BRK.B     188.03 Coca-Cola Co (The)                        KO        182.44 By Douglas A.

Coming from the Greek word rhéos, meaning a flow or stream, the term describes plants with wide roots and flexible stalks, well adapted to strong currents rather than a pond’s or pasture’s stillness. For most of the 20th century, U.S. lawmakers worked to maintain just these sorts of conditions for the U.S. economy—a dynamic system, briskly flowing, that forced firms to adapt to the unpredictable currents of the free market or be washed away. In the past few decades, however, the economy has come to resemble something more like a stagnant pool. Entrepreneurship, as measured by the rate of new-business formation, has declined in each decade since the 1970s, and adults under 35 (a k a Millennials) are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation on record. This decline in dynamism has coincided with the rise of extraordinarily large and profitable firms that look discomfortingly like the monopolies and oligopolies of the 19th century. American strip malls and yellow pages used to brim with new small businesses. But today, in a lot where several mom-and-pop shops might once have opened, Walmart spawns another superstore. In almost every sector of the economy—including manufacturing, construction, retail, and the entire service sector—the big companies are getting bigger. The share of all businesses that are new firms, meanwhile, has fallen by 50 percent since 1978. According to the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank dedicated to advancing the ideals of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, “markets are now more concentrated and less competitive than at any point since the Gilded Age.” From Our October 2016 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe To comprehend the scope of corporate consolidation, imagine a day in the life of a typical American and ask: How long does it take for her to interact with a market that isn’t nearly monopolized? She wakes up to browse the internet, access to which is sold through a local monopoly. She stocks up on food at a superstore such as Walmart, which owns a quarter of the grocery market. If she gets indigestion, she might go to a pharmacy, likely owned by one of three companies controlling 99 percent of that market. If she’s stressed and wants to relax outside the shadow of an oligopoly, she’ll have to stay away from ebooks, music, and beer; two companies control more than half of all sales in each of these markets. There is no escape—literally. She can try boarding an airplane, but four corporations control 80 percent of the seats on domestic flights. Politicians from both parties publicly worship the solemn dignity of entrepreneurship and small businesses. But by the numbers, America has become the land of the big and the home of the consolidated. This is a problem. But it is not an accident. The bigness of business is a result of federal policy, which, in the past three decades, has deliberately made it easier for large companies to dominate their markets, provided that they keep prices down. After years of sluggish wage growth and low levels of entrepreneurship, some people are starting to worry that America’s biggest companies are growing at the expense of the economy, even if they offer consumers good deals. In the late 19th century, when the U.S. was beginning to develop into an industrial powerhouse, it was America’s first small-business owners—farmers—who initially pushed the government to intervene against trusts. They protested discriminatory shipping rates along rail lines, which were dominated by a handful of railroad magnates. Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to break up the trusts and protect competitive markets, but it took decades for the law to serve this purpose. (In fact, in the 1890s, the railroads used the act’s language against their own workers, arguing that a labor-union strike amounted to an illegal “conspiracy to restrict trade.”) Several Supreme Court decisions ultimately stiffened U.S. antitrust law. Perhaps the most important decision came in 1911, when the Court ruled that Standard Oil Company of New Jersey’s ownership of nearly 90 percent of U.S. oil production violated the law. The early antitrust reformers warned that even beyond its effect on prices, economic power could buy influence in Congress. Monopolies don’t just dominate their own industries, Justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933; they monopolize political power as well, which allows them to protect their incumbency and stifle competition in myriad ways. The trust-busting ethos gathered momentum; President Roosevelt transformed the antitrust division of the Justice Department from a tiny office of just over a dozen lawyers to a muscular force of nearly 500. But in the late 1970s and early 1980s, several prominent conservatives succeeded in persuading Washington—especially the Justice Department—to abandon its old dogmas about big business. In a book that galvanized a movement, The Antitrust Paradox, Robert Bork argued that the government fetishized competition and often leveled the playing field for the benefit of poorly run companies. The book argued that by protecting bad companies for the sake of competition, the government was keeping prices higher than they would be if the most-efficient companies were allowed to dominate. The Justice Department’s rules on vertical and horizontal mergers were rewritten to make it easier for large companies to merge, as long as the new, larger business could deliver lower prices. So antitrust law shifted over the course of the 20th century from principally protecting competition to principally protecting consumers. Today many reformers are calling for the pendulum to swing back. In a speech at the nonpartisan think tank New America in June, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that rule changes inspired by Bork have, well, borked America’s competitive spirit. Corporations that grew through mergers weren’t the only targets of her criticism. She also called out technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (the parent company of Google) for abusing their economic power. She accused Apple, for example, of using the iPhone to punish the music-streaming service Spotify and help its own equivalent product. “While Apple Music is readily accessible on everyone’s iPhone, Apple has placed conditions on its rivals that make it difficult for them to offer competing streaming services,” she said. Warren’s main argument was that allowing companies to grow without fear of interference from the Justice Department has stilled the waters of American dynamism. “Left unchecked, concentration will destroy innovation,” she said, before listing other casualties: start-ups, small companies, the economic security of the middle class. “Left unchecked,” she concluded, “concentration will pervert our democracy into one more rigged game.” By the numbers, America has become the land of the big and the home of the consolidated. Her clarion call has resonated with allies in Washington, not only for economic reasons, but also because, in an age of divided government, progressives are looking for an agenda that they can enact without groveling before a do-nothing Congress. The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers has published a lengthy report on the benefits of competition, and the Roosevelt Institute has called on the government to buff up its antitrust policy, in part by increasing scrutiny of how a potential merger would affect long-term competition and dynamism in the sector. Warren would like to see a renewed focus on companies that have grown large organically as well—for example, by getting the Federal Trade Commission to more fiercely fight anticompetitive behavior, such as Apple’s stonewalling of Spotify. All told, this would mean the most aggressive attempt to curb the growth of big business since the New Deal. But how big can a company get before it’s inherently bad for the economy? The technology sector presents a thorny problem for antitrust reformers. Between too-big-to-fail banks and seemingly incompetent cable companies, there may be popular support for action against consolidated market power. But many of the companies in Warren’s crosshairs are beloved. The three most admired American companies are Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon, according to Fortune; Facebook is in the top 15 and rising fast. Our attention seems to be ever more focused on our phones, and Apple owns 40 percent of the U.S. smartphone market; between them, Google and Facebook collect more than half of all mobile-display advertising revenues. If mobile phones, software, and social networks eat the world, who decides how big the portions can be? “I think this is the big policy question for this moment,” says Sabeel Rahman, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “Where do we draw the line between ‘good’ bigness and ‘bad’ bigness?” The debate is more than a century old. In the 1930s, Brandeis argued that large companies would inevitably exploit their workers, convert their profits into political influence, and corrode both the market and the machinations of government. But the Reagan administration and subsequent lawmakers have allowed vertical and horizontal integration on the theory that economies of scale often benefit both employees and consumers. The new antitrust crusaders are manning an old trench with fresh ammo. Brandeis was right, they argue, and the evidence of his rightness abounds: Citizens United has empowered business at the same time corporate profits have been hitting an all-time high; wages are stagnating at the same time stock buybacks and dividends soar; corporate mergers are spiking as entrepreneurship languishes; mom-and-pop stores are shuttering as corporate franchises fill the empty spaces. For decades, Bork and his acolytes had the U.S. government convinced that competition was overrated. But perhaps capitalism needs churn like some aquatic plants need a current. The free market is rheophytic. Bigger is not always bad, but if we’ve learned anything in the past three decades, it’s that a little froth is always good.

Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) whom Donald Trump has reportedly picked to be his national security adviser, is known for his long and distinguished military career, his unceremonious exit from the DIA, and for his controversial views on Islam, torture, and Russia. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was an early and ardent supporter of Trump’s improbable presidential run, giving the Republican presidential hopeful a much-needed endorsement from the national-security establishment. He led crowds at Trump’s rallies to chant “Lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent. “Donald Trump is about the future of this country and making sure that we take a direction … that puts us back on a track that we can continue to be the global leader around the world,” he told Fox Business Network in July. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Jacky Naegelen / Reuters The Problem With Abandoning the Paris Agreement Robinson Meyer Bill O’Reilly and Barack Obama agree: President-Elect Trump shouldn’t walk away from the first international climate treaty. If the Trump administration withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement, the country would face a massive global diplomatic backlash and permanently cede worldwide leadership on climate and renewable-energy issues to China, experts warn. Withdrawing from the treaty “would be a huge mistake, even forgetting about climate change,” said Todd Stern, the former U.S. special envoy on climate change. He added that it would have “radiating bad impacts with respect to U.S. standing” on all other international issues. We know very little for sure about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. So far, he has seemed to choose Russia-friendly advisors like General Michael Flynn, and he has not backed down from previous threats of a trade war with China. If the U.S. were to renege on its NATO commitments or enter a battle of tariffs with China, this could so remake global order that climate would slide off the international agenda. Continue Reading Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Will Trump Be Ready to Govern? Russell Berman The early days of his transition have looked like chaos, but veterans of the process say the president-elect has time to catch up. This was not exactly how the 2016 presidential transition was supposed to go. For years, legislators, civil servants, good-government advocates, and veterans of the last several administrations had been preparing for this very moment. Congress had passed two new laws allowing the two major-party nominees to begin planning earlier than ever, and the Obama administration was committed to handing off the baton of government in full stride. The singular goal was to make this transfer of presidential power the smoothest, most effective transition in U.S. history. Then came the unexpected victory of Donald Trump to blow it all to bits. The Trump transition has looked, from the outside, like a mess. Days after winning the presidency, the new president-elect abruptly replaced the man who for months had been running his transition efforts, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with the soon-to-be vice president, Mike Pence. Other departures quickly followed in what was described as “a purge” of people close to Christie. The leadership swap caused an important paperwork snafu, delaying by several days the point when Trump’s “landing teams” of potential appointees could begin on-the-job training at federal departments and agencies. A former national-security official in Republican administrations, Eliot Cohen, emerged from a single conversation with the transition team only to warn others to stay away. One of Trump’s first appointments, chief strategist Steve Bannon, prompted a firestorm of criticism over his website’s links to white nationalism. Leaks flowed out of Trump Tower faster than transition staff could plug them, while the president-elect himself sneaked away from his press corps for an evening out at the 21 Club in Manhattan.

At a glance, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim, the alternative, late-night comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 p.m. One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel, the show lurches from one surreal, sometimes violent, sketch to the next, and describes itself as being set in an “almost present-day, post-apocalyptic nightmare world.” But Million Dollar Extreme, which premiered in August, is also from the mind of Sam Hyde, an unapologetic member of the alt-right. Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young, liberal, Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to like-minded members of a white-nationalist movement that generally supports Donald Trump.

Alana Semuels So-called activist investors are increasingly gaining control of legacy corporations, forcing them to trim payrolls and downsize research operations—and, quite possibly, damaging the entire economy. WILMINGTON, Del.—Ron Ozer was thrilled to get a job with DuPont, the two-centuries-old chemical company, when he finished his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1990. It was the place to go for young, ambitious chemists; it offered salary and benefits so generous that some people called it “Uncle Dupey.” For 26 years, he invented things for DuPont, filing patent after patent, working on renewable plastic bottles and polymers from the company’s Experimental Station, a research lab where Kevlar, Neoprene, and nylon were all invented. Then, in January of this year, he was abruptly fired, along with hundreds of other employees at the Experimental Station, part of a company-wide wave of 1,700 layoffs, one-third of DuPont’s Delaware workforce. Globally, DuPont cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 5,000 people in early 2016.

What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar.

Like many retail owners , the president and founder of Hobby Works, a four-location hobby and toy store based in Laurel, Maryland, is gearing up for the holiday selling season. That includes putting in orders of his specialty totes for the paraphernalia of hobby enthusiasts, which he manufactures using a Chinese factory. But he's worried his shipments will be delayed, thanks to the bankruptcy of South Korean shipping giant Hanjin, which at the end of August sent shock waves throughout the commercial world when it announced it would enter receivership. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.57 -0.62 -0.90% MSC Co Ltd 009780 ▲ 14,050.00 +450.00 +3.31% Kohl's Corp KSS ▼ 54.13 -0.38 -0.70% National Retail Properties Inc NNN ▼ 41.40 -0.06 -0.14% Not only is Hanjin responsible for nearly 8% of all trans-Pacific trade volume, but its failure comes at a time when retailers large and small are putting in their final orders with manufacturers and stocking up in preparation for the holiday shopping season. Hanjin, the seventh-largest shipper in the world, has reportedly left stranded nearly half of its fleet of 100 vessels in ports around the world. Although Hanjin is said to be working on the solution, its ships, carrying billions of dollars worth of merchandise, are unable to pay the terminal operators the various offloading and fuel surcharge fees required to get the cargo moving. Eliminating such a large carrier also constricts the shipping pipeline for new shipments until the crisis is resolved. Brey, whose company has 50 employees and annual revenue of $6 million, says he probably ships about 12 containers a year using the Evergreen Line and MSC Cargo. Yet even though he doesn't use Hanjin, he believes the shipments of his product are in jeopardy. "This is the time when all the big boys–the Walmarts and Amazons and Kohl's of the world–are pushing their factories to get their products manufactured and shipped to the states and ready to move to stores," Brey says. "If we have prearranged with [our shippers] to do two containers at the end of November, and then Walmart says we need this entire ship, guess what will happen to me."© Provided by Fortune Operations At A Hanjin Newport Co. (HJNC) Terminal The largest retailers and their vendors have well-established shipping contingency plans for emergencies such as bankruptcy or natural disasters, which enable them to shift from one carrier to another to ensure proper delivery of products, says Jonathan Gold, vice president for supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation. That's not necessarily the case for smaller retailers, who lack the scale of their larger competitors. "There is the potential that smaller retailers could be harmed," Gold said. One reason is that contingency plans for smaller businesses can be radically more expensive. Freight forwarding companies such as Unitrans Worldwide, a 12-employee company based in Randolph, Massachusetts, for example, provide full-service shipping arrangements to small manufacturers and retailers. During the West Coast port shutdown in 2015, Lindsay Barich, the company's chief executive and founder, said he was able to manage deliveries to other ports throughout the U.S. Given the timing of Hanjin's bankruptcy, some of Barich's customers have found their only option is shipping their cargo by plane, he says. For example, Barich says he helped a local manufacturer and retailer of sporting goods products transport its polo shirts, golf shoes, and belts using an air carrier, so it would have the products in time for the holidays. Yet the expedited service came at a steep cost, of about $11,000 for the order, more than three times the cost of shipping the cargo by boat. "They paid an exorbitant amount of money for something that could have gone by ocean," Barich says. Related: Why Fintech Startups Are Flocking to a 124-Year-Old Bank in Kansas Rising shipping costs and delays related to the Hanjin bankruptcy are also something that Bryan Pate, the chief executive and co-founder of ElliptiGo, a San Diego-based elliptical bicycle manufacturer with 22 employees, says are now on his radar . The company ships about 40 containers worth of product a year from Taiwan, destined for 250 retailers around the U.S. as well as for sale online at its own website. Pate says his director of operations has gotten shipping estimates that are between 15% and 75% higher from his own freight forwarder, which uses Hanjin, among other large worldwide shippers. "We were shocked to hear the news," Pate says. He adds that the company could handle a small rate increase , but would have a hard time continuing to expand if rates were to jump 75%. "That would cost us about $80,000 a year, which is like adding another employee," Pate says.

Walmart took the step after a review of Welspun's cotton sheets, a move spurred by rival Target Corporation cutting ties with the Indian vendor. Unlike Target, Walmart said it won't end all business with Welspun, which is putting stronger quality controls in place and adopting new labelling practices. "Our customers trust us to provide products that are what they say they are on the label," Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, said in an email on Friday. "Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund." Walmart's move threatens to further tarnish Welspun's image, though the Indian company will at least maintain a relationship with the world's largest retailer. Target said last month that it would end all business with Welspun, one of the world's biggest textile manufacturers, because the vendor was sending it phony Egyptian-cotton sheets. Since Target's decision was announced, Welspun shares have fallen 45 per cent. And other retailers have said they will probe the authenticity of their Welspun products. "We take the current traceability concerns around some of our product lines very seriously and have been working closely with our retail partners to support their actions toward a comprehensive resolution program," a Welspun spokesman said in an emailed statement on Saturday. "The affected products represent around 6 per cent of Welspun's total business." The controversy has raised awareness about cotton certification, and whether household products are indeed manufactured in their labelled country of origin. Customers often pay a premium for Egyptian-cotton products because they are perceived to be softer and more durable. Sheets made from cotton grown in other countries don't always carry the same cachet among Americans. Walmart announced on August 23 that it was reviewing Welspun's cotton certification records, as well as checking other suppliers of Egyptian-cotton products. Walmart is one of Welspun's largest customers, along with Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, which also is reviewing its Welspun products. Welspun is part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka - with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure. The company says it makes every fifth towel sold in the US and counts JC Penney Co and Macy's among its customers. Walmart sold the Welspun sheets and pillow cases under the names Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy. "If a customer believes they have these sheets, they can bring in the sheets, tags of the sheets or receipt into one of our US stores and receive a refund," McInnis said. WELSPUN IN A SPIN "Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable," says Walmart   Welspun, in a BSE filing, said: "Welspun is working to implement stronger control and better label the products"   A fortnight ago, US retail giant Target Corporation terminated contract with Welspun. After this, Welspun appointed EY to look into the alleged lapses   US-based retail chains Bed Bath & Beyond and JCPenney are also conducting third party audit of items sourced from Welspun Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 Demonetisation: Shortage of engineers responsible for the big ATM mess?

Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging factories that supply products to global chains like Wal-Mart and H&M.  In 2012, a fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers.  A year later, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster.

The product line in question with Walmart accounts for approximately 1.5 percent of Welspun’s annual business, it added. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau Welspun India will continue to do business with Walmart and is working to implement stronger controls and better label the products being supplied, the company said in a statement on Saturday. The statement came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc Friday said it will stop selling Egyptian cotton sheets made by Welspun as it was not assured about the authenticity of the products. Walmart plans to withdraw the products from its online and offline stores and provide full refund to customers. "The affected products represent around 6 percent of Welspun’s annual business. The product line in question with Walmart accounts for approximately 1.5 percent of Welspun’s annual business," the release said. Welspun has been in the midst of controversy after one of its US-based customers Target Corp last month severed all ties claiming that Welspun, for nearly two years, had been supplying sheets made of cheaper variety of cotton instead of the premium Egyptian cotton as per the deal.   The company has engaged a Big Four consultancy firm to review its processes to put to rest the "traceability concerns" with respect to its Egyptian cotton products, the statement said.   Tags  Welspun India Wal-mart Stores Inc Egyptian cotton Related Stories Welspun India shares extend fall, dip over 4% on Q2 net loss Welspun India yesterday reported a consolidated ne Will continue to have double-digit growth next year: Welspun In an interview to CNBC-TV18 Altaf Jiwani, CFO at Welspun Q2 net loss at Rs 147.52 cr on Egyptian Cotton issue Its income from operations in the quarter under re Welspun to closely monitor its Egyptian cotton business The steps to be initiated include deployment of a Welspun India: Outcome of board meeting Welspun India Ltd has informed BSE that the Board Set email alert for Welspun India : Set Alert Buy, Hold, Sell ?

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Groups spending millions on charter school ballot question Friday Sep 9, 2016 at 6:38 PM Sep 10, 2016 at 9:10 AM Scott O'Connell Telegram & Gazette Staff @ScottOConnellTG A former New York City mayor, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s company group, and two Walmart heirs are among the major donors to a ballot campaign seeking to open the door for more charter schools in the state, while teachers unions are funding the opposition effort, according to campaign finance reports. According to the state’s Office of Campaign & Political Finance, there has been a flurry of donations – much of it coming from out of state – and spending since the start of the year on Question 2 on the state’s general election ballot this fall. Supporters of the ballot question seek to authorize the state to allow up to a dozen new charter schools to open each year. They argue the autonomous public schools provide a needed alternative to regular public schools, especially in struggling urban school districts. Opponents say more charter schools, the superiority of which to regular schools they argue is still unproven, will sap even more public education money away from those underfunded public schools. According to the OCPF’s online database, there are four committees backing Question 2 this year: Great Schools Massachusetts, Expanding Educational Opportunities, Yes on Two, and the Campaign for Fair Access to Quality Public Schools. Of those, Great Schools has by far been the busiest fundraiser and biggest spender, taking in almost $8.2 million since the start of the year and spending $5.2 million. Most of those contributions came from a single source: New York-based Families For Excellent Schools Advocacy, Inc., which gave multiple donations totaling more than $5.7 million, the committee’s latest report with the OCPF shows. The committee also received a $240,000 donation from billionaire businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Several in-state donors pitched in as well, led by Lynnfield-based Strong Economy For Growth, Inc., which gave multiple contributions totaling $650,000. Great Schools spent most of its money, meanwhile, on advertising, including a combined $4.3 million on media buys. The Campaign for Fair Access committee, the next biggest fundraiser, has only recently started receiving donations since organizing in July, but has pulled in a sizeable amount of money in that short time. Of the nearly $2.3 million the committee has gotten in contributions over that period, the biggest donation came from Arvest Bank Group president Jim Walton, son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, who gave more than $1.1 million to the campaign. The committee so far has spent more than $500,000 of that haul, mostly on campaign management services. The committee dropped $450,000 alone on hiring Wellesley-based Five Corner Strategies, according to OCPF’s records. Yes on Two is also a relative newcomer to the campaign, bringing in a quick $710,100 since organizing in July. Almost all of that money came from a single donor, Mr. Walton’s sister, philanthropist Alice Walton, and all of it has already been spent, primarily as a nearly $704,000 donation to the Campaign for Fair Access committee. Lastly, Expanding Educational Opportunities brought in its entire $325,000 haul in the past month alone, $250,000 of which was then sent over to Great Schools. The committee’s only donors were the Kraft Group and Partners Healthcare, which gave $100,000 apiece, EMC Corporation, which gave $75,000, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, which gave $50,000. The lone committee opposing Question 2, Save Our Public Schools, has so far been outspent by the pro-question groups, but has still taken in almost $6.8 million since forming in March. It’s also spent $3.6 million over the same period on various campaign expenses, including more than $400,000 on TV advertising. The committee’s biggest donations came from teachers unions; the Massachusetts Teachers Association, for instance, gave nearly $4.2 million in multiple contributions, while the American Federation of Teachers donated just over $700,000. The National Education Association pitched in $1.9 million as well. Finance reports submitted to the OCPF on Friday satisfied the agency's requirement that all ballot campaign committees file their latest financial records 60 days in advance of the general election, which this year falls on Nov. 8.

Wal-Mart took the step after a review of Welspun's cotton sheets, a move spurred by rival Target cutting ties with the Indian vendor. Unlike Target, Wal-Mart said it won't end all business with Welspun, which is putting stronger quality controls in place and adopting new labeling practices. "Our customers trust us to provide products that are what they say they are on the label," Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said in an email on Friday. "Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Wal-Mart's move threatens to further tarnish Welspun's image, though the Indian company will at least maintain a relationship with the world's largest retailer. Target said last month that it would end all business with Welspun, one of the world's biggest textile manufacturers, because the vendor was sending it phony Egyptian-cotton sheets. Since Target's decision was announced, Welspun shares have fallen 45 percent. And other retailers have said they will probe the authenticity of their Welspun products. The controversy has raised awareness about cotton certification, and whether household products are indeed manufactured in their labeled country of origin. Customers often pay a premium for Egyptian-cotton products because they are perceived to be softer and more durable. Sheets made from cotton grown in other countries don't always carry the same cachet among Americans. Wal-Mart announced on Aug. 23 that it was reviewing Welspun's cotton certification records, as well as checking other suppliers of Egyptian-cotton products. Wal-Mart is one of Welspun's largest customers, along with Target and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., which also is reviewing its Welspun products. Welspun is part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka — with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure. The company says it makes every fifth towel sold in the U.S. and counts J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc among its customers. Wal-Mart sold the Welspun sheets and pillow cases under the names Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy. "If a customer believes they have these sheets, they can bring in the sheets, tags off the sheets or receipt into one of our U.S. stores and receive a refund," McInnis said.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

But it’s also important how we remember. In a well-intended display at a Panama City, Fla., Wal-Mart this week, a Coca-Cola supplier brought down the righteous ire of social media by stacking cases of Coke in the shape of the Twin Towers – with red, white and blue cases behind them in the shape of an American flag. The display was taken down and an apology offered. We have no doubt both the display and apology were sincere. But it’s a cautionary tale for retailers across the country: Mixing solemn remembrances with retail sales is a delicate matter indeed, and probably ought to be avoided all together. “Delicate” is hardly the word to describe a TV commercial a San Antonio mattress retailer ran recently, which featured a 9/11-themed “Twin Tower Sale.” Unbelievably, the ad sported two “towers” of mattresses that are – supposedly comically – knocked down at the end of the spot. “What better way to remember 9/11 than with a Twin Tower sale?” a woman asks in the commercial. After the shameless plug and presumed hilarity, the woman incongruously seizes up in a moment of seriousness to say “We’ll never forget.” We’d rather she did – if this is how she’s going to remember. It’s the most disgusting advertisement, and the most garish display of raw, ugly, exploitative consumerism that you will ever see. What were these people thinking? It certainly wasn’t about the 3,000 dead on 9/11, or their many thousands of survivors, or the many millions of Americans who still mourn that horrific event to this day. What creates such empty-headed emotional detachment from such a historic atrocity? Surely it’s not just time: It’s only been 15 years – and we’ve certainly done a much better job of respectfully commemorating the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was back in 1941. Maybe present-day Americans – better fed and enjoying more creature comforts than any people in history, and removed from the mandatory military service that might open our eyes wider – have lost a sense of reverence that used to ground us. Just look at our entertainment media, in which absolutely nothing is sacred and everything is fair game for mockery. Take the raunchy adult cartoon Family Guy, which is even billed – admiringly – as “sick” and “twisted.” The show once included a joke that rescued kidnapping victim Elizabeth Smart had brought music back to her family’s home – but that most of the songs were about rape. Do these people not realize there are human beings on the other end of these vulgar outbursts? We need to remember 9/11 solemnly – not with mattress sales as if it’s nothing more than George Washington’s birthday. But more important, we could honor the victims of 9/11 by forming a more perfect union – with citizens who are educated and reverential to the past – to our forebears and their tribulations, to the fact that we stand on their shoulders today, and to our contemporaries who still suffer the gashing wounds of 9/11, war and terrorism. Of course, to grasp the first thing about inhumanity, much less the depth of its touch, one must first explore one’s humanity. It appears we’ve got some work to do on that.

STEPHEN, NEW BRUNSWICK — A man from Maine was arrested Wednesday after he used an air mattress purchased from Walmart to paddle across the St. Croix River and into Canadian territory, according to the Portland Press Herald. John Michael Bennett, 25, of Calais, Maine, claimed he was very concerned about his pregnant fiancee, who, he said, was in danger because of a violent ex-boyfriend. After attempting and failing to enter the country through an official border station, Bennett went to the local Walmart and bought both an air mattress and a paddle that he subsequently used to cross the river into Canada. Authorities say Bennett was rejected from the border station due to a pending criminal mischief charge he has in Calais. Bennett took the air mattress to a riverbank and inflated it, before getting in it and paddling across the "1,000 to 2,000 feet wide" section of river. Bennett's crossing was reported to authorities by a Canadian resident, after which Bennett was picked up by border patrol agents and police on Ledge Road in St. Stephen. Bennett appeared in court on Thursday and pleaded guilty to crossing into Canada illegally. As a result, he was sentenced to two months in jail and will also be deported to the U.S. after his sentence is over. "Although this was somewhat comedic in terms of how he came across, the larger message needed to be sent out to the public on both sides of the border that the penalties will be significant no matter what the circumstances," said Peter Thorn, a lawyer representing the federal Public Prosecution Service of Canada.   MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive Instagram Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

The 46-year-old 30 Rock star was left seriously injured in June, 2014, after a Wal-mart truck crashed into the comedian's limousine van in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy MACk' MCNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. He was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series at the Creative Arts Emmys on Saturday (10Sep16) for his appearance on Saturday Night Live in October last year (15) - his first TV gig since the fatal crash. Despite losing out to Girls star Peter Scolari at the ceremony, which was held at the Microsoft Theatre L.A. LIVE in Los Angeles, Tracy said he was honoured to even be considered. "I came back from a place that nobody thought I was going to come back from, you know? This is for all the survivors and my boy, Jimmy MACk (James MCNair) and it means a lot to me," he told Entertainment Tonight at the ceremony. "It really means a lot to me just to be alive. So I've transcended showbusiness in that sense," he added. Morgan took his wife Megan Wollover as his date to the awards, and said it was her unwavering support that got him through his tough recovery following the crash: "She's my strength, she's my wisdom. That's my lady, that's my wife, and all of that is self-explanatory," he said. And, after the trauma of the last few years, Tracy is just happy to be taking things day by day. "What's next at this point? I'm just going to say one word, it's self-explanatory: tomorrow," he shared.

Their Air France flight was two hours from landing when a plane crashed into the first World Trade Center building. Then 17 minutes later a plane hit the second tower. Another 20 minutes later, all air space was closed. Tuerff’s plane switched directions and the flight map on the screens in front of their seats showed they were headed to the North Pole. Really, his plane, and 37 other diverted flights, were headed to a small Canadian town in Newfoundland. Nearly 7,000 strangers descended on Gander, nearly doubling its 10,000 population. After more than 28 hours on the plane, in-flight and then on the tarmac in Gander, Tuerff and his boyfriend spent three and a half days sleeping on the floor in a school, without any sense of when or how they’d get home. But the inconvenience, the discomfort, the fear is not what Tuerff remembers from those harrowing few days. He remembers the teenage boy who handed him pillows and an air mattress from home. He remembers the townspeople cooking smorgasbords of food. He remembers the woman who drove him to a workout facility where he could have a shower and the other resident who drove him to a Wal-Mart to buy new underwear. He remembers kindness. [RELATED: On 9/11, a tiny Canadian town opened its runways and heart to 7,000 stranded travelers] A year later, Tuerff, the owner of an environmental company, felt compelled to do something that would honor the residents of Gander. So he closed his business on Sept. 11, 2002, and gave each of his 40 employees $100. He told them to spend the money on acts of kindness and then at the end of the day they would come together and discuss what each had done. He’s done it every year since, each time retelling his employees the story of how a town of strangers, on a day of uncertainty and fear, didn’t hesitate to welcome people from a cross section of races and religions. “The idea was, we could have just closed the office and said go do good deeds, but my thought process was let’s help inspire people to pay it forward,” Tuerff said. “Let’s make that happen and do it on the anniversary and tell the story of, on this terrible tragic day, the goodness of people who stepped up and restored my faith in humanity.” Kevin Tuerff pictured here in the days after Sept. 11, 2001 in Gander, New Foundland in a new white T-shirt and socks purchased at Walmart. (Courtesy: Kevin Tuerff) One employee paid $7 to fix a man’s flat tire. She left $50 and told the mechanic it should cover the next seven flats. One called a school and asked what supplies it needed. Another put $50 on a Starbucks gift card and handed it to a customer in line with the instructions to use it on themselves and then pass the card on. More than nine months later, Tuerff got a call from a friend who had just had her coffee paid for with the gift card. The person who gave it to her said it was for some kind of pay it forward project. The little-known Sept. 11 story, of the thousands of people from around the world who found themselves stranded and homeless on an island on the tip of North America, is now a musical, “Come From Away,” currently playing at Ford’s Theater in Washington before heading to Broadway next spring. Tuerff, now 50, is one of the characters portrayed in the show, and after Sunday’s matinee, 15 years to the day since he landed in Newfoundland, he spoke to the audience about his annual pay it forward initiative. What’s more, the producers of the show gave each of the cast members $100 to pay it forward and on Sunday four of them spoke about what they did with the money. Q. Smith, who plays a woman stranded in Gander who can’t reach her New York City firefighter son, said she put money on people’s Metro cards, bought a guy his Coke, and purchased magic-marker art from a homeless woman. Rodney Hicks, who plays a black man initially wary of how he’ll be treated in this mostly white town, said he broke the money into fives and visited a variety of stores. He’d jump in line in front of the person at the cash register and pay for whatever they were buying. “The look of gratitude not only on their faces, but also in their energy, there was a shift that happened. We could feel it,” Hicks said. “It was incredible to change their universe just a little bit with a simple gesture.” Caesar Samayoa, who plays Tuerff’s boyfriend in the play, said he gave money to employees at different establishments and told them to pay for a customer’s meal and explain to them why. “It was profound what happened being a part of this, to see the change of demeanor in people who are tired and have been working so hard,” he said. “They’re so grateful they could share this kindness with someone else.” And Kendra Kassebaum, who played Gander’s news reporter, a flight attendant and other small roles, choked up as she talked about how shocked people were being the beneficiaries of unexpected kindness. Tuerff was recently going through a box of old keepsakes and found an Air France menu from that day. Waiting on the tarmac, at that point for seven hours, with news coming in drips, and no idea when he was getting off the plane, Tuerff started writing notes on the menu. He began, “The world changed today, for the worst.” In many ways, he was right, of course. But what he didn’t know in that moment is that in several hours, when he stepped off the plane for a few sleepless nights in Gander, his worldview would change for the better.

Police said the confrontation Sunday afternoon in Shawnee began when two suspects hit a woman who was putting her child in her car in the head from behind. Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis says a person in the parking lot who tried to help was shot several times. Another good Samaritan then shot one of the suspects, who died at the scene. The second suspect fled but was caught near the store. The female victim and the other person who was shot were both hospitalized in critical condition. Tennis said a motive for the initial attack on the woman is not yet clear. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Today, we look at the textiles sector, in the first part Weeks after the Welspun controversy broke and prominent US retailer Target Corporation severed ties for selling it something other than what was contracted, Walmart, the biggest chain in the world, has for the same reason ended its partnership with the Mumbai-based textile giant on selling Egyptian cotton sheets. This has set off alarm bells for the entire exporting community, especially in textiles and apparel, where unorganised businesses have flourished over the years, with many of them serving as essential building blocks in the value chain of big companies. Welspun India, for which the product in question is six per cent of total business, has appointed EY (earlier Ernst & Young) to review supply chain systems and processes. This was after Target alleged Welspun had for two years been passing off cheaper sheets as premium Egyptian cotton. That a past employee leaked the information on the Egyptian cotton issue, as reports suggest, has highlighted that insiders knew quality standards were ignored. EY will investigate internal checks and processes as part of its audit. The issue goes much beyond Welspun. Global legal and regulatory frameworks are clamping down. The US, UK and European Union are in the forefront, insisting any product that is imported be compliant with their laws and regulations - on quality standards, labour laws, environmental guidelines and anti-money laundering. Adherence with rules that prevent bribery and corruption is part of the list. Some recent developments show how the scrutiny is being stepped up. The US in March passed a Trade Enforcement Act, giving wide powers to the Customs to stop any goods from entering if found violating the regulations. In May, it reformed the anti-money laundering and anti-corruption guidelines; the European Union, UK and many others have been doing that as well. This resulted in many companies from various countries being subjected to heavy penalties. Says an international trade expert and forensic auditor, "All these are aimed at ensuring trade mechanisms are not used to finance terrorism, which has now taken the shape of organised financial crime." Such activities, he said, were being executed via multiple transactions. Welspun, as reports indicate, fell short of the needed compliance in this changing global regulatory and legal landscape of the export universe. Rahul Mehta, president, Clothing Manufacturers Association of India, said: "International laws are getting more and more stringent, and difficult to follow. Large buyers from the developed world, of which the US and EU are the biggest markets, will eventually move to big and integrated players in India.'' Small and mid-size importers from the developed world might still prefer to deal with small and medium companies in India. That division of the market seemed an emerging trend, he said, and could lead to consolidation in the manufacturing and exporting space. How will the exporting community change itself? "Indian exporters will gradually start taking more and more care in ensuring efficiency and insisting compliance from their suppliers as awareness spreads,'' according to Mehta. He believes they might soon insist on a legal undertaking from their vendors and suppliers, seeking assurance on compliance with all legal provisions and fair business practises. The compliance cost for exporters will increase, affecting the competitiveness of our exports, said experts. On the other hand, Bangladesh, China and other competing countries are being made to go through the same regulatory drill. Global risk management gurus agree. Anurag Jain, who leads market development for risk business at Thomson Reuters, said: "The impact of third-party risk and the associated relationship cannot be underestimated. Organisations need trusted risk intelligence that can help them improve overall transparency and monitoring of suppliers at regular intervals.'' Developing risk intelligence in the supply chain will help navigate through today's complexities, ensuring existing customers are served more effectively, he added.

Says an international trade expert and forensic auditor, "All these are aimed at ensuring trade mechanisms are not used to finance terrorism, which has now taken the shape of organised financial crime." Such activities, he said, were being executed via multiple transactions. Welspun, as reports indicate, fell short of the needed compliance in this changing global regulatory and legal landscape of the export universe. Rahul Mehta, president, Clothing Manufacturers Association of India, said: "International laws are getting more and more stringent, and difficult to follow. Large buyers from the developed world, of which the US and EU are the biggest markets, will eventually move to big and integrated players in India.'' Small and mid-size importers from the developed world might still prefer to deal with small and medium companies in India. That division of the market seemed an emerging trend, he said, and could lead to consolidation in the manufacturing and exporting space. How will the exporting community change itself? "Indian exporters will gradually start taking more and more care in ensuring efficiency and insisting compliance from their suppliers as awareness spreads,'' according to Mehta. He believes they might soon insist on a legal undertaking from their vendors and suppliers, seeking assurance on compliance with all legal provisions and fair business practises. The compliance cost for exporters will increase, affecting the competitiveness of our exports, said experts. On the other hand, Bangladesh, China and other competing countries are being made to go through the same regulatory drill. Global risk management gurus agree. Anurag Jain, who leads market development for risk business at Thomson Reuters, said: "The impact of third-party risk and the associated relationship cannot be underestimated. Organisations need trusted risk intelligence that can help them improve overall transparency and monitoring of suppliers at regular intervals.'' Developing risk intelligence in the supply chain will help navigate through today's complexities, ensuring existing customers are served more effectively, he added.

TV Opinion Weird Election 2016 Sports Entertainment Food Newsletter Search Follow @mediaite Like us on Facebook Menu Megyn Kelly on Fox Colleagues: It’s Like a Big Family With One ‘Weird Uncle' Man Basically Dissolves After Falling Into Yellowstone Hot Spring... Why Are People So Shocked Pence's Photo With the GOP Is So, So White? Megyn Kelly Scolds Trump Supporter: 'You Can't Be Citing Japanese Internment Camps as Precedent!' White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Opinion Meet Donald Trump’s Basket of ‘Deplorables’ by Dean Obeidallah | 1:54 pm, September 11th, 2016   Hillary Clinton did make a few mistakes Friday with this comment slamming Trump supporters: “To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.” She continued, “Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamiphobic, you name it.” Her first mistake was not adding the line, “And some, I assume, are good people.” After all that is the exact comment Trump used when he maligned Mexican immigrants as being rapists and drug dealers but his supporters had no problem with that. Her second mistake––as Clinton has acknowledged––was quantifying the percentage of Trump supporters who subscribe to hateful and truly un-American views. It could be five percent or 65 percent––who knows. Of course, given Trump’s history of racism, sexism and bigotry he’s clearly 100 percent deplorable. But her biggest mistake was not detailing the bigots and racists who are part of Team Trump. The Trump campaign has truly been the WalMart of hate––whatever type you want, he has it. And on some level it appears Trump’s goal is to mainstream bigotry and racism with his embrace of certain extremists, his retweeting of white supremacist tweets, and his refusal to vocally denounce the endorsement of the Klan’s David Duke until a media firestorm erupted. Clinton should have simply detailed the hate found under the Trump umbrella to see if Americans really wanted to share a seat with them on the Trump train. Here are some examples: 1. White Supremacists: David Duke doesn’t just support Trump in spirit, he recently recorded a robocall to help attract other white supremacists to vote Trump. And other leading white supremacists also love Trump such as Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor who recently told the media “Most white people, whether they say so or not, would prefer to live… in a majority white country but they’re too terrified to say it.” 2. Neo Nazis– The Daily Stormer, one of the leading New Nazi websites is all in for Trump as noted in its article, “We are all Donald Trump now.” When I called out Trump’s failure to denounce the support of this hate website in an article, Daily Stormer editor Andrew Anglin penned an article denouncing me as a “Moslem terrorist.” (I love taunting the bigots!) 3. Anti-Semites – There has been a drumbeat of vile anti-Semitic attacks upon Jewish journalists who have criticized Trump. We are talking Jewish reporters being sent Holocaust imagery such as cartoons of Jews being shot in the head and ovens, calling them at home and playing Hitler speeches and making death threats. It became so alarming that one female Jewish reporter bought a gun to protect her family from Trump’s anti-Semitic fans. And alarmingly, when Trump was asked by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in May if he had a message to his supporters spewing anti-Semitic garbage, he didn’t denounce them. Instead Trump responded, “I don’t have a message to the fans.” (That’s clearly a message: I want your support.) 4. Anti-LGBT: Just this past weekend Trump spoke to his adoring fans at the Value Voters Summit, an event The Advocate notes is “a yearly conference hosted by the homophobic, transphobic Family Research Council. ” This groups despicable goal is preventing gays and lesbians from being treated equally in America as noted on its website: “We oppose the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law, in the media, and in schools.” 5. Anti-Muslim bigots– The queen of Muslim hate, Pam Geller loves her self some Trump as she noted in her article for Breitbart.com, “Trump Is Right, and He Must Win.” For those lucky enough to have not heard of Geller, she has been denounced the Anti Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for her jihad against Muslims. Same goes for Anti-Muslim activist Frank Gaffney, who apparently is now part of Team Trump. And there are numerous individuals who formally work on Trump’s campaign or are very public supporters who are also loathsome. For example, former Trump campaign official and current Trump cheerleader Roger Stone has made horribly racist comments about African Americans on Twitter, including calling Roland Martin a “stupid negro” and a “fat negro,” Herman Cain a “mandingo,” and former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) an “arrogant know-it-all negro.” There’s also Steve Bannon, former editor of the alt-right website Breitbart.com (translation: platform for hate versus minorities) who now serves as Trump’s CEO. And Trump’s apparent debate coach Roger Ailes who was forced out of Fox News after reportedly sexually harassing up to 20 female employees who worked for him. BTW Trump recently defended Ailes against the alleged sexual harassment claims by accusing the women of lying. I think you get the idea. Clinton should’ve covered those specific groups and people supporting Trump instead of estimating what percentage of Trump supports subscribe to their views. But lets be honest, if you support Trump it does not mean you are a bigot. It does mean, however, you are enabling Trump’s racism, bigotry and sexism. — — Dean Obeidallah is a former lawyer turned comedian and writer.

Football team, led by Charlie O’Dell (with flag). PHOTO by Nick Falzerano, Nicholas Studios Updated: 8:31 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 11, 2016  |  Posted: 9:23 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016 After a one hour and 49 minute weather delay due to lightning and torrential rains, the Dayton Flyers-Robert Morris game at Welcome Stadium Saturday was called with UD ahead, 13-0. Afterward, in the safety of the Flyers’ dressing room behind UD Arena, assistant coach Charlie O’Dell was in the back of the cramped coaches’ quarters pecking out a message on his phone. He wasn’t texting about the game or the weather or sending a quick note to his wife, he was communing with Nick Falzerano about a moment 15 years ago. A moment in which they are forever intertwined. Today marks 15 years since the September 11,, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the airliner that crashed in a Pennsylvania field. In all, 2,996 people were killed and more than 6,000 were injured. On the eve of the 9/11 anniversary, O’Dell was responding to Falzerano, who had messaged that he’d gotten interest from various people about that iconic photo he took in which Charlie had been a focal point. O’Dell said he often thinks of that photo as 9/11 approaches: “It’s an annual reminder of the tragedy and the heroism of the people back then and it’s also a reminder of the daily battle we fight against terrorism now.” While, sadly, terrorism is now a part of the daily fabric of life in America, back in 2001 it was something people weren’t used to and it left them sad, suffering and afraid. The National Football League and major college football programs cancelled their games for the upcoming weekend. But Miami Valley high schools decided to play three days afterward. And Bellbrook High – where O’Dell was a beefy, burr-headed senior lineman and team captain – was hosting Northridge. “I was trying to focus so hard on the game, but I was having trouble,” O’Dell told me back then. “I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened — how all those people had been killed, how everything was being threatened.” Before the game he and another team captain went to Walmart and bought the last pack of American flag decals and gave them to their teammates to paste on their purple football helmets. Many of the players used a felt-tipped pen to write “USA” or “Remember NYC & DC “on their taped hands. Before the game Kevin Basinger, then the Eagles head coach, talked to the team about America and then assistant coach Todd Paul asked if one of the players wanted to carry the American flag he’d brought out onto the field. O’Dell volunteered. Falzerano – himself a Bellbrook High grad and a photographer of note – had been tipped off that the team was about to run out with the flag, so he positioned himself “smack dab in the middle of the field.” And then the purple gates in front of the goalpost burst open and the crouching parents with fire extinguishers unleashed a magical blanket of smoke and through it all came O’Dell, the American flag held high in his left hand as his teammates came rampaging onto the field right behind him. Up in the stands many people began to weep. On the field, Falzerano began back-pedaling and managed to fire off just four frames. One image was perfect and he sent it to Sports Illustrated on speculation. The magazine featured it in a two-page spread in the front of the September 24 issue, “Nick’s photograph captured the essence of what we were looking for,” said SI picture editor Jim Colton. “It was very poignant and colorful and the kid carrying the flag had a great expression on his face. “It showed these kids weren’t ruffled. And the background with the scoreboard reading “1st and 10” very subtly expressed the challenge ahead.” The image lifted people when they needed it most and the magazine sold out in stores around Bellbrook. Soon after, Falzerano turned the photo into a “United We Stand” poster that was popular across Southwest Ohio and especially in classrooms at Bellbrook High. On Saturday Falzerano said he had a request from teacher Chris Bertke, who needed another poster because the one in her classroom “was getting a little rough.” As Basinger, once explained it: “It’s something we’re all very proud of. But it’s not so much that we were in Sports Illustrated as the fact that we could be the picture of the nation that night. That’s what was so humbling.” For O’Dell that period had special resonance: “We were the first 9/11 generation. We were seniors in high school, 18 years old, and we’d be the youngest ones who would enlist in the service to protect the country.” Saturday he said “within a couple of years we had guys on the battlefields in Afghanistan”. Today, along with being a part-time assistant coach at UD, O’Dell teaches junior high history in Bellbrook and coaches varsity track there. While he teaches ancient history, he said he’s devoting Monday to the discussion of terrorism and he’ll reflect on the events of Sept. 11, 2001. So do his young students realize he was the guy carrying the flag in that celebrated photo? “Naah, to them anybody over 20 is old,” he laughed. “To them I’m just another old guy who doesn’t quite get it.” That wasn’t the case 15 years ago when he was that young Bellbrook lineman who didn’t just lift a flag, but lifted a community and a country.

CDT September 11, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Kroger Co. said Friday that its profit during the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 13 fell 11.5% due to charges it took as part of a restructuring of employee pension plans. Without those charges, earnings would have increased 4.8% during the quarter. Kroger reported second-quarter net income of $383 million, or 40 cents per share, compared with $433 million, or 44 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, were 47 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 45 cents per share. Revenue rose 4% to $26.57 billion in the period, which came in slightly under Wall Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $26.78 billion. Kroger said its second quarter same-store supermarket sales grew 1.7%. Kroger, the world's third-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp., is the grocery market share leader in Wisconsin by virtue of its 2015 purchase of Milwaukee-based Roundy's Inc. Kroger holds about a third of the grocery market in Wisconsin and its stores cover the state from Eagle River in the Northwoods to Kenosha near the border with Illinois. In Wisconsin, the company operates under the Pick 'n Save, Metro Market and Copps banners in cities throughout the state. The company employs 13,800 people in Wisconsin. Its stores in the Milwaukee metro compete in what some retail industry observers say is among the most competitive grocery markets in the United States. In a conference call with investment analysts, Mike Schlotman, Kroger executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company's "integration with Roundy’s continues to be on plan. ... We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy’s investments in Wisconsin and we remain excited about this opportunity." Nationwide, Kroger operates  2,781 grocery stores in 35 states under nearly two dozen banners, including the Mariano's banner in northern Illinois. Kroger also operates 785 convenience stores under six banners in 19 states. In reporting earnings, executives at Cincinnati-based Kroger said falling food prices are weighing down sales results. Kroger said it was hurt by falling prices of eggs, meat and other products, forcing it to lower its earnings guidance for the year. Kroger lowered its earnings expectations to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 from a range of $2.19 to $2.28 for the year. The company also cut back its capital investment plan to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion from a range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion. "We are focused on long-term performance over a three- to five-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy," Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement announcing earnings. He also credited the company's employees for executing its strategy "in a deflationary environment." Falling prices reduce the sales dollars a grocery store generates while fixed costs such as labor, utilities and rent remain the same or increase. "It cuts into their margin because they have less top line sales and still a decent amount of fixed or variable expenses," said Rick Shea, president of Shea Food Consultants, a suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul grocery and food marketing consultancy. Shea said the falling prices are likely to continue but right now don't appear to be a long-term phenomenon. "The industry goes through ebbs and flows and cycles," he said. "It will probably correct itself in another six to nine months. "It's mostly grains and dairy and proteins right now causing the food deflation," Shea added. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman told business news channel CNBC Friday that the drop in prices for eggs, meat and milk have affected the price of ice cream and other products that use those ingredients. The Cincinnati Enquirer and Associated Press contributed to this report.  USA TODAY CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Texans players given warnings ahead of Mexico game High speed chase ends with deadly crash Ex-teacher pleads guilty to sexually assaulting student Houston Forecast for Friday morning Family that returned husky is given new dog 21-year-old Carl Conyers found safe Brutal new details in teen's murder Search continues for missing UH student Check before renting out home for Super Bowl Representative's son missing More Stories Mother: Missing UH student, Congressman's son found safe Nov 18, 2016, 4:51 a.m. Woman dies after car slams into pole, splitting it in half Nov 18, 2016, 5:33 a.m. Donald Trump offers Jeff Sessions attorney general post Nov 18, 2016, 6:18 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

(Reuters/Andrew Kelly) Share Written by Laura Frost September 11, 2016 In the first minute of Hulu series Difficult People, an impatient New Yorker is stopped on the street by tourists in need of directions. An older woman in the group brandishes her camera and asks, “Hello, can you please tell us how can we get to nine-eleven?” What kind of nitwit confuses a date with a place? More than just a fictional one. Architectural critic Philip Nobel has recounted being asked for directions to 9/11, and I too first heard the question around eight years ago. Ever since what was once “Ground Zero” became a tourist attraction—the National September 11 Memorial and Museum is ranked third on TripAdvisor’s list of things to do in New York City, right after Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art—the area has been packed with disoriented tourists in search of “9/11.” It almost makes you laugh. As might the release of a previously unheard standup routine by George Carlin, the only bit the comedian ever shelved for taste. Recorded on September 10, 2001, the bit is called “I Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die.” It’s taken 15 years—and the often unsuccessful experimentation of other comics with 9/11 jokes—for audiences to maybe possibly be ready for punch lines about planes again. A rocky recovery Does this mean that it’s no longer “too soon”? That we have sufficient distance from or clarity about the events of September 11? Judging by the controversy that still flames up around pretty much anything related to 9/11, the shortest answer is no. Take just a few events of the past year. July saw the release of 28 pages of previously classified congressional inquiry into, among other things, Saudi Arabia’s connections to al-Qaeda. In April, Donald Trump paid his first visit to the September 11 memorial to bolster his defense of “New York values,” prompting many to question why it was his first visit. That same month, the September 11 museum made headlines when one of its guards stopped a group of students on a field trip from singing the National Anthem on the concourse. Just this week, Congress approved a bill permitting families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia (Obama is expected to veto it), a Florida Walmart embarrassed itself with a “tribute” to 9/11 made from Coca Cola products, and a mattress store put itself out of business with an appalling 9/11-themed ad. The commercialization of the attacks continues to be an issue. Just in time for the 15th anniversary, the new Westfield World Trade Center shopping mall opened inside the WTC transportation hub. John Legend may have played a “smooth medley” at the grand opening in August, but critics call the mall an “absurdity” that is “uninformed by its sacred land.” The concerns echo those raised about the September 11 museum gift store, and the idea (raised soon after the attacks by then-mayor Rudolph Giuliani and president George W. Bush) that Americans support their country best by shopping. Just as Park51, the controversial Islamic community center proposed two blocks from the World Trade Center site, was dubbed “the Ground Zero Mosque,” at least one new outlet has called Westfield the “Ground Zero Mall.” But maybe commerce is itself a return to normalcy, and by proxy a show of resilience. After all, the original World Trade Center also included a shopping center in its subterranean concourse. For those of us who lived in the neighborhood, the WTC was our mall. Below the humming center of global finance, we shopped at Banana Republic, J. Crew, the Gap, and Victoria’s Secret. We bought sandwiches and salads at Au Bon Pain, magazines from the newspaper stand, and books at Borders. After 9/11, television footage showed the mall’s dark, ruined concourse—frozen escalators, racks of merchandise covered in toxic white dust, like some ravaged undersea landscape—but just days before we had walked those corridors with all the carelessness of suburban teenagers. Where we go now The domestic and global repercussions of 9/11 seem endless and ever-deepening; the attacks sent ripples, large and small, throughout private and public life, local and global. Even the term “9/11″—by which I mean its implications, its fallout, its political foreshadowing and aftershocks—has expanded beyond anything we could have imagined in 2001. For those who lost loved ones that day, it’s hard to fathom anything that could ever compensate for that raw, terrifying, and senseless devastation. Our impulse to move on, recover, rebuild, and grow should be balanced against the impulse to linger, learn, process, and mourn. Today, the World Trade Center is a big, noisy, chaotic construction site full of macho buildings, confused tourists and, yes, stores. The museum is still figuring out what it should be. The memorial, for all its impact, still lacks the elegant simplicity of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC, or the Cenotaph in London. Like everything else in the area, our physical tributes to September 11 reflect both the strengths and the shortcomings of our recovery. But there is one standout element at the new WTC site: Santiago Calatrava’s transportation hub, “The Oculus.” Avian, biomorphic, ribbed, and blindingly white, it gleams—a dome flanked by outspread wings, like some creature that has just dropped down from another planet. Yes, it was over budget. Yes, it took a lot longer than expected. Yes, not everyone likes it. But The Oculus offers a note of optimism, idealism, and playful otherness that nothing else in the 16-acre area does. Energetic and spiritual, its curves are a contrast to the aggressive verticality of the surrounding skyscrapers. Its snowy bones are starkly opaque against the slick reflective surfaces of the buildings nearby. Its design makes no obvious reference to the twin towers, and that comes as a relief. There is currently a giant American flag strung up inside, but the outside shell of The Oculus is unmarked by logos or symbols of patriotism. Its flowing form elaborates its function: moving people to and from New York. Read symbolically, Calatrava’s creation is not mired in the traumatic story of 9/11, nor does it rehash the architectural cliches of money and power. It’s encouraging that The Oculus will be the portal through which many people “get to 9/11.” Not because they will shop there, but because a built environment like that creates a tone, just as glorious Grand Central does. Calatrava’s hub brings an international note of creativity, aesthetic challenge, and wit to a site that’s otherwise split between business-as-usual capitalism and unbearable sorrow. The shops inside? So it goes. It’s prime Manhattan real estate. But Calatrava’s building transcends what it contains. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 11, 2016 at 9:49AM Image source: Getty Images. There are significant benefits to including a few dividend-paying stocks in your portfolio. Not only can they produce steadier returns with lower stock price volatility, but their payments help investors take advantage of market swings simply through automatic reinvestment plans. Then, as retirement approaches and income becomes a bigger priority, you can easily start taking dividends in cash, rather than directing them toward automatic stock purchases. Here are a few companies that pay substantial dividends and boast a solid track record of raising that payout over time. Below, I'll highlight some reasons to consider adding a few of them to your portfolio.  Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio Profit Margin Waste Management 2.6% 62% 9% Home Depot 2.1% 43% 8% Johnson & Johnson 2.7% 57% 21% Hershey  2.5% 68% 10% UPS 2.9% 54% 8% Wal-Mart 2.7% 32% 3% Yum! Brands 2.0% 54% 11% Data source: Company financial filings and YCharts. Johnson & Johnson's stellar track record For consistency, it doesn't get much better than Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The medical and pharmaceutical conglomerate has raised its dividend for 54 consecutive years -- one of the longest such streaks on the stock market.  Its massive scale in a consistently growing healthcare market has helped shares rise by a nearly 11% compound rate since 1985. Its 70% gross profit margin, meanwhile, not only beats other dividend payers on the above list but also outpaces more directly comparable companies, like Procter & Gamble and 3M.  JNJ Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Johnson & Johnson is growing faster than these industry giants, as well, which is a testament to its unusually strong competitive position. At 22 times last year's earnings, this stock isn't particularly cheap. Yet the company has consistently demonstrated why it deserves a premium valuation.  Home Depot's outsized profit gains If it's fast growth that you're after, then consider Home Depot (NYSE:HD). The home improvement giant's profits are on a multi-year upswing, thanks to a rising housing market that has plenty of room to continue climbing. Annual net income soared from below $4 billion in 2012 to over $7 billion last year. LOW Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Home Depot targets returning 50% of those profits to shareholders in the form of dividends every year, which explains why the payout has skyrocketed lately. That's a more aggressive goal than rival Lowe's and its 35% payout promise. Dividends aren't the only area where Home Depot beats its smaller competitor: Sales growth, profit margins, and capital efficiency metrics all point toward Home Depot as the stronger stock purchase right now.  Yum! Brands' profitable new focus Finally, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants, looks attractive right now for two big reasons. First, its operating results are strong. Earnings are up 30% over the last six months, thanks to rising restaurant-level margins and an aggressively expanding store base. Image source: Getty Images. Sure, comparable-store sales growth is slowing, but that is an industrywide issue and one that Yum!, with its diverse set of fast-food offerings, should be able to weather better than rivals.  Second, the restaurant chain is on the cusp of shedding its China KFC business, which will free management to focus its energies on improving market share in the U.S. The spinoff will also produce plenty of capital -- much of which Yum! plans to return to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases.  Each of these investments carries specific risks that could cause the stock to underperform in the future. Dividends don't change that basic truth. Yet by focusing on dividend payers, investors enjoy tangible returns in exchange for their patience, which makes it easier to stomach volatility on the way to -- ideally -- market-beating long-term stock price appreciation.   Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

You note that opposition in the west has been left to charities rather than unions. Do you see this changing? JS: Protectionism is the reflex response of workers faced with competition, it is a much easier option than waging class struggle, yet workers can understand that protectionism leads to disaster. An impressive movement has developed in the United States among Walmart workers for $15 an hour and a union. I’m confident they can feel a sense of solidarity with the workers who produce the goods they stack on WalMart’s shelves. The 39,000 striking Verizon workers, including 13,000 call centre workers, recently discovered that workers at call centres in the Philippines, whose services were being used to break the strike, were being paid $1.78 per hour.

EpiPen is the leading way to treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can stop breathing. The patented device makes it easy to inject yourself with the drug epinephrine in an emergency — easy enough that kids can do it, too. But while a dose of the decades-old drug costs just pennies to make, the self-injectable pen is expensive: GoodRx shows that the cost of a two-pack of EpiPen or EpiPen Jr starts at around $600. Parents of children who need the lifesaving drugs have to buy several injectors for home and school, and those costs add up. Tracy Bush, of Pfafftown, N.C., whose 14-year-old son relies on EpiPen for severe food allergies, says that even with health insurance, the family budget takes a hit. “We have to factor in EpiPen costs with other school expenses, including supplies and clothing, making our budget extra tight,” she says. Keep reading for more information and options about emergency epinephrine auto-injectors. CONSIDER ADRENACLICK: The good news is that there are cheaper options. We found a generic version of the Adrenaclick pen for $142 at Walmart and Sam’s Club, using a coupon from GoodRx. If you pay with insurance, you might also be eligible for an insurance co-pay coupon from the drug’s maker, Amedra Pharmaceuticals. Adrenaclick uses a different technology than EpiPen, but both auto-injectors contain the same drug, available in the same dosages, says Barbara Young, a doctor of pharmacy with the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. The key concern in switching, says Young, is that “patients may not be aware of differences in how to use the injector.” She advises making sure you know how to use the injector before leaving the pharmacy, as well as scheduling periodic refreshers. Research shows that people forget how to use the injector after about three months and need frequent retraining. EPIPEN COSTS ON THE RISE: Since Mylan purchased EpiPen in 2007, the price has increased by more than 400 percent, according to the health data firm DRX. “The astronomical cost increase is a very real problem,” says Dr. Andrew Murphy, a board-certified allergist at the Asthma, Allergy and Sinus Center in West Chester, Pa. High prices are one of the main reasons that people go without the lifesaving drug, according to a 2014 study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Although Mylan has poured billions into marketing, company spokesperson Julie Knell attributes increased consumer costs to more people enrolled in high-deductible health plans. “This change to the industry is not an easy challenge to address,” says Knell, but adds that the company is “committed to solutions.” Currently, Mylan offers a coupon that cuts co-pays by up to $100 as well as a patient assistance program that provides free EpiPens for some patients without insurance. THE DIY SYRINGE METHOD: To further cut costs, some have resorted to using manual syringes and vials of epinephrine, which cost a few dollars each. But experts caution that the do-it-yourself system is complicated. You’ll need to be trained by a doctor or pharmacist on how to inject the drug quickly and accurately before attempting it in an emergency. And it’s critically important that you work with your pharmacist to make sure you get the proper dose. You’ll also need to replace the syringe and epinephrine four times a year; the drug loses potency after just three months. (EpiPens and Adrenaclick pens should be replaced every 12 to 18 months.)

The funding allows Medicaid to change how it delivers care to more than 1 million Alabamians in the hopes of lowering costs, officials said. “There will still be a shortage moving forward, and we’ll have to deal with it,” General Fund Committee chairman Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, said about Medicaid, the state’s biggest General Fund budget expense. Here’s how things stood when the Legislature’s special session ended last week. Regional care organizations Medicaid’s planned transformation to a managed-care model -- where private entities called regional care organizations have a financial stake in keeping patients healthier and costs lower -- has been in the works for years. It was supposed to begin next month. Bentley last week said the regional care organizations likely will start in April or July next year. Officials have said the transformation will “bend the cost curve” on Medicaid’s growing expenses. The Huntsville Hospital System has created two regional care organizations and, as of a few months ago, spent nearly $2 million on them, CEO David Spillers said. Spillers said Friday the state cleared a big hurdle for RCOs last week, but the organizations want to see long-term funding for Medicaid. Even with $105 million in BP settlement money allotted to Medicaid in fiscal 2018, the agency is predicting a $60 million shortfall that year, and a larger one the following year. Spillers said the RCOs are spending millions of dollars of private money with no certainty that the state will be able to fund them for more than two years. “Could you imagine Wal-Mart building a new store if they only got a two-year lease on the land?” Spillers said. “That would be foolish.” Long-term fix? Bentley wanted lawmakers in the special session to approve a lottery proposal that he said would generate about $225 million a year for the state. It was one vote away from being on a ballot for Alabamians’ approval when it died in the Senate. “The lottery itself is probably not going to come back up in the near future,” Bentley said. Last year, Bentley pitched more than $500 million in new taxes, most of which died in the Statehouse. He said his office will be looking at other long-term funding options in the coming months, but didn’t provide specifics. Options do not include a revenue-sharing compact with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to expand their casino operations. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, last week tried unsuccessfully to get more of the state’s BP settlement dedicated to Medicaid in the next three years and less to debt repayment and roads in Mobile and Baldwin counties. Orr, chairman of the education budget committee and member of the General Fund Committee, said he didn’t know what’s next for state funding. “But I’m going to be curious to see what options my colleagues come up with because we missed an opportunity,” he said Friday. Tax increases, transfers from the education budget, gaming proposals and unearmarking of funds have not been viewed favorably in recent years by the Legislature, Orr said last week. Spending cuts have been made, Orr said. But to cut more from the more than $1.8 billion General Fund budget means first removing Medicaid and the Alabama Department of Corrections from the equation, he said. “That’s leaves you about $800 million from which to cut,” Orr said. To get Medicaid an additional $60 million in 2018 would mean a nearly double-digit cut for other agencies. “And that doesn’t bring into account all the other needs from all the other agencies and what they’re going to be asking for,” Orr said. Corrections will receive about $412 million in the 2017 budget. The department expects to need more money in 2018 for fixed cost increases in its operations, and ongoing litigation, but specific amounts are still being assessed, spokesman Bob Horton said last week. Study commission Lawmakers this month approved a task force to study possible budget reforms, including uneamarking state revenue and whether tax credits and deductions given by the state are worthwhile. The task force will meet for the first time later this month, and report to Legislature when it reconvenes early next year. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh said he wants to find out who the winners and losers are in the state’s tax structure. He said the task force will look at all taxes, including property and business privilege, and what other states are doing in comparison. “If we’re going to be honest, if we’re going to look at tax reform, you have to look at everything,” Marsh said. The Joint Legislative Task Force on Budget Reform will also look at the possibility of biennial budgeting for the General Fund and Education Trust Fund budgets; requiring state entities to undergo greater performance and program reviews; and tax relief for Alabamians that wouldn’t significantly impact state revenues. mary.sell@decaturdaily.com.

(Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo Story Highlights Could Kmart go the way of Blockbuster? A big retail store closure can be disastrous for a shopping center or business district, but there might be reason for hope and excitement when the store is a long-struggling Kmart. Several Detroit suburbs are now home to promising redevelopments created from the ruins of abandoned Kmart stores. These projects fill in emptied big boxes and spin off new development in once-depressed shopping areas that haven't attracted shoppers for years. Real estate brokers say old Kmarts make good redevelopment prospects because they typically have good locations in high-trafficked areas.  After a decade, is deserted Kmart HQ about to be overhauled? "They were the first ones who did deals here, so they got the best real estate," said Jim Stokas of Stokas Bieri Real Estate. A Free Press survey in southeast Michigan found a variety of reuse examples, including stores subdivided and retrofitted for multiple smaller retailers, conversion into indoor storage businesses, takeover by a big tenant like At Home, and in three instances, demolition and replacement by new large-format Kroger Marketplace stores. This phenomenon shows a cycle of life in commercial real estate — when older, once-popular retail chain stores are succeeded by fresh tenants whose brands and square footage are more competitive. In the case of Kmart, old discount stores bequeath convenient geographic locations and physical buildings that can be retrofitted for modern use. Once known for blue light specials, Kmart is now infamous for its red ink "Kmart had some great locations, so they're being repurposed to better tenants," said Greg Newman, a principal at Keystone Commercial Real Estate based in Farmington Hills. "You are probably going to see extensive renovations done with the ones that are being repurposed because the buildings just looked old. They were dated and needed to be brought up." A 20th-Century retail phenomenon born in metro Detroit, Kmart has been shuttering stores here and across the nation the past two decades as the chain struggles amid competition from the likes of Amazon.com, Walmart, Meijer and other big retailers. Some retail industry observers are bracing for a potential bankruptcy as early as next year of Kmart's parent company, Sears Holdings. Such an event might entail a Blockbuster Video-style closure of many or all of the remaining 941 Kmart stores, including the 51 in Michigan, according to figures in Sears Holdings' latest annual report. Same-store sales for the Kmart brand — representing about 40% of Sears Holdings' revenues — fell 4.2% in the first half of this year, reflecting a $187-million decline. The company announced in April that it would shutter an additional 68 Kmarts nationwide this summer as it accelerates the closing of unprofitable stores.

But a Sears Holdings spokesman said the company is making progress in its journey back to profitability. The parent company of Kmart and Sears has reported improved pretax earnings, reduced operating expenses and is concentrating on its best-performing stores, he said. "We are an asset-rich enterprise with multiple resources at our disposal to fund our transformation, including $4.7 billion of inventory already paid for, a substantial, valuable real estate portfolio and leading proprietary brands such as Kenmore, Craftsman and Diehard," spokesman Howard Riefs said. Originally founded in Detroit in 1899 as the S.S. Kresge Co., Kmart's bankruptcy in 2002 led to its merger with Sears and relocation of its headquarters from Big Beaver Road in Troy to suburban Chicago. In 2006, the company left behind a still-empty office complex in Troy near Somerset Collection. New life for old stores Whatever Kmart's near-term financial future, local governments and developers are finding value in the old Kmart structures that, in many instances, were perceived as holding back business districts because the discount chain was no longer effective as a shopping center anchor. The Chesterfield Township Kmart closed  in 2012, leaving a pizza parlor and Payless Shoes as the only tenants in a shopping center on Gratiot near 23 Mile along a busy commercial corridor. Buy Photo This Hobby Lobby is situated in part of a former Kmart store in Chesterfield Township.  (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) A new owner saw value and decided to subdivide the empty Kmart building into two retail spaces and upgrade the rest of the shopping center. Today, the former Kmart building still stands but is renovated and filled by a Hobby Lobby and a Big Lots, both major retail chains. The once-dead shopping center is thriving with a new Planet Fitness gym, Cold Stone Creamery, Petco and other national retail merchants. "Once Kmart left this was all desolate. Hardly anybody would ever go in here," said Kathy Van Torre, owner of Creative Keepsakes Ceramics that neighbors the former Kmart. "Now it is all rebuilt, and we have new stores all going in." Developer David Przygoda bought the vacant Woodhaven Kmart property at West and Allen roads that had closed in 2013 and even housed squatters for a time. Last year, he did an extensive redevelopment that reconfigured the early 1970s structure into five to six retail spaces. He also turned a section of giant parking lot into two new small retail strips — now mostly occupied. "We brought it out of the doldrums of despair," said the property's leasing agent, Bob Mihelich of CBRE in Southfield. Today, the new retail strips are filled with a Panera Bread, Panda Express, T-Mobile and other national chain tenants. The redeveloped former Kmart building now houses a dental office, a hair salon, a Lady Jane's Haircuts for Men and a soon-to-open Black Rock steakhouse. Potential deals to bring in two additional midsize retail tenants are pending. No longer eyesore The redevelopment was a welcome sight for Woodhaven city officials, who watched with trepidation as the old Kmart fell into disrepair. The shuttered store had been hit by scrappers, and mattresses belonging to squatters were found inside. "There were craters in the parking lot and the building was crumbling — it was really an eyesore to the city," Mihelich said. "The mayor gave me a hug when we finally got it approved because they were so excited something was finally going to happen." Portage officials also were relieved to see their city's former Kmart building given a second chance. The store closed in 2010 and was later subdivided and renovated into a Hobby Lobby and Dick's Sporting Goods with an Aldi added in a 2014 addition. There are two small retail strips in Kmart's old parking lot with a Jared jewelers and a Verizon store. "So what was becoming a blight and a concern has completely turned around," said Vicki Georgeau, Portage's director of community development. Some need space Not all developers want to slice up old Kmarts into retail bays. That's the case in Bloomfield Township, where the shell of the old Kmart on Telegraph in the Bloomfield Town Square shopping center is in the process of becoming At Home, a Texas-based home decor store chain. Buy Photo A former Kmart building in Bloomfield Township that will become an At Home store.  (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) The vacant big box structure proved the big attraction in Detroit for U-Haul, which opened a moving and storage business this year inside the old Kmart at 19990 Telegraph, which closed in October 2014. The building was cleared out on a recent afternoon as crews worked to transform the inside into climate-controlled storage. "It's a good thing someone took it over; it's been sitting idle for a couple years," said Tim Holt, project manager for the U-Haul conversion.

Some Kmart buyers, such as Kroger, admire the discount retailer's large properties and locations but often want nothing to do with the leftover buildings. In the past three years, Kroger has bulldozed three former metro Detroit Kmarts in Roseville, Commerce Township and White Lake Township, replacing them with new large-format Kroger Marketplace stores. These new Krogers sell many non-grocery items — not unlike the merchandise still found in Kmarts — such as toys, kitchenware and school supplies. They measure about 120,000 square feet, compared with the 50,000 to 60,000 square feet of a traditional Kroger. The newest of Kroger's Marketplace trio is in White Lake Township, scheduled to open Sept. 21. That Kroger replaces a Kmart that featured a rare lime-green and gray color scheme and was heralded as Kmart's "Store of the Future" in 2002, in the middle of the discount retailer's bankruptcy. It closed in 2014. "The Kmart sites are offering the acreage we're looking for," said Kroger's Rachel Hurst, manager of consumer affairs. "I'm sure there will be more in the future."

Source: Whole Foods Grocer’s aggressive expansion plan may need to be shelved Competition from lower-priced retail chains like Wal-Mart Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The problem with Whole Foods Market Inc.’s expansion plan -- and, perhaps, its entire business model -- is epitomized by its store in a western suburb of Chicago. The Elmhurst, Illinois, outlet looks like any other Whole Foods on the inside, with its artisan breads, exotic facial oil and quinoa. But it’s the surroundings that are the problem. It shares a parking lot with a Dress Barn, a Kmart and a Shoe Carnival (“Buy One Get One Half Off”) -- “not what we would consider high end,” as Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin put it. John Mackey Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg At a time when Whole Foods is losing shoppers to the likes of Kroger, Trader Joe’s and Wal-Mart -- as those chains crowd into the organic-food business Whole Foods helped create -- the concern that Mushkin and others on Wall Street have is that by trying to expand into hundreds of new neighborhoods, the company is targeting the wrong audience. Focus instead, they say, on the wealthy urbanites who can afford to pay $29.99 for a pound of filet mignon. “They should embrace that premium experience,” said Matt Argersinger, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool. “If they race in the opposite direction, I think it will trip them up.” Stock’s Down It’s already has. Shares are down more than 50 percent since hitting a record high in 2013, around the time co-founder John Mackey declared his goal to more than triple the number of stores to 1,200. Sure, there are other problems depressing the stock -- same-store sales are sliding and profit margins are shrinking as the company offers discounts and digital coupons in a bid to shed its “Whole Paycheck” nickname -- but these are issues that outsiders worry will only get worse as the company finds itself in more and more middle-class locations. The stock suffered a fresh drubbing on Wednesday after rival Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. cut its forecast, renewing concerns about the industry. Whole Foods fell as much as 7.2 percent to $28.49, while Sprouts tumbled 17 percent to $19. It’s an age-old problem for retailers: How do they keep growing when they run low on suitable new locations? So far, Whole Foods insists it’s sticking to the 1,200-store target. There are signs, though, that it may be having second thoughts. Mackey recently said the company would cut back on square-footage growth in 2017 and that it’s giving more scrutiny to potential new locations. The company currently operates 435 stores in the U.S., with another 20 in the U.K. and Canada. Tweak Plan Whole Foods in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. Source: Whole Foods Some analysts say it’s just a matter of time before the 1,200-store plan is abandoned, or at least tweaked. They say it’s possible, for instance, that the expansion target will be reached by including the construction of stores in the new 365 by Whole Foods Market chain. Named for the company’s private-label brand, these stores are cheaper to build and operate and are designed to attract customers priced out of the flagships. The first two in the chain opened recently on the West Coast, with another scheduled for this month. And in May, Whole Foods said it had renegotiated three leases in Ohio and Indiana, switching those sites to 365 stores. In all, 20 leases for 365 locations have been announced. On a recent earnings call, company executives gushed about the economics of the model. “All of our regional presidents have gone and seen the 365 stores and are kind of electrified by some of the labor savings and some of the structural changes that we’ve done there,” David Lannon, executive vice president of operations, told analysts. For more on organic food, click here. So far, Whole Foods hasn’t abandoned Mackey’s target of 1,200 stores, and has said that the number of locations for its 365 stores will push the total beyond that optimistic number. And it was only four years ago that the company said its push to add more stores would include locations in food deserts in inner-city Detroit and Chicago. Different Opinions The sentiment on Wall Street is that if Whole Foods is intent on expansion by competing for budget-conscious consumers, the 365 stores, with their lower cost structure, are the right way to go. Credit Suisse Group AG analysts recently added Whole Foods to its list of top investment ideas, with a price target of $40. The analysts argue that while a basket of grocery items at Whole Foods stores they visited in three Midwestern cities cost as much as 20 percent more than a similar basket at Kroger, some of that price premium was warranted because the shopping experience at Whole Foods was better. Whole Foods’ stock has been hovering in the $30 to $31 range since the end of July. And there are, of course, some cities and neighborhoods targeted in the expansion plan where the arrival of a Whole Foods flagship store is still a hit. In July, the company opened a glistening 51,000-square-foot (4,700-square-meter) store in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, the center of New York City’s hipster community and a million miles culturally from Elmhurst, Illinois. The store features a tap room and wine bar, a food hall and a full butcher shop where whole pigs hang from the ceiling. Stylish young shoppers streamed by, picking through local cheeses and stopping at the eye-catching display of LaCroix seltzer, which has become a popular selfie backdrop. Analysts expect the location to do well, but it’s also emblematic of the company’s need to focus on areas with the kind of upwardly mobile shoppers who don’t mind paying a little more. Swinging too far the other way, and stretching to hit an aggressive store target by trying to fight a price war with Kroger and Wal-Mart, could end up being a trap that Whole Foods can’t afford to fall into. “There are a lot more wrong ways to do it than right ways,” said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Inmar’s Willard Bishop.

If someone asked you that, you would probably be able to tell them exactly how that fateful day panned out. The 9/11 kids who never knew their dads Because 15 years ago today, our world changed forever when two planes crashed into the Twin Towers and another into the Pentagon. The attacks, that killed 2,997 people and injured more than 6,000 others, are considered to be the worst terrorist attack in American history. We asked people to share their memories of that day and the moment they found out. Saurav Dutt, 34, from London (Picture: Saurav Dutt) ‘I was at Brent Cross shopping centre when I found out. I remember getting ready to leave when I saw a lot of people crowding around a TV in Dixons. It was almost like I was watching a movie. It took a few moments to put the pieces together and realise it was live, which made it even more surreal. As it unfolded, I couldn’t bring myself to watch the coverage as it was really hard for me to detach emotion from fact. But you could feel it in the air, the world was about to change. The attacks led me to become more politically aware as I wanted to find out why it happened. It totally changed my political outlook. I stayed at home most of the next day but the one time I did venture out was to go to the gym. That’s when I had racist comments made to me in my own area. I heard someone muttering: ‘Don’t you feel any shame?’ but I couldn’t do anything. All you could do is be as numb as everyone else.’ MORE: Mattress company apologies for offensive 9/11 ‘Twin Towers’ advert (Picture: Carmen Taylor/WireImage) Chistina Tweedle, 39, from Cumbria ‘I was sitting in the living room with the little boy I babysat. We’d just finished breakfast and the news was on for back ground noise. We were colouring in when I glanced up and saw an image of the second tower being hit. I remember having to hold back tears as I heard what had happened as I didn’t want to upset the little boy. He looked at the news but thought it was a film.’ Raisa Smoot, 28, from Los Angeles (Picture: Raisa Smoot) ‘On September 11th, 2001, I was an 8th grader at Greenbelt Middle school in Greenbelt. I was in a Code of Conduct Assembly when our 8th grade administrator suddenly interrupted everything and shoved a fat TV in front of us. We then watched a plane fly into the 2nd building. On live TV. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen as a 13-year-old. I think that’s when I realised how bad the world really could be. ‘Not to mention being super freaked out because in Washington DC, almost everyone works in the government…including my mom. ‘My mom worked at the Pentagon but was unharmed. She lost lots of friends though. It was a sad day. Here I am at 28. Remembering like it was yesterday.’ MORE: Wal-Mart removes Coke can display stacked like Twin Towers ahead of 9/11 (Picture: Rex) Stephen Dickens, 34, from Nottingham ‘I was 19, working for an insurance company in London when I found out. Someone said to me, “Steve, something’s kinda happening in the States”. I didn’t even look up. “Ok, what? I only work PI with them.” He replied, “NO!! JUST LOOK”. ‘I went out to the crowd that were already staring at the TV. I looked at them first. I still didn’t get it. Then I looked up at the screen. The rest is kinda blurry. ‘I don’t know if it was a repeat of the first plane hitting or the second I saw first or the whole thing could have been repeats. We were all sent home, evacuated from the square mile is probably more accurate, like I said. Blurry. I think the Wharf was the main concern. ‘I lived on Drury Lane at the time. I walked home. I think because I lived so close I was advised not to use the tube by my boss. I don’t remember much panic from my office. Just shock. I just got myself home. Fast. ‘I didn’t have a TV, so I hammered on my mates door who lived in the same block. Then we just kinda sat there stupefied and watched as the rest unfolded.’ Lisa Amaya, 34, from Texas (Picture: Lisa Amaya) ‘I was a college student at New Mexico State at the time. My alarm clock woke me up at around 7am for class. The first plane had just struck when the clock radio turned on. ‘I couldn’t believe it so I turned on the TV to see what was happening. I was completely shocked when I saw the footage! My classes were then canceled. I was supposed to celebrate my 20th birthday with friends and family. ‘Instead, I spent my 20th birthday watching the coverage on TV. I wasn’t in the mood for cake, much less celebrating. I can’t believe it’s already been 15 years.’ MORE: When is Eid ul Adha? Greater Eid will NOT coincide with 9/11 terror attacks anniversary (Picture: Rex) Pinda Aujla, 34, from Derby ‘I remember that day very clearly, I had just come back from University and my mum was watching BBC. ‘What we were seeing on the TV was unbelievable, then a few moments later we saw the second plane crash into the other tower and that’s when our faces dropped. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing, ‘I had to translate to my mum to explain but I didn’t fully understand myself what was happening. To see so much carnage and devastation right in front of me was shocking. ‘Slowly more and more information came out, who was responsible & how many innocent lives had been lost. I still remember watching it unfold like it was yesterday. ‘The few weeks after I experienced bigotry & rudeness due to the colour of my skin, as a proud British Sikh, certain members of the public we’re looking at me, as if to point the blame my way. ‘I’ll never forget that day, and still to this day my heart goes to all the innocent lives taken & also the lives taken in that war which followed after.’ MORE: Saudi government linked to 9/11 hijackers in secret US report Hugh McGivern, 51, from Glasgow (Picture: Hugh McGivern) ‘I remember the day well as it was my first day in a new job as Chef to the Chairman of ICI. The following day was just as memorable as I had a pre-existing meeting at the American Embassy in London for the Head Chefs position. ‘It was eerily upsetting with staff wandering aimlessly throughout the building. I stuck to the ICI job. A very surreal couple of days that we should never forget.’ (Picture: Getty) Megan D'Arcy, 28, from London ‘I remember coming home from school and finding my mum sitting on the sofa watching TV (which is just completely out of character). She said, “come here” and I went and sat with her and we cried as we watched the news. ‘I was 13 and it was the first time I properly watched the news and understood that terrible things can happen in the world. It made me feel small, scared and horribly grown up.’ Hazel Winters, 36, from Hertfordshire ‘I was working at a zoo in Hertfordshire and was sitting on the railings on a roundabout I was giving rides on. A woman was on the phone to someone and said “They just flew the plane into it?”. ‘I had no idea what she was talking about until I went for a break and the TV was on in the staff room. We all stayed and watched it for an hour or so. The world felt very strange for a couple of days afterwards.’ MORE: Fugitive claims he has proof US government knew about 9/11 Lucy Darbyshire, 28, from Preston (Picture: Lucy Darbyshire) ‘I was in my third year of high school and remember this day so vividly because of how normal a day it was. It had been a warm day at school and the ride on the school bus home had been almost unbearable because of the weather. ‘Walking into my street with my younger sister, we first realised something was very wrong because our mum was stood in the porch waiting for us – something she never did so we instantly assumed someone was in hospital or worse. ‘When she opened the door she said ‘just go and watch the telly, girls’ which again was strange. ‘Sitting down, BBC News were just replaying the moment of impact on the first tower. At thirteen, I remember asking ‘what film is this?’ Mum shook her head and said ‘no, it’s real, love. Someone’s flown a plane into the tower’. ‘As we watched, the level of surrealism intensified. I remember not being able to recall a time when the entire street were all gathered in one place and it got to the point where the plumbers at the house next door even stopped what they were doing and had piled in to our living room to watch – all open mouthed, wide-eyed, and silent. ‘Then I remember the plumber shouting “Jesus Christ! It going! It’s going!” and as we looked, we watched the first tower falling. I don’t think anybody expected them to fall. I think that was the worst thing. ‘My sister and I both recall crying for the first time at the news. This was new for us. We always have the news on in our house but at 13 and 11, this was a defining moment. ‘Later, my Dad explained to me that much like I was obsessing over the Titanic at the time (we’d done a project at school and I was hooked) I’d always remember this particular day as the biggest disaster of my lifetime up until that point. And he was right.’ Richard Smith, 37, from Bradford (Picture: Richard Smith) ‘When this tragic day started I was on a break at work, I had called my wife at home as I did everyday and events unfolded on the TV in front of her and she was relaying it back to me. ‘Once I was off the telephone, I went back inside where most of the staff were huddled round the only TV in the building watching the pictures staring in disbelief. ‘No-one could quite believe what was happening, the phones were pretty much silent for the rest of the day with only the odd customer in touch who hadn’t seen the news or had a deadline to finish. ‘That evening all we could do was watch the news, transfixed by the entire situation.’ MORE: Blind mystic who predicted 9/11, the Boxing Day tsunami and Isis ‘also foresaw Brexit’ (Picture: Getty Images) Eleanor Summerfield, 26, from Derby ‘I was 11 and still in school when I found out. I remember it was a Tuesday afternoon and had drama class as my last period. ‘I remember pretty much everything about that day even the weather, it was a sunny afternoon when I was walking home. I got home and my parents had something on the news on the CNN channel. ‘Fifteen years on and we still talk about it like it has just happened.’ (Picture: Getty Images) More Teenage cancer patient, 14, becomes first Brit to be cryogenically frozen Teacher who got pregnant after sex with pupil, 13, faces 30 years in jail Sponsored13 reasons American ERs are so much sexier than our A&Es Royal family funding to almost double to cover £369m Buckingham palace repair bill Review of law on rape cases launched following Ched Evans retrial Scottish and Welsh governments allowed to intervene in Brexit process, rules Supreme Court Comments What's trending nowMore trending stories » Calls for DNA test after woman finds concerning 'meat' in her soup Shocking conditions of UK free range egg farm exposed on camera Snooper’s Charter just got passed so government can spy on your internet use Woman, 27, who had sex with dog must await sentencing behind bars Woman 'admits to killing her two children after husband files for divorce'More trending stories » VideoMore videos » Italian medics jailed after abandoning mentally ill patient Thieving crabs try to steal camera from backpacker Child rapist forced daughter to have sex with him for cash Bulgarian 'bounty hunter' vigilantes round up refugeesMore videos » YOU ARE HERE: UK Home News Sport Lifestyle Entertainment More Blogs Jobs Search Metro Trending Nutshell MetroUK @MetroUK © 2016 Associated Newspapers Limited Powered by WordPress.com VIP Your ad choices Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite map Back to top Get us in your feed Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.67 -0.52 -0.75% DigitalGlobe Inc DGI ▲ 32.25 +0.15 +0.47% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.28 +0.33 +0.30% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 765.83 +9.43 +1.25% In 1609, Galileo wowed Venice’s big cheeses by letting them use his telescope to see ships way out at sea, a good two hours before their owners would see them enter the port. The Venetians were impressed (they doubled Galileo’s salary and gave him lifetime tenure at the University of Padua) because they immediately saw the huge financial and military advantages offered by this visionary device. A few hundred years later, we are on the cusp of an equally radical transformation in how information is gathered, analyzed and monetized. And if we pay attention, we might even save the planet. The number of satellites orbiting Earth increased 40 percent in just the past five years, and those hunks of metal are snapping pictures at a mind-blowing rate. This explosion of images isn’t just the National Security Agency feverishly peeking into your bedroom and laptop; it’s a revolution that’s going to radically change how we respond to environmental disasters and run our farms. It’s also going to upend the stock market, because it’s turning the whole world into usable data, giving us a precise count of oil tankers in all the world’s ports and how many cars are in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Know that, and you can—like Galileo’s Venetian pals—make some very lucrative investments. That’s why dozens of companies are racing to get into orbit. Seattle-based BlackSky Global is planning to launch six spacecraft; Terra Bella, a Google-Alphabet subsidiary, has two satellites in orbit and promises video that can “see objects up to the size of a car,” while Spire owns 10 orbiting satellites and plans to take millions of pictures of the world’s oceans. These and other upstarts are chasing imaging giants like DigitalGlobe, Airbus and Rapid Eye, who have hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware floating miles above our heads. But no one has launched as fast and as often as Planet, a startup running out of an old gray warehouse in San Francisco’s Mission District. In a neighborhood filled mostly with vintage furniture stores, hip restaurants and coffee shops, Planet has 62 satellites in orbit, the world’s largest private collection, and by the end of the year it will have 100, enough that every nook, cranny and keyhole on Earth will get its own medium-resolution photo every single day. This avalanche of images will create an unprecedented database of the entire planet, one that can be used to stop forest fires and maybe even wars. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 8NEXT SLIDE > Daily photos covering the entire world could keep better track of wildfires, such as this one in Southern California photographed by a NASA satellite in 2007. (NASA) © Provided by IBT Media What Hath Smartphone Wrought? Nothing about launching a satellite is cheap or easy, but what if you could just hurl your iPhone into orbit? In 2010, two NASA Ames Research Center engineers, Will Marshall and Chris Boshuizen, basically did just that. They realized that the power of the phones in their pockets far outstripped anything in orbit in terms of computing power, and the tech underneath that glass screen has a lot of overlap with the nuts and bolts of most satellites. “You have to have power, batteries, GPS, a transmitter,” says Marshall, “all that was missing were solar panels to keep them charged and a system to orient it in space.” The duo went to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert and strapped a few smartphones onto amateur rockets to see if they could handle the g-force and vibrations of a launch. This seat-of-the-pants test wasn’t NASA-approved—“We hadn't really told anyone what we were doing,” Marshall says—but it was a success. The phones were able to handle the vibrations of a launch and the vacuum of space, so the engineers convinced NASA to try a bigger test. By late 2013, the agency was officially on board, putting them in charge of a mission to launch three modified Google Nexus 1 phones on a rocket to the International Space Station, where they were dropped into orbit. The phones flew around the globe, happily chirping back photos to be collected by amateur radio operators down on Earth. The final cost: just $3,500. The three tiny spaceships used for that mission—nicknamed Alexander, Graham and Bell—took very low-resolution, almost useless, images. But Boshuizen and Marshall, now working with NASA engineer Robbie Schingler, saw a huge opportunity: They wanted to make a space company (Planet) that moved like a tech company, upgrading its electronics constantly, like Apple does with the iPhone. Instead of planning a mission years out, as NASA does, Planet started building and launching cheap and fast—and just kept upgrading. Even after all their upgrades, Planet’s pictures won’t be the best on the market for resolution. You can see buildings, but details like cars are harder to make out. The stunning images available on Google Maps, for example, are much clearer, but that higher resolution requires bigger satellites, some the size of a bedroom, with lenses that have to be carefully aimed. That means they can only image a tiny part of the planet in a day. Planet doesn’t want to compete with these high-end images—it’s going for quantity. It just wants to slap a 3-foot telescope, some electric motors and solar panels to phone parts. Its satellites are cheap and small enough to cram into a nook on a rocket, allowing them to hitch on bigger space cargo trips, further reducing costs. The picture is just decent, but each photo-snapping satellite is so inexpensive that the company can line them up like pearls on a string high in the sky, running from the North Pole to South Pole, and create an extraordinarily rich database that will reveal how the Earth changes. Of course, those millions of images will be little more than a curiosity unless there’s a way to turn them into usable data. Not that long ago, getting a computer to recognize an image—a simple task for humans: Which of these 10 photos is one of Mom?—required supercomputers and algorithms written by entire university computer science departments, and even then the results were pretty fuzzy. Planet was lucky—it came along at just the right time to harness the power of one of the hottest fields in computer science: machine learning. Scientist have made huge gains with computers that act more like your brain—turn those computers loose on massive amounts of data, and they “learn” how to solve problems on their own. In 2012, Google coupled a neural network with a massive database built out of YouTube videos. Because it was YouTube, the computer eventually got pretty good at recognizing cats. Since then, machine learning has popped up in a lot of places online—it’s what lets Facebook match your friends to their faces when you upload photos, for instance. Computers have always been able to do things with numbers that humans never could; now they can do the same thing with images. That means you can point a computer to something in Planet’s archive of photos, like a baseball field, and then tell it to find and count every one on Earth. You could do the same for airfields in Europe or chemical plants in Africa. Planet could, according to one analyst, provide a daily count of every tree on the planet. Of course, there’s not a lot of money to be made counting trees—but somebody could get stupid-rich counting barrels of oil. Governments and commodity traders spend billions of dollars every year trying to get a handle on the oil industry, but the market is so wild that experts have called it broken or even rigged. Satellites offer a solution, because most oil is stored in giant cylinders. To keep explosive gas from building up in these big tanks, the lids float atop the oil, rising and falling as they get filled and emptied. Position a camera directly above one of those tanks, create a time-lapse video, you’d see a crescent shadow that would get slightly larger as the tank drained and the lid sank. A math whiz (or a computer) can then calculate how much oil is in that tank based on the time of day, the tank’s diameter and its shadows. It’s a neat trick people have been using for years—with the help of helicopter photos—to game the oil market. But with Planet’s images and machine learning, anyone could figure out how much oil is being stored all over the world (and place million-dollar bets accordingly). You could do the same with the number of shipping containers entering Seattle, or trucks parked at every manufacturing plant in China—data that could predict where key markets are headed. At least, that’s Orbital Insight’s business model. It is based on a quiet street that might house a tax preparer in most of the country, but in Palo Alto, California, it’s home to another space startup looking to change the world. Inside a nondescript, two-story office building, Orbital Insight’s founder, James Crawford—who worked in artificial intelligence and, with Google Books, helped digitize every page of every book in the world—calls up a graph that shows how many cars were spotted in all the parking lots of a major American clothing retailer (that he preferred not be named here) and the company’s income over the past five years. The two lines move in tandem through spikes and dips. In the latest quarter—a period for which the company has yet to report earnings—the cars-in-the-lot count looks pretty good. “We’re showing [the clothing retailer] slightly up,” Crawford says, “which is interesting because the market is showing them down.” You can almost hear a broker shouting, “Buy!” Tractors in Outer Space Most of Orbital Insight’s customers now are in finance, but the imagery revolution could have an even bigger impact in agriculture and, strangely, the quest for world peace. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has an annual budget of $180 million for data-crunching our food supplies, as well as a pretty good track record without using satellites: Its predictions on output are normally off by just 4 percent. But Descartes Labs, a satellite image analysis company, believes it has a new tool that can beat that. Most chlorophyll-filled plants, as you may remember from junior high biology, absorb the full spectrum of light except green, which gives them their tint. Chlorophyll also reflects near-infrared light, which is just outside the visible spectrum for humans, but by looking at infrared in a photo, you can get a pretty good look at the density of chlorophyll—high density is a sign of good plant health. Descartes can use chlorophyll density images, taken by satellites, to predict agricultural output. According to CEO Mark Johnson, the Descartes algorithm’s prediction of corn output was off by just 2.5 percent for the last 10 years. That may seem like news fit for Page 24 of a sleepy commodity markets publication, but poor food production predictions can lead to armed confrontations on a street near you. Wheat prices, for instance, spiked right before the Arab Spring, and a drought has been cited as one of causes of the French Revolution. “If you look at [the emergence of] Boko Haram and even ISIS, both were preceded by food shortages,” Johnson says. Descartes plans to move beyond corn to other crops and beyond the U.S. to make international estimates as well. But to do that, it needs images with a much higher resolution than what’s being shot now over rural areas. “Understanding activity in a field, differentiating between different types of crops—you can’t do that at low resolution,” Johnson says. That’s why Descartes is starting to use Planet’s images. Other companies are using satellites to maximize output on individual farms. For years, growers have tried to farm efficiently by applying different amounts of fertilizer to different parts of their land, depending on the soil type. That meant they had to divide the farm into a giant grid and test the soil type of each square. But with satellite images, a lot of that can be automated. A Canadian company called Farmers Edge can take the satellite image, run it through an algorithm and quickly figure out the soil makeup of each part of the field. The company sends signals directly to tractors that automatically apply the right type of fertilizer for each area. The process could save farmers money and get them to use less fertilizer, which will curb the runoff of nitrate into rivers. Cutting pollution is just one social benefit satellites will bring. “We finally have the tech to understand the planet as a living organism,” Johnson says. He sees Descartes’s mission as a “living analysis of the world, where we understand the resources we mine, grow and take out of the ground, and watch how we humans use them.” Execution by Anti-Aircraft Gun For most of history, humans had never seen a full picture of Earth. In the 1960s, as the space race heated up, a portrait that showed the whole planet became something of a holy grail. Former Merry Prankster and Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand started lobbying NASA to release an image of the planet in 1966. When the Apollo 17 crew returned with the Blue Marble image on December 7, 1972, Brand slapped it on the cover of his magazine and expected human consciousness to blossom. It did, sort of: There was something about seeing ourselves suspended in the blackness of space. Having a picture of our planet that changes with time could fundamentally alter how we think about ourselves and our environment. And it could change how we act, and react to disasters. On April 14, 2016, just weeks away from the presidential election of Peru, the front page of the most influential newspaper in the country ran two images taken by DigitalGlobe. The first, from November 2015, showed the rainforest verdant and full, broken only by a muddy lake. The second was taken in April 2016 and showed the same stretch of forest torn open, the lake bigger and, most critically, man-made structures spreading like the tendrils of a tumor. It was proof of “deforestation caused by gold seekers in the Tambopata Reserve,” the front page read. The photos sparked a national debate about illegal mining in the jungle that became a large part of the presidential election. Those images were discovered and released by the Amazon Conservation Association, a group with people on the ground in parts of the Andean Amazon disappearing the fastest, as well as a team of satellite analysts working in Washington, D.C. Matt Fine, a research specialist with the ACA, gets alerts from a University of Maryland program that automatically scans the forest and flags new signs of deforestation using NASA’s Landsat images. The two Landsat spacecraft take pictures of the whole planet, but the photos are low-resolution and updated only every 16 days. “You can confirm or deny deforestation is happening, but you can't see the forest,” Finer says. “It doesn’t really pull at your heartstrings too much.” But once he gets a Landsat image alert, Finer can track down better and more up-to-date images from Planet that show changes almost as they happen, and at a resolution where the changes in the twists of a river, for instance, are visible. It used to take months to find a story of environmental degradation; it now takes days, and activists can rally policymakers and voters in time to make a difference. Other companies are using satellite images to protect cultural landmarks or hapless citizens under the boot of a demonic despot. AllSource Analysis, based in Longmont, Colorado, uses the photos to tell stories about “places that are too hard, too dangerous or too remote to travel to,” for governments, nongovernmental organizations and commercial groups, according to Stephen Wood, the company’s CEO. For example, AllSource tracked the destruction of Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery by the Islamic State group (ISIS) and saw North Korea using anti-aircraft guns in executions. When a tsunami smashed into Japan in 2011, the AllSource team stayed up through the night to aid search-and-rescue efforts and then monitored a full-on nuclear meltdown at a huge power plant. “We were watching Fukushima as it was going through these changes, including blowing up a few times, and we’re one of the few people in the world seeing this,” Wood says. “We would see these villages, beautiful fishing villages, right after the tsunami had come through…just complete and utter devastation.” Planet’s Marshall says they were able to find an entire village that had vanished in a mudslide after Nepal’s quake in 2015. No one would have known to send help if someone hadn’t compared before and after images. Search-and-rescue missions and rapid disaster response are two areas where a regularly updated visual database of the full planet can save lives and even the planet. Black Boxes and John Prine It’s hard not to bang your head on low-hanging puns at Planet’s headquarters—work jargon like space and launch have much bigger import here. The employees make the most of the fact that they all work “in” space—they refer to themselves as “planeteers” and celebrate “flight-suit Friday’s.” (The flight suits aren’t company-issue, but there are quite a few to pick from on Etsy, an employee tells me.) At first glance, it looks like the office of a generic tech company—there’s a giant rack of bikes, a tasteful cafeteria with exposed brick, fridges stocked with coconut water, a sound system playing John Prine and the Kinks. It moves like a tech company too. Planet created 13 versions of its satellites in just over three years, a rate of iteration even Steve Jobs would have envied. But there are plenty of signs that Planet is working on something bigger than an Uber for ice cream. Just off the cafeteria is a door leading to its clean room, where engineers are assembling the delicate electronic innards for the company’s main product: satellites. A left turn brings you to a padded black box, an “anechoic chamber” that blocks radio signals so engineers can test radios without interference from cellphones or TV stations. Upstairs are rows of desks and blackboards scribbled with what looks to me like some dauntingly serious math. There’s also a giant wall of screens—kind of like what you see in photos of NASA’s command and control center—that tracks the movement of each of the company’s satellites, tracing parabolas over the planet, constantly snapping photos as they go. They’ve launched enough satellites that they’re beyond champagne celebrations. Eight went up in the week before my visit in early summer. Each Planet satellite is a work of art, in part because an artist adds swirling designs and a touch of individuality to each. But the extra care doesn’t mean they’re going to last. All orbiting satellites are always falling, losing a tiny amount of speed and altitude with each trip around Earth. Bigger, more expensive satellites push themselves back up with small thrusters, but Planet allows its satellites to drop. After about two years of going around and around, they re-enter the atmosphere and briefly turn into a shooting star as they burn up. Planet has launched 133, and 51 are still operational. I’m not good at math, but I know that’s a lot of shooting stars. Counting trees or even oil tanks doesn’t sound sexy, and it may not even be important if you’re not an investor or a tree hugger, but this technology is going to snake into every byway and back alley on Earth, and show us things we want to see, along with many things we didn’t know we needed to see. Back at that big wall of monitors, a “planeteer” pulls up an image from Aleppo, Syria. It’s not supercrisp, like what you get from Google Earth, but I can make out what’s going on down there—I can see berms being built. Someone explains to me that people are frantically digging earthen barriers to protect their homes and their families from suicide car bombers. And I suddenly feel horror, fear and guilt. It’s a tiny detail from a vast panoply of human endeavors, one that the curve of the Earth normally obscures from us, but for a minute it makes that war on the other side of the planet feel a little closer and stopping it a lot more urgent.

Among the most widely-shared, and most passionately condemned, is a 20-second mattress ad promoting a "Twin Towers sale," which depicts store employees screaming and falling into two stacks of mattresses meant to resemble the buildings. "Here it is folks. We can say with metaphysical certitude this is the clearest definition to date of 'f------ stupid,'" wrote Borough President James Oddo in a Twitter post. The store, Miracle Mattress in San Antonio, Texas, has closed "indefinitely," Mike Bonanno, the store's owner said Friday. He said that several store employees had received death threats. Earlier in the week, Walmart was the target of outrage after a Panama City Beach store created a Coca Cola-themed 9/11 display using boxes of soda.

The store removed the display on Wednesday. And last weekend in Atlanta, two people attended a Dragon Con costume event dressed as the burning towers. A photo of the offensive costumes went viral. So wrong & inappropriate! More than just a cosplay fail, it's foul.

"We will be silent through the 9/11 Anniversary to avoid any further distractions from a day of recognition and remembrance for the victims and their families," Bonanno posted on Facebook.

The recall affected several of its vegetable products – including sliced onions, mushrooms, and peppers – that were distributed to many Southeastern states including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. All affected products were wrapped in clear plastic containers or packaged in Styrofoam trays covered with clear plastic film and sold at Publix, Wal-Mart, Winn Dixie, Harris Teeter Supermarkets and BI-LO. A full list of the recalled products from the Texas-based company is available at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. How did these bacteria end up on the veggies?Listeria monocytogenes is a natural occurring bacteria in soil and water. Animals can carry the bacteria without showing signs of illness. Through contact with contaminated soil or animal manure that is often used as a fertilizer, the bacteria can end up on raw vegetables and equipment of food processing factories. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Listeria can live for years on the surface of equipment. It even survives the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. "It's a pathogen that's particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments," Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science. Who is at riskIllness from Listeria monocytogenes can be rather serious and in some cases lethal, especially for elderly people, young children, and immunosuppressed people. Healthy individuals will probably only suffer short-term symptoms such as high fever, headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, while infections among pregnant women can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. According to the FDA, the company hasn't received any reports of illness linked to the contaminated products from Country Fresh. However, if you have eaten any of the recalled vegetables with best-by dates between August 7 and August 19 you should closely monitor your health. Children who have consumed these foods should be closely monitored as well as the elderly and people who are otherwise immuno-compromised, as they are more prone to infection. Listeriosis, caused by the listeria bacteria, can take up to 70 days after exposure before causing symptoms. Make sure to check your freezer too. If you froze any of the products on the list, you should return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. How to prevent infectionThanks to the quick decision of Country Fresh to recall its products the contamination was caught before any illness was reported. However, listeria outbreaks are not uncommon in the food industry. Other food items prone to listeria contamination include raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheese, and deli meats. Therefore, the CDC recommends to thoroughly wash or scrub fruits and vegetables before eating, cutting or cooking. Always separate uncooked foods from the cooked ones and wash your hands afterward, as well as the knives and cutting boards you used for the foods. Furthermore, they advise people to drink pasteurized milk and only consume ready-to-eat foods if they are steaming hot.

STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Published: September 10, 2016, 1:00 pm Updated: September 10, 2016, 1:00 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) BOSTON (AP) — Supporters and opponents of a ballot question aimed at expanding the number of charter schools in Massachusetts have pulled in nearly $19 million in contributions heading into the final two months before Election Day. Charter school activists raised $12 million, according to reports filed late Friday with the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance. That’s nearly double the $6.8 million raised by opponents of the question, including teachers unions. The measure would let Massachusetts add up to a dozen new or expanded charter schools each year outside of existing caps. Donors to the pro-charter school campaign include two prominent billionaires — former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who contributed $240,000 and Jim Walton of Arizona, the son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, who contributed more than $1.1 million. Another $5.5 million came from the New York City-based Families For Excellent Schools Advocacy, Inc. The group was founded in 2011 and said its mission is to “ensure that every child attends an excellent school by building coalitions of families and their allies and running campaigns that change education policy.” The three biggest donors to the group Save Our Public Schools, which opposes the ballot question, are teachers unions: the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which contributed nearly $4.2 million; the Boston- and Washington-based American Federation of Teachers, which contributed more than $700,000; and the Washington-based National Education Association, which contributed $1.9 million. Opponents of the charter school question put out a statement saying “Massachusetts voters trust public school teachers, not out-of-state billionaires, to do what’s best for our students.” Great Schools Massachusetts spokeswoman Eileen O’Connor said the pro-charter school group is “proud to have the support of parents and community members across the Commonwealth” while the opposition to the question is funded by “special interest groups.” The charter school question is one of four on the ballot, including a question that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Massachusetts Backers of the legalization question Massachusetts raised more than $2.7 million. The bulk of the money — about $2.2 million came from a single Washington-based political action committee — the New Approach PAC. Supporters of the question describe the PAC as “a foundation of philanthropists dedicated to reforming marijuana laws for social justice reasons.” Nick Bayer, campaign manager for the Safe and Healthy Massachusetts Campaign — which opposes the marijuana question and reported having raised $363,000 to fight the measure — said their contributions came from “a broad coalition of support from the Massachusetts health care, addiction, and business communities.” Supporters of a question that would ban the sale of eggs and other food products that come from farms where animals are confined to overly restrictive cages reported having raised $1.6 million. That included a $143,000 contribution from the Maryland-based Humane Society of the United States and $250,000 from Maximilian Stone, managing director of the New York-based investment and technology development firm DE Shaw & Co. There were no filings for opponents of the question. There were also no new filings for another question that will ask Massachusetts voters if the state should issue a second slots parlor license.

The organic food industry has gotten ugly, but one of these two looks like it's a better bet on the future. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Sep 10, 2016 at 11:11AM Image source: Getty Images. For well over a decade, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) was the only pure play in the organic food movement. The company was enormously successful, and that garnered investors a return of almost 1,000% between 2000 and 2013. But others took note of that success, and it hasn't been pretty in the industry since then. On the low end, Wal-Mart, Costco, and Kroger have significantly upped their organic offerings. On the high end, a number of specialty stores have given Whole Foods a run for its money. One of those high-end purveyors is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM). Today we'll look at whether Sprouts' or Whole Foods' stock is a better buy. Financial fortitude As boring as cash in the bank might be, its importance cannot be understated. When a company has a cash hoard sitting around, and doesn't have to worry about meeting debt payments, it has options and flexibility. If the economy sours, it can outspend rivals, buy back shares on the cheap, or even make an acquisition or two. But if there is no cash stash, then options are extremely limited. That's why financial fortitude is so important. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Whole Foods $625 million $1,050 million $476 million $203 million Sprouts $78 million $282 million $144 million $131 million Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Net income and FCF reported on trailing twelve-month basis. It should be noted that Whole Foods is valued at roughly three times the size of Sprouts. It's also important to point out that Whole Foods pays for its new-store expansions almost solely from free cash flow (FCF). If it used debt instead, its FCF would stand at $603 million. Taking all these things into consideration, it's clear that Whole Foods is in the superior position. It only recently started taking on any debt at all, and that was largely because the money could be borrowed at such cheap rates. Sprouts, on the other hand, has a much higher debt load, relative to the amount of cash it has on hand. Winner: Whole Foods. Sustainable competitive advantage Another name for a sustainable competitive advantage is a "moat." One of the reasons that every player in the organic industry has struggled lately -- and why organic goods can be had cheaper than ever before -- is that there are no significant moats for anyone in the industry. As the popularity of natural and organic foods has increased, farmers have had more incentive to switch over to new farming practices. Because Whole Foods didn't -- and couldn't -- sign exclusive contracts with every potential organic producer worldwide before companies like Sprouts popped up, there weren't very high barriers to entry. At the end of the day, organic-food shoppers are starting to look a lot like buyers of airline tickets -- there's very little brand loyalty, and price seems to be the most important variable. When that's the case, it's never good for industry players. Winner: Tie. Valuation Finally, we need to evaluate how expensive each stock is. Just this past week, Sprouts announced that it was cutting its comps outlook for the third quarter. That sent its shares down over 15%, but it wasn't alone: Whole Foods shares dropped over 6% in concert. Given these lower valuations, which stock is a better buy today? Let's look at four popular metrics:  ratios of price to earnings, price to free cash flow, price to sales, and price/earnings to growth. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Whole Foods 19 43 0/59 1.9 Sprouts 21 19 0.75 1.6 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, YCharts. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. As I said above, Whole Foods' FCF is skewed because it uses the money to fund growth, instead of debt. If we back this out, shares of Whole Foods trade for a more reasonable 15 times FCF. When we look at the more holistic picture, we see two companies that are pretty fairly valued. Sprouts is cheaper based on its PEG ratio and price-to-FCF. Whole Foods is cheaper based on price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. Winner: Tie. So, if you must choose between these two companies, I would argue that Whole Foods is the better bet today. But in reality, you don't have to choose. And I would personally favor staying out of both companies. Whole Foods is staking its turnaround hopes on a smaller 365-branded store, but I think it, along with Sprouts, is in the unenviable position of running an extremely low-margin, commodity-based business. That's not a great environment for your hard-earned dollars.   John Mackey, co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The man told Richland County deputies he noticed a car following him from the discount store’s gas station as he walked to his home on Goodwin Way. As he was about to go inside the house, two men got out, pushed him down and stole his wallet, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Curtis Wilson said. As they were about to leave, one of the attackers turned around and shot the man in the lower body. He was taken to Palmetto Health Richland hospital. Wilson said his condition was not known. The spokesman provided no other details. Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Local Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:29 Gov.

Tom Dart in Houston @Tom_Dart Saturday 10 September 2016 10.09 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.33 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old Every advertiser dreams that their content might go viral – just not like this. On the eve of the 15th anniversary of 9/11, a San Antonio mattress store has apologised for promoting a “twin towers sale”, and closed its doors in response to the backlash. 9/11 tapes reveal raw and emotional Hillary Clinton Read more “Right now, you can get any sized mattress for a twin price!” says a grinning woman flanked by two employees in the 20-second spot. She flings her arms out and the men tumble backwards, knocking over two tall piles of mattresses. The woman screams “Oh my God!” in mock panic, then immediately recovers her composure and adds, with a half-smile: “We’ll never forget.” The now deleted video was posted on the store’s Facebook page earlier this week, the San Antonio Express-News reported. It quickly attracted local, then national outrage. “I say this unequivocally, with sincere regret: the video is tasteless and an affront to the men and women who lost their lives on 9/11,” Mike Bonanno, owner of Miracle Mattress, said in a statement. “Furthermore, it disrespects the families who lost their loved ones and continue to struggle with the pain of this tragedy every day of their lives.” By Friday afternoon, the company’s Facebook page had attracted more than 3,000 negative reviews, with many commenters expressing disgust. “I literally hope a small plane crashes into your absolute piece of shit store and it burns to the ground just for the sake of irony,” said one. Bonanno issued another statement on Friday, saying: “Effective immediately, our Miracle Mattress store will be closed indefinitely. We will be silent through the 9/11 anniversary to avoid any further distractions from a day of recognition and remembrance for the victims and their families.” Marian Salzman, New York-based chief executive of Havas PR North America, said that even well-intentioned efforts around 9/11 can come across as opportunistic intrusions into what should be a time of sober reflection. “You can have a tasteful response – it still doesn’t mean I feel it’s appropriate,” she said. “It’s a day I’d prefer not to see commingled with marshmallows or dog food or airline travel or my favourite luxury car. “I’d feel a brand respects me more and understands me better if they left a few things sacrosanct … Do me a favour, let a national day of mourning be a day about mourning.” Miracle Mattress is not the first company to misjudge the tone of an ad. In 2014, for example, a yoga studio in Virginia attracted negative responses with a “9+11 = 20% off Patriot Day Sale”. Even major brands have produced 9/11-related advertising, promotions and would-be tributes that have been criticised as tasteless and exploitative. Earlier this week, a Walmart store in Panama City, Florida, took down a September 11-themed soft drink display. Boxes of Coke and Sprite were stacked to form an American flag, with two dark towers of Coke Zero in the middle. A banner depicting the Lower Manhattan skyline and bearing the line “We Will Never Forget” hung above the price tag, which floated between the towers and informed customers that the multipacks were now $3.33. A Walmart spokesman told Orlando Weekly the display had been taken down. Shawn (@online_shawn) Florida c'mon man pic.twitter.com/HU4y2rxgFG September 6, 2016 In 2013, the communications giant AT&T responded to an immediate backlash by swiftly deleting a tweet that showed a hand holding a smartphone with the Tribute in Light memorial on its screen. Also that year, Marriott apologised and said it was reminding its hotels to be sensitive after a property in San Diego informed guests: “In remembrance of those we lost on 9/11 the hotel will provide complimentary coffee and mini muffins from 8.45-9.15am”. In 2009, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and an advertising agency apologised for a newspaper advertisement that appeared in Brazil and depicted dozens of planes heading for the twin towers. The goal was to remind readers of the need to respect the power of nature by comparing the death toll on 9/11 with the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed about 230,000 people. '9/11 belongs to compassion': Congress marks 15th anniversary on Capitol steps Read more “In no way was it done in bad faith or with disrespect to American suffering. WWF Brazil and DDB Brasil acknowledge that such an ad should never have been made, approved or published,” the charity and the ad firm said in a statement. It then emerged that a TV commercial on the same theme had been submitted to awards shows. As the Guardian reported: “Copy attached to the submission states: ‘We see two airplanes blowing up the WTC’s [World Trade Centre’s] twin towers ... We see hundreds of airplanes invading the screen. Before they hit the buildings ... lettering reminds us that the tsunami killed 100 times more people.’” There has been a 9/11-themed commercial that worked. In the US, only four months after the attacks, Budweiser aired a muted and widely admired tribute featuring Clydesdale horses passing the Statue of Liberty and kneeling as they face towards Ground Zero. It aired only once, during the 2002 Super Bowl. The concept was reprised 10 years later, adding the line: “We’ll never forget.” More news Topics September 11 2001 Advertising Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Fire officials described as huge Saturday's explosion at the five-story Tampaco Foils Ltd factory in the Tongi industrial area outside Dhaka. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The fire triggered by the blast spread quickly because flammable chemicals were stored at the factory. At least six of the 14 people being treated for burns at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital were in a critical condition, said police official Mohammed Bacchu Mia. He confirmed that at least 23 people had died. Local TV stations said about 50 people were injured in all. Television footage showed smoke billowing from the factory, with the fire engulfing part of the upper floors. Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging factories that supply products to global chains like Wal-Mart and H&M. A fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers in 2012. A year later, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh's worst industrial disaster. It took firefighters nearly five hours to bring Saturday's blaze in the Tongi area under control. Huge piles of burned materials and chemicals had to be removed from the building to prevent the fire from spreading further. Authorities have ordered an investigation but it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which occurred at around 6am. Syed Mokbul Hossain, the owner of the Tampaco Foils factory, said he was not sure when the boiler was last inspected. He said around 75 people had been scheduled to work the overnight shift. Saturday was the last working day at the factory before the workers were to go on leave for a week-long holiday for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which falls on Tuesday. The major factory accidents in 2012 and 2013 prompted Bangladesh's government, global brands and the United Nations to work together to try to improve safety standards in the South Asian country's factories.

Those and many other changes to the building that once housed The Star Ledger newsroom and business offices give the big, wide open areas the eager, if still-unfinished look of a new box store waiting to be stocked. And stocked it will be, but not with the toys, clothes or patio furniture of a Walmart or Target. Rather, the space is being remade into an energy efficient, climate-controlled and hushed warehouse for works of art. Manhattan-based Crozier Fine Arts, which stores, maintains and transports paintings and sculpture around the world, bought the building in June 2015 for $7.5 million from Maddd Equities of Floral Park, N.Y., the real estate firm that had purchased it from The Star-Ledger's owner, Advance Publications, a year earlier for an undisclosed sum.  The 177,000-square-foot grey brick building at the corner of Washington and Court streets, was the newspaper's headquarters and main location from 1966 to 2014. (The Star-Ledger remains New Jersey's largest-circulation newspaper. The Star-Ledger still maintains a presence in downtown Newark, at the Gateway Plaza complex near Penn Station. The newspaper's publisher, other executives and some editorial employees work in that location.) Crozier is now spending another $10 million to $12 million to knock out old walls and erect new ones, revamp the air circulation system and surfaces, and otherwise remake the building to suit its needs. It will be Crozier's third facility in New Jersey, after two other Newark locations, on Johnson Avenue and Irvine Turner Boulevard. "We want to make it as secure and air-tight a facility as possible," said James Pantoleon, Crozier's director of facility maintenance and engineering. "We have custom climate control systems we install in the spaces. We maintain 70 degrees and 50 percent relative humidity. And we do it with very little real energy." People and portraits are not the same, and it's more demanding to accommodate a large workforce than a large collection. "The building was constructed to house 1,200 people and keep them comfortable. Art storage is a different concept in itself," Pantoleon added. "We don't bring in a lot of outside air. Whereas for people you need a lot of oxygen, we don't want a lot of oxygen in our air." (Oxygen degrades a variety of materials, and is unwelcome in many storage environments.) Crozier said about 50 people will work in the facility once it's fully operational later this fall. And it's that modest human traffic and occupancy that will allow the building to remain at a constant temperature and humidity with little effort by the heating and air conditioning system, Pantoleon explained, because there will be relatively little walking — or breathing — in and out. Mayor Ras Baraka welcomed Crozier's reuse of the building, noting it will provide employment including entry-level jobs, as well as tax revenues. "It's great," Baraka said. "It actually speaks to whats going on in the city of Newark in bringing in terms of warehousing and manufacturing."    Crozier's clients include artists, galleries, museums, private collectors and others who need their valuable works stored in a secure place, under precise atmospheric conditions, and handled with the utmost care. Newark was an ideal location for the company, located just 5 miles west of Manhattan, the world's main intersection of art and commerce, and with easy access to several major highways and Newark Liberty International Airport. "It takes me 22 minutes from Chelsea to get here," on the PATH train, Pantoleon said, referring to the Manhattan neighborhood where Crozier's headquarters are located. The Newark building's size, its large, open spaces, high ceilings and its availability for immediate occupancy, made the old Star-Ledger building attractive to the company.   In addition to its larger storage areas, the facility will include smaller spaces that can be leased and controlled by individual galleries or artists, doubling as viewing areas to show pieces to potential buyers. A bar-code system will track every work that enters the building, allowing it to be retrieved in a matter or minutes. Crozier declined to identify any recognizable artists or institutions among its clients, citing confidentiality agreements. Company officials said they could not provide even a range of dollar values for individual pieces they store, because their clients don't tell them.  Like Observer Highway in Hoboken or Journal Square in Jersey City, the newspaper's name will outlast its physical presence on the spot. The address of the building, at the intersection of Court and Washington streets, a few blocks from City Hall and the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Courthouse, will continue to be 1 Star-Ledger Plaza, said Simon Hornby, Crozier's president and CEO. "Star-Ledger Plaza holds a special place in the heart of Newark, and we want to maintain that," said Hornby, the Louisiana-born son of Britains whose dual citizenship and posh accent reflect the international art world he trades in.   Hornby said Crozier makes a point of hiring locally. Apart from corporate public relations, he said, it's simply good business to have your workforce handy.  Many employees are artists themselves. Andrew Deock, a Newark native who is director of storage operations in New Jersey, is a painter. Shoshanna Weinberger, Crozier's director of administrative operations, is a multi-media artists with pieces in the permanent collection of the Newark Museum.  "There's an affinity for the product their dealing with," Hornby said.     Angel Rodriguez and Ralph Austin are both local hires, Newark natives who still live in the city. The two were installing electrical lines in the old newsroom, a space Crozier people have dubbed, "the loft," because it will be filled with stacks of oil paintings, lithographs, silk screens and other works.  "It's exciting," Austin, 32, a Star-Ledger reader, told a reporter. "It's a big transformation, going from being used for news to a big art site. It's interesting. And fun for me. I enjoy it." "It's pretty interesting, the history here," added Rodriquez, 31, who also reads the Ledger. "We found some old papers from you guys." Steve Strunsky may be reached at sstrunsky@njadvancemedia.com.

Fire officials said that the explosion at the five-story Tampaco Foils Ltd. factory in the Tongi industrial area outside Dhaka was huge, and that the fire triggered by the blast spread quickly because flammable chemicals were stored at the factory. Story continues below At least six of the 14 people being treated for burns at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bacchu Mia, a police official at the hospital. He confirmed that at least 23 people had died. READ MORE: John Kerry discusses security in Bangladesh amid terror concerns Local TV stations said about 50 people were injured in all. Television footage showed smoke billowing from the factory, with the fire engulfing part of the upper floors. Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging factories that supply products to global chains like Wal-Mart and H&M. In 2012, a fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers. A year later, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster.

A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh\’s capital. AP Photo/A. M. Ahad It took firefighters nearly five hours to bring Saturday’s blaze under control. Huge piles of burned materials and chemicals had to be removed from the building to prevent the fire from spreading further, officials said. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which occurred at around 6 a.m. Authorities have ordered an investigation. Syed Mokbul Hossain, the owner of the Tampaco Foils factory, told the Bengali-language Prothom Alo daily that he was not sure when the boiler was last inspected.

Saturday was the last working day at the factory before the workers were to go on leave for a weeklong holiday for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which falls on Tuesday. The major factory accidents in 2012 and 2013 prompted Bangladesh’s government, global brands and the United Nations to work together to try to improve safety standards in the South Asian country’s factories. © 2016 The Canadian Press Report an error Bangladesh explosion bangladesh factory Factory Explosion factory fire fire bangladesh Tampaco Foils factory Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Jon Stewart slams 'hypocrisy' of labelling all Donald Trump voters racist 9703 Earth on track to heat up to devastating levels by 2100, scientists say 8561 WATCH: Polar bear seen petting sled dog near Churchill, Manitoba 8270 Father sentenced to 40 years in jail for killing his daughter’s sexual abuser 7786 How the ‘mystery shopper’ scam fooled a young mother, a factory worker and a senior 5763 Sponsored content Popular Videos Mystery shopping texts sent to Canadians turn out to be scam WATCH NOW Man dies after falling into acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park WATCH NOW MPs Michelle Rempel and Elizabeth May argue over the use of the word ‘fart’ in House of Commons WATCH NOW Love and loss, a Saskatoon couple shares their NICU story WATCH NOW Jon Gosselin says Kate Gosselin ‘won’t tell’ where their son Collin is WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Wal-Mart stops selling Egyptian cotton sheets made by Welspun Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday said it will stop selling Egyptian cotton sheets made by Welspun India after the Indian manufacturer was unable to assure them the products were authentic. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday said it will stop selling Egyptian cotton sheets made by Welspun India after the Indian manufacturer was unable to assure them the products were authentic. Last month, US retailer Target Corp severed ties with Welspun after accusing them of passing off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton for two years. "Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable," Wal-Mart said in a statement. The company will pull the products from its stores and website. Wal-Mart said it will not cut ties with Welspun but will work with them to implement strong controls and better label the products. The retailer will offer customers, who purchased the products, a full refund. Egyptian cotton is prized because the length of the cotton fibers are longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.

Cramer: The market cannot rally until retail snaps back CNBC 9/9/2016 Abigail Stevenson Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival.

The stocks have now become so visible and so disturbing that Jim Cramer is worried.  "I would be kidding you if I said I wasn't worried. All I can say is, this group needs to snap out of its funk or the stocks will only get worse," the "Mad Money" host said. Quotes in the article Dollar General Corp DG ▼ 76.76 -0.15 -0.20% HD Supply Holdings Inc HDS ▼ 38.26 -0.08 -0.21% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 57.66 -1.12 -1.91% The Home Depot Inc HD ▼ 128.68 -0.25 -0.19% The sudden decline in retail seemed almost untenable to Cramer. The idea that the sector could just be resting before its next move higher seemed like wishful thinking to him. The first sign of trouble came when the momentum retailers stalled out or were caught in strong headwinds. Ulta Salon (ULTA) was one of the fastest growing retailers out there but fell 2 percent on Friday. More from Jim Cramer and other top money experts Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) also collapsed when they missed earnings estimates and cut guidance due to competition. "In fact, (Dollar General) point blank cut prices on 400 products to stay ahead of a newly energized Wal-Mart (WMT). That's disastrous," Cramer said. Specialty players L Brands (LB), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's (DKS) were the only stocks not pulled down by the gravitation of retail, but Cramer still worried that they could fall. Investors once thought that housing-related stocks were the safest in retail. But then HD Supply (HDS) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) reported weak quarters, and have managed to bring down Home Depot (HD), too. Discounters and close outs are the only group that Cramer believes in. His charitable trust just purchased TJX (TJX) because it looks like a solid play going into the holidays and a place for Macy's (M) to dispose of merchandise when it closes 100 stores. © Provided by CNBC However, the weak quarter reported by Pier 1 (PIR) could also pull it down. The only winner, according to Cramer, is Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI). The nastiest of the bunch were the department stores, with Macy's wallowing, Kohl's (KSS) slipping away, and Nordstrom (JWN) losing momentum from its last quarter. Ultimately, retail must snap back, or Cramer fears that the entire stock market could only get worse. If positive news surfaces surrounding back to school season, it could reverse. "Right now all I can hear when I think about retail is King Midas in reverse. That is not the direction you want if you believe that this market can go higher without first having a more pronounced decline, like we saw today," Cramer said.

Phillip / AP) Cincinnati – — Kroger reported weaker-than-expected revenue Friday and said it was hurt by falling prices for eggs, meats and other products, forcing it to lower its sales forecast for the year. The supermarket operator said it expects the price weakness to continue into next year, but CEO Rodney McMullen expressed confidence that it “won’t last forever.” Shares of Kroger Co. were up slightly at $31.32 in Friday trading. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman told business news channel CNBC that the drop in prices for eggs, meats and milk have affected the price of ice cream and other products that use such ingredients. Kroger, based in Cincinnati, has nearly 2,800 grocery stores around the country, including its namesake Kroger as well as Ralphs and Dillons. Like other grocers, Kroger has also been trying to keep prices low to fend off competition. Analysts have noted the increasingly competitive environment in the grocery industry, with chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pushing aggressively to win over customers with lower prices. Restaurant groups including Wendy’s have also said cheaper groceries have crimped their business, because people are opting to eat at home more as a result. For the second quarter ended Aug. 13, Kroger said sales rose 1.7 percent at locations open at least 15 months. The metric is considered a key indicator of financial health because it strips out the impact of newly opened and closed locations. For the full year, the company said it expects sales to be up 1.4 percent to 1.8 percent. That’s down from its previous forecast for growth of 2.5-3.5 percent. Kroger’s profit for the second quarter fell nearly 12 percent to $383 million, or 40 cents per share, as it made changes to its employee pensions. A year ago, it earned $433 million, or 44 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, were 47 cents per share, beating the 45 cents per share Wall Street expected, according to Zacks Investment Research. Total revenue rose 4 percent to $26.57 billion in the period, which missed Wall Street’s forecast for $26.78 billion. Kroger said it now expects earnings for the year between $2.10 per share and $2.20 per share. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The strike was coordinated by IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) according to an announcement from the the organization. The strike comes on the 45th anniversary of the prisoner protest and takeover at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, NY. In a statement, the IWOC likens prisons to modern slave holding pens, where prisoners are forced to work for little or no pay. They may have replaced the whip with pepper spray, but many of the other torments remain: isolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes and investigating our bodies as though we are animals. In federal prisons, prisoners earn 12 to 40 cents an hour and in Texas, Arkansas and Georgia they earn nothing at all. Jobs include everything from groundskeeping to janitorial services to preparing and serving meals. In addition to maintaining the prison, common jobs also include labor to benefit private corporations from Walmart to Victoria’s Secret. Prisoners even farm tilapia for Whole Foods and fight forest fires in California. Alongside these corporate jobs, which exist to bring in revenue for the contractors who run the prisons, prison conditions have weakened due to overcrowding, continued cost constraints and a general lack of care. In Louisiana, prisoners sued for the right to A/C after interior temperatures rose into the hundreds, resulting a myriad of health impacts. NPR recently chronicled the rise of ramen noodles as the currency of choice as prison officials limit the quantity and quality of food provided in cafeterias. A rash of deaths at Nassau County correctional facility brought that facility’s private health contractor into the limelight for inadequate care. Basically, conditions are pretty terrible nationwide, even considering that we’re talking about prison. People are inclined to strike when they feel they have no other option and nothing to lose. What’s interesting about this strike is the coordinated effort between facilities, which seemingly took months to coordinate via contraband cell phones, sympathetic family on the outside, and secret social media accounts like this protected Twitter account from the Free Alabama Movement and its associated YouTube page, where video from a contraband cellphone captures an inmate describing prison officials’ efforts to keep a food poisoning outbreak under wraps: Despite months of preparation, the strike is still extremely risky. Cole Dorsey, an IWOC organizer in the Bay Area, explained to Mother Jones: “inmates could be put into solitary confinement or segregation, and could lose phone call and visiting privileges— in addition to the physical risks that come with participating in even the most non-violent protests. ” IOWC explains the reason for the strike: This is a call to end slavery in America. This call goes directly to the slaves themselves. We are not making demands or requests of our captors, we are calling ourselves to action. To every prisoner in every state and federal institution across this land, we call on you to stop being a slave, to let the crops rot in the plantation fields, to go on strike and cease reproducing the institutions of your confinement. Prisoner strikes differ from facility to facility but may include work stoppages and other non-violent protest techniques. The strike was coordinated with a number of protests outside prison walls in cities around the country, which are well-documented on social media. Unsurprisingly, news from inside the gates has been slow to emerge today — many prisons will respond with a communications lockdown as a first line of defense to prisoner unrest. We do have confirmation of 35 workers striking from their jobs producing license plates at Holeman correctional facility in Alabama. A press release called it a “peaceful protest.” Two Florida prisons are on lockdown and will be through the weekend. It’s going to be a little while before news from the inside filters out and we see what kind of impact, if any, this strike has on inmate’s living and working conditions. We’ll be watching. At the very least, the scope of the strike brings attention to a population whose wellbeing is often ignored.

Perhaps making Prison a living hell would deter these criminals from doing anything that may land them in prison again.

What she knows is that Debra Chrisjohn, 39, died in the custody of the Elgin OPP on Thursday, after she had been taken to the detachment on a warrant, went into “medical distress” and was taken to hospital. Her family fears they might never know what happened. Cindy Chrisjohn says Ontario’s police watchdog agency that’s investigating the death — the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) — is keeping them in the dark. “I just don’t want her situation to fall on deaf ears. I really want a good investigation into this. I want followup,” she said. The SIU has five investigators on the case, including one in forensics. Given her sister’s troubled history, and her own $100,000 lawsuit and allegations of discrimination against the London police after she was wrongfully identified as Debra and arrested three years ago, Cindy Chrisjohn says she has good reason not to trust authorities. “I don’t have the full story,” the London woman said. “They’ve just started their investigation and they said it’s likely going to take weeks, probably months. “They have to wait for toxicology (test results) and they said in the end we wouldn’t get the report anyways because it goes to the (provincial) attorney general.” Because Debra is aboriginal, her sister said she fears the whole story will “be swept under the rug.” Friday, the SIU said Debra was rushed to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital just after 7:30 p.m. where she was pronounced dead. Cindy Chrisjohn said Debra, the mother to 11 children and grandmother of two, lived at Oneida with their father and was “really kind-hearted and loving.” She said Debra had started on methadone for her drug addiction, had two of her children living with her, was looking to go back to school and had joined an event-planning committee on Oneida. She agreed Debra had led a troubled and addicted life and had numerous scrapes with the law. One was in August 2013 when she was arrested at the east London Walmart for shoplifting to pay off drug debts. Debra gave Cindy’s name and birthdate to police. A month later she failed to show up for her fingerprinting and a first court appearance. At the end of September 2013, Cindy Chrisjohn was pulled over while driving to the Oneida settlement. After she identified herself, the OPP said there was a warrant for her arrest and took her into custody in handcuffs and handed her over to the London police. She was told she’d been identified through mugshots and was held in cells for an hour before she was released early in the morning without a ride back to the reserve. At the time she weighed close to 200 pounds more than Debra. Their only matching characteristic was their aboriginal heritage. Her lawsuit remains before the courts. The family is trying to piece together Debra’s final days. Cindy last saw Debra Sept. 1 when Debra showed up at her London home and was hoping to get a ride to the reserve “to pick up her cheque.” Cindy Chrisjohn said Debra was arrested Tuesday by London police after she was accused of trying to break into cars. There was a warrant for her sister’s arrest in Brantford for breaching release conditions and theft. Brantford police didn’t come to get Debra and London police had no jurisdiction to hold her. At the hospital, with no one watching her, Debra bolted, her sister said. “She was at the hospital and she saw an opportunity just to take off,” Cindy said. Family members reported they saw Debra on Wednesday walking near Horton and Wellington streets. “They said she didn’t look good,” said Cindy. The SIU said Debra was picked up Wednesday after London police were called to Highbury Avenue and Trafalgar Street where a woman was reportedly obstructing traffic. Arrested, she was turned over to the Elgin OPP on a warrant and taken to their detachment. Cindy Chrisjohn said she fears Debra’s distress in custody might not have been taken seriously . She said she’s forgiven her for using her name when arrested in 2013 and understands she was driven by drug use and wanting to avoid police detection. Debra’s funeral is planned Monday on Oneida. jsims@postmedia.com twitter.com/JaneatLFPress Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Equipment Sales & Rentals McLean Scale Co & Ltd New Homes Rembrandt Homes Medical Kyle Foot & Orthotics Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Tell us about it in 40 words or less. Hikers on the Javelina Trail (#332) would appreciate the organizers of the Ken & Barb bike race on Sunday to inform their participants that they are supposed to yield to hikers. We are not supposed to jump/dive out of the way of bikes moving way too fast. Such behavior is both discourteous and dangerous. The next time you are in a coffee shop and you receive a call on your cell phone, please talk short and quietly or go outside if you are going to talk loud and long. Most people go to a coffee shop to read the paper, visit quietly with friends or spend time on their computer. Quiet is appreciated. It seems that a sense of humor is pretty common among successful coaches and managers. Has anyone ever seen Chip Hale smile, much less laugh out loud? On Aug. 3, I was shopping at the Gail Gardner Walmart in the pouring rain. I was in such a hurry to get my purchases in the car without getting wet and to place the cart in the cart rack that I left my purse in the cart & drove home. I panicked when I realized my purse was missing and immediately called Walmart. My purse had been turned in with everything in it. Nothing was missing. I would like to thank the honest person who took my purse to customer service. What a wonderful town we live in! All Rants&Raves are subject to review and editing.

Bikers follow the rules of the road like cars have to? Bikers pay their 'fair share' of road maintenance costs? Good luck! Bikers are the next 'protected class.' The left has us so divided, all they have to do is step into the vacuum and they are king of the heap. They live for power. Most of us live for our families or to actually help others, not just talk about helping others. Welcome to America 2016. We allowed this to happen.

If you seek peace and quiet, buy yourself a Mr. Coffee sip your joe at home. If you do come to a coffee shop, please wear a tie. Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal ThomasPaind 2 months, 1 week ago Seems to me there's a middle ground -- if you need to use a cell phone in a coffee shop, lower the volume on your ringer and speak at a level well below that of live conversations, as ILP appears to suggest. If reception is poor and you need to speak up, then go outside or place the call later. No need in that case for Mr. Coffee or neckties. Here's a brain twister for UponReflection: Who are the leftists -- those who speak loudly on cell phones in coffee shops or those who don't like it? Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal ConcernedCitz 2 months, 1 week ago Cell phone conversations are often louder because the person speaking into the phone overcompensates due to background noise. Even person-to-person conversations are louder when in a noisy environment, however voice volume decreases when background noise decreases. Not the same with people talking on cell phones because they are unaware background noise has decreased.

PHOTO BY CINDY YAMANAKA, THE REGISTER/SCNG , Related article » Seasonal Job Tips Who hires? Distribution operations including Amazon, UPS and FedEx have all announced seasonal work in the past several years during the early fall. Big retailers that have previously put out a holiday hiring sign include Target, Kohls, Macy's. JCPenney , Sears-Kmart and Toys R Us Online applications are the standard. Company websites online are the starting point. Some stores have online application kiosks. How much?* Here's an hourly wage outline for Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario. It can vary. Retail cashier: $11.39 Retail sales: $13.05 Counter and rental clerks: $14.98 Freight, stock and material movers: $13.66 Packers and packagers: $12.26 Machine feeders and off-bearers: $13.96 *Source: First quarter of 2016 wages, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, U.S. Department of Labor. Sorry to bring this up one week after Labor Day, but it’s not too early to start thinking about seasonal jobs. The money isn’t great, the hours can be challenging, and most jobs are over by January, but work in retail stores or fulfillment and distribution centers has regained a reliable spot for extra holiday earnings since taking a dip or flattening out during the Great Recession. AWAITING WORD Hiring agency Randstad has already announced it is taking applications for seasonal and temporary workers for the Walmart.com Fulfillment Center in Chino, with 800 jobs to fill. Not all the usual outlets have yet announced their plans and hiring numbers for holiday jobs, but some, including Amazon, Target, JCPenney and Toys R Us have dedicated seasonal hiring websites. OTHER OPPORTUNITIES Holiday positions are already listed on Kohl’s regular jobs website, which encourages a “seasonal associate” search. The Sears-Kmart site invites visitors to register for seasonal jobs. And there are crossover opportunities as e-commerce continues to surge – chain department stores are as likely to offer jobs at their distribution centers as work in the aisles and counters of their stores. WORKER COUNTS UP For the Inland area, retail workers jumped by more than 12,000 between September and December of 2015; the warehouse and transportation workforce jumped by 6,600 during the same period. Both job categories then dropped by thousands in January of this year.

(a.m. ahad/Associated Press) By The Associated Press Published: September 10, 2016, 7:45 PM A   A NEW DELHI (AP) — A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh’s capital on Saturday, killing at least 23 workers and injuring dozens, officials said. Fire officials said that the explosion at the five-story Tampaco Foils Ltd. factory in the Tongi industrial area outside Dhaka was huge, and that the fire triggered by the blast spread quickly because flammable chemicals were stored at the factory. At least six of the 14 people being treated for burns at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bacchu Mia, a police official at the hospital. He confirmed that at least 23 people had died. Local TV stations said about 50 people were injured in all. Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging factories that supply products to global chains such as Wal-Mart and H&M. A fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers in 2012. In 2013, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster. It took firefighters nearly five hours to bring Saturday’s blaze under control. Huge piles of burned materials and chemicals had to be removed from the building to prevent the fire from spreading further, officials said. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which occurred at around 6 a.m. Authorities have ordered an investigation.

Douglas Ave. in Belleville. Mike Koziatek mkoziatek@bnd.com 1 of 2 i By Mike Koziatek mkoziatek@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BELLEVILLE Mayor Mark Eckert on Friday revoked the liquor license for Ehssan “Sammy” Hamdan, who owns Sammy’s Market and is under investigation for recruiting people to steal baby formula from other stores and then stocking the formula in his convenience store. Hamdan has not been charged with any crimes but Belleville Police Detective Shane Brown testified during a public hearing about Hamdan’s license on Thursday that the case remains under investigation. Neither Hamdan nor his attorney, Jack Kloess of Belleville, could be reached for comment on Friday. They declined to comment after the hearing Thursday. Eckert said he based his decision on the evidence of criminal actions presented during Thursday’s hearing. place_quote1 “...There is substantial evidence to adequately support the conclusion that the licensee is a person who is not of good character/reputation” as required by license holders, Eckert said in his order. The order also states there is “substantial evidence” that Hamdan violated state laws regarding theft and money laundering. “I have much concern about the seriousness of these charges,” Eckert said in an interview. “He’s not saying these things didn’t happen. We have statements from his family, other witnesses” and a police officer, he added. “I just decided for now this store needs to remain closed,” Eckert said. “I’m doing what I think is the best thing for the neighborhood and for the city.” The store at 530 N. Douglas Ave. will remain closed because Hamdan’s commercial occupancy permit was pulled because unauthorized sewer line work and electrical work was done at the store, Eckert said. Brown testified that two people were arrested June 30 at Walmart in connection with an earlier theft of baby formula at the store. “They stated they were provided a shopping list from Sammy himself and what Enfamil products to go out and steal,” Brown said. “They gave me a detailed explanation of the products they were given, how much they are paid by Mr. Hamdan for those products and other items that he requested they go out and steal.” Brown said the two people would receive $3, $5 or $6 for a container of baby formula. He said the containers usually are valued at $18 to $32. The detective said police had been investigating a rash of baby formula thefts across the city in June. Hamdan, 23, was taken into custody but then released after two search warrants were obtained in late June and early July, Brown said. Hamdan first was given permission to get a liquor license in July 2015. The license was suspended last month by Eckert, who serves as the city’s liquor commissioner. Eckert’s order said the license was pulled last month because there was a reasonable belief that Hamdan’s store would “immediately threaten the welfare of the community” and that “criminal activity” occurred at the store. Ward 7 Alderman Phil Elmore was the only alderman to vote against granting permission to Hamdan to get a liquor license. Elmore said he voted “no” on the request because there were residents who did not want the store to sell alcohol. Elmore was pleased with the mayor’s ruling. “I think the decision was clear and swift and there did not seem to be much gray area,” Elmore said. “The law is clear. The testimony was clear and the decision was a good one by the mayor.” He also commended Brown for his “thorough and professional” investigation. Eckert said his ruling can be appealed to the Illinois Liquor Control Commission.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Luciano: Sordid murder case leaves Pekin family stunned and stung Saturday Sep 10, 2016 at 6:44 PM Phil Luciano Journal Star columnist @lucianophil PEKIN — To frustrated family, Douglas Bailey grows ever elusive, first by a crime, now by the courts. Last Thanksgiving, he never arrived back home for a family gathering in Pekin. He supposedly had driven from his Wisconsin residence but only got as far as rural Peoria County. Relatives looked all over, and so did police, but couldn’t find him. That’s because he wasn’t there. He was in Kentucky. Dead. In a box. Days earlier at home, his naked girlfriend had gunned down Bailey. Then her on-the-side boyfriend dumped him down a remote ravine hundreds of miles away. Why did she pull the trigger? That was the crux of charges filed in December. She faced life in prison if guilty of cold-blooded murder. But at trial in August, she beat a first-degree homicide charge with a defense of battered-spouse syndrome. She is free on bond, awaiting retrial on a lesser charge, sometime next year. Meanwhile, Pekin kin feel as stunned and stung as the moment they heard the verdict in the courtroom. Battered-spouse syndrome? That wasn’t the Doug Bailey they knew. Says sister Lisa Elwell, 54, of Pekin, “He was on trial, not her." *** As his family tells it, Douglas Bailey always was a jolly imp. “He was the funnest person,” says sister Sheila Dockerty, 57, of Mapleton. “Everybody loved the guy.” Like many of his nine siblings, he grew up in Pekin and Marshall counties. He dropped out of high school to work at his dad’s mill in Lacon. At the time, brother Larry Bailey, 19, was shot to death in the home of a Lacon man. The shooter was booked on three manslaughter counts, but the charges were later dropped. An investigation showed Larry Bailey slipped into the home and attacked the man for allegedly fooling around with Larry Bailey’s girlfriend. After losing two teeth, the man grabbed a handgun. Two shots later, Larry Bailey was dead. Not long afterward, Doug Bailey left the area to take a job as a truck driver, all 120 pounds of him merrily bouncing across the country. Over time, he’d have three sons, now ages 30, 22 and 20. He eventually landed in Iowa, befriending an older couple living nearby. When the husband died, Bailey often would help the widow with chores. Eventually, he met the widow’s daughter: Rose Marie Kuehni, seven years his junior, a construction management instructor at the University of Minnesota who lived across the border in Prescott, Wis. The two hit it off and quickly became a couple. In 2011, his relatives went to Wisconsin to attend what they thought was a wedding ceremony, but it was actually a “commitment ceremony” that involved no officiant or paperwork. Still, they returned to central Illinois with a good vibe about the new couple. Later, during visits to Prescott, they say, Kuehni sometimes got moody about certain things (such as when visitors smoked indoors) but never mentioned any relationship problems. In fact, they say, she usually looked blissful. For his part, Bailey seemed happy, at least at first. But last year, he confided to siblings that he’d been chatting with an old flame in Princeton, 50 miles north of Peoria — and he planned to leave Kuehni for her. In fact, weeks before a family Thanksgiving gathering in Pekin, Bailey said he would be attending with the Princeton woman. He planned to arrive two days early. But on Tuesday, Nov. 24, relatives received a text from his phone, stating, “I can’t leave my Rose. I’ll be there Thanksgiving.” They were surprised, but shrugged off the switch. “It’s his life,” sister Dockery says. “What are you going to do?” On Thanksgiving morning, Bailey’s Facebook page offered the post, “Can't wait to see all my loving brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews it's going to be so fun.” But hours later, the page offered a rambling post hinting he was quitting his job and heading someplace down South. “This is Douglas Leroy Bailey, aka 'Hillbilly,' signing off. It's been a good run but my days are done.” His family was perplexed. He wasn’t so mercurial as to just take off on a whim. Dockery posted back, “Where the hell are you, brother?” The family traded texts and calls with Kuehni. But she expressed puzzlement as to his whereabouts. Where was Doug Bailey? *** On Nov. 30, still with no word from Bailey, sister Dockery contacted the Peoria County Sheriff’s Office. After detectives talked with Kuehni, the Peoria County Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team swarmed rural areas near Edwards. According to Kuehni’s story at the time, the two had driven from Wisconsin toward Pekin but on Interstate 74 took the Edwards exit and drove around. She said they argued about Bailey’s intent to leave Kuehni for another woman, and Kuehni supposedly dropped him off in Edwards before heading back to Wisconsin. During the first week of December, Bailey’s relatives scoured the area, trying to help the search team. When nothing turned after a week of searching, a Peoria County sheriff’s detective drove to northern Wisconsin to chat with Kuehni. Soon, after further questioning by investigators there in Pierce County, Kuehni was behind bars under $100,000 bail. Charges alleged she killed Bailey, then had his body hidden. In court documents and into the trial, sordid details would emerge. But to Bailey’s survivors, the most jarring revelations involved Kuehni’s claims that Bailey had abused her for years. According to the Pierce County Herald, Kuehni pointed to “three weeks of terror” in 2012. Falsely believing she had cheated on him, Bailey repeatedly beat and raped her, Kuehni said. The family couldn't believe it. Aside from once slugging a man who’d tried to steal a girlfriend, Bailey wasn’t known to cause trouble. Further, siblings that visited Bailey and Kuehni during times she claimed to have been severely bruised, including that three-week period of 2012, spotted no such injuries. And she never made a peep about any attacks. But, according to Kuehni, his rage peaked Nov. 22, when Bailey made a pact with God: In exchange for sparing his sister of a medical scare, Bailey somehow would give up his life within a year, according to The (Red Wing, Minn.) Republican-Eagle. First, though, Bailey planned “to have some fun” and seek revenge from people who’d wronged him, Kuehni said. “I’m going to start with you and I’m going to finish with you,” he said, according to her account. “It starts tonight.” He ordered her to the bedroom, where she went into a closet to put on only a robe. But once naked, she spotted a 20-gauge pump-action shotgun she kept loaded in the closet. Instead of grabbing the robe, she grabbed the shotgun. According to her testimony, from two feet away, Bailey ordered her to her knees — and she pulled the trigger. When he lunged at her, she fired again. Kuehni sat in the room for a while with the lifeless Bailey. Then she put on some clothes before wrapping Bailey in a sheet “because she didn’t want to look at him,” she said. She carried the body downstairs and into the garage, where she found a square box (about 2 feet by 2 feet) that used to store Christmas wreaths. She stuffed Bailey in the box, then trundled him by wheelbarrow into a shed until Thanksgiving morning. That morning, just before dawn, she hoisted the box into her truck and headed south, toward central Illinois. On the way, she texted the family, in part by using Bailey's phone and pretending to be him. At some point, she made another call, to Clarence Hicks, 60, of Harrodsburg, Ky. They’d originally met at a Walmart in Mankato, Minn., and thereafter would sometimes rendezvous in various states for sex. That Thanksgiving morning, she said she needed a favor of another sort. At her trial, Hicks — though cooperative with authorities — would take the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify, out of fear of incriminating himself. But emails between Hicks and Kuehni, including some from 2015, not only discussed their dalliances but her frustration with Bailey. In one, she pondered “ways to take his life” without getting caught, according to the Republican-Eagle. However, on Thanksgiving, Hicks never asked what was inside the box, Kuehni told police. She asked him to drive from Kentucky to central Illinois. They converged off Interstate 74 — one court account says near Peoria, another says near Bloomington — and Hicks put the box into his vehicle. He then drove hours to a rural, mountainous area and flung it down a ravine near Pineville, Ky. Police later found the box with his assistance. Meanwhile, Kuehni motored back to Wisconsin. Along the way, she tossed Bailey’s phone out the window, never to be found. *** As the trial wound down, with much of the evidence undisputed, jurors would take a hard look at Kuehni's motive. Defense attorney Mark Gherty stressed battered-spouse syndrome, painting a background picture of long-term abuse and fear that pushed Kuehni to the breaking point of pulling the trigger. Kuehni testified she didn’t just leave the home because “I wasn’t allowed to leave.” She said she didn’t call police because Bailey claimed to be a former Army Ranger with special governmental immunity. Pierce County Assistant District Attorney Bill Thorie acknowledged Kuehni likely endured severe abuse in 2012. But, according to the Pierce County Herald, he told the jury, “Getting beat up in 2012 is not a get-out-of-jail free card to shoot your partner.” Thorie pointed out inconsistencies between evidence and her statements. For instance, though Kuehni said she shot Bailey face-to-face, a medical examiner testified to an entry wound to Bailey’s back. Thorie also wondered about her painting the bedroom a few days after the shooting. She replied that the paint job was intended to help her sleep better at night: “I kept having nightmares about blood coming out of the ceiling and couldn’t take it.” After several days, the jury began deliberations on three possible charges. The harshest charge, first-degree intentional homicide, carries mandatory life imprisonment. Jurors could opt for a lesser count, second-degree intentional homicide, punishable by up to 60 years, which implies a defendant acted in self-defense but was in no imminent threat. The third charge, hiding a corpse, is punishable by up to 12½ years. After 14 hours of deliberation, the jury went three ways on three charges. Kuehni was acquitted on the first-degree count but convicted on the lowest charge. Meanwhile, the jury could not reach a verdict on the second-degree count. Later, the prosecution said it would retry Kuehni for second-degree intentional homicide. But the judge agreed with Kuehni’s attorney and dropped her bail. She’d been held under $100,000 bond, but she was allowed to walk out of jail after her parents signed a $20,000 surety bond, meaning they’d be on the hook for that amount if she were to flee. Conditions of her bond prohibit her from contacting Hicks, who still faces a count of hiding a corpse. A new trial date for Kuehni has not been set, but Bailey′s family has been told January is possible. Almost a month after the first-degree acquittal, Bailey’s siblings remain as shocked as the moment in court they heard the verdict. Though they buried his remains at the family plot in Mason County, they say they struggle for closure. The pain drags on: first his disappearance and death, then the court testimony and acquittal, now the lingering case and ebbing hope. “We hope the prosecutor does a better job,” says sister Carol Bailey, 62, of Pekin. Maybe they’ll never have a clear picture of what happened to their brother. But frustrated by a process in which they have no control and little say, Douglas Bailey seems to slide further and foggier out of reach — hauntingly so, says sister Elwell. “It’s horrible,” she says. “I’m having nightmares. Last night, I saw (Bailey and Kuehni) coming around the corner in my apartment, and I had to stay up all night to keep an eye on her.” She goes quiet, hesitating before saying: “There’s another nightmare. I’m in the courtroom, and everyone's laughing at me.” Some information in this story was provided by the Pierce County (Wis.) Herald, the Prescott (Wis.) Journal, the Hudson (Wis.)

Reuters Published Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 7:28AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 11:03AM EDT Comments AA Department store operator Sears Canada Inc reported a quarterly loss, compared with a year-earlier profit, hurt by a 15.6 per cent fall in sales. The company said same-store sales fell 5.5 per cent as traffic for big-ticket items such as major appliances fell due to termination of a credit card agreement and lower-than-expected sales of new merchandise launched in spring. Bank of Nova Scotia said in October it would buy JPMorgan & Chase Co’s Canadian credit card portfolio associated with Sears Canada. Sears Canada, hit by increasing competition from U.S. retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has been shutting down stores and cutting jobs. The company said it cut $128-million in costs for the first half of this year and said it was planning cost cuts at the higher end of its previously announced $127-million-$155-million forecast. Sears Canada posted a net loss of $91.6-million, or 90 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 30, compared with a profit of $13.5-million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included a gain of $67.2-million as a result of sale-and-leaseback transactions. Revenue fell to $648.5-million from $768.8-million.

A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh’s capital. A. M. Ahad — The Associated Press By The Associated Press Posted: 09/10/16, 6:35 PM EDT | Updated: on 09/10/2016 # Comments Firefighters work to put out the fire at a packaging factory in Tongi industy area outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, Saturday. A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh’s capital. A. M. Ahad — The Associated Press NEW DELHI >> A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh’s capital on Saturday, killing at least 23 workers and injuring dozens, officials said. Fire officials said that the explosion at the five-story Tampaco Foils Ltd. factory in the Tongi industrial area outside Dhaka was huge, and that the fire triggered by the blast spread quickly because flammable chemicals were stored at the factory. At least six of the 14 people being treated for burns at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bacchu Mia, a police official at the hospital. He confirmed that at least 23 people had died. Local TV stations said about 50 people were injured in all. Television footage showed smoke billowing from the factory, with the fire engulfing part of the upper floors. Advertisement Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging factories that supply products to global chains like Wal-Mart and H&M. A fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers in 2012. In 2013, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster. It took firefighters nearly five hours to bring Saturday’s blaze under control. Huge piles of burned materials and chemicals had to be removed from the building to prevent the fire from spreading further, officials said. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which occurred at around 6 a.m. Authorities have ordered an investigation. Syed Mokbul Hossain, the owner of the Tampaco Foils factory, told the Bengali-language Prothom Alo daily that he was not sure when the boiler was last inspected. He said around 75 people had been scheduled to work the overnight shift, which was to end at 7 a.m. Saturday was the last working day at the factory before the workers were to go on leave for a weeklong holiday for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which falls on Tuesday. The major factory accidents in 2012 and 2013 prompted Bangladesh’s government, global brands and the United Nations to work together to try to improve safety standards in the South Asian country’s factories.

Prisoners were used to clean the beaches after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf, the largest marine oil spill in history. Exposed to deadly toxins, they were given no protective gear, evidence that prisoners used as slave labor are expendable. I am not shocked, I am not appalled, but every time this fact clicks in my brain that people don’t know, it truly takes me into an OMG moment. This is one of the biggest wow factors that I have ever experienced. Just think about it. Scenario: I am looking you square dead in your eyes and I am telling you that SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. OK, it may take some time for you to register this information because what you see around you are shopping malls, schools, restaurants, libraries, game rooms, beaches, hotels, grocery stores, highways, camping sites, resorts, schools, movie theaters, night clubs, gas stations, amusement parks – you see a functioning society full of all of life’s joys and people who are moving about freely. Some are going left, some are going right, and some are going north, some are going south, some are walking, some are driving, some are traveling by plane, bus and train, and some are even sitting still. You see them and they exist all around you. A large number of them are New Afrikan (Black people), and they don’t have to go to the back of the bus or even use separate bathrooms; they are enjoying life’s pleasures right along with everyone else. You see them in motion and you don’t see anyone in chains, shackles, or torn and tattered clothing. This is not what you see. The idea that slavery exists doesn’t fit in the equation of what you see around you. After processing my statement and your present reality, you turn to me and ask me, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m free. I am not a slave.” I proceed to tell you that what you understand is an illusion and it can change in the blink of an eye. Just one incorrect move can alter your “Amerikkkan dream.” Now I have your full attention because you enjoy driving your vehicle that you work so hard to make the monthly payments on. You enjoy your two-bedroom apartment full of nice furniture that you worked overtime to get so that you can impress and entertain your family and friends, inviting them over for snacks, card games and on holidays like every family should be able to do. This young prisoner in a forced labor camp in Georgia in 1932 is being punished. Prisoners worked as slaves can be tortured or killed without any monetary loss, so they are more expendable than slaves, who comprised a slave owner’s wealth. – Photo: John Spivak You enjoy that and, most importantly, you worked your ass off for it. To think that it could be gone in a blink of an eye and to think that you could be a slave is laughable: Ha ha ha. It’s unheard of, right? NO. I hate to be the bearer of bad news – i.e., the party pooper – but I have to be. My freedom depends on your understanding this undeniable fact. “We aren’t free until we all are free” is a saying not utilized by capitalists – in this case, slave owners. It is a saying used by freedom seekers and those who seek not to exploit the labor of others, those who wish to live in a just society. All must understand that YES, SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. So now you are all ears. Good. The United Snakes Constitution is a legal document which lays out the system of fundamental principles according to which the U.S. is governed. I would like to bring your attention to the 13th Amendment of 1865, the law that abolished slavery, or so we are taught. Unfortunately, many overlook the clause that tries to make continued slavery acceptable to the daughters and sons of our ancestors who were enslaved and those who fought like hell not to be. The 13th Amendment states in full, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Now this is pretty much in layman’s terms; it’s simply saying that if you have been convicted of a crime and you are captured you can and most likely will be subjected to slavery regardless if you like it or not. Why? Because it is the law. Get it? Got it? Good. So now you say: “That’s wrong. That’s insane. That’s horrible. Why would they do that? Why would they have that there in the Constitution?” The answer is this: Slavery was the best thing to ever happen to the United Snakes of Amerikkka. Slavery was and is today its bread and butter. To understand the U.S. and how it functions, you must understand capitalism. Capitalism at its core is a system built off and maintained on profit – profit and wealth for the individual and not the masses. In order for capitalism to exist, the people, we the people must remain powerless, while a few individuals, stakeholders, corporations control the wealth of nations. Only the overseer’s uniform and the modern photography tell us that this is 1975, not 1775. The prisoners are picking cotton on the Cummins Prison Farm in Texas, where many current prisons are former plantations. Texas and Georgia are the only states that pay prisoners nothing at all for their labor. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project The mode of production is fueled by human labor. This mode of production became rampant and well defined with the rise of slavery, particularly with the enslavement of African people. As production and goods began to serve the interests of the few and wealth was being made, MORE, MORE and MORE became the desire of those who were benefiting from slavery. They then contemplated on ways to become masters of the economy, and with the growth of industrialization and the supposed abolishment of slavery, they moved to wage slave labor, which most Americans unconsciously commit their daily lives to when they go to work every day. For the Afrikan in America who was supposed to be free, there were still great and many challenges. Jim Crow laws enforced and justified plenty of reasons to capture and imprison men and women, who were officially considered free, for crimes of all sorts. You could be captured and imprisoned for things like looking at a European (white person), spitting on the sidewalk, talking too loud or walking on the wrong side of the street – almost anything would give way to your imprisonment. Lawmakers and those who were displeased with slavery being supposedly abolished understood that they would lose money. Who would harvest their crops? Who would till their lands? Who would be the mammies for their children? Who would they release their sexual desires on? Who would they enjoy torturing? Who could they maim? No more slaves meant an end to the lifestyle they so enjoyed. This made them angry and furious. There has to be a way around this, they figured. With anger, rage and a well thought out plan to imprison former slaves, they won again. Imprisoned people, particularly those of African descent, would be forced to work in coal mines, railroads, as indentured servants for alleged unpaid taxes or debt, and things of that nature for all the days of their lives. The only difference between these prisoners sent to work on a plantation after the Civil War – in a system known as convict leasing – and the slaves they had been before the Civil War is their stripes. Many of us were subjected to convict leasing, a system of penal labor practiced in the Southern United States. Convict leasing provided prisoner labor to private parties, such as plantation owners and corporations, such as the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The lessee was responsible for feeding, clothing and housing the prisoners just as they had in the centuries that they held slaves. The state of Louisiana leased out convicts as early as 1844, but the system expanded all through the South with the emancipation of slaves at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. In 1898 some 73 percent of Alabama’s entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing. Capitalist wealth since then has continued to grow due to prison slave labor. As of 2014, 37 percent of the prison population consists of New Afrikans. This is not by chance. Mass incarceration is steadily increasing as the laws are strategically in place to incarcerate men and women on a daily basis – just the same as the Jim Crow laws that were in place not so long ago. The slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment safeguards, protects and gives the right to profiteers, stakeholders, corporations and government entities to use slave labor for profit and refuse to be morally responsible for the injustice of slavery. They lose no sleep at night behind the idea that we are still slaves just like the old days. This is not a scene out of ancient history. Prison slavery is rampant today but rarely as visible as this. Another example of the past that wasn’t so long ago operating under the same amendment are chain gangs. A chain gang is a group of prisoners chained together to perform menial or physically challenging work as a form of punishment. Such punishment might include repairing buildings, building roads or clearing land. This system also existed primarily in the Southern United States and by 1955 had been phased out nationwide, with Georgia the last state to abandon the practice. Chain gangs were reintroduced by a few states during the “get tough on crime” 1990s, with Alabama being the first state to revive them, in 1995. The experiment ended after about one year in all states except Arizona, where in Maricopa County inmates can still volunteer for a chain gang to earn credit toward a high school diploma or avoid disciplinary lockdowns for rule infractions. The introduction of chain gangs into the United States began shortly after the Civil War. The Southern states needed finances and public works to be performed. Using prisoners as slave labor was a way to do it for free. This information isn’t hard to find; I got the above on Wikipedia. I hope that you are uncomfortable now, but I am not done. So that wasn’t so long ago. America is built off of big business. Here are a few of big businesses that are a part of most citizens’ everyday lives and that use prisoners as slave labor, legally: Victoria’s Secret, BP, Whole Foods, AT&T, Bank of America, Bayer, Cargill, Caterpillar, Chevron, Chrysler, Costco, John Deere, Eli Lilly and Company, Exxon Mobil, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson and Johnson, K-Mart, Koch Industries, McDonald’s, Merck, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, ConAgra Foods, Shell, Starbucks, UPS, Verizon, Walmart and Wendy’s. Most men and women in prison make anywhere from 25 cents per hour up to $1.15 per hour. This is the true meaning of “Made in America” when we see it on many of our product labels. This legalized slavery is often called insourcing. Insourcing is the most cost effective way for the capitalist to keep production costs low and profit high, without suffering criticism for outsourcing, sending jobs overseas. Imagine how sad Ronald McDonald would be if McDonald’s had to pay real wages for its products produced by prisoners working for pennies an hour. Boycott McDonald’s and tell them you’ll come back when they stop using prison slave labor. They can keep America great by utilizing that slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment. McDonald’s, known for serving over 68 million customers a day, is the world’s most successful fast food franchise. Did you know that prisoners manufacture the plastic cutlery, containers and uniforms? McDonald’s also uses prison slave labor to produce frozen foods. Prisoners process beef for patties. They also process bread, milk and chicken products. Another added incentive for the greedy amongst us is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which gives employers a tax credit of $2,400 for every work-release inmate they employ as a reward for hiring “risky target groups.” It’s also an added plus when the employer doesn’t have to provide things like vacation days and sick days, 401k retirement plans, or medical and health benefits. Look at all the money that is being saved by using the slave labor of prisoners instead of using the labor of ordinary wage slaves in the work force. Prison slave labor is the way to go for greedy employers. For workers trying to support their families, it means depressed wages or unemployment. Guess what else is made in prisons – U.S. military equipment, a billion-dollar industry. There are also all sorts of everyday items; the list goes on and on. Word on the street is that prisoners are even raising seeing-eye dogs for blind people. UNICOR proudly displays this picture of a woman prisoner, a slave laborer. Aside from the private corporations, there are even larger entities profiting off prisoner slave labor that you must be made aware of. One is UNICOR, a very guilty party in this modern day slavery here in Amerikkka. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR or FPI, is a corporation created in 1934 and owned by the federal government to oversee prisoner slave labor and set the condition and wage standards for prisoners working in federal prisons. UNICOR’s official reason for being is that in exchange for their slave labor, prisoners are given “vocational training.” Yet the workplace conditions are often appalling, and the transfer of skills to the private sector is dubious. UNICOR operates many call centers. “When you call a company or government agency for help, there’s a good chance the person on the other end of the line is a prison inmate,” NBC News reports. In the first half of 2016, UNICOR generated $231 million in sales. Since 2014, UNICOR has focused on employing prisoners within two years of release; in 2015, 24 percent of the Bureau of Prisons population was that close to release, and UNICOR’s workforce was approximately 30,000. The workers produce about 175 different types of products and services, including clothing and textiles, electronics, fleet management and vehicular components, industrial products, office furniture, recycling activities, and services including data entry and encoding. Prison slavery: Prisoners are driven to work in the fields of another former plantation in Texas, now a prison known as the Ellis Unit. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project Another expendable prison worker – or slave – Danny Lyon dies of heat exhaustion at the Ellis Unit in Texas in 1942. According to Prison Policy Initiative, UNICOR pays from 23 cents to $1.15 per hour. Workers in state prisons make an average of 59 cents an hour. Prisoners in two state, Georgia and Texas, are paid nothing at all. A 1977 Supreme Court decision made it illegal for prisoners to form labor unions. So I ask you, if UNICOR in federal prisons and the state prison systems are supposed to be about vocational training and reentry into society, why are prisoners making under $2 an hour? Why aren’t they at least making minimum wage with that money put away in an account to be there upon their release along with other earned incentives? The answer: That would be a service to humanity and a service to humanity would be a blow to capitalism. The cheapest way is the best way. Cheap and free labor keeps capitalists’ bellies fat and pockets full while we the people starve and stay broke and live off of crumbs like, you know, slaves. That is the way the system of slavery works. Get it? Got it? Good. Lastly, I must mention Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). CCA owns and manages private prisons and detention centers. One of its founders is Thomas W. Beasley, a leader in the Republican Party. It received its initial investment in 1983 from Hospital Corporation of America founder Jack C. Massey, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Vanderbilt University. As of 2015, the company is the largest private corrections company in the United States. It manages more than 65 correctional and detention facilities with a capacity of more than 90,000 beds in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s revenue in 2012 exceeded $1.7 billion, according to Wikipedia. “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S. Rubenstein, quotes Prudential Securities saying about CCA: “It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs. Low occupancy is a drag on profits … Company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate.” Angola, Louisiana’s largest prison, is an 18,000-acre former slave plantation, worked today by enslaved prisoners who are the descendants of the slaves who worked it before the Civil War. CCA’s prime objective is to KEEP THE PRISON FULL! They are needing you to be there. You are to be locked behind bars. This is the goal. This is the mandate. In 2012, CCA sent a letter to prison officials in 48 states, offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a 20-year management contract and a guaranteed occupancy rate of 90 percent. Community organizations have criticized the proposals, arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to 90 percent occupancy is poor public policy that could force communities into creating criminals, writes Chris Kirkham in “With States Facing Shortfalls, Private Corporation Offers Cash for Prisons,” a story posted Feb. 14, 2012, in the Huffington Post. THE RALLY CRY IS KEEP PRISONS FULL – maintaining and increasing mass incarceration. So I urge you to not only open your ears and your eyes, but I urge you to open your mouths and use your hands and your legs and all of your might to abolish the slavery-for-convicts clause by amending the 13th Amendment. I beg of you, if you have any sense of right from wrong, to challenge this system and bring an end to slavery once and for all. You must get involved, and there are many things that you can do. You must support the strikers right now. They need you. They need us. You must deliver a gut busting blow to corporations like McDonald’s and continue to expose their fallacies so that people will stop buying their products and take off their mask. It is our duty. You must remember that if not you, your child and/or other loved ones will be next. Write us a letter at George Jackson University and ask about other ways you can get involved. Call and ask what’s to be done. You can very well be pulled over, forced to get out of your car, and the next thing you know you are dead or in jail. If you are imprisoned, you just may become a 2016 slave; it’s real in the field. Tim Anderson reminds us that this is “The Unites States of Incarceration.” The U.S. has a huge per capita prison population, second only to the Seychelles, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean with a total population of 92,000 which imprisons many Somali pirates. Although only 5 percent of the world’s population lives in the U.S., this country incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. Racism, drug laws, mandatory minimum sentencing and, of course, privatization of prisons all play a part. The partnership of the U.S. government with big business allows prisoners to be used as slave labor, another great incentive for filling prisons. Prison overcrowding is common. Instead of helping and rehabilitating people, the U.S. uses them for profit – another grotesque feature of a capitalist system fixated on making money over everything else. You must remember this as you go about your daily routine. Don’t be comfortable. You should be mad; you should be angry. Michael Leibowitz writes about the nature of capitalism in his book, “The Socialist Alternative: Real Human Development”: “The logic of capital generates a society in which all human values are subordinated to the search for profits. … Rather than building a cohesive and caring society, capital tears society apart. It divides workers and pits them against one another as competitors to reduce any challenge to its rule and its bottom line. Precisely because human beings and nature are mere means to capital’s goal, it destroys what Marx called the original sources of wealth – human beings and nature.” Don’t let capitalism make you into a monster. The monster of all monsters is ignoring that there is a problem. If you don’t work to eradicate these crimes against humanity and you consciously know they exist, doing nothing at all … SHAME ON YOU.

California’s “liberal” attorney general opposed reducing vastly overcrowded prisons in California for fear the state would have to pay real wages to fight its wildfires. Though extremely dangerous, firefighting is considered a premium job in California for prisoners, and most of those chosen are not people of color. - Tweet More Pocket Share on Tumblr Print Related Tags Filed Under: Prison Stories Tags: “get tough on crime” 1990s • “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print There are a number of people in the city of Austin, Texas, who are paid fulltime salaries by taxpayers to run their private union and handle its business. That, according to the Goldenwater Institute, is just wrong. “Under the Texas Constitution, the government is prohibited from spending public money for purely private purposes,” said Jon Riches, director of national litigation for the organization. “With release time, Austin taxpayers are required to foot the bill for the activities of a private union. “This is an abuse of tax dollars and violates Texas law,” he said. The conflict arose because the city and the Austin Firefighters Association, Local 875, reached an agreement for the city to pay a number of firefighters full-time salaries while they are on “release time,” also known as “association business leave,” or “union leave.” It simply allows certain firefighters to draw a full salary from the city but spend their time pursuing union work. “Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! The institute has filed a legal action challenging the practice, arguing it “violate the Texas Constitution ‘gift clause’ provision that prohibits government from giving taxpayer funds to private entities without a public purpose.” Robert Henneke, the general counsel for the Center for the American Future, said, “Allowing fulltime public employees on the government’s payroll to work for a private union at taxpayer expenses is even more egregious as the city of Austin’s proposed budget would increase taxes on all residents. “All taxpayer resources should be put into services for citizens not directed to the benefit of private entities.” The Goldwater Institute originally discovered the illegal use of taxpayer money in 2011 in the city of Phoenix and filed a lawsuit to stop it. There, police officers were collecting some $4 million a year from taxpayers in such “release time” activities. The lawsuit was successful and the practice stopped. “Since that initial discovery, the Goldwater Institute has found the practice is widespread across the country, including in federal government contracts. For example, while some military veterans wait an average of 115 days to get an initial appointment with their primary care provider, the Veterans Administration spends over $40 million a year on release time for VA employees,” the organization reported. “When release time contract provisions are added up across the country, taxpayers spend over a billion dollars each year to pay government workers to clock in at the union desk, not to do the government work they were hired to do.” Several states now have introduced bans on the practice. The Austin deal allows the president of the local union to use up to 2,080 hours of release time per year. At 40 hours of work per week, that’s 52 weeks, meaning that person can essentially be a full-time worker for the union, at taxpayer expenses. It allows the union to consume up to 6,600 hours a year, for all officials to be paid by taxpayers while doing union work. “A payment by a political subdivision, including a municipality, of the state of Texas is proper under the Gift Clause only if: first, the expenditure serves a public purpose, and second, the expenditure affords a clear public benefit in return.” The union, however, is not required to provide “any direct benefits” to the city in return for the subsidy. In a description the legal team explained: “Imagine if your city council contacted a local Walmart and offered them fulltime city employees to use however Walmart wished – as checkout clerks, greeters, stockers. Walmart makes the decision, and the employees wear Walmart uniforms, report to Walmart management, and work for Walmart’s benefit. “But the city claims that they’re still city employees, and pays them salaries out of the government’s treasury, including full taxpayer-funded benefits, and fringe benefits including guaranteed pensions.” That is what the city is doing, the team explained. The case is pending in Travis County District Court. “Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution.

ESPN 0 0 0 The Wow Factor Few could have guessed that the league's return would become so bloody, bitter and, most of all, emblematic of how power in the NFL truly works. ESPN The Magazine & Outside The Lines by Seth Wickersham and Don Van Natta Jr.ILLUSTRATION BY LINCOLN AGNEW 02/11/16 O n West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, an overgrown tree obscures a whitewashed, two-story building sandwiched between a radio station and a studio lot. Inside, it's a time warp. The battered carpet is blue, and the rippled wallpaper is bubbling, peeling off. Behind glass is a showcase of dull trophies and yellowed photos from another era. Everything is labeled "Los Angeles Rams." That team, of course, left LA, its home for nearly half a century, for St. Louis after the 1994 season. But on most days since, this nondescript office has remained open, staffed by two people: John Shaw, the former team president who engineered the franchise's flight from Anaheim to St. Louis, and his secretary. They work in this nearly invisible team outpost, as if the Rams never left. One NFL owner called the meeting a "s--- show." A "nightmare," another said. Yet another described it as "the most contentious and polarizing" in decades. On Dec. 2 at the Four Seasons in Irving, Texas, the owners-only meeting had a single agenda item: Which team or teams should be allowed to relocate to Los Angeles? The inability of America's most popular sport to occupy the nation's second-largest market since the Rams and Raiders left after the 1994 season had become a running joke. In the past two decades, at least 20 Los Angeles stadium proposals had been designed and junked. An expansion team had been awarded to LA in 1999 but then, mired in red tape, sent to Houston to become the Texans. Many clubs had used the threat of moving to Los Angeles as leverage to build new, publicly financed stadiums. But now, the idea of at least one franchise relocating to LA wasn't just a fanciful notion. It was real. More ESPN Mag Torre: Curry's best worst ankles in sports Subscribe to The Mag One proposal was for Stan Kroenke, owner of the St. Louis Rams, to build the world's most expensive stadium, a $2.7 billion, 80,000-seat roofed venue in Inglewood, just east of Los Angeles International Airport. The other proposal was for the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders, owned by Dean Spanos and Mark Davis, to share a $1.8 billion, 65,000-seat open-air stadium in Carson, a city about 12 miles south of Los Angeles. Most owners meetings are boring. Some members doze. Groupthink often prevails. Not this time. For hours, the owners argued and traded barbs. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson spoke in support of Kroenke four times, to the annoyance of others waiting to be heard just once. Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross joked that the league should hold an auction for the right to relocate, though some owners thought he was serious. Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson argued that Spanos, a beloved owner who for more than a decade had tried to build a new stadium in San Diego, deserved the market. Others insisted that Kroenke had the land and the money not just to build a spectacular football venue rivaling Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, but to return to Los Angeles with a transcendent "football campus," as an owner later put it, with a shopping mall, movie theater, office complex and luxury apartments. The project, to be mostly paid in full by Kroenke, had the "wow factor," Jones liked to say. The dueling proposals did not only represent the NFL's most recent, best opportunity to return to Los Angeles. They had also become the centerpiece of a chaotic power struggle among the league's 32 owners, between the so-called new-money group, with members who all supported Inglewood, and the old guard, most of whom favored Carson. Going into the meeting, most believed Carson had more votes. But one moment, many would later recall, seemed to halt its momentum. Michael Bidwill, president of the Cardinals and a Carson supporter, argued that the NFL doesn't exist just to make rich owners richer. Owners needed to consider what would be best for the league, and ... Jones cut him off: "When you guys moved the team from St. Louis to Phoenix -- it wasn't about the money?" As Bidwill tried to answer, Jones moved in for the kill: "You did it for the money." LA Story: How the Rams returned to Los Angeles Follow the back-channel deals and twists and turns of a battle described by owners and league executives as bruising and divisive as Don Van Natta Jr. takes you down the Rams' road back to Los Angeles.AP Photo/Jeff Roberson TWO YEARS EARLIER, on Aug. 27, 2013, Kroenke and Spanos met for a private dinner at Mastro's Steakhouse in Beverly Hills. At a corner table, the two talked cordially -- a quiet beginning to a 29-month saga that would end on Jan. 12 of this year in a Houston hotel. Back then, neither man could have guessed that the league's return to Los Angeles would become so bloody, bitter and, most of all, emblematic of how power in the NFL truly works. In contentious closed-door meetings in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, New York and, finally, Houston, owners belittled, undercut -- even bullied -- each other in ways never before witnessed, according to interviews with more than two dozen owners, league officials, team executives, lawyers and staffers involved in the relocation efforts, many of whom requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. The split between owners had as much to do with personal loyalties as it did the appeal of the two stadium proposals. The ruthlessness of Kroenke was fixed in sharp relief against the abidance of Spanos. The savvy of Jones, who led the new-money Inglewood supporters, clashed with the brute force of Richardson, leader of the old-money Carson backers. Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company -- which owns ESPN -- was enlisted to run the Carson project, with the hope that his star power could offset Kroenke's money. It wasn't enough. In the end, no owner would feel more pain than Spanos, the league loyalist who did everything his peers asked of him -- only to be forced to work out a face-saving partnership with the man who had beaten him to LA, a process that likely won't be resolved until 2017. If you want to do it right, you have to step up. - Jerry Jones, endorsing Stan Kroenke's vision Spanos and Kroenke had long targeted Los Angeles as the best, most attractive option for relocation of their respective teams. Their peers viewed them as being on opposite sides of the ownership spectrum. Now 68 years old, Kroenke -- tall and thin with a thick mustache -- was a largely quiet partner who rarely attended owners meetings and had little patience for the league's glacial-paced relocation process. He has made much of his estimated net worth of $7.6 billion in real estate and bought several sports teams, including the Avalanche and the Nuggets. After his 2011 majority stake purchase of the English Premier League team Arsenal, Kroenke had pined for the larger international presence that other owners envisioned for the NFL's global future. With thinning brown hair and rimmed glasses, Spanos was deeply involved in league matters, "loyal to a fault," in the words of a close friend. Now 65, he ran the team owned by his 92-year-old father, Alex Spanos. The NFL was his primary business, even if many owners wondered whether he possessed the sharp elbows of his father. At Mastro's, the two men met to determine whether they might have a shared vision for Los Angeles. Kroenke was enthusiastic about a 60-acre tract of land in Inglewood, nestled between the Forum and the soon-to-be-closed Hollywood Park racetrack. Earlier in the year, Kroenke had driven around the site at 5:30 a.m. and raved about its potential to Rams chief operating officer Kevin Demoff and to Jones. Spanos, though, was cool on the Inglewood location, citing concerns about parking and traffic. Still, both men, and their associates, saw the convivial dinner as a promising first step toward a potential partnership. They agreed to be in touch. But after the dinner, Spanos called Kroenke several times. Kroenke never returned any of the calls. Despite Spanos' reservations, the Inglewood land -- owned at the time by Wal-Mart, the family business of Kroenke's wife, Ann Walton Kroenke -- still intrigued Kroenke. At the time, it was being sold in a blind auction. Without any warning to Spanos, a company set up by Kroenke, Pincay RE LLC, offered $90 million, outbidding everyone -- including NFL executive Eric Grubman, who later would become the league's point man on the relocation process. Nobody knew whether Grubman had bid on his own or on behalf of the league or some other buyer. But Kroenke's purchase -- and his later deal for an adjacent 238 acres -- was a precursor of what would become the dominant theme of the NFL's return to Los Angeles: Stan Kroenke would not be stopped. Raiders owner Mark Davis (left) and Chargers owner Dean Spanos (right) were outflanked by Kroenke. Lincoln Agnew NOBODY KNEW IT at the time, but the league office had already lost control of the Los Angeles relocation process. Commissioner Roger Goodell's mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic violence discipline in the summer and autumn of 2014 distracted him from executing the league's longtime goal of returning to LA and severely weakened his standing in ownership circles. Meetings about LA that were scheduled for September were pushed to November. The distractions also created a power vacuum that Grubman -- and other owners -- eagerly filled. Spanos reacted to Kroenke's Inglewood purchase by proposing to buy a 168-acre landfill lot in Carson. He and his team had designed a creative development method, based on a landmark California Supreme Court decision a few months earlier, that would expedite the arduous process of entitling a stadium to a city council vote, overcoming legal hurdles that often take years to clear. At a meeting in Los Angeles in mid-November 2014, the Chargers leaders presented their plan to Grubman, who some owners and executives suspected favored Kroenke and Inglewood. Both proposals were rolling forward. And then, all of a sudden, they weren't. Later in November, several owners who would serve on the league's LA committee told Kroenke no team would be moving for the 2015 season -- owing, in part, to Goodell's weakened leadership. In mid-December, on the eve of an important Carson City Council stadium meeting, Art Rooney II of the Steelers delivered the same message to Spanos, telling him to "stand down." Spanos complied. But Kroenke, who was well-versed in relocation politics after he had helped move the Rams to St. Louis as a minority owner after the 1994 season, told a few owners that he would play one more season in St. Louis but would exercise his right to relocate in 2015 -- "when the window is open," he told associates. Some took Kroenke's declaration as a veiled threat to sue if anyone tried to block him; others understood that he had paid a fortune for the land and wanted to move forward. Jerry Jones, who once played himself on an episode of Entourage brokering the NFL's return to LA, implored Kroenke to "just go" and not wait for the league's sluggish bureaucracy. And so on Jan. 5, 2015, Kroenke unveiled plans to build his Inglewood stadium, all but announcing a move to Los Angeles. Spanos and his associates not only were furious that Kroenke had beaten them out of the gate but were also deeply suspicious of Kroenke's plan to fast-track the entitlement process. It was the exact process they'd presented to Grubman. The Chargers suspected that Grubman had alerted the Rams to it; the Rams insisted that their own California-based development company knew about it. Either way, it didn't matter. Carson was behind. While St. Louis fans cursed Kroenke, LA fans rallied for him and then cheered his return. AP Photo/Richard Vogel STAY IN THE GAME. If we're not in the game, we get nothing. Stay in the game. That's what the Chargers executives kept telling each other. Kroenke had land, money and, most of all, the shrewdness required to relocate. He was willing to sacrifice his relationship with Rams fans and with the state in which he was raised -- something that Spanos, for all of his fights with San Diego politicians, seemed reluctant to do. Spanos needed help. So Richardson suggested that he partner with Mark Davis on the Carson project. For years, the Chargers and Raiders, both of whom play in baseball venues built in the 1960s, had failed to persuade their communities to help offset the costs of new football-only stadiums. If two teams moved together, Richardson said, it would help solve the league's "California dilemma," as owners called it. Most owners liked the eccentric Davis, now 60, even if they knew him only as the quiet guy with the bowl cut who had pushed his father Al's wheelchair through hotel lobbies at league meetings. Still, many wondered whether Davis, who never had an official job with the Raiders until he assumed control of the team after his father's death in 2011, was up to the challenge of shepherding a stadium project alone. He had turned down many offers to partner with the 49ers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, and for years, the Davis family had resisted offers to buy the team and move it south. During one such lunch meeting in 2010, two Los Angeles businessmen pitched a lowball offer to Al Davis, who started laughing. "F--- you," he told them. "Get the hell out of here." And he went back to eating his lunch. So on Feb. 19, 2015, six weeks after Kroenke's Inglewood announcement, the Raiders and Chargers proposed their Carson project, a football-only venue, unlike the epicenter planned for Inglewood, and financed mostly by Goldman Sachs. Looking back now, some around the league wish that Goodell had locked the three owners in a room and forced them to cut a deal right then, avoiding the battles and hurt feelings that would unfold. Instead, Goodell allowed the NFL's messy form of democracy to run its course, appearing strangely detached in meetings. He said almost nothing while Grubman, who, like Goodell, declined to comment for this story, appeared to be too close to Kroenke; some involved in the process said they had expected Grubman to be strictly neutral. The disjointed process was leading to discontent among owners, at a time when, with football's long-term future a constant topic of debate, solidarity was needed. The stage was now set for a showdown. On Aug. 11, 2015, the league's owners convened at the Hyatt Regency, in a Chicago suburb, for a special LA meeting. For the first time, both sides presented their proposals. When you guys moved the team from St. Louis to Phoenix -- it wasn't about the money?" As Bidwill tried to answer, Jones moved in for the kill: "You did it for the money. - Jerry Jones to Michael Bidwill, president of the Arizona Cardinals The Carson team went first. During its presentation, Grubman paced in the back of the conference room, drinking coffee. The Rams contingent went next. Grubman moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the commissioner's table. The presenters showed off a model of their football oasis, and Mark Davis stared at it in awe. Saints owner Tom Benson posed the first question about Inglewood, asking why owners should defray the costs of the extra real estate developments -- up to $200 million in league loans available for new stadiums -- that would benefit only Kroenke. But before Kroenke and Demoff could say a word, Grubman jumped in to answer the question, explaining that Benson misunderstood the amount of money the league would contribute. The pro-Carson owners couldn't believe that a league official appeared to be speaking on behalf of the Rams' proposal. That moment, along with persistent rumors that Grubman wanted to work for Kroenke in Los Angeles, cemented in the minds of some owners that he was an agent for Inglewood. Later in the meeting, Bears chairman George McCaskey asked whether Kroenke would be willing to share the stadium with a second team. Kroenke reminded the owners of a 2012 memo from Goodell that mandated that any LA stadium be built to house two teams. Kroenke said he could quickly draw up a lease if necessary. Some of the owners on the NFL's six-person Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities -- Richardson, Rooney, John Mara of the Giants, Robert Kraft of the Patriots, Clark Hunt of the Chiefs and Bob McNair of the Texans, most of whom were considered the old guard and supported Carson -- were offended. Spanos' family had always put the league first, and now Kroenke had declared that if it were necessary to take on a second team, the Chargers would be relegated to a tenant, junior-partner status. Kroenke considered his invitation to be sincere. He had extended a hand as far as he could, given the agreement between Spanos and Davis for Carson. Before the meeting ended, Jones, as would be his habit, took control. He delivered a rollicking, profanity-laced eight-minute endorsement of Kroenke's monumental vision, saying in his Arkansas drawl that whichever owner returned to Los Angeles, he needed to have "big balls." It was awkward and hilarious. Everyone, including Kroenke, tried not to laugh. But it was also a welcomed sentiment for the new-money owners such as Dan Snyder of the Redskins and Jeffrey Lurie of the Eagles, who backed Inglewood. "If you want to do it right," Jones continued, "you have to step up." With a final vote scheduled for Jan. 12, 2016, in Houston, only five months away, the Carson supporters knew they were in trouble. Making matters worse, Spanos and Davis had argued with each other about Carson earlier that day in front of other owners. Still, Jones sensed Spanos had enough support to prevent Kroenke from going to Los Angeles alone. After the meeting, Jones approached Spanos on the tarmac where a handful of owners had parked their planes. "I want you in LA with Stan," Jones told Spanos. Spanos was noncommittal. He had no interest in partnering with Kroenke. Meanwhile, a few old-guard owners had another idea to help their friend. If Carson was going to succeed, the project needed a star.

SHORTLY BEFORE THE Chicago meetings, Bob Iger received a call from Jerry Richardson. The Panthers' owner wanted to meet the Disney CEO, but Richardson didn't identify the topic -- only that the sit-down should be conducted under strict secrecy. An Iger confidant suggested that Richardson was inquiring about his interest in perhaps replacing the wounded Goodell, but Iger suspected otherwise. After all, a year earlier both Goodell and Kraft had asked Iger whether he'd be interested in getting involved in a team that could move to LA, tapping into his local expertise and gravitas. The topic came up again in April when Iger ran into Mark Davis at a Clippers game, a meeting that led to a few discussions about Iger buying a share of the Raiders. And so when Iger and Richardson met on Aug. 5 for two hours in Iger's office in Burbank, Richardson asked Iger about the market. One team or two? Carson or Inglewood? They agreed to stay in touch. Over the next few days, Iger researched the Carson site online, noting its proximity to a cross-section of freeways. Richardson and Iger met two more times, talked often on the phone and traded email. Iger liked the fact that Carson would be an open-air stadium, unlike the roofed one Kroenke wanted to build. He also preferred parking lots rather than the garages proposed at Inglewood that would limit tailgating and make game-day traffic a mess. "This is great," Iger told Richardson. It was exactly what Richardson wanted to hear. So he asked whether Iger would be willing to talk with Spanos and Davis about it. In early October, Iger met with Spanos at the Shutters hotel in Santa Monica. A month later, Disney's board of directors approved Iger's involvement. On Nov. 11, it was announced that Iger had become the nonexecutive chairman of Carson Holdings, the joint venture between the Chargers and Raiders, with an option to become a minority owner of one of the franchises after the stadium was completed. Goodell, who privately preferred the Inglewood site but had pledged to remain neutral, told a friend that Iger's involvement was a potential "game changer" for Carson. Having helped negotiate billions of dollars of rights contracts with the NFL, Iger and some of the owners were acquaintances. He knew how the league worked. Many owners who had considered Kroenke to be a Los Angeles lock worried that now he might lose. By The Numbers Carson Manica Boss Alex Spanos, Dean Spanos and family, Chargers owners, net worth $1.689 billion, and Raiders owner Mark Davis, net worth $500 million.

OWNERS AND EXECUTIVES say the following weeks were among the wildest they had seen. They called and texted each other daily with sales pitches, demands and gossip. Almost nothing was out of bounds. Some Carson supporters weighed ways to try to jam up Kroenke, such as forcing him to pay the entire $550 million relocation fee up front while giving Spanos and Davis a payment plan. Undecided owners considered the price of their vote, whether it was changing their division and conference alignment, horse-trading a vote for a promise of future support for an ownership succession plan or a new stadium of their own. Others were convinced that some owners didn't even know where Carson and Inglewood were located. "Owners were all over the place," one team executive says. By most estimates, Carson had managed to cobble together 18 votes, shy of the 24 required for relocation. The Rams moving alone to Inglewood had only about seven votes. Many owners thought Kroenke was hell-bent on trying to reach nine, just enough to prevent the Carson project from reaching 24 votes and keeping him in the game. The silent majority preferred the Inglewood site but liked Spanos better than Kroenke. Most owners wanted to avoid a Raiders return to Los Angeles, owing to Al Davis' burned bridges and the co-opting of the team apparel by gangs, concerns so deep that some wouldn't even consider Carson. "It's hard to get owners to move," Iger says now. "Each one is a boss in his own right." And so the battle for Los Angeles became a battle between Richardson and Jones, two Jerrys with dueling powers of persuasion. Jones mostly worked the phones, trying to broker a partnership for the Rams and Chargers in Inglewood. On Nov. 27, Kroenke wrote a letter pledging to allow a partner, though it would not extend to the stadium's design or the surrounding development. It was a major concession, encouraged by Jones after calculating that Kroenke likely wasn't going to get 24 votes on his own. Spanos and Davis still refused to consider it, but Jones continued to push for support, convinced that the membership silently preferred it. Richardson flew his private plane to visit several owners. Everyone around the league called it the Jerry Tour. He insisted that Carson was the better site and that the league not only would regret leaving St. Louis for a second time but would set an awful precedent by turning away the estimated $477 million in public funds for a new stadium that the state of Missouri was poised to offer. At times, Richardson's hard-charging style, delivered with a threatening tone and citing favors he had done for them, offended some owners. "He bullied people," a team executive says. "Some were turned off by his forcefulness." It was clear that the owners were playing by their own rules -- and, as a league insider working with all three teams later said, "They make up the rules as they go." A news report said that the league would pledge an extra $100 million to help St. Louis finance a new $1.1 billion riverfront stadium -- a move that McNair, the Texans' owner and a Carson supporter, predicted would prevent the Rams from meeting the league's relocation guidelines. But days later, Goodell wrote a letter saying that the $100 million would not be available. And the night before St. Louis voted on the stadium package, Grubman called in to the show of local radio host Bernie Miklasz to describe St. Louis' new stadium proposal as "suboptimal" and say that Kroenke was "going to keep his options open." It seemed to validate what many had long suspected: He wanted the Rams to move. It was chaos. The spectacle of NFL leaders undercutting St. Louis' attempt to keep the Rams, and the uncertainty in San Diego and Oakland, was becoming another public-relations disaster. Goodell privately expressed frustration about all three owners -- if they were elite, they wouldn't be trying to relocate in the first place, he told a friend -- but in the end, the commissioner supported their efforts to leave. A few days after all three teams filed for relocation, Goodell issued a 147-page report that called the efforts of all three markets to keep their respective teams "unsatisfactory and inadequate." It was an official green light for all of them to move, knowing that at least one team would be forced to crawl back home. Soon news broke that Kroenke would build a stadium in Inglewood no matter how the owners voted, a charge the mayor of Inglewood denied but some around the league believed to be true. Many Kroenke supporters were furious that he would risk alienating owners so close to a vote. "There it is," said one executive of a pro-Inglewood team. "A big middle finger to the league." All three teams privately vowed to abide by the membership's vote, and each of the three owners had to sign an agreement pledging not to sue if his relocation proposal was rejected. But by then the LA derby had become an open war, beyond anyone's control. Before a late-season AFC game, two owners met in a luxury box and wondered how the LA vote would turn out in Houston. "I don't know," one owner told the other. "Stan is more interested in blocking Dean than he is in finding 24 votes." News would eventually break that Kroenke planned to build a stadium in Inglewood no matter how the owners voted. Ted Soqui/Corbis PROGNOSTICATIONS DEPENDED ON which Houston restaurant you happened to be having dinner at on Jan. 11, the night before the final meeting. Those at Vallone's steakhouse across the street from the Westin hotel, the venue for the owners meeting, mostly predicted the Rams and Chargers would end up in Inglewood. Those at a private room at Eddie V's Prime Seafood felt certain Carson would prevail. If Iger could assuage the antipathy toward the Raiders and get 20 votes, and if the LA committee voted for Carson, the rest of the votes would fall in line -- or, worst case, a final vote would be delayed until the Super Bowl. At 10 p.m., the Chargers and Raiders received a curious email from league officials: a proposal for one of the two teams to share Inglewood with the Rams. It was a modified version of a resolution Jones had submitted the previous weekend, calling for the Rams and Chargers to share Inglewood. Spanos and his associates were offended. The eleventh-hour email suggested that before the owners voted, the league was laying the groundwork for its own solution. At 9 the next morning, 32 owners -- or, in a handful of cases, their representatives -- entered the Azalea Ballroom on the Westin's fourth floor. Each person settled into a large leather chair for a session that league officials had warned could take two days, though the owners nearly all hoped to get out of town that evening and pocket their share of the relocation fees, $17.7 million or $35.5 million, depending on whether one or two teams moved. The Rams won a coin flip and presented first. Over 35 minutes, Demoff offered details about how a potential partnership would work, showing how the stadium would use digitized screens to show the logos, sponsors and Ring of Fame for either team, solving the dual-branding problem. It was a big reversal for Kroenke, but many owners found it to be sincere and attractive and, most of all, exactly what they wanted to hear. On behalf of Carson, Iger went next. He tried to "break the ice," he says now, with a joke about how in his 42 years at ABC and Disney, he had paid more money to the NFL than anyone else. The quip was met with blank stares. For about 20 minutes, Iger spoke with a slideshow behind him, then ended with another prepared line, a spin-off of the famous commercial of the Super Bowl MVP shouting, "I'm going to Disney World!" "I hope I'm going to the NFL!" Iger said. Again, silence. After Iger left the ballroom and returned to his suite, Jones said, "He said he paid us. Last time I checked, that money is coming from Disney shareholders, not him." The message was unmistakable: NFL owners listen only to each other. The owners first voted on whether to opt for a secret ballot, a rarely used method some owners had quietly requested back in August. It won, 19-13. Then the owners moved to a debate period. Paul Allen of the Seahawks opened the discussion by asking everyone to forget about the teams and the personalities involved and ask, What's the best site? Let's work backward from there. One owner then reminded everyone that Carson "is literally a dump." Still, the Los Angeles committee recommended Carson by a 5-1 vote, with only Hunt dissenting. A committee vote is usually a reliable predictor of the full ownership's vote. And so, during a lunch break, some owners were so certain that Carson would win that they checked out of their rooms. Luggage embroidered with team logos filled the Westin's lobby. Two rows of black SUVs idled outside the hotel, ready to go to a nearby private airport. The Dec. 17 game against Tampa Bay would be the Rams' last game in St. Louis. AP Photo/L.G. Patterson Initially, four resolutions were going to be considered for a vote. But Steve Bisciotti, the Ravens' owner, argued that the proposals conflicted with one another. And so the owners agreed to consider only two: the Rams-Chargers to Inglewood and Chargers-Raiders in Carson, pitting a version of Jerry Jones' proposal against Carson. When the first secret ballot for relocation was tallied, the Rams-Chargers in Inglewood won by a whopping 21-11 vote. The Carson team was stunned. It was all but over. The membership essentially had ordered Spanos to work out a deal with Kroenke, leaving him little leverage: become a tenant, try to negotiate the terms of a broader Inglewood partnership or return to San Diego hat in hand. Goodell, Grubman, the Los Angeles committee owners and members from the Carson team huddled in a private meeting area to hammer out a resolution. The mood was somber. Kraft, Hunt, McNair and Mara led the negotiations; Goodell mostly listened. Rooney and Richardson were quiet, even "despondent," one meeting participant says, angry on Spanos' behalf and frustrated that their recommendation was ignored. "These are proud people," the participant says. "It was a slap in their faces." Roughly four hours later, the league announced that the owners, by a vote of 30-2, had approved the Rams for immediate relocation to Inglewood, with the Chargers having a yearlong option to join them. If the Chargers didn't exercise the option, the Raiders would have a year to join the Rams in Inglewood. The Chargers and Raiders would receive $100 million extra from the league to help defray the cost of a new stadium if they remained in their current markets. Shortly after, Goodell, Kroenke, Spanos, Davis and a few others held a news conference. Kroenke and Spanos stood apart from each other. Nobody looked happy. Goodell spoke first. When he announced that the Rams had won the right to relocate, Spanos closed his eyes and breathed deeply and loudly, as if preparing to speak at a funeral. When Goodell said that the Chargers had the option to join the Rams, Spanos closed his eyes and sighed again. Calling the relocation "a painful process," Goodell acknowledged excitement but also disappointment that "we weren't able to get it done for our fans in St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland." Spanos read a short statement that he would continue to explore his options and took questions. "This has really been excruciating for everyone," said Spanos, who left the room shortly after as Kroenke was speaking. A historic moment, two decades in the making, signaled stark bitterness rather than elation. In the lobby of the Westin after the news conference, Jerry Jones exited an elevator, carrying a nearly empty glass of whiskey, looking both energized and relieved. Though he deeply believed that the vote reflected the league's best interest, Jones had engineered the defeat of one of the most beloved owners by one of the shrewdest. A few feet away at the hotel bar, some owners took turns consoling Spanos. He felt as if he'd been stabbed in the back. Someone suggested that he should pull a Kroenke and move to Carson anyway. Spanos didn't want to hear it. A few weeks later, Kroenke would announce that he had reached an agreement to partner with the Chargers in Inglewood. On the same day, Spanos said his team would stay in San Diego for the 2016 season, adding, "I hope for the long term in a new stadium." In a referendum this November, Spanos will ask San Diego voters to approve hundreds of millions in public money for a new stadium, a long shot. This gambit all but assures that the ugly process, and uncertainty hanging over two NFL cities in California with old stadiums, will continue at least another year. Jones, though, was unapologetically proud. He had helped at least double the Rams' franchise value, ranked at a league-low $930 million in 2014 by Forbes, and had given Spanos the chance to increase the value of the Chargers if he chose to move to Inglewood. The race for LA was always a race for money, and so it ended the only way it could. "Stan is a tremendous asset for the NFL," Jones said. "He's God-sent, really." A few hours later, at Vallone's steakhouse, Jones, Kroenke and a handful of associates held court. It was nearly 1 a.m., and they had an entire section of the restaurant to themselves. Kroenke's move, which in some ways began with a steak dinner with Spanos in 2013, was ending with another. Every five minutes or so, Jones would stop the conversation, raise his glass and say, "The Los Angeles Rams," as if none of them could quite believe it. THE DAY AFTER the vote, the dusty, dated office of the Los Angeles Rams on West Pico was alive for the first time in years. Spread out on desks were newspapers announcing the Rams' return. The phone was buzzing. John Shaw, the former president, was at his desk, chatting with a friend. His secretary read headlines out loud. "They're coming to Inglewood," she said, still in disbelief. On the office's front door, someone had posted a yellow note: "Welcome back!" Don Van Natta Jr.Van Natta is a senior writer for ESPN Digital and Print Media.

Firefighters work to extinguish the blaze at the Tampaco Foils Ltd. packaging factory in an industrial district outside Dhaka. Photo: A.M. Ahad, Associated Press Blast kills 23 at Bangladesh packaging plant 1 / 1 Back to Gallery NEW DELHI — A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh’s capital on Saturday, killing at least 23 workers and injuring dozens, officials said. Fire officials said that the explosion at the five-story Tampaco Foils Ltd. factory in the Tongi industrial area outside Dhaka was huge, and that the blaze triggered by the blast spread quickly because flammable chemicals were stored at the factory. At least six of the 14 people being treated for burns at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bacchu Mia, a police official at the hospital. He confirmed that at least 23 people had died. Local TV stations said about 50 people were injured in all. Television footage showed smoke billowing from the factory, with the fire engulfing part of the upper floors. Factory safety is a major concern in Bangladesh, which has thousands of garment and packaging plants that supply products to global chains like Walmart and H&M. A fire at a garment factory in a Dhaka suburb killed 112 workers in 2012. In 2013, a commercial complex near Dhaka housing five garment factories collapsed, killing 1,135 people, Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster. It took firefighters nearly five hours to bring Saturday’s blaze under control. Huge piles of burned materials and chemicals had to be removed from the building to prevent the fire from spreading, officials said. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which occurred around 6 a.m. Authorities have ordered an investigation. Syed Mokbul Hossain, the owner of the Tampaco Foils factory, told the Prothom Alo daily that he was not sure when the boiler was last inspected. He said around 75 people had been scheduled to work the overnight shift, which was to end at 7 a.m. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The Habitant bar at Nordstrom in Toronto’s Eaton Centre. The department store opens Sept. 16.  (Bernard Weil / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Francine KopunBusiness reporter Sat., Sept. 10, 2016 It will have a casual cocktail lounge, a men’s clubhouse, a playhouse for children, an espresso bar, a full-service licensed restaurant and, oh yes, Nordstrom will also sell clothes and shoes and accessories when it opens inside its Toronto Eaton Centre location on Friday. Launching this store at a time of turmoil in the apparel industry, the Seattle-based retailer is betting that a suite of lavish services — including the restaurant and bars; a 24-hour emergency shopping service; personal stylists; and a small army of cosmetics experts — will be a hit with shoppers who are proving increasingly distracted and harder to persuade when it comes to spending money on the things they wear and carry. The new store — the first Nordstrom in the GTA — has been carefully laid out across 220,000 square feet on three floors at the north end of Eaton Centre, in part of a space once moored by the failed Eaton department store chain and vacated by a struggling and grateful Sears Canada in exchange for cash from mall operator Cadillac Fairview. The space has been transformed into a fresh, bright, slate, with natural light from windows overlooking Yonge Street. It has been carefully curated with goods ranging from Nordstrom’s own private-label clothing and accessories to frothy designer creations with equally frothy price tags. But while Nordstrom is often cited as a luxury retailer, prices are in fact accessible to a wider range of consumers — including people just joining the workforce and moms who don’t mind paying $50 for a private-label tote bag that can run into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars under a designer label. Article Continued Below It will be the fourth Nordstrom store to open in Canada and the second largest, after the Vancouver location. A fifth is set to open at Yorkdale on Oct. 21, and a sixth is set for Sherway Gardens in the fall of 2017. Five Nordstrom Rack locations have also been announced. “We’re happy with the way they’re going. They’re doing well, but by no means do we think we have it all figured out,” said Todd Buntin, Nordstrom CF Eaton Centre store manager, during a media tour of the TEC store on Wednesday. Whether Nordstrom will ultimately succeed with its model in Canada requires a longer time frame than the two years since the first store opened in Calgary, and will depend on a number of economic factors, but adding restaurants and bars to the mix is being met positively by some analysts. ▶ American retailer Nordstrom opens its first Canadian store in Calgary with shoppers lining up for hours.(Todd Korol for the Toronto Star) “There is a tight correlation between the number of minutes or hours a consumer spends in a store and how much they buy and how loyal they are to a store,” said Merril Mascarenhas, managing partner at Arcus Consulting Group. “People who hang around a long time actually buy stuff because they feel guilty.” He cites Ikea as an example of a retailer that has successfully used the restaurant concept to build traffic, sales and loyalty — many shoppers breakfast at Ikea and then shop, or shop and pause for a lunch of Swedish meatballs. Perhaps ironically, offering shoppers a place where they can meet and eat and shop is a return to old “Main Street” culture, said Mascarenhas. “Most interactions have become too transactional, whether they are in the workplace or online. Emotion has been stripped out of a lot of those transactions.” Creating a place where people can meet and interact with others brings the emotive reasons for shopping back into play. The concept has been put to use by Restoration Hardware in the U.S., which opened a restaurant inside a Chicago store just before Christmas in 2015. Three months later, CEO Gary Friedman was able to say it was on track to becoming a $5 million (U.S.) a year business for the company, and more restaurant locations were being considered. “They have this beautiful café on the ground floor with a big, open atrium. We were going to eat there at lunch and they had a three-hour wait,” said Maureen Atkinson, of J.C. Williams Group, a global retail consultancy, who visited the location. “I was laughing because I saw these people wandering around the store with a glass of wine and the stuff is really expensive. Can you imaging getting home from your foray in the afternoon thinking: ‘Oh my god, what did I just do? I just spent a fortune on furniture.’ “For a store like Nordstrom, which is a very pleasant store to be in, it makes a lot of sense . . . It is a trend I think we’ll see more of.” Getting more people in the door isn’t a magic bullet. The Runnymede Chapters store was closed in 2014 even though it had become a neighbourhood meeting place, because the visits weren’t translating into enough sales to support an upcoming rent increase. Then again, that store didn’t sell alcohol. The latest statistics underpinning the sector aren’t all that encouraging for upscale apparel retailers. Overall sales of women’s clothing and accessories grew by a threadbare 0.5 per cent between June 2015 and June 2016, according to Statistics Canada, while men’s clothing fell by 0.1 per cent during the same period. Footwear sales rose two percent. Meanwhile, sales of home electronics, including cameras and computers, were up 6.5 per cent. A recent report by Randy Harris, president of the apparel industry newsletter Trendex, concluded that department stores in Canada are continuing to lose market share and currently account for only six per cent of Canadian retail apparel sales. Walmart was Canada’s largest retailer of apparel in 2015, according to Harris. H&M is the country’s fastest growing major apparel specialty store. And at the higher end, while the market for personal luxury goods in Canada is in good shape, the sector found itself challenged globally in 2015 by heavy discounting at department stores, the Paris terrorist attacks, which affected tourism, and setbacks in Asian markets, according to a report by Bain & Company, issued in May. “The luxury market is stuck in a holding pattern for the foreseeable future,” said Claudia D’Arpizio, lead author of the study, predicting continued, measured growth of 2 to 3 per cent through 2020. Nordstrom was not unaffected by the trend, posting poor earnings after the holiday season, but an unexpected improvement in the second quarter sent its stock price soaring. Critics, however, pointed to an increase in discount sales, including sales at Nordstrom Rack stores, as an important underlying factor — not a good sign for a retailer that trades in luxury. Mascarenhas said the value of Toronto real estate will shape the future of Nordstrom and retailers like it in the GTA. He believes that the steeply rising price of real estate has driven the economy over the past three to five years, because people feel wealthy and spend more when their home values rise, even though they may not be earning more. “Usually there is a co-relation between the wealth effect and how well retail will do,” he said. But the blistering pace of home price increases in the GTA is unsustainable, he believes, and Canadian consumers are carrying record loads of debt. If there’s a market correction, retail will suffer. “I think there is going to be a big shakeout in the market. Those that have a strong reason for being and a distinct identity, which have loyal customers with good incomes who keep their jobs, will do well.” Read more about: Nordstrom, Eaton Centre The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Sep 11, 2016 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp MasterCard faces US$18.6bn UK suit AP, LONDON MasterCard Inc is being sued for ￡14 billion (US$18.6 billion) on behalf of British consumers for allegedly charging excessive fees on millions of transactions over a 16-year period. The suit, which is the latest in a string of legal cases around the world over card companies’ fees, could bring a payout to 46 million British MasterCard users, the law firm filing says. The firm, Quinn Emanuel, says the claim is the largest in British legal history. The suit alleges that MasterCard charged stores unlawfully high fees on credit and debit card transactions between 1992 and 2008, which were passed on to consumers in the form of inflated prices for goods and services. “The filing of this claim is the first step towards consumers obtaining compensation for what MasterCard did,” said Walter Merricks, a former UK financial services ombudsman who filed the suit through Quinn Emanuel on Thursday at the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Merricks called it “a watershed moment for consumer redress in this country.” MasterCard and its larger competitor Visa Inc have been embroiled in legal battles with merchants over their fees for decades. A US$6 billion class-action lawsuit in the US, which involves merchants suing Visa and MasterCard, is being appealed in US courts. There is also a legal battle between Visa and retail giant Wal-Mart, which involves what are known as “chip and sign” transactions. Merchants have long argued that the fees that Visa, MasterCard and to a lesser degree American Express and Discover, charge to process transactions are too high. Because Visa and MasterCard have a near duopoly on credit card transaction processing in most of the world, merchants say the fees represent anti-competitive behavior. The British lawsuit follows a 2014 ruling by the EU’s highest court backing the EU’s move to scrap some fees that MasterCard allows banks to charge to merchants. MasterCard said in a statement that “we continue to firmly disagree with the basis of this claim and we intend to oppose it vigorously.” The tribunal will rule late this year whether the case can proceed, the law firm said. If so, it is expected to go to court in 2018. This story has been viewed 1471 times. Comments will be moderated.
