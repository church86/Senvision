JD.com is China's second-largest e-commerce website, with almost 200 million active users.  (Jason Lee / Reuters)   By Bloomberg Thu., Oct. 20, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores has hit the reset button on its China strategy in dramatic fashion. The world’s largest retailer is making an ambitious push into e-commerce in China and aims to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. Shoppers in select remote villages could even see their Wal-Mart products being delivered by drones as part of a pilot project by its Chinese partner, JD.com. After unsuccessful efforts to scale up its own e-commerce network, Wal-Mart launched several new initiatives this week through a tie-up with JD.com — China’s second-largest e-commerce website, with almost 200 million active users. With this partnership, Wal-Mart said it will now be able to deliver its goods, ranging from American vitamins to Japanese hand cream, to more than 90 per cent of China’s 1.4 billion consumers. “There isn’t another country in the world that represents the kind of retail growth opportunity that China does, given the growth rate of the market itself and the consumer demand here,” Chief executive officer Doug McMillon, 50, said in an interview in Beijing. “We see opportunities to partner together to provide goods to our customers, to leverage our supply chain and their digital capabilities.” Wal-Mart has a lot riding on its new online strategy aimed at getting a bigger slice of the world’s biggest e-commerce market. The retailer this month forecast that earnings will be flat the next two years while it invests in e-commerce. As it looks to China to fuel growth, cracking the Chinese online game will be more important than ever. Article Continued Below “They have found a clever way to leverage someone else’s network to help them sell things online, and it’s easier to jump on the back of JD.com,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “They need to do something online to stop e-commerce from taking away their business. This is Wal-Mart’s solution.” Wal-Mart shares gained 12 per cent this year through Wednesday in New York trading, outperforming the Bloomberg World Retail Index, which was down 1.1 per cent. That still lagged the U.S.-listed stocks of its major e-commerce competitors, Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which gained 21 per cent and 28 per cent respectively over the period. McMillon, who took over the top role in 2014, said the initiatives will keep the company’s China operations on track to contribute a quarter of its global retail growth in the next five years. That’s despite sluggish sales at Wal-Mart’s retail stores in China while shoppers there increasingly turn to online websites for convenience. The strategy also gives it access to new Chinese consumers in smaller cities where Wal-Mart doesn’t operate stores. “The scale of the last mile here in China is unique — the economics related to it are different,” McMillon said. “We could have built this ourselves, but everything requires investment. What we are doing is being very deliberate about where we’re putting our resources and being open to working with others. In today’s world, there’s different ways to build that ecosystem that serves customers.” To reach customers, Wal-Mart is relying on JD.com and its extensive logistics and delivery network. JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu said the company wants to build a fully-automated delivery infrastructure that includes automated warehouses and distribution centres, self-driving delivery cars and drones. The company is delivering products to a limited number of remote villages in southern China by drones. Villagers who order Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club products could see some goods flown to them, according to JD.com spokesperson Josh Gartner. Wal-Mart operates 420 stores and Sam’s Club membership outlets in the country. Wal-Mart’s global online sales are about $14 billion, or 3 per cent of worldwide revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. About 20 per cent of China’s retail sales are online, according to Ben Hassing, senior vice-president for China e-commerce. Wal-Mart, which posted $482 billion in annual sales, doesn’t break out China revenue. The initiatives include guaranteed deliveries within two hours to customers who live within a few miles of 20 Wal-Mart stores initially. The U.S. retailer will also stock a JD.com warehouse with imported products from its stores globally to capitalize on Chinese consumers’ preference for overseas goods. That means such things as dried cranberries from the U.S., toothpaste from Japan and face masks from Korea available at Wal-Mart stores overseas will be available to Chinese consumers for the first time. The company plans to offer tens of thousands of items it imports from around the world to Chinese consumers within 18 months, Hassing said. The other twist: Sam’s Club stores’ upscale products are now available to all Chinese. A range of products from the membership store, which sells $3,000 rice cookers and $1,800 bottles of red wine, will be available for the first time to non-members online in China — at a 10-per-cent price premium. Wal-Mart has struggled in China with multiple attempts to get a foothold in the market since its entry two decades ago. In 2007, it acquired Taiwanese chain Trust-Mart, though the company struggled to integrate it into its wider business. In the last few years, it has pulled back on an expansion as it closed stores in mostly second- and third-tier cities while opening new ones at a slower pace. The new strategy follows Wal-Mart’s decision to sell its Chinese e-commerce platform Yihaodian in June in exchange for a 5 per cent stake in JD.com. The retailer had acquired full ownership in the business a year earlier, and the sale was seen by analysts as a retreat from China’s e-commerce market. Instead, the Bentonville, Ark.,-based company has used the relationship with the Chinese partner to grab Chinese consumers online. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart boosted its stake in JD.com to about 11 per cent. JD.com’s Liu said that Wal-Mart’s challenge with Yihaodian was that China’s e-commerce landscape has two major players — Alibaba and JD.com — and not much room for the rest. “I think Wal-Mart did have success with e-commerce,” Liu said in a separate interview conducted in Mandarin. “If not, we would not have given them so many shares when we acquired Yihaodian.” Liu said there is potential for the partnership to go global, especially with Wal-Mart’s $3.3-billion acquisition of U.S. e-commerce start-up Jet.com in August. “There’s great potential for us to cooperate with Jet.com to develop e-commerce markets globally after we align our supply chains in China,” he said. To gain the upper hand in the retail battlefront, McMillon says the company needs to be ready with an array of tools and platforms that serve customers. “What we’re seeing is that customers want it all: They want to save money, they want to save time, they want to have access to the merchandise they’re looking for and sometimes be surprised by a new item,” he said. “They want to do that in stores. They want to do it on a mobile device. Some day they’ll do it with a virtual-reality experience. They’ll get all of that.” With assistance from Bloomberg’s Shannon Pettypiece Read more about: China, Drone The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Pastor — Will Face Charges For Assault News 0 0 0 October 20, 2016 Stranger Who Choked Baby At Walmart Is A Former N.J. Pastor — Will Face Charges For Assault Janice Malcolm On Thursday a 54-year-old man was brought before the courts to face charges for allegedly attacking and trying to choke a 4-month-old baby girl in a Walmart on Wednesday. The man was a stranger to the child and her parent, and only today did it become known that he is a former pastor from New Jersey. Oleh Zhownirovych was brought before a Johnson County District Court at 1:30 p.m. to face charges of felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery against a 4-month-old baby girl. Fox 4 KC reported that bail had been set for the former pastor from Clifton, New Jersey at $100,000 before he was scheduled to appear in a Johnson County court on Thursday afternoon. The man was captured after a mother sounded an alarm with the complaint that he had been trying to choke her baby. Man arrested this morning for trying to choke a baby inside an Overland Park Walmart.https://t.co/81TRkBgB7Z — tony rizzo (@trizzkc) October 19, 2016 The Overland Park police report stated that the incident occurred on Wednesday at approximately 7:23 a.m. in an Overland Park Walmart. The child and her mother had been in a check out line when Oleh Zhownirovych, who was a stranger to the pair, approached them and immediately put his hands around the baby’s neck and began to choke her in plain view of those at the Overland Park Walmart at 75th Street and Frontage Road. Leslee Wright, a spokesperson for Walmart, did let it be known though that the security guard had been quick to respond to the unfolding scene. The man is not a company employee but works for a security firm and though the company policy does not encourage security guards or bystanders to become physically involved in all altercations it was definitely the right thing to do here, as Wright agreed. “I think they did act heroically. We don’t know what would have happened to that child. I think this definitely rose to the level of potentially life and death.” When she spoke to the media, the baby girl’s mother Quisha Hill, said that when the stranger approached her, he had said to her that he was taking the baby moments before he attempted to drag the carrier out of the shopping cart she had it laid in. When the mother began to scream, the security guard, along with several bystanders, rushed to assist and managed to stop him from choking the baby. Hill was frantic as she recounted the moment. “I come in to grab couple items, and as I while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby, and he’s like I’m taking the baby, I’m stealing her. I’m taking her. Call 911. Call 911.” Walmart released a statement that they will be cooperating fully with investigators during the case and that their “main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store.” The former pastor was held down by those who assisted the mother until the police were able to arrive. Witnesses say they believe that the man had been under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. According to NJ.com Oleh Zhownirovych had become a former pastor by choice, having left his post with the Ukrainian Orthodox Holy Ascension Cathedral in Clifton approximately 10 months ago. Man charged with trying to choke baby at Overland Park Walmart https://t.co/dRz6v96Zs7 pic.twitter.com/Db0p98qUtG — KMBC (@kmbc) October 20, 2016 The 4-month-old baby girl was not seriously injured by the attempt to choke her and was treated at the scene by the responding paramedics. The police said that the attack which the former pastor committed towards the child was meant to cause “great bodily harm, disfigurement or death” and is the reason for the felony aggravated battery charge. The charge for misdemeanor battery is between Zhownirovych and one of the men who helped subdue him. Oleh Zhownirovych is due back in court on October 27.

Ford was one of 50 Walmart employees who graduated Thursday morning from a new training academy inside the Walmart store here. SEE: Camden teacher gets surprise The New Gretna native, who is a department manager in the lawn and garden section, has worked at Walmart for 22 years, the last five at the Williamstown store. She makes the hour-long commute each day from Burlington County. “It was very exciting,” said Ford, who got to wear a cap and gown. “I never graduated high school, so to do this, it was like amazing. I never thought it would happen ever. I was excited. I was so proud. This is an amazing program, it really is, and everybody just needs to give it a chance. When you go in with an open mind, you have that chance. The training academy inside the Walmart at 1840 South Black Horse Pike is the first in the state and one of four planned for the region. Two more are planned for North Jersey and one for New York. The retail giant, which is also celebrating its 25th year of operations in New Jersey, plans to open 200 training academies across the country, which are all scheduled to open by the end of 2017. Walmart opened its first New Jersey store in Turnersville in 1991 and now has more than 70 locations throughout the state with more than 20,000 employees. The company’s plan is for the academies to give hourly supervisors and department managers hands-on training in the classroom and on the sales floor, which it says will help them gain retail skills and knowledge to run their specific departments, ultimately helping the people they supervise and improving the experience for customers. "This is a really good learning experience for all of us. I’ve been with Walmart for over 33 years. The training academies are by far the best thing that I have seen Walmart do to train hourly associates, ever," said Thomas Underwood, Walmart regional general manager. The crop of graduates from the Williamstown store all work at the location, but that won’t always be the case with the academy graduates. Each academy across the country will train associates from approximately 25 nearby stores in two-week sessions.

Moreno/Staff Photographer) More than 140,000 hourly associates will be trained around the country over the course of a year. Each academy, located in or adjacent to a Walmart Supercenter, will have its own team of about 14 associates with retail operations experience to lead the training. Jacqueline Williams, a Williamstown resident, also graduated early Thursday morning. A claims supervisor at the store, Williams said the training academy helped to reinvigorate her. “I wasn’t really enthused about it at first,” said Williams, a 19-year Walmart employee. “As we were sitting in the class, it was what you’ve kind of been asking for, for a long time. If you know anything about Walmart, you have all these stores, all these departments. I could call four different stores for some help or advice and you might come up with four different answers. It wasn’t real cohesive. From the class, it reminded me how it was when I first started ...The company, they hear us. That’s like the best thing.” Walmart, which has 1.5 million employees in the U.S. and 2.3 million workers worldwide, raised its minimum wage to $9 per hour in 2015 and $10 this year. According to the company, full-time hourly associates in New Jersey earn an average of $13.98. The New Jersey minimum wage is $8.25. Recently, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a minimum wage hike, which would’ve raised it to $15. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009. For years, the retail giant had been criticized for its low pay structure and labor practices, and has also faced legal battles with employees in the past.

The 186,000 current and former employees had been owed $140 million of the $187 million they sought and are due $224 million with interest. The suit first came up in 2006. Brandy Jordan, senior director of human resources for the Northeast Division for Walmart, said the training academies are not a reaction to anything. “This is not a PR stunt. It’s not to address any of the negative concerns in the media. This is about it was the right thing to do for our associates," Jordan said. “…Over the course of the last 18 months, Walmart’s invested over $2.7 billion into our hourly associates and we’re very proud that the academies are a portion of our investment.” Buy Photo Esther Moralez Ortez, a Walmart employee, carries fruit in the store.

Moreno/Staff Photographer) Said Underwood: “Something Doug McMillon, our CEO, is very much behind is making sure we offer our customers the best shopping experience we possibly can. This is one way of doing that.” Walmart also offers a program called Pathways, which Jordan said is a computer-based training program that helps serve the needs of entry-level hourly associates. “We’ve had that program in effect for almost a year,” she said. “We provide them entry-level skill set training. We also start to prepare them for their next role. The academies pick up at our hourly supervisor level for associates.” Asked how it felt to pull that tassel over across her cap, Ford got a little emotional. “I could’ve cried,” she said. “My mom was out there. It was very exciting. I can imagine what it would’ve been like to graduate high school. I didn’t get the chance to do that.” Celeste E.

An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Wal-Mart had sought the order against the union and the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart in response to the group demonstrating and picketing at its stores over its pay and benefits. George Wiszynski, the attorney for the union, said the Bentonville-based company’s trespassing complaint was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. “At the end of the day, Wal-Mart relied on the same conduct for its unfair labor practice, its National Labor Relations Board charge as it does for its lawsuit,” Wiszynski told justices. Wal-Mart’s attorney, however, said trespassing is a state issue and was properly before the judge. “Trespass, repeated, defiant trespass absolutely is a significant state interest,” Steven Wheeless told justices. “Second, there is no risk of interference between a state court hearing a trespass claim and a labor board hearing about a labor violation that arose during the trespass.” Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included “flash mobs” where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans march and chant through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. The union has also argued that the judge’s order was too broad since it bars entering Wal-Mart’s property for “non-shopping” activities, rather than barring the demonstrations and other conduct that prompted the retail giant’s complaint. The justices did not indicate when they would rule in the case. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has announced a partnership with IBM Corp. to use "blockchain" software technology to improve its track and trace capabilities on food shipments in China. Working in collaboration with China's Tsinghua University, the partners will track shipments of meat, vegetables, and other products through the Chinese supply chain in an effort to improve food safety and reduce contamination. Blockchain technology can provide better supply chain transparency than manual, paper-based approaches by creating a secure, digital record of transactions that preserves the chain of custody as goods flow from suppliers to distributors to retailers. That process is particularly important in food logistics, where expired or counterfeit products can pose safety risks to consumers. Also known as distributed ledger technology, blockchain is a shared, immutable software record for recording the history of transactions, IBM says. Until recently, the technology was known primarily for being the foundation of the bitcoin online electronic currency, but has recently been adopted for business use in industries such as finance, banking, and healthcare. "Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life, but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains," IBM's Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president, industry platforms, said in a release. Walmart will use the technology in its recently opened Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. #Track and Trace Systems #Software & Systems #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article IBM Tsinghua University Wal-Mart Related Articles Convey launches retail shipment-tracking software Zebra launches mobile computers for retail tasks Descartes pays $2.7 million for Australian health-care software vendor Intelligrated launches software platform for robotic palletizing systems Freightos launches freight rate calculator More Videos » Technology Videos Orchestrating Your Next Best Move With Real-Time Visibility Logistics technology tools that matter Ruan: A Culture Enhanced by People, Process and Technology Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

Just like stock market investors love to buy shares at a discount, consumers love to find bargains when shopping. Retailers exploit this discount purchasing desire in numerous ways. Consumer savvy sellers do everything from issuing discount coupons and participating in loss-leader Groupon-type programs, to holding sales events and carefully setting price amounts to psychologically pleasing figures. Discount shopping is such a dominant force that the International Monetary Fund listed discount retailer Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) as 28th on the list of the world’s largest economies in 2013. This means that the discount retailer’s economic power is greater than most nations, serving as a testament to the success of the discount shopping model. The Next Level Of Discount Shopping An entire industry has emerged pushing the discount concept to the extreme in the brick & mortar space. Known as dollar stores, these deep-discount retailers have become a thriving industry, while creating over $25 billion in annual revenue. Dollar stores are defined as stores that sell most of their merchandise at a single low price. As the name suggests, the price is generally $1.00 or so per item. These retailers focus on regions that are considered too small to support a Walmart, yet have enough of a population to allow the dollar store concept to thrive. In September 2014 a survey conducted by Symphony IRI revealed that approximately 65% of all consumer packaged goods were purchased in dollar stores. This figure indicates the closing gap between mass merchandisers, supercenters, and dollar stores, and is an incredibly bullish metric. Right now there is tremendous opportunity in both of the leading dollar store retailers, Dollar General Corp. (DG) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR).  In 2015, Dollar General’s net sales hit just under $20.50 billion, while Dollar Tree posted net sales of approximately $15.5 billion. I believe that there is opportunity in both stocks. However Dollar Tree appears to offer the best opportunity right now for investors. 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Dollar Tree, a Fortune 200 Company, ran 14,129 stores across 48 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces as of the end of the second quarter. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree Canada. According to results posted on August 22 the company performed well in the second quarter of 2016, with net sales growing by nearly 66% to $5 billion, up from $3 billion in the same period last year. (Third quarter 2016 results are expected in November.) Once adjusted for the impact of Canadian dollar changes, same-store sales posted growth of 1.1%. This positive same-store sales growth was driven by increases in both customer count and average ticket, meaning that not only is the company attracting more customers, those who visit are spending more. Gross profit ramped higher by just over $657 million, or nearly 77%, to $1.51 billion in the second quarter, compared to $855.2 million year over year. The increase was predicated upon just over $588 million of gross profit for Family Dollar, as well as a 9% increase in Dollar Tree’s gross profit in the second quarter. Bob Sasser, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am very pleased with the Company’s overall performance in our second quarter. Through what continues to be a challenging retail sales environment, we delivered gross margin improvement and managed expenses actually to provide earnings at the top end of our guidance range. In our Dollar Tree segment, we improved our operating margin and delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales.” Despite these great numbers, Wall Street focused on the EPS estimate miss during the second quarter. The estimate of 73 cents per share was slightly over-optimistic with the actual number coming in at 72 cents per share. The stock price was slashed lower by over 20% in an irrational reaction, which has created an ideal buying opportunity for these shares. Risks To Consider: Deutsche Bank has lowered its target price despite maintaining a buy rating on the shares.  The investment bank cites margin concerns and weak consumer traffic as reasons for the lower price target. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Action To Take: Technically, shares have set up to be ideal rebound play. The stock price bounced solidly from the lows, with the next resistance level being $79.00 per share. Enter long on a breakout above $79.00 per share with initial stops set at $75.67 per share to allow for the inherent price volatility.  Our target price is $96.00 per share. P.S. Everyone knows that Social Security is in bad shape. But most people don’t realize just how desperate the situation is… to fix Social Security, benefits have to be cut by 22% immediately. Or payroll taxes have to jump by 32%. So you’re facing pain whether you’re working OR retired. But there’s a way out. A program that can pay you $43,543 per year for the rest of your life. And it has nothing to do with the government. Check it out here.

That includes two-hour delivery services at some Wal-Mart stores and a Wal-Mart global store on JD Worldwide, JD.com's cross-border platform. Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site, this year in a deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. FILE - This Thursday, Nov. 12, 2015, file photo, shows the Yihaodian office in Shanghai. Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com, China's second-largest e-commerce site, in a deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Wal-Mart and JD.com are offering more choices for Chinese shoppers ahead of Singles Day, one of the world's biggest online shopping days of the year. Singles Day, Nov. 11, is China's answer to Cyber Monday in the United States. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) The world's largest retailer is trying to improve its business in China, the globe's most populous country that is lucrative but challenging. In China, Wal-Mart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. Its online business makes up a fraction of the overall online Chinese market compared to Alibaba, which is No. 1 online, and JD.com. But the recent moves underscore how Wal-Mart is accelerating its efforts to cater to online Chinese shoppers who are dramatically increasing their purchases on their smartphones. Singles Day was launched by Chinese college students in the 1990s as a version of Valentine's Day for people without romantic partners. The Nov. 11 timing was based on the four singles of 11.11. Unattached young people would treat each other to dinner or bestow gifts to woo someone and end their single status. It became a shopping bonanza as sellers of everything from necklaces to TVs moved to cash in on the marketing opportunity, and it is now China's answer to Cyber Monday in the United States — the day after Thanksgiving weekend, when retailers have their busiest online sales day. Wal-Mart said late Wednesday that now more than 20 of its Wal-Mart stores in China offer two-hour delivery services for customers ordering on JD Daojia, the grocery and fresh goods business of the New Dada joint venture with JD.com. The number of stores is expected to double by the end of the year. On Thursday, an exclusive Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD.com. It offers millions of Chinese customers access to premium products with JD.com's same- and next-day deliver Wal-Mart plans to use JD.com's nationwide logistics network and stock Sam's Club merchandise in JD.com warehouses. Wal-Mart also says all JD.com users will be able to buy Sam's Club products at membership prices during a 10-day introduction period following the official launch. Sam's Club has been a bright spot in Wal-Mart's business in China as it worked hard to offer top-quality products that appeal to affluent Chinese consumers. It also launched a Wal-Mart global store on JD Worldwide, providing products imported by Wal-Mart from around the world. _____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Walmart Canada and Visa are locked in a battle over merchant fees, since the retail giant declared back in June that it payed more than $100 million in annual fees and would stop accepting the credit card. Story continues below The U.S.-based retail giant said the change will come into effect at all 16 locations in the province as of Oct. 24. Customers will still be able to pay for purchases with cash, debit, MasterCard and American Express cards. Walmart stopped accepting Visa cards at three stores in Thunder Bay in July. Spokesperson Alex Roberton said Manitoba was chosen second because it provided a “seamless transition” but didn’t elaborate on why.

These Fortune 500 companies have installed solar at nearly 2,000 individual installations nationwide. The top 10 corporate users are compiled in a slideshow below, and demonstrate that America's top brands are choosing to go solar at an impressive rate.  Target is the leads the pack with the most solar installed (147.5MW on 300 installations). Other companies recognized in the report’s Top 10 for their amount of solar capacity and number of solar installations include heretofore perennial champion Walmart (145 MW), Prologis (107.8 MW), Apple (93.9 MW), Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl’s (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy’s (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties, Inc. (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). “These blue-chip companies are proof that sustainability and profitability is not an either-or proposition,” said SEIA’s interim president Tom Kimbis. “Investing in solar is a common-sense decision that pays dividends for both the environment and companies’ bottom lines and these leaders deserve a big round of applause. They’re not only helping to create thousands of American jobs in solar, the nearly 2,000 corporate systems highlighted in this report are generating enough clean electricity to offset more than 1.1 million metric tons of harmful carbon emissions a year.” Covering corporate solar installs now in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, the 2016 Solar Means Business report tracks nearly 1,100 MW of solar installations at America’s top companies. To put that in context, that’s enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year. Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142 MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW). “Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio,” said Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart. “This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam’s Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business. Being recognized by the SEIA for our efforts is confirmation that we are moving in the right direction with regards to renewable energy, specifically solar.” “As the world’s largest owner and operator of logistics real estate, we’re proud to contribute to a low-carbon future and use our properties as a platform to generate large volumes of clean electricity,” said Matt Singleton, vice president, Global Energy and Development, Prologis. “We are on pace to meet our goal of 200 megawatts of solar in our global portfolio by 2020, and we appreciate being acknowledged by SEIA for these efforts.” “We appreciate SEIA recognizing GGP’s commitment to sustainability, which is imbedded in everything we do,” said Shobi Khan, chief operating officer of GGP. “Solar energy is one of our areas of focus, and we’ve found that solar installations have the capability to deliver a significant amount of clean electricity to our shopping centers. Our investment in solar projects delivers benefits to the environment and strong returns to our shareholders.” “We’re honored to be named by SEIA as a top company for another year in a row,” said Lawrence Garb, executive vice president and managing director of Hartz Mountain Industries, Inc. “Hartz continues to find the economics of the New Jersey solar market very accretive and has continued to increase its pipeline of new projects.” Back to News   Innovative Solar Products DuPont Teijin Films Introduces Optically Clear UV Stable Polyester...

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 20, 2016 at 8:00AM Wal-Mart will be adding seasonal workers this year, as it usually does. Image source: Wal-Mart. While physical retailers have struggled to keep up with online completion, the holiday season still requires extra workers. Starting as early as October and extending through the end of the year, most major retailers have to add staff. That's also true for online retailers as well as industries that support the selling season like shipping companies and manufacturers. That's good news for the unemployed looking to get back into the workforce, college kids who need a few weeks or months of work, and anyone looking to make a little extra cash. Retail hiring for the last three months of 2016 is expected to be about the same as last year, when it was 738,800, according to an annual study by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. The nature of seasonal jobs, however, has begun to shift. "The big change we are seeing, however, is that while seasonal retail jobs remain flat or shrink, there has been a marked increase in seasonal job gains in other sectors," wrote John A. Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online." Hiring, he explains, reflects not only a shift in how we shop -- moving from physical to online stores -- but it also has been impacted by the change in the types of gifts Americans are giving. "Seasonal hiring is not limited to retail or retail-related industries," he said. "More and more Americans are giving friends and families experiences instead of material items. The increase in this type of gift-giving means that there are more seasonal employment opportunities at theaters, restaurants, amusement parks, and other entertainment venues." These are some of the companies hiring for the 2016 holiday season: Traditional retailers are hiring Target (NYSE:TGT): While the retail chain may be struggling, Target still plans to hire nearly 80,000 new employees for seasonal jobs this year. That breaks down to 70,000 workers in its stores and 7,500 across distribution and fulfillment facilities, according to the company. The chain will be focusing on non-store jobs as a way to facilitate digital orders and get merchandise to its roughly 1,800 United State locations. "Our distribution teams will be major players in that game, helping us get all those products to guests in time to host holiday events, give gifts and celebrate all season long," said Distribution Senior Vice President Carson Landsgard in a press release. Kohl's (NYSE:KSS): Although it's much smaller than Target, Kohl's plans to hire nearly as many seasonal workers this year. The company plans to add more than 69,000 employees at its 1,100 stores in 49 states. In addition, the company, which did not break down hiring numbers by type of job, plans to also add positions (part of the 69,000 hires) at its distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers across the country and at Kohl's credit operations. Macy's (NYSE:M): While Macy's may be struggling as much as any company on this list, it still expects a big holiday season and plans to add 83,000 seasonal positions at its Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, call centers, distribution centers, and online fulfillment centers nationwide. J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP): The retailer, which has been on the comeback trail, plans to add 40,000 seasonal workers this year, according to The Dallas Morning News. And like Target and Kohl's, added attention will be paid to digital fulfillment, with 2,000 new workers being hired to help with JCP.com orders. Additional retail companies hiring: Toys R Us has seasonal jobs listed on its website and on various job boards, but has not said how many workers it plans to add. Sears also has a web page for people looking for seasonal jobs, but has not publicized its plans. Online hiring comes down to one company Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN): The online retail giant has been getting bigger every holiday season and this year it intends to hire "more than 120,000 seasonal positions across its U.S. network of fulfillment centers, sortation centers and customer service sites." Getting seasonal work with the online retail leader could lead to permanent jobs as the company said that, in 2015, "more than 14,000 seasonal positions were transitioned to regular, full-time roles after the holidays and the company expects to increase that number this year." Hiring goes beyond stores In addition to all the stores and online retailers that plan to add seasonal employees, the holiday rush will also force the U.S. Postal Service, UPS (NYSE: UPS), and Federal Express to add workers. The biggest increase will be at the USPS, which is increasing the 29,000 seasonal workers it hired in 2015 to between 35,000 and 40,000 this year. FedEx has not released its seasonal plans yet, but UPS plans to add 95,000 seasonal employees, many of whom will end up with permanent jobs. From the 2012 through 2014 holiday seasons, over 37% of the people UPS hired for seasonal package handler jobs eventually ended up with regular jobs. "For many it's an opportunity to earn some extra cash for the holidays," said CEO David Abney, who started loading trucks at night in 1974 while in college. "But with many of our holiday hires getting permanent jobs with us, it can also be a gateway to a career." Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Regions Can Access Donation of 160,000 Pouches through Walmart Pharmacy Locations -- -- Focus on Safe Drug Disposal Helps Combat Opioid Abuse, Misuse and Diversion -- News provided by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Oct 20, 2016, 07:30 ET Share this article CHESTERFIELD, United Kingdom, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it will provide 160,000 drug deactivation pouches to families in Kentucky as well as across the U.S. Midwest and Central Appalachia to encourage the safe and responsible disposal of leftover prescription pain medications. Mallinckrodt will make the pouches available – free of charge – at nearly 800 Walmart store pharmacy locations across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. A potential 7.2 million prescription pills could be destroyed if each of the 160,000 pouches is used to capacity. The user-friendly pouch-based systems deactivate prescription drugs and render chemical compounds safe for landfills. After placing unused medications in the specially formulated pouch and adding regular tap water, the pouch can be sealed and thrown away with the household trash. The pouches are completely biodegradable, providing an environmentally responsible way to deactivate and dispose of drugs. This donation is part of Mallinckrodt's 1-million pouch donation initiative to help combat the abuse of prescription pain medications, which is one of the top public health threats in the U.S. today. "As a company focused on the health and well-being of our patients and communities, Mallinckrodt has long been a strong advocate of addressing the complex issues of opioid misuse and abuse that cause so much harm to families," said Mark Trudeau, Mallinckrodt President and Chief Executive Officer. "We share the concerns of parents across the nation, and believe that providing patients with a safe, environmentally responsible way to dispose of unused medications is critical in this fight against prescription drug abuse," added Trudeau.

Can Access Donation of 160,000 Pouches through Walmart Pharmacy Locations - - Focus on Safe Drug Disposal Helps Combat Opioid Abuse, Misuse and Diversion - News provided by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Oct 20, 2016, 07:30 ET Share this article CHESTERFIELD, United Kingdom, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it will provide 160,000 drug deactivation pouches to families in Ohio as well as across the U.S. Midwest and Central Appalachia to encourage the safe and responsible disposal of leftover prescription pain medications. Mallinckrodt will make the pouches available – free of charge – at nearly 800 Walmart store pharmacy locations across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. A potential 7.2 million prescription pills could be destroyed if each of the 160,000 pouches is used to capacity. The user-friendly pouch-based systems deactivate prescription drugs and render chemical compounds safe for landfills. After placing unused medications in the specially formulated pouch and adding regular tap water, the pouch can be sealed and thrown away with the household trash. The pouches are completely biodegradable, providing an environmentally responsible way to deactivate and dispose of drugs. This donation is part of Mallinckrodt's 1-million pouch donation initiative to help combat the abuse of prescription pain medications, which is one of the top public health threats in the U.S. today. "As a company focused on the health and well-being of our patients and communities, Mallinckrodt has long been a strong advocate of addressing the complex issues of opioid misuse and abuse that cause so much harm to families," said Mark Trudeau, Mallinckrodt President and Chief Executive Officer. "We share the concerns of parents across the nation, and believe that providing patients with a safe, environmentally responsible way to dispose of unused medications is critical in this fight against prescription drug abuse," added Trudeau. "Mallinckrodt is committed to working with policy makers, community leaders, law enforcement and industry partners to ensure the responsible use of pain medication and prevent unused medications from ending up in the wrong hands." The initiative reinforces Mallinckrodt's long-standing commitment to the safe and responsible use of medications and collaboration with community leaders and organizations who share its goal of building public awareness of the critical role of responsible drug disposal in the fight against prescription drug abuse.

Appalachia Regions Can Access Donation of 160,000 Pouches through Walmart Pharmacy Locations -- -- Focus on Safe Drug Disposal Helps Combat Opioid Abuse, Misuse and Diversion -- News provided by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Oct 20, 2016, 07:30 ET Share this article CHESTERFIELD, United Kingdom, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it will provide 160,000 drug deactivation pouches to families in Pennsylvania as well as across the U.S. Midwest and Central Appalachia to encourage the safe and responsible disposal of leftover prescription pain medications. Mallinckrodt will make the pouches available – free of charge – at nearly 800 Walmart store pharmacy locations across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. A potential 7.2 million prescription pills could be destroyed if each of the 160,000 pouches is used to capacity. The user-friendly pouch-based systems deactivate prescription drugs and render chemical compounds safe for landfills. After placing unused medications in the specially formulated pouch and adding regular tap water, the pouch can be sealed and thrown away with the household trash. The pouches are completely biodegradable, providing an environmentally responsible way to deactivate and dispose of drugs. This donation is part of Mallinckrodt's 1-million pouch donation initiative to help combat the abuse of prescription pain medications, which is one of the top public health threats in the U.S. today. "As a company focused on the health and well-being of our patients and communities, Mallinckrodt has long been a strong advocate of addressing the complex issues of opioid misuse and abuse that cause so much harm to families," said Mark Trudeau, Mallinckrodt President and Chief Executive Officer. "We share the concerns of parents across the nation, and believe that providing patients with a safe, environmentally responsible way to dispose of unused medications is critical in this fight against prescription drug abuse," added Trudeau. "Mallinckrodt is committed to working with policy makers, community leaders, law enforcement and industry partners to ensure the responsible use of pain medication and prevent unused medications from ending up in the wrong hands." The initiative reinforces Mallinckrodt's long-standing commitment to the safe and responsible use of medications and collaboration with community leaders and organizations who share its goal of building public awareness of the critical role of responsible drug disposal in the fight against prescription drug abuse. A national survey of U.S. adults who used opioids showed that nearly 6 out of 10 had or expect to have leftover opioids, according to findings published online June 13, 2016, in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal. Nearly 68 percent of those who used prescription pain relievers non-medically in 2012-2013 got them from friends or relatives, according to the 2013 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

Diese Unternehmen könnten Interesse habenAnleger aufgepasst! Was Fonds-Anteilen nach Silvester droht Regulatory News: Publicis Groupe (Paris:PUB): 3rd Quarter 2016       Revenue    2,315 million Reported growth -0.4% Growth at constant exchange rates +1.5% Organic growth   +0.2% At September 30, 2016       Revenue    7,068 million Reported growth +2.9% Growth at constant exchange rates +5.2% Organic growth   +1.9% Maurice Lévy, Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe: « Publicis Groupes revenue at September 30, 2016 was up 2.9% over the corresponding period in 2015, and by 5.2% when exchange rates are factored out. Organic growth for the period was 1.9%. Unsurprisingly, growth decelerated in the third quarter to 0.2%. As announced, the third and fourth quarters of the year are the most significantly impacted by accounts lost in the media palooza. This was compounded by projects recently completed at Razorfish that will only be relayed by new projects in the fourth quarter, but that will produce their full effect in 2017. Therefore, on the geographical standpoint, North America showed a sharp downturn (-4.0%) while Europe reported a strong growth (+7.6%). As anticipated, it is in 2017 that we will reap the full benefits of the new "Power of One organization we are implementing. The initial results are already there, as evidenced by the large accounts awarded to us by advertisers such as Wal-Mart, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. It is worth noting "The Power of One" has been very successful at Razorfish which experienced the best ever quarter for new business. Regarding the fourth quarter, like every year, economic uncertainties can result in marketing investments becoming the adjustment variable in the equation towards the end of the year. We have nonetheless confidence in our ability to reach our objectives, which is why the Management Board has moved that the 42% payout ratio we had been targeting for 2018 be decided as of 2016. As indicated quite some time ago, the formal process of identifying my successor will commence in November, leading to a decision to be taken by the Supervisory Board, no later than at its meeting of February 2017. » 1  Q3 2016 REVENUE Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was 2,315 million euro, 0.4% below the 2,325 million euro reported for the corresponding period in 2015. Exchange rates impacted revenue negatively by 45 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 1.9% of Q3 2015 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 31 million euro to revenue in Q3 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 1.3% of Q3 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was +1.5%. Organic growth was +0.2% in the third quarter, below the growth rate at June 30 due to the more significant impact of media accounts lost in the 2015 media palooza  an impact that will remain high in Q4  and to the end of several digital projects when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet. Breakdown of Q3 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported Million   Q3 2016   Q3 2015   growth   growth Europe 643   625 +7.6% +2.9% North America 1,254 1,292 -4.0% -2.9% Asia Pacific 261 260 -0.4% +0.4% Latin America 89 87 +13.1% +2.3% Middle East & Africa   68   61   +4.1%   +11.5% Total   2,315   2,325   +0.2%   -0.4% 2  REVENUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 In the first nine months of 2016, Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue totaled 7,068 million euro, up 2.9% from 6,867 million euro for the corresponding period in 2015. Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period. Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016. Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported Million   9M 2016   9M 2015   growth   growth Europe 1,992   1,894 +6.2% +5.2% North America 3,874 3,767 -0.5% +2.8% Asia Pacific 764 746 +2.9% +2.4% Latin America 241 278 +5.1% -13.3% Middle East & Africa   197   182   +1.0%   +8.2% Total   7,068   6,867   +1.9%   +2.9% Europes revenue grew by 5.2%. When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment. The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year. The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%) North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter). This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet. Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India. Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%. Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year). The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%. Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog   Europe   North   Asia   Latin   Middle East   Total         America   Pacific   America   & Africa     Digital   +13.9%   +0.3%   +19.2%   +3.2%   +7.8%   +4.9% Analog   -0.2%   -1.8%   -4.7%   +5.5%   -0.9%   -1.3% Total   +6.2%   -0.5%   +2.9%   +5.1%   +1.0%   +1.9% The Groupes growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start. Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30. It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline. 3  NET DEBT At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015. The Groupes average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015. It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015. 4  HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 4.1 - Transformation During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One) to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation. The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters. The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&Gs home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA. 4.2  Digital Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One. 4.3  Groupe commitment to start-ups - Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment. This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector. With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy. This event should be staged every year from now on. - Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupes digital experts. After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology. 4.4  Global partnership with Tencent Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China. This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and Chinas biggest internet company. It spans the Groupes three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencents eleven product lines. This agreement will cement the groups relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencents innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: - a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore. The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future. This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; - an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; - innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients. 4.5 - Acquisitions - MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience.

It is being carried out to meet clients new requirements in selling their products or in their own transformation. Publicis Groupe has abolished the notion of holding company with silo-type operating structures. The results to date, obtained with the implementation of the new "Power of One organization, have been very promising, with accounts gained including Wal-Mart, Asda, P&Gs home care products, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. Publicis Groupe is confirming its previous guidance for 2016 in spite of the 250 to 300 basis point negative impact on the growth of the second half of 2016. On top, the fourth quarter is usually characterized by uncertainty surrounding advertisers budget management. We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the US, France and Germany, and the consequences of "Brexit, not just for the UK for also for the rest of Europe. The Management Board will be proposing that the 2018 objective of a 42% payout (compared with 39.5% in 2015) be brought forward in respect of financial 2016. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.

Breakdown of Q3 2016 revenue by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million Q3 2016 Q3 2015 growth growth Europe 643 625 +7.6% +2.9% North America 1,254 1,292 -4.0% -2.9% Asia Pacific 261 260 -0.4% +0.4% Latin America 89 87 +13.1% +2.3% Middle East & Africa 68 61 +4.1% +11.5% Total 2,315 2,325 +0.2% -0.4%     2 - REVENUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   In the first nine months of 2016, Publicis Groupe's consolidated revenue totaled 7,068 million euro, up 2.9% from 6,867 million euro for the corresponding period in 2015.  Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015.  Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period.  Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million 9M 2016 9M 2015 growth growth Europe 1,992 1,894 +6.2% +5.2% North America 3,874 3,767 -0.5% +2.8% Asia Pacific 764 746 +2.9% +2.4% Latin America 241 278 +5.1% -13.3% Middle East & Africa 197 182 +1.0% +8.2% Total 7,068 6,867 +1.9% +2.9%   Europe's revenue grew by 5.2%.  When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment.  The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year.  The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%)   North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter).  This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet.   Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India.   Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%.  Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year).    The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog     Europe North America Asia Pacific Latin America Middle East & Africa Total Digital +13.9% +0.3% +19.2% +3.2% +7.8% +4.9% Analog -0.2% -1.8% -4.7% +5.5% -0.9% -1.3% Total +6.2% -0.5% +2.9% +5.1% +1.0% +1.9%   The Groupe's growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.  North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start.  Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30.  It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline.   3 - NET DEBT   At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015.  The Groupe's average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015.  It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015.     4 - HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   4.1 - Transformation   During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One") to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation.   The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters.  The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&G's home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA.   4.2 - Digital    Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One".   4.3 - Groupe commitment to start-ups   -    Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment.  This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector.  With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy.  This event should be staged every year from now on. -    Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupe's digital experts.  After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology.   4.4 - Global partnership with Tencent   Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China.  This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and China's biggest internet company.  It spans the Groupe's three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencent's eleven product lines.  This agreement will cement the groups' relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencent's innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: -    a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore".  The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future.  This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; -    an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; -    innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients.   4.5 - Acquisitions   -    MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience. MercerBell is specialized in CRM and digital strategy, creativity, content and technology, and will be integrated into Saatchi & Saatchi. This agency, which was founded in 1999, has a team of 65 professionals and a customer base that includes Toyota, Foxtel, Quantas, BT, Allianz and ASX. -    Vertiba, the Salesforce partner, is specialized in marketing solutions.  Founded in 2010, Vertiba is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.  Vertiba's skills will be integrated into the Publicis.Sapient platform. -    Seven Seconds, the London (UK) based e-commerce and digital specialist, was founded in 2013 and will be integrated into BBH.  Its main clients are British Airways, Barclays, Boots, Tesco Retail and Tesco Bank. -    Venus Communications is one of the leading public relations agencies in Vietnam.  Venus has been integrated into the MSL brand, which in turn is part of Publicis One in Vietnam.  Over the last 10 years, Venus and MSL have worked together successfully on numerous assignments.

Six-foot-long snake shocks Florida man by slithering out from under his hood while he drives on freeway Tim Mokwa of Denedin was driving his brand new car along the US 19 when he saw a head pop up in his side vision The head belonged to a snake that slithered up and out from under his hood The stunned driver managed to pull over into a Walmart parking lot and film the slimy intruder By Kiri Blakeley For Dailymail.com Published: 01:30 EST, 20 October 2016 | Updated: 03:16 EST, 20 October 2016 e-mail 36 shares 7 View comments A man got the fright of his life when he was driving down the freeway in Florida and saw the beady eyes of a snake staring back at him from his car hood. Tim Mokwa, 37, of Denedin, was in rush hour traffic on Monday on US 19 when he saw a small green head emerge in the corner of the windshield on his 2015 Sonata, according to News12. 'He just popped his little head up right over here,' he told the outlet. The visiting snake took a liking to Tim Mokwa's brand new Sonata Mokwa managed to keep his cool and pulled over into a Walmart parking lot to film As quick as he appeared, he disappeared down into the hood again, where he hasn't been seen since Mokwa says the intruder almost slithered into his open window but he managed to roll it up just in time. He then kept his cool and pulled into a nearby Walmart parking lot, where he let the snake roam free on his hood while he took video, which has received almost 30,000 views on Facebook. The snake was about six feet long, taking up the entire length of the hood. On Facebook, Mokwa identified the snake as a black indigo. 'In situations like that flipping out is exactly what you don’t want to do,' he told the outlet. 'The best thing you can do it just remain calm, so you don't hit somebody.' Not bothered: Tim Mokwa kept calm while a snake slithered out from his car and gyrated on his hood After he took several seconds of video of the slippery creature, it suddenly veered back under his hood. 'He just kind of slithered his way back down in there,' he said.  He drove home and parked his car, and hasn't seen the critter since, though he doesn't know if perhaps it might still be curled up under his engine.    Mokwa said he closed up his air conditioning vents just in case.  'I was like, I do not want it to sneak in this car. It’s a brand new car. I imagine it’s sealed pretty well,' he told WFLA. He suspects the critter most likely made an escape during the night.

Share this article Share 'I'm just glad it wasn't poisonous' the level headed Floridian said of the unexpected encounter 'Hopefully he’s just out here in the bushes somewhere just living a new life,' he says. Mokwa thinks it was while he was kayaking in Weeki Wachee that the creature took a liking to his vehicle.  Having lived in the Sunshine State his whole life, Mokwa wasn't unduly ruffled by the encounter. 'Snakes come natural in Florida, just like rain in the summertime. I’m just glad it wasn’t poisonous,' he said.  Not everyone was so sanguine about the encounter - Mokwa says his girlfriend hasn't been in the car since. 'I guess you could say she had an anxiety attack, because she does not like snakes,' he laughed.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon was in Beijing on 19 October to announce the investment and launch the Beijing Food Safety Collaboration Centre, reports Reuters. “By bringing together the best food safety thinkers from across the food ecosystem, from farmers to suppliers, retailers to policy regulators, we’ll accelerate food safety awareness and help make Chinese families safer and healthier,” McMillon said. The Walmart Foundation will fund projects in science, education and communications, working with Tsingua University and global technology company IBM to track the movement of food products across China using blockchain technology. IBM said the blockchain technology keeps a permanent record of transactions, tracing produce from farms to store shelves, and could offer an alternative to packaging tracking and manual inspections. "Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains," Bridget van Kralingen, IBM senior VP industry platforms told Reuters. The technology is expected to improve food safety and part of Walmart’s strategy to improve its positioning in the China after several food safety scandals in China. Earlier this year, Walmart China announced an investment in Chinese e-tailer JD.com to grow its e-commerce positioning in China.   Share facebook linkedin twitter googleplus Download PDF Related Articles 1Subscribers onlyChina unveils super-greenhouse 2New China head for Maersk Line 3Jumbo Chilean cherries star on Singles Day 4Asoex courts China’s horeca sector 5Singles’ Day sales top US$1bn in five minutes 6New RSA-China grape protocol opens doors 7Subscribers onlyRSA grape deal sparks lemon hope 8Aldi set to enter Chinese market 9Breakthrough for RSA grapes in China 10Italian export trade pushes hard in China Comments (0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Popular news Read: LatestMost read 1Subscribers onlyChina unveils super-greenhouse 2Future and INI launch JV 3New China head for Maersk Line 4INI launches Kimaye for kids 5Jumbo Chilean cherries star on Singles Day 6Australia’s “fruit bowl” hit by storms 7United Exports widens portfolio 8Chile steps up fight against codling moth 9Brazil develops disease resistant banana 10Southern African grape season underway 1China access in sight for CA strawberries 2Del Monte appoints new president and COO 3Philippines, Australia expand mango pact 4New RSA-China grape protocol opens doors 5CA strawberries celebrate China access 6Aldi set to enter Chinese market 7Thai importer ramps up apple promotions 8Bakkavör reports on “disappointing” Q1 9USDA releases risk report on Indian grapes 10Aussie exporters seek trade in Middle East Features & Analysis Online dating for fresh produce They describe themselves as the matchmakers of fresh produce – but what does this latest wave of fruit and veg e-commerce platforms offer suppliers?

The three organisations announced that they will collaborate to improve the way food is tracked, distributed and sold to consumers across the country, and much of their efforts will pivot around a new Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center. According to Bloomberg, Walmart and its charitable foundation plans to invest $25m into food safety research in China, a country which has been rocked recently by a series of food safety scandals and where consumers frequently rank the issue as one of their top concerns. "By bringing together the best food safety thinkers from across the food ecosystem, from farmers to suppliers, retailers to policy regulators, we'll accelerate food safety awareness and help make Chinese families safer and healthier," said Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, at a press conference in Beijing. Walmart's new research centre will bring together academic research and IBM's blockchain technology to help develop solutions for China's food supply chain. Specifically, blockchain is said to provide an alternative to traditional paper tracking and manual inspection systems by keeping a permanent record of transactions, which are then grouped in blocks that cannot be altered. The information gathered in each transaction is agreed by all members of the business network and it also helps individual retailers to improve their management of a product's shelf-life. "Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains," said Bridget van Kralingen, SVP of Industry Platforms at IBM. "Food touches all of us, everywhere, so we are experimenting in China with Walmart and Tsinghua given the size and scale of food consumption in this country," she added. "Tsinghua University is also committed to in-depth research of food safety – one of the most important areas that the world is focusing on," added Prof Chai Yueting of Tsinghua University. "We believe the work with IBM and Walmart can serve as a global model for others to follow and replicate."

Published Oct 19th, 2016 5:22 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. ––––––––––––––– Little Rock-based Westrock Coffee Company knows what it’s like to get a product on Walmart U.S. shelves only to have it pulled. But that disappointment has not prevented the mission-oriented business from growing retail distribution to Kroger, Harps, Food Lion and other regional grocers around the country over the past five years. With that retail experience behind it, Westrock is again setting its sights on Walmart and hoping for a second chance. Elizabeth McLaughlin, Westrock’s executive vice president of marketing, told Talk Business & Politics the company is working with an advisor and plans to meet with Walmart’s coffee buyer to get Westrock branded coffee back on the shelf. It recently got the product on Walmart.com, but has yet to secure shelf space in stores. “It’s a very crowded category and our biggest challenge is brand awareness. We don’t have a coffee shop (ready-made audience) but we have thought about it,” McLaughlin noted. “It’s just that the capital spent to get that up and running would be money that couldn’t go to growing our farmer base, which is core to the company’s mission.” Westrock Coffee Company is not just about generating sales revenue. Founders and owners – and father and son team – Joe and Scott Ford wanted to be involved in a company with socio-economic benefits to communities in Africa. The former Alltel execs and shareholders had time on their hands when Alltel sold to Verizon in 2008. Their focus with Westrock was that giving back and supporting communities was essential. WESTROCK ORIGINS A happenstance meeting between Scott Ford and the president of Rwanda occurred during a family trip to Africa in early 2009 in which Ford was looking for his next business opportunity. When he heard the president of Rwanda wanted to meet, he feared the conversation would be about cell phone towers and so he tried to dodge the meeting. But after the president called his hotel room and personally asked the family to dinner at his home Ford ultimately agreed. The two discussed what it might take to help improve the lives of people of Rwanda to rebuild from war and genocide in that country. Four hours later Ford accepted a challenge from the Rwandan President to try and help the people of Rwanda taste the benefits of the free-market system. During the trip Ford saw an opportunity at a washing station used by local coffee bean growers selling fresh beans for 40 cents per handful. As a former commodity trader at Stephens Inc., Ford saw an opportunity to create a crop-to-cup business model that would provide stable earnings for farmers in Rwanda. Later that year Ford purchased the Rwanda Trading Company and got into a vertically integrated coffee business on a global basis. Westrock contracts with 80,000 growers in Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia in Africa and has expanded bean sourcing to Nicaragua, Peru and Brazil in Latin America. In 2012 Westrock purchased the Tembo Trading Company in Tanzania to raise production levels. Having a transparent and ethically sourced supply chain is key to Westrock’s mission as well, which is why the company purchased Falcon Coffees Limited in the United Kingdom two years ago as way to connect roasters and farmers around the world working with partners in Africa, Asia and across Latin America. Beans grown in Africa are shipped to Little Rock and distributed from there. GROWING WITHOUT WALMART On a whim Ford was able to get an early coffee brand version called TradeWinds into Walmart U.S. stores and Sam’s Clubs in 2010 but sales faltered and the TradeWinds brand was pulled from the shelves. Walmart U.S. has since added national brands like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks to their shelves – brands with large followings. McLaughlin said it was fairly easy to get into 800 Walmart stores in 2010, but the young company wasn’t ready to handle it. She said the store locations were outside of Arkansas and the company had no branding equity. Rather than roll up the dream, McLaughlin said the company continued to expand its distribution in retail as a bean wholesaler with clients such as national chains like Starbucks and local coffee houses like Onyx in Northwest Arkansas. Today 85% of the more than 10 million pounds of beans exported from Westrock’s international mills are sold into wholesale market to roasters like Starbucks. The remaining 15% of its production is roasted at the company’s North Little Rock plant, which has a capacity of 33 million pounds per year. The Westrock branded coffee is bagged and sold at retail in national distribution for Kroger and Food Lion, and regional grocers such as Harp’s, Hanford, Winn Dixie and Bi-Lo. Westrock also has a branded product at Amazon.com and Costco.com and more recently Walmart.com. Westrock Coffee Company’s Little Rock roasting facility has a 33 million pound annual capacity and employs 50. Westrock employs about 50 in the Little Rock area who manage the bean roasting and distribution business. While product is sourced largely from Africa, McLaughlin said the roasting is done in Little Rock and that includes a private label business for Sam’s Club. McLaughlin said Westrock is hoping for shelf space in Walmart’s grocery aisle and now the company is better equipped to market the branded product. Westrock is the official coffee of the Denver Broncos as well as the Arkansas Razorbacks, and the company continues to expand its brand into the hospitality sector. She said this past year the company was able to double its growth rate by expanding into foodservice with a few local hospitals, while also garnering a contact with Omni and MGM Hotels and resorts around the world. GOOD FIT Westrock could be a good fit as a Walmart supplier when it comes to sustainability. Westrock boasts of its transparent supply chain for coffee that also benefits some of the poorest countries in the world. In Rwanda, Westrock’s business model has put more than $100 million into the pockets of small coffee farmers over the past six years, according to Westrock’s 2016 Sustainability Report. Through Westrock’s Rwanda Trading Company, nearly 9,000 farmers have taken part in training programs in agribusiness to help increase plant yields while also caring for the land. The training provided by Westrock has helped the average family household coffee yields increase 155% over the past six years, pushing household income up 61%, according to the company. The Tembo Coffee Company in Tanzania has followed a similar model since 2012. Westrock has been able to train more than 5,000 coffee farmers in similar agribusiness programs creating 150% growth in export volume since 2013. Westrock says 53% of the farmers in Tanzania are women. Westrock sources 40 million pounds of coffee beans annually from its contract farmers in Africa. Westrock also has made more than $16 million in pre-harvest loans to small family farmers so the women could afford to send their children to school. Tuition is due before the harvest and families typically don’t have the money to cover school costs until after they are paid for the harvest. Ford saw an opportunity to bridge that gap and routinely makes loans to families which are paid back when the harvest comes in. All of this “do-good” focus by Westrock gives the company a compelling story and it lines up with Wal-Mart’s broad corporate platforms on sustainability, women’s empowerment and ethical sourcing. But McLaughlin said the coffee quality will have to speak for itself. Brad Feagins, company advisor to Walmart agreed, saying one thing he’s learned in three decades of retail is that items matter, not categories when it comes to merchandising. McLaughlin said the owners are mission oriented when it comes to Westrock, but that doesn’t mean it’s a non-profit venture. Coffee is big business, and just last year Westrock spent $60 million sourcing coffee sustainably from around the world and hopes to buy more by growing its distribution further in 2017. Walmart could be key to making that happen, but if not, the company will continue to seek shelf space elsewhere. “We make money and the more we make by expanding our distribution, the more we can give back farmers,” McLaughlin said.

Each bag contains precut and measured vegetables and other ingredients. "Chef Robert Irvine exclusively approached Walmart with his Sidekicks line because of our strong distribution and trusted name that could deliver these fresh side dishes to our stores across the U.S. We have a commitment to quality, healthier products at an affordable price, as well as helping families save time, so we thought this was a great partnership," Walmart spokesperson Marilee McInnis told SN. The line also appealed to Walmart since a portion of the proceeds go to the Robert Irvine Foundation which supports members of the military and their families. “I am excited to announce that my Signature Sidekicks are rolling out to Walmart stores nationwide right now!” said chef Robert Irvine in a Facebook post, Monday. “My personal recipes, fresh ingredients, 3 easy steps, and less than 10 minutes to prepare. A portion of the proceeds goes to my foundation to support our military and their families.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your Supermarket News ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles Clinton lauds Walmart in document released by WikiLeaks 9   Walmart impressed by fresh results   EXCLUSIVE COSMETICS LINE TO DEBUT AT WAL-MART   Hy-Vee Discusses Origin of Exclusive Beer   Aldi Introduces Exclusive Premium Brand   Latest News 5 things we learned from SpartanNash's first corporate responsibility report Stern: 'How will you respond to hyper-local trend?'

Quisha Hill said that she shops at a particular Walmart location in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, and early Wednesday morning was no different. At about 7:23 a.m., she was getting to pay for her groceries when the bizarre incident occurred. “I come in to grab couple items, and as I while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby, and he’s like, ‘I’m taking the baby, I’m stealing her. I’m taking her. Call 911. Call 911.'” The man then started choking the baby. Other shoppers heard Quisha’s screams and tackled the man, then held him to the floor until police arrived. In the scuffle, Quisha was able to get her baby back. “That’s when tons of Walmart workers come over to help me get her out. She is still restrained. As soon as they come over to get him, they body slam him down to the ground. He punches one of the security officers. And then that’s when we have the baby back.” Hill says that man at one point tried to put the baby’s car seat on his head and wear it like a hat, according to Fox 6. She also said the man appeared to be intoxicated, and that he spoke a foreign language that she didn’t understand. RT 41ActionNews “Police: Man arrested for choking 4-month-old infant at Walmart in Overland Park – … pic.twitter.com/R2oI9YGgFH” — The Now KC (@TheNowKC) October 19, 2016 Overland Park police have arrested a suspect, but as of this writing, have not released his name or his mugshot. Neither have they confirmed whether or not he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. Fortunately, the baby is going to be OK. Quisha said she turned red for a few seconds but was back to normal pretty quickly, and is no worse for wear. She is expected to make a full recovery. In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson promised to cooperate fully with the police. “Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store, and we’re working with police to make sure they have all the information they need.” In the overwhelming majority of child abuse cases, the perpetrator is close to the victim: a parent or relative, a caregiver, a teacher, or a member of the clergy. Incidents of strangers randomly attacking children and babies are exceptionally rare, but not unheard of. One of the most tragic cases ever of an infant being assaulted by a stranger came out of Georgia in 2013. As CNN reported at the time, Sherry West was pushing her 13-month-old baby in a stroller when two youths approached her and demanded money. “A boy approached me and told me he wanted my money, and I told him I didn’t have any money. And he said, ‘Give me your money or I’m going to kill you and I’m going to shoot your baby and kill your baby,’ and I said, ‘I don’t have any money,’ and ‘Don’t kill my baby.'” West struggled with the youths over her purse, and eventually one of them fired his weapon. One shot grazed the woman’s head, another shot was fired at her leg, and a third shot was fired at the baby’s face, striking and killing him.

That's where they found the 24-year-old bleeding from the chest. Walmart shopper Irma Garcia and others were trying to help him stay alive. "I witnessed two gentlemen, they were standing over here by the tables," said Garcia, who just happen to park nearby. "Both gentlemen walked towards the PT Cruiser (parked on the side.) The gentleman in the gray shirt was arguing with the employee of Walmart. They pushed each other, all of the sudden. The guy in the gray shirt stabbed the employee." The man in the gray shirt quickly ran off. Meanwhile, Garcia jumped into action. "We grabbed some rags to stop the bleeding, that's when these guys showed up and the ambulance took him," she said. Investigators determined the fight was over the affections of a young woman who worked at the McDonald's inside the Walmart. Sheriff K9 units were dispatched, and within a few hours, the suspect was captured by a deputy and his K9. "It's scary when it hits close to home," says Rebecca Slovacek, who runs a neighborhood watch program in the area. "Because we're such a small close knit area, everyone knows everybody. That's the scary part about it, when something like this happens in broad daylight." Crosby Independent School District lifted a lock-in of their campuses after the suspect was captured.

Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained popularity worldwide due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. Chinese food safety practices have raised concern about contamination in China and in countries where Chinese food products are imported, and the new project aims to trace the movement of meat, vegetables and other products. China's government has identified food authentication and supply chain tracking as a critical step to quickly find and eliminate sources of contamination. With blockchain, the movement of food products can be digitally tracked from suppliers including farms to the store shelves and ultimately to consumers. IBM said this could be done on the blockchain, which provides a permanent record of transactions that cannot be altered. This would serve as a viable alternative to traditional paper tracking and manual inspection systems, IBM added. "Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains," said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president, industry platforms, at IBM in New York. When applied to the food supply chain, product information such as farm origin details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, storage temperatures and shipping details are digitally connected to food items, and the information is entered on the blockchain at every step of the process, IBM said. The information in each transaction is agreed upon by all members of the business network. Once a consensus is reached, it becomes a permanent record that cannot be changed, IBM said. The record created by the blockchain can also help retailers like Walmart better manage the shelf-life of products in individual stores, further strengthening safeguards related to food authenticity. The world's largest retailer also announced the opening of the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing in response to China's initiatives on food safety, and said blockchain technology would be a major part of the program. Walmart said it will be using IBM Blockchain based on the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project, which is an open source software project that builds blockchain tools. Tsinghua University, located in Beijing, will serve as an academic partner and advisor on the blockchain project.

Foundation to Help Strengthen Local Communities Oct 19, 2016, 10:24 ET from Partnership With Native Americans Funding granted to PWNA is part of more than $5 million in grants awarded by the Walmart Foundation to help strengthen local communities     Facebook Twitter Pinterest     Facebook Twitter Pinterest × Funding granted to PWNA is part of more than $5 million in grants awarded by the Walmart Foundation to help strengthen local communities DALLAS, Oct. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Partnership With Native Americans is one of nine organizations selected by the Walmart Foundation to receive grants to fund programs that address hunger and nutrition education, as a way to strengthen local communities. The USDA reports that 42.2 million people in America are at risk of struggling with hunger and this funding will increase access to nutrition education and emergency meals. Partnership With Native Americans was awarded $258,000, which will help serve 26,000 Native American people through the following programs: providing children nutritious snack and juice service through food pantries distributing emergency food supplies through food pantries providing fresh produce at eight elder nutrition centers supporting 10 community garden projects conducting canning and healthy cooking training in 15 communities equipping a mobile nutrition and training unit for use in Southwest communities More than any other group in the U.S., Native Americans are impacted by food insecurity, affecting 23 percent of Native families. Many reservation communities face high rates of impoverishment and are located in food deserts – areas vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables and other whole foods – putting them at greater risk of diabetes and other nutrition-related illnesses.   "Support from the Walmart Foundation will enable us to continue delivering on our ongoing commitment to increase availability of healthier food options in remote tribal communities, by supporting community gardens, nutrition education, food pantries and other nutrition programs," said Robbi Rice Dietrich, President/CEO of Partnership With Native Americans.   "Collaboration and dedication are key to making a positive impact on the issue of hunger in local communities across the U.S. We're proud to work with Partnership With Native Americans to support hunger relief and nutrition education for individuals and families in need. Thanks to the programs these grantees have implemented, thousands of underserved people will have access to emergency meals and information to help themselves and their families make healthier life choices," said Carol May, Program Manager of the Walmart Foundation. The grant awarded to Partnership With Native Americans is one of nine grants awarded to national nonprofit organizations totaling more than $5 million to fund nutrition education and emergency meal programs with a focus on helping reach underserved populations. In October of 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving affordability by lowering the "true cost" of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. The commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those in need and invest in programs that provide nutrition education for 4 million people, by 2020.

The organization collaborates with its reservation partners to provide immediate relief and support long-term solutions for strong, self-sufficient Native American communities. Established in 1990, PWNA works through its grassroots partnerships and distribution network to improve the lives of 250,000 Native Americans each year.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Over the past few years, I have had a brisk, if intermittent, correspondence with a professor of my acquaintance. Our subject: Wal-Mart. Specifically, wages at Wal-Mart, and whether (and then why) they could go up. One of those conversations was already turned into a column, and this morning, he e-mailed me to ask what I thought about Neil Irwin’s latest piece in the New York Times on the outcomes of the company’s fairly recent foray into higher average wages. Irwin’s conclusion: Paying higher wages has allowed Wal-Mart to attract better workers, resulting in cleaner, nicer stores. My conclusion: All is proceeding as I have foreseen. That is, I predicted that workers would like making more per hour, rather than less (who wouldn’t?), and that this would allow Wal-Mart to attract a better class of worker, or at least keep the workers it had around longer, reducing turnover costs and allowing the company to deliver a better customer experience. But I was less sure that this would actually deliver increased profits; indeed, Irwin notes that it hasn't. Revenue is up, as are ratings in customer surveys. But so far, that’s not translating into enhanced profitability. “Operating income for Walmart’s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter,” Irwin writes, “reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments.” It would be great news if Wal-Mart could turn into a higher-wage employer, offering a real path to the middle class for people who aren’t interested in picking up and moving to a bigger city. Its stores are ubiquitous in America’s hinterlands, and as a massive national brand, it could offer real opportunity to folks who don’t seem to be getting much of it right now. But I’ve long been skeptical that Wal-Mart could remake itself as a new-model engine of opportunity to replace America’s vanished manufacturing plants. And so far, Wal-Mart’s not giving me much reason to revisit my skepticism. For years before Wal-Mart finally raised its wages, comparisons between Wal-Mart and Costco were a perennial staple of left-wing writers, a genre that I dubbed “Costco shows it’s possible” (to run a big-box store with highly paid staff). Costco paid its workers generously, ran their argument, and was doing very well; ergo, Wal-Mart could do so, too, and it was only refusing out of stupidity or sheer meanness. This argument naturally segued into arguments for raising the minimum wage to $12 or $15 an hour; if companies were too evil or stupid to see where their best interests lay, then public-spirited politicians would have to take matters into their own hands. This never made much sense: The fact that one retailer manages to pay relatively high wages in no way proves that every retailer should therefore follow suit. Costco and Wal-Mart look a lot alike to the sort of people who write articles comparing Costco and Wal-Mart: large spaces filled with stuff, both of which are visited at best infrequently by the writers. In fact, however, they have completely different business models. Costco provides bulk goods to a relatively affluent demographic that does not do the majority of its shopping there; Wal-Mart is a full-service department store where a lower-income demographic expects to buy the bulk of its daily necessities. Because it needs to be everything to its core customers, Wal-Mart’s stores carry about 25 times the number of individual products (different brands, as well as different sizes) than Costco stores do. This makes Wal-Mart's business vastly more labor-intensive, which in turn means that the company needs to worry more than Costco does about controlling hourly wage costs, and it gets less reward out of paying for skill and experience, because ultimately, there’s an upside limit to how much extra productivity you can wring out of clever, hardworking people engaged in the task of putting things on shelves. Meanwhile, since its business is pitched to a customer base that worries about every extra penny it spends, improving customer service won’t necessarily translate into higher sales; Wal-Mart's core consumer is shopping mostly on price. Though they didn’t realize it, the people who were arguing that Wal-Mart should adopt Costco’s labor policy were also arguing that Wal-Mart should adopt Costco’s business model, because the two are inextricably tied together. Unfortunately, Costco was already executing Costco’s business model brilliantly, which limited the upside to Wal-Mart crowding into its market (when it tried, with Sam’s Club, it didn’t do very well). And if you wanted to create Costco II, it wasn’t clear why you’d decide to reconstruct a massive legacy retailer in Costco’s image, rather than starting over with a new group of people who hadn’t spent decades of their lives learning to operate “big stores in small towns.” However, the “big stores in small towns” business model has reached the natural limits of possible growth; overseas expansions have not gone as swimmingly as Wal-Mart’s conquest of America, and if the company wants to grow further, it’s going to need to do something different. For that matter, with Amazon breathing down its neck, it may have to anyway. So when Wal-Mart went ahead and raised wages, I expected that this presaged some shift in its business model, as managers sought to expand the mass retailer into something beyond its core competency. So far, however, it seems, if anything, to be trimming back toward “big stores in small towns,” closing down many of the smaller, more urban locations that didn’t do as well as the company had hoped. It was never clear that it’s actually profitable to run that kind of business model by hiring and retaining better people, as opposed to simply hiring more warm bodies to put things on shelves at the lowest wage you can get away with paying. The most recent results certainly don’t offer huge encouragement to those who hoped it could. If cleaner stores and better-stocked shelves don't eventually translate into better profitability, the company will be under pressure from shareholders to shift its labor-cost model back toward its older, cheaper style. That’s unlikely to mean wage cuts -- cutting wages is nearly impossible, because it enrages workers, who leave, or stay on and carry out their work with surly indifference. Instead, if the pressure is severe enough, I expect that Wal-Mart will have to try to get by with fewer workers. With stores as big as Wal-Mart's, that will be a challenge, because no matter how good that smaller workforce is, it can’t cover all those square feet three times faster than a less clever or less motivated workforce. So far, my verdict on Wal-Mart’s experiment with higher wages is, as I wrote to my professorial pen pal: “Great if it works, but I’m not sure it works.” And as he wrote back: that “would be a great slogan for 90% of public policy.”   Megan McArdle is a Bloomberg View columnist who writes on economics, business and public policy.

At this time, the Company is working on meeting specific criteria presented by Walmart that will afford the Company the best chance of success while mitigating potential risks due to an initial lack of retail brand awareness.

This is the last phase of necessary documentation and Pro Prom believes the final permitting is imminent. Pro Prom will also be handling distribution, marketing and sales to Walmart Mexico (WALMEX). Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, "We are very pleased to announce our next production run and the introduction of our latest lemon/lime flavor."

Why is Columbia acting like Walmart? File Photo / Kadaja Brown By Bruce Robbins | October 18, 2016, 10:37 PM It’s hard to know how much money Columbia has already paid to the law firm of Proskauer Rose during its years of struggle against the graduate student effort to form a union, and how much it is still paying. Reliable figures are hard to come by on subjects like this one, but popular estimates run from several million to tens of millions of dollars. Every time I think back to the moments when the administration told my department that there are no “new lines” (that is, permission to hire new faculty members) in such-and-such a field, that retiring faculty members may not be replaced, that things are tight, I think of all that money, the hard-earned result of so much fundraising, and all of it going—for what? To stop the young people who do so much of our teaching and research from having any say in their working conditions. But why would we want to spend money on that? Proskauer Rose is widely referred to as a union-busting firm. Such firms seem pretty good at advertising their services while somehow also keeping a low profile. Common sense being what it is, the busting of unions is not something with which you want to be associated. According to Art Levine, who went undercover at a $1,500 per head union-busting seminar in Las Vegas led by Jackson Lewis attorneys, the name Jackson Lewis didn’t even appear on the sign outside the door. The client list of any given union-busting firm is also hard to come by, but the names of the companies that shell out for them do eventually become known. Alongside many university administrations, these names include Cablevision, Pfizer, IBM, Volkswagen (now infamous for its dishonesty), and Walmart. Unfortunately, it seems that the Columbia administration’s recent memo to faculty follows rather closely Walmart’s advice to its managers about how to fight unionization. What are nonprofits like us doing in the same company as these for-profit corporations? Corporate ruthlessness about employee wages and benefits is ugly, but at least it makes sense in terms of corporate principles, questionable as those principles may be. Universities should have higher principles, no? They are exempted from taxation because they are supposed to be operating in the public interest. How is it in the public interest to make sure that the people who do the University’s essential work have no one to support their interests and grievances and must depend instead on the hypothetical good will of their employers? Many of us faculty members have been wondering lately what it is exactly that administrators, whose numbers seem to increase a lot faster than ours, get paid to do. An upper-level Columbia administrator visited my department recently to explain the administration’s position on the union drive. The students, as I remember him saying, were claiming that their dental coverage had been arbitrarily revoked. This, he said, was untrue. In fact, he said, it was the insurance company that had cancelled the policy, not the University. The University had promptly replaced that policy. Perhaps, he conceded, the administrator in charge (not himself) had not advertised the replacement widely or rapidly enough. An email to a graduate student clarified this problem somewhat. The new coverage, according to the email, included one routine visit and one cleaning per year, pain relief and advice in case of a dental emergency, a $20 copay, and a 10 percent discount on other fees. Comprehensive coverage had disappeared as an option, even an expensive one. Our conversation seemed to indicate that the new policy was saving the University money, and that it was clear whose pockets that money was coming out of. How many graduate students are not living under or around the poverty line? In its memos regarding graduate worker unionization, the University administration all but complained that allowing a union in a private university would plunge us all into a terrifying new world of uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty is what graduate students are already living with. They had no say at all in whether or not they would have comprehensive dental coverage. The administration decided arbitrarily whatever it liked, whenever it liked, with no input from anyone else. Here are some answers, then, to the question of what University administrators do. They try to recruit faculty members into their anti-union drive (why else are they visiting so many departments?) And they… spin. Smoothly. Technically, no lies were told to my department. The substance of the issue had been, I think, misrepresented. But nothing was said, I would guess, that would be actionable in a court of law. The administration has likely been receiving high-quality advice from its very expensive counsel. The putative ill effects of a graduate student union have been mentioned often, and each time they have been soundly refuted. I have been told, for example, that the mentor-mentee relation would be endangered by the existence of a union. That was not my experience, though admittedly, this was at a public institution. Nothing the administration tells me to fear seems any more plausible than its account of the dental coverage replacement issue. What I do have to fear is every new step it takes that makes Columbia more like Walmart.

Van and Karen Bohrer are looking for B&M Baked Beans in 16-ounce cans, preferably in the northwest, and their fellow Taste of the Town readers found them all over the valley. Nancy Fiorello spotted them at the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market at 10440 W. Cheyenne Ave., near the 215 Beltway. Patti Bourgeois, Cheryl Berggren, Annie Bartholomew, Alan Van Ees and Ann Winchell found them at other Wal-Mart stores. Judi Granick, Bob Dunn and Ann Brown found them at Glazier’s Food Marketplace at 8525 W. Warm Springs Road, and Berggren added that they’re available at Nellis Air Force Base, for those with commissary privileges. Van Ees added, “Funny, most folks seem to want these in the glass jar packaging, not the cans. For every Jack, there’s a Jill.” More on Aunt Hattie’s cinnamon-raisin bread: Jerry and Barbara Brooks find it at Albertsons at 8350 W.

Virginia Rego is looking for chicken tortellini, preferably refrigerated and preferably by Buitoni. Chris Radcliff is looking for a local source for black bologna.

The funding together with the Walmart Foundation will support projects in applied science, education and communications, according to the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer at a briefing held in Beijing, where it also launched the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center to bring together local and international research. “By bringing together the best food safety thinkers from across the food ecosystem, from farmers to suppliers, retailers to policy regulators, we’ll accelerate food safety awareness and help make Chinese families safer and healthier,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said at the event in Beijing on Wednesday. Wal-Mart, which is overhauling its business globally to meet the challenge from e-commerce, had struggled over the years to adapt its stores to meet Chinese consumers’ tastes and compete with local online grocery providers. The retailer earlier this month boosted its stake in China’s second-largest e-commerce website JD.com Inc., strengthening its China presence after its sales were hit in 2014 by a series of food incidents. The new center will facilitate research in areas such as the root causes of food-borne illnesses, and developing solutions for China’s food supply chain. It also announced Wednesday three projects including one that brings U.S. and China academics together with local poultry producers Fujian Shengnong Food Co., New Hope Liuhe Co. and Guangzhou Jiangfeng Industry Co. to study safety in poultry supply chains. — With assistance by Rachel Chang Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home Beef Companies Failing in Effort to Slow Amazon Deforestation, Study Says America's top beef buyers have vowed to help stop the clearing of rainforest land for beef production, but haven't gone far enough, says advocacy group. By Georgina Gustin, InsideClimate News Oct 19, 2016 Much of the deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven by beef production. Credit: Getty Images America's top beef buyers have failed to tackle deforestation in South America despite some companies' pledges to source "deforestation-free" beef, according to a report by an environmental advocacy group. The growing global appetite for beef is the single biggest driver behind the disappearance of the planet's rainforests—and that is likely to expand as the world hurtles toward a population of 10 billion in 2050. Those forest suck up millions of tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide every year and are critical to solving the global climate crisis. Ending deforestation and restoring damaged forests could deliver as much as 40 percent of the emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the Paris accord, the international climate agreement that will go into force next month. The study, by the Union of Concerned Scientists, tracked the beef industry's progress toward "deforestation-free" beef, ranking 13 U.S. companies on the strength of their efforts over the past few years in South America, where deforestation rates have skyrocketed over the last four decades. While the beef industry and its customers, including major buyers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart, have made some commitments to sourcing beef raised on land that hasn't been cleared or burned for pasture, UCS researchers said they're not going far enough. Burger King, ConAgra, Kroger and Pizza Hut each earned a score of zero for failing to make any commitment toward buying "deforestation-free" beef. McDonald's, Wal-Mart and Mars earned the report's top scores. They have made public commitments to buying from suppliers that have pledged to raise cattle on land that hasn't been freshly cleared.   Burger King, ConAgra, Kroger, Pizza Hut and McDonald's did not respond to requests for comment. "McDonald's is very progressive and doing much more than other companies, and Wal-Mart also got a good score. Wal-Mart has had a sustainability program for years," said Chris Wille, a co-founder of the Rainforest Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, which did not participate in the UCS study. "When they or McDonalds make the tiniest move, it rocks the whole industry." UCS estimated that 10 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions is linked to the slashing of tropical rainforests. And a United Nations analysis in 2015 showed that the amount of deforestation caused by beef production is more than double caused by soy, palm oil and wood products—the next largest drivers of tropical deforestation. Yet the beef industry has only recently started to limit its impact. Over the past several years, a number of collaborative efforts have outlined pledges to limit deforestation—and accurately guage companies' attempts—but most of the corporate pledges have been aimed at soy, palm oil and paper. A report by the Supply Change project found that 61 percent of the companies active in palm oil have committed to deforestation efforts, whereas only 15 percent of the industries linked to cattle had done so as of last March. "The disparity is alarming because it is estimated that cattle production causes 10 times more deforestation than palm," the report said. "The cattle sector is the last to really address the need for some kind of guidance and metrics, and the last where new omnibus commitments are being made," said Wille. "It's really the laggard industry." The UCS report said even the companies getting high marks could be buying indirectly from ranchers that clear land. That's because cattle are bred, raised and slaughtered by different ranchers in different places, so even when a company buys cattle from a "deforestation-free" supplier, that supplier may have gotten his cattle from elsewhere. "Despite [our] progress, we recognize that there are still major risks of deforestation within our beef supply," Wal-Mart acknowledged in a 2016 company report. "Before cattle arrive at our slaughterhouse, it is possible that they might be traded from high-risk ranches to 'approved' ranches or slaughterhouses."   Wal-Mart, widely considered a leader in supply chain sustainability, also said ranchers "can simply re-register their operations under different names to access clean supply chains," and that a major deforestation pledge by major suppliers only extends to the Brazilian Amazon. "We are exploring ways to deepen transparency within our beef-monitoring system by extending our reach to other sensitive biomes," the company said. Between 1990 and 2005, beef production was responsible for 71 percent of the deforestation in South America. In Brazil, the world's second-largest beef producer after the U.S., 80 percent of the forests cleared were linked to beef production. Ranchers have cleared millions of acres across the continent for grazing land, but also for soy, most of which is fed to livestock, indirectly compounding the problem. "We did the damage 150 years or 200 years ago here in the U.S.," Wille said. "It's ongoing now in Brazil." In 2009, in response to pressure from advocacy groups led by Greenpeace, four of the largest meatpackers operating in Brazil signed a public agreement to stop buying beef from recently deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon. Between 2005 and 2014, deforestation rates in the region dropped 70 percent. This is at least in part because of the industry's actions, according to the UCS  report. In 2014, criteria for sustainable beef production, with deforestation-free measures, was formally approved by the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, a coalition of retailers, producers, processors and environmental groups. Those steps are now being developed by individual member countries, including Brazil and the U.S. At a conference held this month by the Global Roundtable, conservationist groups and the industry acknowledged progress, particularly in the Brazilian Amazon. Now their focus is turning to other massive ecosystems, including the Cerrado, a swath of savanna mostly in Brazil, and the Chaco, a woods and grassland ecosystem mostly in Paraguay and Argentina. "Issues in the Amazon have not been resolved, but there's progress," said Sharon Smith, who leads the tropical forest and climate initiative at UCS. "The conversation is expanding to how we begin tackling these other ecosystems." Earlier this year, an effort called the Forests and Agriculture Markets Initiative launched with the mission of securing deforestation-free commitments from the beef and soy industries in areas beyond the Brazilian Amazon. "The ecosystems of the Cerrado and Chaco aren't dense forests like the Amazon, but they store carbon, provide habitats for wildlife and provide other ecosystem services just like the Amazon," said Carlos Saviani, vice president for food sustainability at the World Wildlife Fund. But conservation groups say the industry will continue to threaten South American forests unless global agreements set stronger criteria, with more oversight of exactly where beef is coming from. "What we need to see is joint collective action, modeled using the lessons from the [2009 Brazilian] Cattle Agreement, that extends to more meatpackers, more ecosystems, like the Cerrado," Smith explained, "and all suppliers including indirect suppliers."

Vudu, which Walmart acquired in 2010, has up to this point served as a destination for customers to rent and buy content. The new program, dubbed Vudu Movies on Us, offers up thousands of movies and TV shows to watch free of charge and on-demand through an ad-supported model. It's a smart move on Walmart's part as it allows the company to generate revenue from older content and potentially attract new customers that may end up buying or renting premium content. To get started, you’ll first need to sign up for a free Vudu account if you don’t already have one. Then, simply navigate to the Movies on Us section to browse the catalog. All free content will stream in full 1080p HD resolution with Dolby Digital sound (when available) and can be viewed across a variety of devices including smart TVs, Blu-ray players and on streaming devices from companies like Roku and Google. You can also view content on your Android or iOS device or with your desktop web browser. Notably absent from the list of compatible devices is Amazon which isn’t all that surprising consider Prime Video is a direct competitor. If you’re looking for new release movies or current TV shows, you’re out of luck. What you will find, however, is a decent collection of older blockbuster and classic titles like True Grit, Mad Max, Abduction, School of Rock and Young Adult, just to name a few. As said Jeremy Verba, vice president and general manager of Vudu, correctly states, nothing is more affordable than free.

A DPS trooper preparing for work this morning, got quite the surprise when a burglar greeted him in his own front yard. And authorities worked overtime to find the people involved. It happened in the 7100 block of Columbia... A homeowner (who happens to be a DPS trooper) came out to his vehicle and found the suspect inside of it. "He noticed his DPS Tahoe, the doors were open and the back end was open, he went to that vehicle and confronted a man that was inside the vehicle, gave orders and commands for the subject to get out, the subject disobeyed the commands," says DPS Lt. Bryan Witt. The suspect jumped in his own vehicle and began to flee. It was then, the trooper fired one round out of his service weapon. APD officers eventually began to chase the vehicle. "APD briefly saw the vehicle, but due to the way the guy was driving, he lost Amarillo PD," says Witt. About ten hours later, the vehicle was located. One suspect is in custody in Canyon and one suspect is in custody in Amarillo. "What we've recovered so far is a couple of cameras, a portable breath tester, some ammo out of the vehicle," said Witt. "We believe the suspect had just began robbing the patrol vehicle at the time the trooper got..and came out." The trooper was not injured in this incident. And a brief lock-in of Greenways Intermediate was in place, as a precautionary measure Join us as new information unfolds.

(Jeff Chiu / Associated Press) THURSDAY, OCT. 20, 2016, 2:50 P.M. Wal-Mart’s China revival strategy calls for deliveries, some by drones, in hours Bloomberg Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Wal-Mart Stores has hit the reset button on its China strategy in dramatic fashion. The world’s largest retailer is making an ambitious push into e-commerce in China and aims to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. Shoppers in select remote villages could even see their Wal-Mart products being delivered by drones as part of a pilot project by its Chinese partner, JD.com. After unsuccessful efforts to scale up its own e-commerce network, Wal-Mart launched several new initiatives this week through a tie-up with JD.com – China’s second-largest e-commerce website, with almost 200 million active users. With this partnership, Wal-Mart said it will now be able to deliver its goods, ranging from American vitamins to Japanese hand cream, to more than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion consumers. “There isn’t another country in the world that represents the kind of retail growth opportunity that China does, given the growth rate of the market itself and the consumer demand here,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, 50, said in an interview in Beijing. “We see opportunities to partner together to provide goods to our customers, to leverage our supply chain and their digital capabilities.” Wal-Mart has a lot riding on its new online strategy aimed at getting a bigger slice of the world’s biggest e-commerce market. The retailer this month forecast that earnings will be flat the next two years while it invests in e-commerce. As it looks to China to fuel growth, cracking the Chinese online game will be more important than ever. “They have found a clever way to leverage someone else’s network to help them sell things online, and it’s easier to jump on the back of JD.com,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “They need to do something online to stop e-commerce from taking away their business. This is Wal-Mart’s solution.” Wal-Mart shares gained 12 percent this year through Wednesday in New York trading, outperforming the Bloomberg World Retail Index, which was down 1.1 percent. That still lagged the U.S.-listed stocks of its major e-commerce competitors, Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which gained 21 percent and 28 percent respectively over the period. McMillon, who took over the top role in 2014, said the initiatives will keep the company’s China operations on track to contribute a quarter of its global retail growth in the next five years. That’s despite sluggish sales at Wal-Mart’s retail stores in China while shoppers there increasingly turn to online websites for convenience. The strategy also gives it access to new Chinese consumers in smaller cities where Wal-Mart doesn’t operate stores. “The scale of the last mile here in China is unique – the economics related to it are different,” McMillon said. “We could have built this ourselves, but everything requires investment. What we are doing is being very deliberate about where we’re putting our resources and being open to working with others. In today’s world, there’s different ways to build that ecosystem that serves customers.” To reach customers, Wal-Mart is relying on JD.com and its extensive logistics and delivery network. JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu said the company wants to build a fully-automated delivery infrastructure that includes automated warehouses and distribution centers, self-driving delivery cars and drones. The company is delivering products to a limited number of remote villages in southern China by drones. Villagers who order Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club products could see some goods flown to them, according to JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner. Wal-Mart operates 420 stores and Sam’s Club membership outlets in the country. Wal-Mart’s global online sales are about $14 billion, or 3 percent of worldwide revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. About 20 percent of China’s retail sales are online, according to Ben Hassing, senior vice president for China e-commerce. Wal-Mart, which posted $482 billion in annual sales, doesn’t break out China revenue. The initiatives include guaranteed deliveries within two hours to customers who live within a few miles of 20 Wal-Mart stores initially. The U.S. retailer will also stock a JD.com warehouse with imported products from its stores globally to capitalize on Chinese consumers’ preference for overseas goods. That means such things as dried cranberries from the U.S., toothpaste from Japan and face masks from Korea available at Wal-Mart stores overseas will be available to Chinese consumers for the first time. The company plans to offer tens of thousands of items it imports from around the world to Chinese consumers within 18 months, Hassing said. The other twist: Sam’s Club stores’ upscale products are now available to all Chinese. A range of products from the membership store, which sells $3,000 rice cookers and $1,800 bottles of red wine, will be available for the first time to nonmembers online in China – at a 10 percent price premium. Wal-Mart has struggled in China with multiple attempts to get a foothold in the market since its entry two decades ago. In 2007, it acquired Taiwanese chain Trust-Mart, though the company struggled to integrate it into its wider business. In the last few years, it’s pulled back on an expansion as it closed stores in mostly second- and third-tier cities while opening new ones at a slower pace. The new strategy follows Wal-Mart’s decision to sell its Chinese e-commerce platform Yihaodian in June in exchange for a 5 percent stake in JD.com. The retailer had acquired full ownership in the business a year earlier, and the sale was seen by analysts as a retreat from China’s e-commerce market. Instead, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has used the relationship with the Chinese partner to grab Chinese consumers online. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart boosted its stake in JD.com to about 11 percent. JD.com’s Liu said that Wal-Mart’s challenge with Yihaodian was that China’s e-commerce landscape has two major players – Alibaba and JD.com – and not much room for the rest. “I think Wal-Mart did have success with e-commerce,” Liu said in a separate interview conducted in Mandarin. “If not, we would not have given them so many shares when we acquired Yihaodian.” Liu said there is potential for the partnership to go global, especially with Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of U.S. e-commerce start-up Jet.com in August. “There’s great potential for us to cooperate with Jet.com to develop e-commerce markets globally after we align our supply chains in China,” he said. To gain the upper hand in the retail battlefront, McMillon said the company needs to be ready with an array of tools and platforms that serve customers. “What we’re seeing is that customers want it all: They want to save money, they want to save time, they want to have access to the merchandise they’re looking for and sometimes be surprised by a new item,” he said. “They want to do that in stores. They want to do it on a mobile device. Some day they’ll do it with a virtual reality experience. They’ll get all of that.” Published: Oct. 20, 2016, 2:50 p.m.  Tags: business, china, drones, economy, retail, trade, Wal-Mart Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

"My heart dropped to the ground, and only recently have I been able to pick it up." The panicked call was from John's girlfriend's mother, Julie Caron, telling her to get to the scene of this precious couple's auto accident on Cooks Road, which happened on their way home from work at the Mt. Juliet Walmart. Theirs was a simultaneous work shift at Walmart that night for this young couple. Molly, also 16, and John are juniors and co-NJROTC students at Wilson Central High School, and they just celebrated their two-year dating anniversary Monday. It was an anniversary that easily could not have been. "Theirs is a love story with a tragic moment," Carol said. That tragic moment was a horrific car crash so close to home. It was already dark, on a street with no lights. When the car finally rested in the culvert, Carol said it was divine intervention that saved her grandson's life. "They went off the road, rolled and landed upside down and somehow the car 'tented' on impact and landed in a place their car roof didn't collapse," Carol said. "It was cradled somehow in a divot in the ground." Carol believes that tenting and random hole on the culvert saved their lives. Also, both were wearing seatbelts, according to authorities. "I'm extremely proud of them both," this grandma said. "John was a passenger, and just has his temporary license. He's a somewhat nervous driver." Said grandma, "it's a given he puts on a belt." It took first responders about 20 minutes to cut the young man out of the seatbelt. He was in and out of consciousness during the time, but Molly was luckily spared extremely serious injuries, and because of this, had to witness her boyfriend trapped in the mangled Ford SUV. That horrendous phone call about the accident came when Carol was preparing dinner. It came from Molly's mom, Julie, and then Carol, her husband, and granddaughter raced to the scene that was just down the road. When she arrived she was not allowed to go to the car and comfort her grandson, but she was able to ride in the ambulance with him to Summit Medical Center. "When I heard Summit, my heart felt better because severe traumas go Vanderbilt," Carol said softly. However, just a few hours later, she was in the ambulance again, racing to Vanderbilt where her grandson was transferred. "Luckily for John, he doesn't remember the accident, only getting in the car," said Carol. "Sweet Molly, unfortunately, was conscious and can remember seeing John trapped." When he came to, John somehow related real time to some years ago when his appendix ruptured and he was sick in the hospital. "He thought he was just sick, in the hospital," this grandma said. Sadly he was, in reality, way more than sick. The junior NJROTC cadet, and second-degree black belt, has five fractured ribs, a fractured sternum, suffered three fractures on his pelvis, a lacerated kidney, brain bleed, severe concussion and a laceration on his face. Molly was banged up bad, but released from Summit only to spend every single day thereafter at John's side. When John was released from the hospital on Monday the two cradled each other and held hands. "We are one big family," Carol said. "We love Molly. We loved them [Molly and her family] before, and we love each other more now." While Molly is John's beloved girlfriend, she's now his earth angel, solicitous and caring along with Carol. Hopefully she'll be back in school next week after fall break. Doctors said it will take John about three months to recover. "Molly is doing okay," said her mom Julie. "She has night terrors reliving everything. Time will heal this, and they will strive for new memories." Molly recently got her driver's license and Julie said both of the youngsters are full of faith. Molly takes AP and honors classes this junior year. Julie really can't put into words her feelings when a Good Samaritan called her about the accident from the scene. Those good Samaritans, who also held John's hand while he was trapped and upside down while waiting for paramedics, were just the first "rung" of a mammoth long ladder of supporters. When Julie posted on social media about the horrific accident to garner prayers, the post blew up and support in the Mt. Juliet realm rushed. Well over a thousand people "liked" the post, and subsequent updates. Both families do not take this lightly. And when John's a bit stronger, his grandmother plans to shower him with the emails, "likes," letters and well wishes. "Faith will get them through," she said. Carol knows about struggles. "I'm a realist," she said. "John is a realist. We know things bad happen. We know to take it on and overcome." Carol, 55, is able to be strong when she talks about the accident. She deals. A substitute teacher in Wilson County, she lost her brother in an auto accident in 2002, had four friends die recently, watched her mom die a year ago, and recently had open heart surgery. "My mind expects the worst, and when the worst doesn't happen, it's a party," she said. "The fact they survived is nothing short of a miracle. It's a blessing from God. I don't just attribute John overcoming his injuries to the fact he's young and in good shape. He was in the hospital five days. They expected him to be there seven to 14 days. I attribute it to God and all the prayers." Molly's mom put a little angle pendant on her daughter's visor to "watch over" her as she drove to and from home. That little angle is not found in the wrecked car. "We think that little angel protected and saved their lives," she whispered. "And flew away to protect others."

The Buzz: Fireline takes aim in Grand Chute Maureen Wallenfang , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 5:26 p.m. CDT October 20, 2016 Fireline Shooting & Training Center's new Grand Chute shooting range is similar to the range shown here in its Rice Lake facility. (Photo: Courtesy of Fireline Shooting & Training) 280 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Ready. Aim. Fireline Shooting & Training Center is a new indoor shooting range, gun store and firearm training business opening in Grand Chute at 4811 W. Michael Drive, on the south side of Walmart. It will hold a preview this weekend for members only, and concludes discounted charter membership sales Sunday. Fireline will hold a public grand opening Oct. 29. The family owned and operated business started in Rice Lake. This second 15,000-square-foot location was built from scratch for about $3 million and opened with an additional investment of $1.5 to $2 million for inventory and fixtures. RELATED:Read more about local businesses in The Buzz. RELATED: On the gun range with Citizens Academy The proliferation of guns in the U.S. was inspiration for the business. “Per capita, the civilian gun stock has roughly doubled since 1968, from one gun per every two persons to one gun per person,” according to a Congressional Research Service report. “There’s a need for this with the amount of firearms that have been sold and continue to be sold,” said John LaBonte, chief executive officer, who owns the Fireline business with son Georg and son-in-law, Brandon Powers. “It’s a facility that caters to all of the elements, from firearm sales to classes to the shooting range. We’re making sure we’re being good stewards of the Second Amendment,” LaBonte said. He describes shooting as a “perishable skill” that has to be maintained with practice. Customers will likely be a mix of hunters, sport shooters, gun enthusiasts and those who want to learn self-defense. “Ladies are the fastest growing demographic in shooting sports,” said Powers, operating partner of the Grand Chute branch. Some classes are for women only and will be taught by female instructors. Fireline’s Rice Lake facility has hosted both bachelorette and bachelor parties. Three things to know before you go: 1) Employees carry guns, either openly or concealed, as a deterrent and security measure. “It’s also to show that people carrying guns can be friendly and polite,” said LaBonte. 2) Customers who have concealed carry permits may come into the store with guns if their guns remain holstered. 3) Shooters may bring in their own unloaded and cased guns to the range for practice. They may also rent or buy guns to “try before they buy,” Powers said. Normal background checks apply to gun sales. Those using the ranges must register and have a photo ID. Minors under age 18 must be accompanied by parents. First-time shooters must be accompanied by an experienced shooter. The facility has 14 shooting lanes that allow handguns and rifles. “We do have supervised machine gun rentals with a training program that teaches fundamentals of how to hold and shoot,” said Powers. “The machine guns we have are for rent (to use on site only) and are not for sale.” Fireline’s pro shop sells pistols to hunting rifles and shotguns, ammunition, ear and eye protection, shooting accessories and holsters. Training courses and workshops are available at all skill levels. Minors may take classes, including home firearm safety, if accompanied by a parent or guardian. See www.firelinestc.com for range rules, membership, hours and prices.

(AP) — A labor union that has demonstrated against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. asked the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse a judge's decision barring it from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Wal-Mart had sought the order against the union and the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart in response to the group demonstrating and picketing at its stores over its pay and benefits. George Wiszynski, the attorney for the union, said the Bentonville-based company's trespassing complaint was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. "At the end of the day, Wal-Mart relied on the same conduct for its unfair labor practice, its National Labor Relations Board charge as it does for its lawsuit," Wiszynski told justices. Wal-Mart's attorney, however, said trespassing is a state issue and was properly before the judge. "Trespass, repeated, defiant trespass absolutely is a significant state interest," Steven Wheeless told justices. "Second, there is no risk of interference between a state court hearing a trespass claim and a labor board hearing about a labor violation that arose during the trespass." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included "flash mobs" where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans march and chant through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. The union has also argued that the judge's order was too broad since it bars entering Wal-Mart's property for "non-shopping" activities, rather than barring the demonstrations and other conduct that prompted the retail giant's complaint. The justices did not indicate when they would rule in the case. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo ___ This story has been corrected to show the union's attorney, not Wal-Mart, argued the National Labor Relations Board should have jurisdiction over the complaint.

Construction on Teterboro Landing, a 55-acre redevelopment, is nearly complete and all tenants are expected to be open by April, said Todd Schefler, executive vice president of development for Catellus. Catellus first bought the property in 2007. It was a former aircraft-parts factory built by the Bendix Aviation Corp., later purchased and closed by Honeywell. The place needed work, Schefler said. Catellus would need to demolish the 1 million-square-foot factory and remediate contaminated soil before even building. Schefler wouldn't say exactly how much Catellus spent, but said such projects typically cost between $100 and $200 million. It was a risk worth taking, Schefler said. "Finding 55 acres in Bergen County on a highway is almost impossible," he said. Is creepy clown craze killing costume sales? The two biggest retail tenants, Walmart and Costco, opened in 2015. The center also has a "Restaurant Row" along Industrial Avenue. Some of the restaurants, like Habit Burger and Panera, have opened, while Blaze Pizza, Sarku Japan, Texas Roadhouse, Halal Guys, Chic-fil-A and Chipotle are on the way. Chic-fil-A is the only tenant in the center whose building isn't complete. The former Bendix factory, built in 1938, produced equipment for the moon landing, parts for the F22, the Hubble Space Telescope and much of the United States' World War II airfleet. "There was virtually not an Allied aircraft that didn't fly without one of our parts during the war," Robert Sanders, a former plant executive, said in a 2004 Star-Ledger story. The plant employed 13,000 people at its peak. Teterboro was briefly named "Bendix" after the company, and a diner at the intersection of Routes 17 and 46 still bears its name. When it closed, it left behind contamination in the form of PCBs, chemicals believed to cause cancer. The plant's history is reflected in a small park on the property near Route 46, Schefler. The rise of the shopping center has transformed tiny Teterboro, which has a population of less than 70. A group more than twice that size works at Walmart alone. "We're very pleased with the development and how it's coming along," said Nicholas Saros, municipal manager. There have been adjustments: Catellus paid for improvements to ramps off Route 46 and surrounding roads. The biggest growing pains are probably for local police. Teterboro doesn't have its own police force. The Moonachie Police Department patrols the borough as part of a shared service agreement. The department responded to 220 motor vehicle crashes in Teterboro from the start of the year through Oct. 16. Before Walmart, there were typically less than 50 in a year. The stores have also been a source of crime, particularly shoplifting. This year, Moonachie police have made more arrests in Teterboro than they have in their own town, by a margin of 64 to 29. Each arrest can tie up an officer for an hour or more, significant for a police force of 17, Detective Sgt. Anthony Fugnitti said. While Sgt. Richard Behrens, the officer in charge of the department, emphasized the center is safe, its opening has changed the nature of their job in Teterboro, where calls used to involve fender benders in the Honeywell parking lot. Saros said both Teterboro and Moonachie would review the shared services agreement when it expires at the end of 2017. He said he meets regularly with Catellus and Walmart to discuss security. Tenants at the Teterboro Landing have reported strong sales, Schefler said, including from pilots at neighboring Teterboro Airport, who stop at Panera Bread for their morning coffee. It wasn't always to see when Catellus first bought the property in the midst of a financial crisis. "You draw a lot of things on paper," he said, "but you don't know how well it will all work until it comes to fruition and opens." Myles Ma may be reached at mma@njadvancemedia.com.

CDT October 20, 2016 Chesala Markham vowed to get justice for her son, Gilley, who was shot.  (Photo: WFAA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT WORTH -- The man arrested and charged with murdering a Fort Worth teenager says he is innocent. "I know nothing about it," said James Murphy, 37. Murphy spoke to News 8 from inside the Mansfield Jail, where he's being held on a capital murder charge and a second charge of aggravated robbery. Police arrested him yesterday, a relief to the family of the victim, Chaz Gilley. %INLINE% "He's off the streets where he cannot do this to another child," said Chesala Markham, Gilley's mother. "At the same time, it's extremely painful, because now I know the monster that did this to us." Markham says her son was a goofy and fun-loving young man who had recently started a job at Goodwill in Fort Worth. She says on Oct. 7 just before 5 p.m., Gilley rode his bike to a nearby Walmart to cash his first paycheck. "He was excited," she recalled. "He was going to buy a new cellphone, because he had dropped and cracked his screen." But Gilley never made it home. On the bike ride back from Walmart, she says, he was run over by a car and then shot twice. Doctors tried to save him, but he died the next day. "I'm never going to get to kiss my son's face again," Markham said through tears. She says police detectives contacted her to let her know of Murphy's arrest, and told her that her son was targeted in Walmart for the money he was carrying. %INLINE% "Probably about $400 in his pocket," Markham said. "It makes me sick." Fort Worth police could not confirm those details and said that the investigation is ongoing. Murphy does have a long criminal history, and court records show in 2007 he was charged with the murder of another Fort Worth teen, Kelvin Collier, who was 16 at the time. But those charges were later dropped at the prosecutor's discretion. Wednesday, the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office said it was because the prosecutor did not feel there was sufficient evidence. "It makes me angry, because had they worked harder, maybe if they dug deeper, maybe the could have found the evidence to put this man away," Markham said. Now, the mother says she's fighting for two teenagers, and she's determined that James Murphy will see justice. "No matter what I have to see, no matter what I have to hear, this man is going to see my face every single court date," she said.

Rae-Showna Jones, 17, disappeared in December 2015 from Saginaw, Michigan, but on Tuesday she was found wandering around the back of a Walmart in the southwest of the country. Police believe the teenager may have been a victim of human sex trafficking. Rae-Showna Jones, 17, ran away from home last December and had been missing ever since There was finally a break in the case on Tuesday when someone spotted Jones wandering near a Walmart in New Mexico The teenager was found more than 1,500 miles away from where she disappeared last year The teen's mother, Charlena Poole, pictured, said she was in tears the moment she found out police found her daughter Rae-Showna's mother, Charlena Poole, told Mlive.com that said she has prayed for her return every night since she vanished. 'I just screamed like I hit the lottery,' Charlena said. 'Me tossing and turning at nighttime, praying and almost about to commit suicide a couple of times, you know, thinking, where is my daughter, and who did this to her, and did somebody try to hurt her,' Charlena told ABC7. The teen was stopped by police who found her walking near a busy intersection in Rio Rancho near the city of Albuquerque. It was only when they questioned her that they found out Jones was a teen who had been a reported missing. Police say they are now going to speak to her to find out what had happened in over the last ten months.  Video Courtesy WJRT  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Woman, 48, arrested after DNA links her to 1989 cold case...

Share this article Share Rio Rancho investigators said right now they have no reason to believe there is any criminal activity involved but so far Rae-Shawna isn't talking Mom, Charlena, had been praying for her daughter’s safe return but was beginning to lose hope. She believes her daughter is a victim of human sex-trafficking Rio Rancho Police Lt. Nicholas Onken said that he was not sure if Jones was a victim of human trafficking or not. Although officers picked her up, she has so far refused to talk to them about how she ended up in New Mexico. Mom, Charlena, told police that she feels as though she has been to hell and back with the turmoil of losing her daughter. She ended up having to go through counselling in order to get her through, although she still faces a smaller problem of trying to get her daughter back home.  A GoFundMe account has been set up to pay for a flight to get her back to Saginaw, Michigan.  'When I go get her now, it's going to be a miracle. I can believe but then I can't believe that my daughter is alive and they found my daughter,' said Charlena. 'I just want to see her!' she said.

Advertisement On Monday (Oct. 17), a group opposing the expansion of Chico’s Walmart store responded to a recent Chico Planning Commission decision to approve the big-box’s plans. Brett Jolley, an attorney out of Stockton, delivered the appeal to the city on behalf of Chico Advocates for a Responsible Economy. That group, represented by Jolley, mounted a successful campaign against Walmart’s supercenter plans a decade ago. Those plans ultimately were denied by the City Council in 2009. Last year, the big box brought forward new expansion plans, which include a gas station and other external retail features. Opponents have gathered more than 950 signatures. The appeal will take the matter to a public hearing before the Chico City Council. A date is tentatively set for mid-November, according to Deputy City Clerk Dani Brinkley.

Third-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates, dragged down by the loss of U.S. media-buying accounts like Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co. in the past year. Some U.K. customers in finance and other segments have pulled back because the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union may hurt business. “We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the U.S., France and Germany, and the consequences of Brexit,” for the U.K. and the rest of Europe, Maurice Levy, the company’s 74-year-old chief executive officer, said in a statement. Publicis, whose clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nestle SA, reported a 0.4 percent decline in sales, to 2.32 billion euros ($2.54 billion), below analysts’ average estimate of 2.33 billion euros. Organic growth, which strips out effects from acquisitions and currency swings, was 0.2 percent, bolstered by advances in digital business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The French company warned in April that it would be hit by the loss of several media-buying accounts during the following quarters. That effect has been compounded by projects recently completed at digital ad agency Razorfish, at a time when new ones haven’t reached their full potential yet, Levy said. Sales declined 4 percent in North America in organic terms in the third quarter. Publicis fell as much as 6.5 percent, on track for the biggest loss since Oct. 22, 2015. The stock was down 4.8 percent to 63.8 euros at 3:14 p.m. in Paris. In London, rival WPP Plc lost as much as 3.2 percent -- a read-through from the slump reported by Publicis and the weaker outlook, Charles Bedouelle, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said in an e-mail. At 0.2 percent, organic growth at Publicis was slightly below expectations, and the company’s comments on the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 were circumspect, Bedouelle said in a note to clients.  For more on Maurice Levy and Publicis succession, click here. Although Publicis has decided to keep all its operations in the U.K. following the country’s June 23 vote to leave the European Union, many customers are considering moving London-based operations to continental Europe, “notably in finance but not only,” Levy told reporters. “They are worried that a hard Brexit could close some doors to European markets. They are very cautious.” At recent roadshows and private discussions with the French broker, managers in global advertising have all highlighted their fear that the market was too complacent about Brexit and political risk, Exane BNP Paribas’s Bedouelle said. “None were really seeing major impact yet they were expecting it to hit in 2017,” Bedouelle said. Publicis said it will raise its dividend payout ratio to 42 percent in 2016 from 39.5 percent last year, achieving a target it originally set for 2018. Levy, who has led Publicis into the digital age, plans to step down next year after almost 30 years as CEO. The process of finding a successor will start in November and is expected to be completed by February. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Bloomberg Shanghai: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has hit the reset button on its China strategy in dramatic fashion. The world’s largest retailer is making an ambitious push into e-commerce in China and aims to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. Shoppers in select remote villages could even see their Wal-Mart products being delivered by drones as part of a pilot project by its Chinese partner, JD.com Inc. After unsuccessful efforts to scale up its own e-commerce network, Wal-Mart launched this week several new initiatives through a tie-up with JD—China’s second-largest e-commerce website, with 300 million active users. With this partnership, Wal-Mart said it will now be able to deliver its goods, ranging from American vitamins to Japanese hand cream, to more than 90% of China’s 1.4 billion consumers. “There isn’t another country in the world that represents the kind of retail growth opportunity that China does, given the growth rate of the market itself and the consumer demand here,” chief executive officer Doug McMillon, 50, said in an interview in Beijing. “We see opportunities to partner together to provide goods to our customers, to leverage our supply chain and their digital capabilities.” Wal-Mart has a lot riding on its new online strategy aimed at getting a bigger slice of the world’s biggest e-commerce market. The retailer this month forecast that earnings will be flat the next two years while it invests in e-commerce. As it looks to China to fuel growth, cracking the Chinese online game will be more important than ever. “They have found a clever way to leverage someone else’s network to help them sell things online, and it’s easier to jump on the back of JD.com,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. Wal-Mart and its competitors in China are all suffering in sales lately because the e-commerce websites are taking away their business in everything except fresh foods, and this is Wal-Mart’s solution, he said. Wal-Mart shares have gained 12% so far this year in New York trading, outperforming the Bloomberg World Retail Index, which is down 1.1%. That still lags the US-listed stocks of its major e-commerce competitors, Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which have gained 21% and 28% respectively over the period. McMillon, who has run the company since 2014, said that the initiatives will keep the company’s China operations on track to contribute a quarter of its global retail growth in the next five years. That’s despite sluggish sales at Wal-Mart’s retail stores in China while shoppers there increasingly turn to online websites for convenience. The strategy also gives it access to new Chinese consumers in smaller cities where Wal-Mart doesn’t operate stores. “The scale of the last mile here in China is unique -- the economics related to it are different,” said McMillon. “We could have built this ourselves, but everything requires investment. What we are doing is being very deliberate about where we’re putting our resources and being open to working with others. In today’s world, there’s different ways to build that ecosystem that serves customers.” Wal-Mart operates 420 stores and Sam’s Club membership outlets in the country. About 20% of the retailer’s sales in China are online, according to Ben Hassing, senior vice president for China e-commerce. Wal-Mart, which posted $482 billion in annual sales, doesn’t break out China revenue. Wal-Mart’s global online sales are about $14 billion, or 3% of worldwide revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The initiatives, which include guaranteed deliveries within two hours to customers who live within a few miles of 20 Wal-Mart stores initially, will also see the US retailer stock a JD.com warehouse with its products from around the world. That means such things as dried cranberries from the US, toothpaste from Japan and face masks from Korea available at Wal-Mart’s stores will be available to Chinese consumers for the first time. The company will be able to offer tens of thousands of items from its Wal-Mart stores around the world to Chinese consumers within 18 months, said Hassing. Remote villages JD, a retailer with an extensive logistics and delivery network, is delivering products to a limited number of remote villages in southern China by drones. Villagers who order Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club products could see some goods flown to them, according to JD spokesman Josh Gartner. The other twist: Sam’s Club stores’ upscale products are now available to all Chinese. A range of products from the membership store, which sells $3,000 rice cookers and $1,800 bottles of red wine, will be available for the first time to nonmembers online in China—at a 10% price premium. The retailer has struggled in China with multiple attempts to get a foothold in the market since its entry two decades ago. In 2007, it acquired Taiwanese chain Trust-Mart, though the company struggled to integrate it into its wider business. In the last few years, it’s pulled back on an expansion as it closed stores in mostly second- and third-tier cities while opening new ones at a slower pace. The new strategy follows Wal-Mart’s decision to sell its Chinese e-commerce platform Yihaodian in June in exchange for a 5% stake in JD. The retailer had acquired full ownership in the business a year earlier, and the sale was seen by analysts as a retreat from China’s e-commerce market. Instead, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has used the relationship with the Chinese partner to grab Chinese consumers online. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart boosted its stake in JD to about 11%. E-commerce competition JD.com founder Richard Liu said that Wal-Mart’s challenge with Yihaodian was that China’s e-commerce landscape has two major players—Alibaba and JD.com—and not much room for the rest. “I think Wal-Mart did have success with e-commerce, if not we would not give them so much shares when we acquired Yihaodian,” he said in a separate interview. Liu said there is potential for the partnership to go global, especially with Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of US e-commerce start-up Jet.com in August. “There’s great potential for us to cooperate with Jet.com to develop e-commerce markets globally after we align our supply chains in China,” he said. To gain the upper hand in the retail battlefront, McMillon says the company needs to be ready with an array of tools and platforms that serve customers. “What we’re seeing is that customers want it all: They want to save money, they want to save time, they want to have access to the merchandise they’re looking for and sometimes be surprised by a new item,” he said. “They want to do that in stores. They want to do it on a mobile device. Some day they’ll do it with a virtual reality experience. They’ll get all of that.” Bloomberg Rachel Chang Topics: Wal-MartChinaJD.come-commerceAmazon More from this Section Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Pricing is a strategy, not a long term differentiator: Vodafone India More disclosure has pushed up executive salaries Many entrepreneurs don’t need subsidies Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Reliance Jio’s entry a boost for Ericsson, Truecaller and Lava Mobiles A new economic paradigm is being fashioned First Published: Thu, Oct 20 2016. 10 50 AM IST Read more from Livemint Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Snapchat said to have filed for IPO Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Latest News Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Snapchat said to have filed for IPO Pricing is a strategy, not a long term differentiator: Vodafone India Tata Motors says Tata Tech stake sale talks on; deal may take longer Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Zhownirovych, who didn't know the mother or her child, was until recently a pastor at a Ukrainian Orthodox church in Clifton, New Jersey.  'I come in to grab couple items, and while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby and he's like I'm taking the baby,' mother Quisha Hill told Fox 4.  Scroll down for video  Police say Oleh Zhownirovych, 54, attacked the child (pictured) at the store in Overland Park, just south of Kansas City, while she was in the checkout lane with her mother on Wednesday Mom Quisha Hill (pictured) said her 4-month-old baby girl  'turned red for a few moments.' She is expected to be fine, she added 'I'm stealing her. I'm taking her. Call 911, call 911,' Zhownirovych told Hill, according to the station.  That's when he allegedly began to choke the child — and the mom screamed at him and got him to stop.  'That's when tons of Walmart workers come over to help me get her out,' Hill told Fox 4.

He punches one of the security officers — and then that's when we have the baby back.'  Several customers and store security pinned Zhownirovych down until police arrived. Hill said her 4-month-old baby 'turned red for a few moments.' She is expected to be fine, she added.  Several customers and security personnel at the Walmart (pictured) pinned Zhownirovych down until police arrived Cops have not said if drugs or alcohol played a role in the bizarre attack. But Hill says the man appeared to be under the influence of some substance — and at one point even tried to wear her daughter's car seat as a hat, FOX 4 reported.   'It's a wonderful thing that the bystanders were there and able to subdue suspect until police arrived,' Officer John Lacy told KCTV.  Zhownirovych was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries before being taken to jail.   In jail, Zhownirovych listed his address as that of the Ukrainian Orthodox Holy Ascension Cathedral in Clifton, New Jersey. A rep for the church said he hasn't been employed there for at least 10 months, the Kansas City Star reported.    Read more: Stranger chokes 4-month-old baby girl in Overland Park Walmart | fox4kc.com Police: Stranger chokes baby at Overland Park Walmart - KCTV5 www.kansascity.c...

The purchase of the new transportation vehicle was made possible by a $125,000 grant from Walmart and the Walmart Foundation to support DC Central Kitchen in expanding healthy food access in DC’s food deserts. The new truck will allow DC Central Kitchen’s social enterprise, Healthy Corners, to deliver healthy food to partner corner stores in Wards 7 and 8. Healthy Corners is a pioneering venture that is sustainably expanding healthy food access in DC’s food deserts. DC Central Kitchen provides fresh produce and healthy snacks to corner stores in DC’s low-income communities, offering produce to corner stores at wholesale prices and in smaller quantities than a conventional distributor. The stores then sell the produce at below-market prices, making it an affordable option for the consumer. Instead of just giving away food, Healthy Corners has demonstrated significant demand in low-income communities for fresh, affordable food deliveries to corner stores. ← RLJ ENTERTAINMENT AND AMC NETWORKS FORM STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP FOR STREAMING SERVICES Unmade in America: Industrial Flight and the Decline of Black Communities → Facebook Feed Northwest DC Scoops Twitter Tweets by @NWDCScoop Northeast DC Scoops Twitter Tweets by @NEDCScoop Southeast DC Scoops Twitter Tweets by @SEDCScoop Southwest DC Scoops Twitter Tweets by @SWDCScoop The Washington Sun Twitter Tweets by @thewashsun Weather Washington Weather Forecast, DC (20001) Advertising View post on imgur.com Weather Washington Weather Forecast, DC (20001) Horoscopes Get your free daily horoscope + free daily forecast below.

This is especially true for those military personnel who have recently returned home and are in the process of transitioning back into civilian life. As the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart set out to showcase its military support with a $1.5 million donation to a well-respected military nonprofit organization, the Fisher House Foundation. Fisher Houses provide a home-away-from-home for military and veteran families whose loved ones are in a nearby military or veteran’s hospital receiving care. Walmart wanted to showcase its support for military members and their families during a holiday season that’s cluttered with philanthropic giving campaigns. To effectively accomplish this, Walmart and BRG Communications created a campaign that would rise above other holiday announcements and encourage more Americans to support military and veteran families in their communities over the holiday season. The campaign secured more than 700 national and local media placements, resulting in 31 million media impressions.

Quisha Hill said that she was in the checkout line on Wednesday when the man came up to her. “I come in to grab couple items, and as I while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby, and he’s like I’m taking the baby, I’m stealing her. I’m taking her. Call 911. Call 911,” she said. “That’s when tons of Walmart workers come over to help me get her out,” Hill said. “She is still restrained. As soon as they come over to get him, they body slam him down to the ground. He punches one of the security officers. And then that’s when we have the baby back.” According to Officer John Lacy, a shopper who saw the incident tackled and held the man until police could arrive. Police say that the man was taken into custody and that the baby is alright.   TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America The best and worst NBA number 1 draft picks of all time The 30 greatest black movie soundtracks of all time Michelle Obama's birthday!: 52 memorable moments to celebrate the first lady's 52nd year 15 gifts we don't want for Christmas Top Posts & Pages Tearful Omarosa says friends turned backs on her for supporting Trump David E.

Walmart Launches Free Streaming Movie Platform — But Don’t Expect New Releases Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Launches Free Streaming Movie Platform — But Don’t Expect New Releases October 19, 2016 12:24 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler more streaming options Vudu Movies On Us vudu movies streaming ad-supported ADS walmart retail another movie streaming option Free Older Movies Users of Walmart’s streaming video service, Vudu, have been able to pay for TV shows and movies for years. Now, the retailer has launched a companion service that will provide customers with free streaming videos — if you don’t mind commercial interruptions and movies that are a few years old. Walmart announced Tuesday the launch of Vudu Movies On Us, offering customers thousands of (older) movies and TV shows to watch on-demand for free. The service, which is supported by advertisements, will focus on offering customers blockbuster titles and other classic films, so don’t except the latest releases to appear on Vudu Movies on US. “As part of the Walmart family, Vudu is always looking for new ways for customers to save money – and nothing is more affordable than free,” the company says in a statement. “Millions of customers already buy and rent content on Vudu on a monthly basis. This new service provides value for customers who want to watch movies and TV for free, when and how they wish to watch, without sacrificing quality.” TechCrunch points out that while Vudu might be courting some Netflix or Amazon Prime customers, its true competitors will be other free, ad-supported services like Yahoo View or Sony’s Crackle. Despite an abundance of other services on the market, including those that do include new releases, Walmart believes there are enough customers to go around, citing a Deloitte report that found over 42% of U.S. consumers prefer to stream content at home, most from ad-supported services. Walmart, of course, is no stranger to streaming services. In addition to purchasing Vudu in 2010, and offering discounted episodes Emmy winning shows earlier this year, the company has pushed “cut the cable” promotions. In June, the company launched a promo urging shoppers to buy products that focus on streaming services rather than traditional pay-cable.

The baby was not injured, according to the Kansas City Star. A woman was standing in line with her child when a man she didn't know walked up and started to choke the infant. Bystanders intervened and subdued the man until police arrived and arrested him, the Star said. The baby's mother, Quisha Hill, told Fox 4 in Kansas that she often shops at the Wal-Mart where the incident took place. "I come in to grab a couple items and while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby and he's like I'm taking the baby, I'm stealing her, I'm taking her," Hill said, according to Fox 4.

That's when several nearby shoppers wrestled the man to the ground. Hill said the child turned red for a few moments, but is expected to be fine. At one point, the man took the baby's car seat and put it over his head and tried to wear it like a hat, Hill told Fox. Police told the Star the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child," a spokesperson for Wal-Mart said, according to Fox. "We're appalled this happened in our store and we're working with police to make sure they have all the information they need."

A shopper saw the incident and tackled the man, restraining him until officers arrived, police said. The suspect was taken into custody, and the baby is OK.

The sticks felt clinical, complete with an "active ingredient" list on the packaging. If you wanted to go wild, you could skip the tasteless "original" flavor and spring for cherry or mint. But seven years ago, pastel-colored orbs of lip balm called EOS began to pop up everywhere. They took over shelf space at Walgreens, then Walmart, then Target. Beauty editors at Cosmo and Allure couldn't get enough of the stuff, raving about flavors like honeydew and grapefruit. And then Miley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera, and Kim Kardashian were spotted whipping balls of EOS out of their makeup bags. Products from EOS—the acronym for the company's full name, Evolution of Smooth—are splashed all over beauty and fashion magazines. But the company's founders haven't spoken about their business strategy until now. In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, they told us how they created a $250 million company that has, according to consulting and research firm Kline, become the second best-selling lip balm in the country, after Burt's Bees, and outpaces Chapstick and Blistex, which have been around for far longer. Kline Research says that EOS has singlehandedly driven growth in the oral care category. It currently sells over 1 million units a week and future prospects look promising, since the global lip care market is projected to increase steadily to $2 billion by 2020, driven by demand for natural and organic products, which is EOS's speciality. "Not necessarily building up information about it was something quite deliberate on our part," Sanjiv Mehra, EOS cofounder and managing partner, explains. Mehra points out that as a small startup, they wanted to focus all their attention on creating products and distributing them. "As we've grown, we believe that it is important for consumers to know a little bit more about the business we are and the values we stand for." Rethinking The Tube Nearly a decade ago, Mehra, who had spent his career in consumer packaged-goods companies like PepsiCo and Unilever, joined forces with Jonathan Teller and Craig Dubitsky, who had spent time at startup incubators, to think about how they could shake up the beauty aisle in the drugstore. (Dubitsky left before EOS launched to manage a new oral care company called Hello Products.) The lip balm category struck them as a prime candidate for innovation, since the vast majority of products on the market "were indistinguishable" from their 100-year-old predecessor, Teller says. Many brands appeared to be driven primarily by cutting costs and competing on price, he points out. "It appeared to us that everybody in this category was being lazy. That was an opportunity." Lip balm tended to be treated as a unisex commodity, like toothpaste or shampoo. But, as they did in-depth consumer research, they found that the product was overwhelmingly used by women as part of their beauty regime. On sensory panels, users they spoke to explained that they would lose lip balm tubes in their handbags. Many liked the idea of pots of lip balm that were entering the market, but they did not like to apply it with their fingers, because it seemed unhygienic. But one of their most important findings was that they did not find applying lip balm fun or enjoyable. "The products that women depend on every day should deliver moments of delight that elevate these daily routines," Mehra says. So they set about creating a product that would be tailor-made for women's everyday experiences, using their own funds and startup capital. (They still have not taken in external investment.) They wanted to rethink the lip balm format from the ground up, so they brought in a clay artist who modeled different shapes. "We were trying to to make the product as imaginatively as possible and not create an incremental variant over what was already in market," Teller explains. Even though they were coming up with a radically different take on the lip balm concept, they didn't want to make something that would be a fad. "We had to do it in a way that was not gimmicky, so that it would stand the test of time," Mehra says. "We had to make a product and a package that would be seen as useful for a very long time." In his mind, this meant that the lip balm had to be effective and consistently pleasurable to use, not just a wacky new addition to the lip balm aisle. In they end, they decided to think about how the product would engage all five senses, from soft round packaging that felt good in the hands, to the colors of the orbs, to the smells, to the way the flavors tasted, and even to the clicking sound the sphere makes when it closes. They would price the lip balm at about $3, so that it could compete on price with all the other drugstore lip balms, but they decided to use organic ingredients. (Earlier this year, some customers who had a bad reaction to the product brought a class action lawsuit to the company, but it was quickly settled out of court and EOS was not required to change any of its ingredients.) Throughout it all, they wanted to focus on creating an emotional connection with the user, rather than being simply another commodity. So they picked the tagline, "The lip balm that makes you smile." Big Dreams But it wasn't enough to create an innovative new product. How would a startup compete in a market dominated by giants like Chapstick, which is owned by Pfizer, and Burt's Bees, which is owned by Clorox? Mehra and Teller explain that it wasn't easy getting into stores. Mehra was himself familiar with the process, and they also hired an experienced sales representative. But buyers at drugstores and chain stores didn't know what to make of this new product. Many thought that customers were creatures of habit who were loyal to their existing lip balm brand. "There were a lot of male buyers out there who would say that they didn't understand the product," Mehra says. This makes sense, since the EOS team had carefully designed the product for female users. But then they were lucky enough to get a meeting with a female buyer at Walgreens who loved the little spheres. They landed their first account with her, and after the successful launch of the product, Walmart and Target later decided to sell EOS on their shelves. This brought them to their next big hurdle: To compete with the industry leaders, they would have to scale very quickly. They decided early on to invest in their own equipment, rather than relying on a third-party manufacturer. Mehra and Teller remember going to engineering trade shows to see how they could get experts to create machinery for them. Ultimately, they managed to create a production facility that is almost entirely automated from start to finish. This has served them well, since they were able to meet the demands of every new account they landed very quickly. Marketing To Millennials Besides getting products on shelves, the cofounders wanted to create a buzz around their new product. They decided that their target audience was millennial women between the ages of 25 and 35 who were style conscious. EOS advertised in the same ways that the older brands did, through magazine and television ads, but they also became experts at influencer marketing, which they believed was a smart way to reach their demographic. They contacted beauty bloggers who reviewed the product and talked about it on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. They worked with millennial celebrities to get the word out about the lip balm through product placements and endorsements. EOS appeared in Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears music videos, was a headline sponsor for Demi Lovato's world tour, and Taylor Swift became its Asian spokesperson. "We became the largest advertiser in our category," Teller says. EOS has also worked to build a large social media presence. It now has more than 1.8 million followers on Instagram and nearly 7 million followers on Facebook. A photograph of a new EOS flavor can get over 40,000 likes. Finally, the brand partnered with other major players on the market. It collaborated with Keds to produce an EOS shoe that came with a matching lip balm. It worked on a limited-edition holiday collection with designer Rachael Roy. It created an Alice in Wonderland collection with Disney that sold out in days and showed up on eBay for hundreds of dollars. (Some are still being sold, starting at $75.) All of this work has paid off. In seven short years, the brand emerged from an incubator to become a household product. It has even spawned a host of copycats. Blistex and Revo (made by OraLabs) have spherical lip balms that take a page from EOS's playbook, while Walgreens and Sephora have created their own iterations of it. These days, the company sells over a million lip balms a week, which is more than they sold in their entire first year in business. For all this success, the company is working hard to continue innovating. It comes up with new collections regularly, so that there is a constant stream of new products on shelves. EOS already creates shaving creams and hand lotions, but plans to enter new categories in the future. As Mehra and Teller look back, they believe that their unique backgrounds allowed them to take on a giant of their industry. Mehra, having worked at major corporations, understood the ins and outs of big business, while Teller was immersed in startup culture. Says Mehra: "That approach of using an entrepreneurial mind-set and big-company discipline is part of how we do things every day at the company."

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Police are investigating after a woman said a man tried choking her 4-month-old baby in the checkout lane of an Overland Park Walmart. Authorities said the incident occurred around 7:20 a.m. Wednesday at the Walmart near 75th Street and Frontage Road. According to officials, Oleh Zhownirovych approached the mother and child in the checkout lane. He then grabbed the baby out of the cart and tried to steal the child. A fight ensued, and Zhownirovych began choking the infant until the baby turned red. Bystanders were able to subdue the suspect and held him until police arrived.  Elliott Hurst was almost done with his overnight shift at Walmart when he heard cries for help coming from the front of the store. “Some of the associates were up there and they were hollering, ‘He got the baby, he is choking the baby,’ so me and the security guard went up there and tried to get control of the situation,” Hurst told 41 Action News over the phone. Hurst said the security guard got the suspect’s hands off the baby while he grabbed the car seat. “I don’t believe I done anything different than what my parents or my brother would have done,” Hurst said. “That’s the way I was raised.”  Police said the mother did not know Zhownirovych and that he may have been under the influence.  The infant was treated at the scene and is expected to be fine. Zhownirovych remains in police custody. Police offered some advice if you find yourself in a similar situation. "The first thing I would want someone to do is to scream for help. The more people around, the more people see what's going on. They can probably aid or assist you," said John Lacey with the Overland Park Police Department. Walmart released the following statement:  “Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store and we’re working with police to make sure they have all the information they need.” Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the Overland Park Police Department at 913-895-6300.

While the rewards of running a family business can be great, there are significant obligations and risks that all family members should be aware of. Sam Burke Sam Burke Denton Record-Chronicle Published: 19 October 2016 05:51 AM Related Sam Burke Family businesses have an important place in America’s economy and our psyche. Family businesses (or businesses that start out that way, i.e. Wal-Mart, Berkshire Hathaway) not only make up a significant share of American businesses, they are tied up in our ideas about the best of the American dream. The benefits and rewards of working with and building something meaningful for your family are obvious. Locally, this ideal has found expression in businesses such as Gohlke Pools. While the rewards (financial and otherwise) of doing business with family can be great, there are significant obligations and risks that all family members should be aware of when deciding whether to run or own a business together. Historically, people who were in business together owed each other the highest duty recognized in civil law. This duty, which creates several obligations, is called a fiduciary duty. Fiduciary duties include the duty of loyalty, utmost good faith, candor, integrity and to refrain from self-dealing. If an allegation of a breach of fiduciary duty has been made, often the person who owed the duty largely shoulders the burden of proving that their conduct satisfied these duties. In the last few decades, there has been a movement to limit or remove these duties from business relationships, particularly between co-owners. For example, if your business is formed as a limited liability company, the duties that you owe to that business and the others who own or operate that business are governed by the Texas Business Organizations Code and the operating agreement of the LLC. These duties will depend on the position you hold in the company, the capital you contributed and your position in day-to-day operations. If desired, the obligations of any given member to the other members of the company can be very limited. For several reasons, the limitation of these obligations can be more difficult in a family business. One reason the limitation of obligations can be difficult in family business is that fiduciary duties can be created in multiple ways. Among them is a pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence. While the existence of a familial relationship does not automatically create this pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence, it is a factor courts will consider, and, as a practical matter, few family members will deny that a relationship of trust and confidence exists between them. The existence of that type of relationship can create fiduciary duties in a family business where ordinarily they would not exist. Also, during transitions of control from one generation to the next, additional complications can arise. As parents or other family members age and their ability to take care of their own day-to-day affairs is diminished, children or other family members often are given powers of attorney (or other written authority) so they can conduct business for their aging family member. Few people are aware that becoming an attorney-in-fact for a parent creates not only a fiduciary duty to the person you are authorized to act for, it also creates a statutory duty to account for every action that you take under that power of attorney. Imagine a situation where a family member who has been helping manage a family business and provide for significant health care has to account for all the actions they took under a power of attorney for a period of several years when they had no knowledge they had a duty to keep track. When this duty is not recognized and understood, it becomes very difficult and, at times, in the context of litigation, very expensive to account for the attorney-in-fact’s actions. A power of attorney or similar arrangement can create other duties that ordinarily would not exist in a business relationship. When well thought out, company agreements are designed to match the partners’ business objectives and contributions. For example, each partner’s obligations match their investment, desired participation in the business and the benefit they hope to receive from the business. However, family businesses at times are structured not with these business objectives in mind but as estate planning or asset protection tools. In this context, parents or grandparents are often identified in company agreements as having control of the business and as the individuals who will primarily benefit from the business, when in fact their responsibilities are limited or delegated to other family members. In such cases and during times of transition, without communication and planning, this can lead to a mismatch of power and responsibility. For instance, a child acting under a power of attorney might be assisting in operating the family business, but is a minority owner in the family business who does not stand to benefit (per the company agreement) from the business. When conflicts arise regarding the care of the parent or grandparent, whether it is time to take away car keys or to consider assisted living, these mismatches can create leverage that can lead to dangerous enabling of parents or grandparents or various types of litigation that can strain, if not destroy, family relationships. As with almost all problems, prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this case, prevention requires communication ahead of the stresses that create conflict. Family businesses deserve the place they have in the hearts and minds of most Americans. In most cases, they embody the best of the American dream. But, like all dreams, they can become a nightmare when communication fails or family members become motivated primarily by fear or self-interest. SAMUEL B.

Jeremy Verba, vice president and general manager, Vudu, said, "Vudu is always looking for new ways for customers to save money - and nothing is more affordable than free... Millions of customers already buy and rent content on Vudu on a monthly basis. This new service provides value for customers who want to watch movies and TV for free, when and how they wish to watch, without sacrificing quality." Customers can log on to Vudu from their browsers, mobile or living room devices, and then watch blockbuster and classic titles, including Mad Max, True Grit, Abduction, School of Rock, etc.. with no fees, no subscriptions, and limited commercials, in premium 1080p high definition, the retail giant noted. The movie titles include critically-acclaimed films, family-friendly features, date night movies, thrillers, documentaries and more. They stream in full HD 1080p resolution, with Dolby Digital sound when available, and can be watched across smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and TV connected devices such as Roku, Chromecast and gaming consoles. Vudu is also accessible from the web and via downloadable app for iOS and Android, including the recently released Mi Box Android TV device. To access Vudu Movies on Us, customers first long on to Vudu, then take the "New" tab on their desktop, or "Spotlight" tab on their living room or mobile device, then take "Movies on Us" to access these free movies or TV titles with limited ads. For Vudu, its Movies on Us service is the first foray into a free, high-definition streaming option. Earlier this year, Vudu was the first to integrate 4K UHD with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos Audio. According to Walmart, more than 42 percent of American households stream content at home. Among these, most prefer to watch long-form content like movies and TV from ad-supported services on their living room devices. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances U.S. Business Inventories Rises Less Than Expected In September AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Putin Calls Trump, Agrees To Work To Mend "extremely Unsatisfactory" Ties <<Previous        57 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Walmart's Holiday Helpers Will Speed Up Lines Wal-Mart Pulls Controversial Suicide Scar Makeup Kit Walmart To Invest $50 Mln In Logistics & O2O Grocery Platform New Dada, China Wal-Mart Stores Investment Community Meeting At 9:00 AM ET Trade WMT now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

MST October 20, 2016 "Positive Pat" Brocco speaks to 12 News about the thril of being on "Ellen" and inspiring others to lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle like he has. (Photo: 12 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST AVONDALE, Ariz. - Pat Brocco lost 300 pounds just by willing himself to walk to Walmart for lunch every day. That willpower turned the man formerly known as "Fat Pat" into "Possible Pat" because he showed himself and others what's possible if you just put your mind to something. Brocco's story of inspiration landed him on "Ellen" last week, and now he's back in Avondale after his experience meeting Ellen Degeneres and receiving a $25,000 check from the show and Walmart to continue spreading his message of positivity. The life decision he made three years ago saved his life and gave him national attention to help others struggling with obesity around the country. "A lot of butterflies, being on 'Ellen,'" he said. "My first thing is I'm going to be doing a bodybuilding show in June. We can talk to people, give them nutrition ideas, workout ideas. No matter how far gone you are, you can take your body and your health to a place that you've never been." As for his motivation, he didn't have to look very far. "I didn't want to not be there for my kids. I didn't want to give up anymore. I wanted to finally make the change," he said. "Just the other day, I posted a picture of playing with my son on the floor. At 600 pounds, I couldn't do that. I couldn't bend down, I couldn't get up. It was hard for me just to walk, and I'm just so happy that I made the change because I know he's going to appreciate it. I know in the future, I might live longer to spend time with him, to watch him grow up, to spend time with his dad." He also said he's gotten positive feedback from those inspired by his story. "A lot of people have been reaching out to me through my social media," he said. "I had a guy tell me I helped him lose 100 pounds, that I'd saved his life." Check out Pat's Instagram page to see how he's doing. You can also find him on Facebook at Possible Pat and Twitter @ItsPossiblePat.

Katie Turner and Dr. Diane Carnahan will hold the first Sidewalk Talk in downtown Stockton beginning at noon Oct. 22 at the Downtown Transit Center.

20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global kombucha market is expected to reach USD 4.46 billion by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing awareness of the health benefits associated with consuming probiotic drinks is projected to boost market demand over the forecast period. Kombucha helps to control liver cell toxicity and aids in detoxification, digestion, and weight loss. It also improves immunity and acts like an energy drink. Some of the drivers influencing the market growth are the ease of manufacturing and rising demand for probiotic beverages. Growing disposable income and the trend of maintaining a healthy diet intake has led to increasing demand for natural and organic beverages. North America occupied the largest market share in 2015 on account of a vast number of brewers operating in this region. Companies such as Buchi Kombucha, GT's Kombucha, Celestial Seasonings, and KeVita, Inc. have adopted expansion strategies to increase their presence in the market. Most of the companies have tie-ups with local retailers and health food stores such as Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Whole Food Market for the distribution of their products. Further key findings from the report suggest: The Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast (SCOBY) is the key ingredient for the manufacture of fermented kombucha tea Fermented drinks have gained wide acceptance in the healthy beverages industry Consumers broadly prefer flavored kombucha drinks; this segment accounted for 68% of the market volume in 2015. Brewers have launched a variety of exotic flavors such as coconut & mango, pineapple-jalapeno, guava, and berry. Other flavors extracted from flowers, herbs, roots, and spices are also used in the beverage. Asia Pacific is projected to grow at the highest CAGR on account of the growing demand for probiotic beverages in China, Japan, and India Companies have partnered with large retail chains and other distributors to cater to the increasing demand in the U.S. Major companies identified in this industry include Buchi Kombucha, Cell-Nique Corporation, GT's Kombucha, Hain Celestial Group, Red Bull GmbH, and Revive Kombucha among others Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4230368/ About Reportbuyer Reportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers http://www.reportbuyer.com For more information: Sarah Smith Research Advisor at Reportbuyer.com Email: query@reportbuyer.com Tel: +44 208 816 85 48 Website: www.reportbuyer.com To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kombucha-market-analysis-by-flavor-by-distribution-channel-and-segment-forecasts-to-2024-300348911.html SOURCE ReportBuyer Related Links http://www.reportbuyer.com Oct 20, 2016, 18:21 ET Preview: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic Market Analysis By Raw Material, By Product, By Application and Segment Forecasts to 2024 Oct 20, 2016, 18:16 ET Preview: 1-Decene Market Analysis By Application and Segment Forecasts to 2025 My News Release contains wide tables.

Scam Alert By Dumas Police Department SCAM ALERT!!!!!! In the past two weeks the Dumas Police Department has recieved several complaints of citizens having damaged computer equipment and contacting an online warranty company and being contacted by the same company asking them to complete a secret shopper survey at Wal Mart. In all instances the representative from this fraudulent company tells the victim they will send them a check or they get the victim to give them their banking info and they would direct deposit money into their account, they then either tell the victim they sent too much money by check and the victim needs to withdraw some of the funds when they deposit the check and send it back to the company, or they tell the victim they need to withdraw funds from their account and send them a cashiers check or moneygram to the company, then the direct deposit is not made to the victims account. The company name is Development Incorporated. If someone offers to send you a check and request you send them money back or wants you to send them money from your account before a direct deposit is made and accepted by your bank it is a scam. Never give your banking or personal information to anyone you do not know to be reputable. These scams usually originate from overseas countries. If you fall victim to one of these scams and send money or goods to these people we will most likely not be able to identify them or recover any of your money. If you do deposit a check in your account do not spend or send any of that money until you are sure the check has cleared the issuing bank or institution because your bank will debit your account if the check doesnt clear. When in doubt always contact your local law enforcement, and verify all checks through your banking institution. { Newspaper Template by bulletlink.com }

(AP Photo/Mike Groll, File) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on October 20, 2016 at 5:59 PM, updated October 20, 2016 at 6:23 PM comments ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — An investigation of state employees stealing from developmentally disabled people in their care found "systemic theft and mismanagement" of cash accounts of group home residents, New York State Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said Thursday. "With disturbing regularity we have seen the shameless preying on a vulnerable population by those charged with their care," Leahy Scott said in releasing a report that detailed 10 state caregiver theft cases that have been prosecuted. The cases included a staff member's Walmart shopping spree using residents' gift cards, an employee who used money from six residents to take her own family to a show, and a house manager who used residents' funds to buy himself musical equipment, a recliner and expensive sneakers. In each case, the employee was prosecuted and terminated from state service. Based on the 10 cases described in the report, the inspector general found the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities was deficient in its oversight, training and policies on residents' cash accounts. In response to the report, the state agency agreed to implement reforms including periodic audits of residents' cash accounts, more accurate logs of transactions and updated training for caretakers and supervisors at group homes.

The Kansas City Star reports prosecutors in Kansas’ Johnson County charged 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych of Clinton, New Jersey, with felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. It was not immediately clear if Zhownirovych has an attorney. Overland Park police say a man walked up to a woman who was in a checkout lane early Wednesday and began choking her baby. The woman screamed, and the man stopped. Police say people in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. The baby was not injured. Investigators say the man possibly was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Zhownirovych reportedly listed an address as that of a New Jersey Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral when he was booked into jail. The current pastor there told the paper Zhownirovych left his position as a pastor there about 10 months ago. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The factory’s close proximity to Harding means anyone in the area is subject to the occasional sensory surprise. One of the most notable products Schulze and Burch produces is Pop-Tarts — a Kellogg breakfast toaster pastry filled with a variety of flavors. Jessica Pratt, head of Human Resources at Schulze and Burch’s Searcy location, said they make strawberry, brown sugar cinnamon, blueberry, wildberry and peanut butter Pop-Tarts, to name a few.  “Now, sometimes you might smell cranberries or bananas,” Pratt said. “That’s coming from our B line, which produces hard granola bars.” Schulze and Burch run three lines of production over the course of two shifts, which means the ovens are running from 4 a.m. until 11 p.m. Consequently, Harding students could catch a whiff of an array of pastries baking at almost any hour from the minute dorm doors open until curfew.  Thousands of products are baked at Schulze and Burch each day, but their production schedule is entirely dependent on the demand of their clients. Clients like Kellogg’s and Quaker take inventory and order more Pop-Tarts and granola bars as needed. The Searcy factory then whips up baked goods that are eventually shipped to stores nation-wide.  Pratt said that although it is impossible to predict what flavor of toaster pastries Schulze and Burch will be producing from week to week, it may be possible to track what days good smells will be heading towards campus.  “It’s all about the wind,” Pratt said. “If it’s blowing in the right direction, campus is going to catch some of whatever we’re making that day. It is kind of exciting because people recognize that the place where I work is the source of all these good smells.” Weekend desk clerk for the Heritage Inn and clinical mental health counsel major Scott Lacy worked at Schulze and Burch during the fall of 2014. Lacy remembers the production floor being filled with the smell of whatever flavor of toaster pastry was baking during that particular shift. However, Lacy said a full day’s worth of the smell made it all a little less enchanting. “After 10 hours of either smelling or stepping on Pop-Tarts, they start to lose their appeal,” Lacy said. “I would still get positive comments all the time about how the factory would flood Searcy with the smell of blueberries or chocolate.” So on those whimsical days when the wind is blowing north, students become the recipients of a serendipitous perk of living in Searcy, and Harding University becomes the recipient of thousands of dollars worth of atmospheric aroma marketing — and we have Pop-Tarts consumers nation-wide to thank.   107 reads The Bison Multimedia See interviews, features, and more from the Bison's multimedia team.

Big companies push NW utilities to produce clean sources for electricity By Becky Kramer beckyk@spokesman.com(208) 765-7122 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Demand for carbon-free energy is starting to influence how electricity is produced in Washington state. In about two years, corporate and government clients of a Western Washington utility will be able to buy 100 percent of their electricity from new, renewable energy projects. Puget Sound Energy’s program is the first of its kind in the state. Customers who sign up for the voluntary program will pay more for the all-renewable electricity from the Bellevue-based utility, but they’ll be able to track their kilowatt consumption back to specific wind farms or solar installations. “They wanted something that was cost-effective. They also wanted to be able to point to a new solar farm, or a new wind farm, and say, ‘That was built because of our commitment,’” said Tom MacLean, manager of customer renewable energy programs for Puget Sound Energy, which serves about 1.1 million electric customers. Outdoor retailer REI, which has 11 Washington stores, was among the first utility customers to approach Puget Sound Energy, MacLean said. The utility has also heard from Target, Walmart and other members of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, which formed with the help of the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute to assist large corporations with affordable ways to reduce their carbon footprint. More than 60 companies are part of the alliance, representing hundreds of megawatts of new demand for renewable energy, according to World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based group. Like other Northwest utilities, Puget Sound Energy gets part of its electricity from hydropower dams and wind generation, MacLean said. But the utility also has coal- and natural gas-fired electric plants. Initially, Puget Sound Energy will limit the program to 75 megawatts of electricity. That represents the average output of two large wind farms, MacLean said. A large grocery store uses about one-half of a megawatt of electricity, so a company with 10 stores would require about 5 megawatts, he said. The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission approved the program in late September. State oversight helps insure that program costs don’t get shifted onto other utility customers, said Jeremy Twitchell, the UTC’s energy policy adviser. Puget Sound Energy is starting to market the new program to prospective customers, including local and state governments. But since the construction of new wind farms is required, the program’s roll-out is about two years away, MacLean said. Participating companies will sign 10- to 20-year contracts for the all-renewable energy, which helps give them price certainty, he said. Avista Corp. is also assessing customers’ interest in renewable energy, said Mary Tyrie, a company spokeswoman. About 1 percent of the Spokane-based utility’s electric customers participate in the Buck A Block program. Customers who opt in pay an extra $1 for 300 kilowatt blocks of electricity. Avista uses the extra money to purchase renewable energy credits, primarily from wind farms, said Chris Drake, Avista’s energy efficiency manager. The credits offset electricity in Avista’s portfolio generated from burning fossil fuels. Puget Sound Energy also offers the purchase of renewable energy credits to its residential and commercial customers, MacLean said. Though they have similar goals, the new program better fits the needs of large, corporate customers, he said. Corporate clients will be able to tout their participation in specific projects that help reduce the nation’s carbon emissions. “The companies can say, ‘Those wind turbines, or those solar panels, are our project. They were built for us,’” said Twitchell, the energy policy adviser.

Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Tuesday 15th November 2016 | Cambridge, UK Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Film: American Honey Immersive, modern and surreal: American Honey is a coming-of-age story which is both sensual and disconcerting, says Sarah-Anne Aarup Sasha Lane plays Star, the film’s protagonist A24 by Sarah-Anne Aarup Thursday October 20 2016, 9:49pm Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp American Honey, now showing at the Arts Picturehouse, plunges you into an exciting and exploitative world of door-to-door magazine subscription sales in a dystopic vision of the United States, rife with drug epidemics, economic inequality and shattered families. The opening scene of the teenage protagonist Star (Sasha Lane) standing in a dumpster to scavenge for food behind a supermarket announces the flip side of the American Dream. Star decides to break out from her desperate life in Oklahoma when she locks eyes with Jake (Shia LaBeouf), a misfit dancing with his friends in a Walmart. She leaves her younger siblings with a sleazy relative before heading off to Kansas City with Jake and his crew, who offer her the opportunity to become part of their team of itinerant salesmen. Jake entices Star with the prospect of a job, a surrogate family, and even love. But what starts out as a care-free road trip through the American Midwest slowly turns into a bad trip as unexpected and surreal situations break out. The stifling pattern of work-play-travel echoes the absorbing hip hop and rap soundtrack of the salesmen’s existence. The question is, which path will Star choose? And does she have a choice? American Honey’s explosive, highly sensual and personal coming-of-age story makes you laugh, yet all the scenes are tinged with an expectation of violence, and a gut feeling that something could go wrong in a split second. While Jake trains Star, he shares his biggest sales secret: judge the potential client in the first split second and adapt your spiel, because you aren’t selling magazines, you’re actually selling yourself. So does Jake actually care about Star, or is it all a mask, as the crew manager Krystal (Riley Keough) tells Star? British director Andrea Arnold majestically orchestrates this 163-minute epic and immersive experience, and her work was justly awarded the prestigious Jury Prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The acting is striking and nuanced; Sasha Lane made a riveting film debut as Star, and Riley Keough – Elvis Presley’s granddaughter – was spot on in her interpretation of the ruthless Krystal. This film echoes Larry Clark and Harmony Korine’s works, such as Kids, Ken Park and Spring Breakers – and most definitely surpasses the latter in cinematic eloquence and narrative nuance. The filmic aesthetics of American Honey are mesmerising and contemporary, with Instagram-ish lighting and a perpetually wavering camera that echoes mobile phone filming. Go for a ride with American Honey for its coming-of-age story, social exposé of a decaying American society, impressive acting, engrossing soundtrack and beautiful 21st-century American landscape Most read Latest stories Theatre / Cambridge theatre has a class problem 11 November 2016 News / ‘This experience has been detrimental to my mental health’ – intermitting as a graduate 11 November 2016 Features / Why can’t Cambridge embrace my interracial relationship? 11 November 2016 Comment / Brexit means Brexit – and that our political language needs to change 13 November 2016 Reviews / Film: Nocturnal Animals 11 November 2016 Comment / Keeping term keeps homesick students from finding relief 15 November 2016 Culture / From Cindies to Tokyo: dark clouds and natural disasters 15 November 2016 Fashion / Part II: the sociology of Pink 15 November 2016 Sport / CUWBC continue their unrelenting success at Fours Head of the River Race 15 November 2016 News / ‘Easy answers to difficult questions’: the Any Questions? panel on Brexit and Trump 14 November 2016 Sponsored links Limo hire Microsoft Research Back to top First published in 1947, Varsity is the independent student newspaper for the University of Cambridge.

(John Bazemore/AP) October 20 TECHNOLOGY Microsoft’s shares surge to record high Microsoft reported adjusted revenue and profit that blew past analysts’ estimates Thursday, as soaring sales from its cloud business pushed the technology giant’s shares to an all-time high. Microsoft’s shares rose 5.8 percent, to $60.59, in after-hours trading. The Redmond, Wash.-based company said revenue from its flagship cloud product Azure, which businesses can use to host their websites, apps or data, rose 116 percent. Revenue from its overall Intelligent Cloud business, which sells computer services and storage to corporate customers, rose 8.3 percent, to $6.38 billion. This beat analysts’ average estimate of $6.27 billion, according to the research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Under chief executive Satya Nadella, Microsoft has focused on cloud services and mobile applications as growth slows in its traditional software business. Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.9 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to the research firm IDC, although that was much less than the 7.1 percent it had previously estimated. — Reuters HOUSING Home sales rebound despite tight supply More Americans bought homes in September, many for the first time, despite a persistent shortage of properties for sale. The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, the strongest pace since June. Sales rose across the country: 5.7 percent in the Northeast, 5 percent in the West, 3.9 percent in the Midwest and 0.9 percent in the South. Demand for homes is solid, but supplies are weak. A solid job market and low mortgage rates are bringing buyers into the market, but they are not finding many homes for sale. Mortgage rates remain at near-historic lows. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 3.52 percent, still close to the record-low 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage rose from 2.76 percent to 2.79 percent. The National Association of Realtors said first-time home buyers accounted for 34 percent of the purchases, the most since July 2012. — Associated Press Also in Business ● Hyundai is recalling nearly 63,000 midsize cars in the United States because the panoramic glass sunroofs can come loose and fly into traffic. The recall covers certain Sonata midsize cars from the 2015 and 2016 model years. The South Korean automaker said that wind-deflector anchor plates in front of the sunroofs were not bonded properly to the cars. A loose deflector can detach and interfere with the roof as it closes. If the owner tries to force the roof closed, it can fly off. ● A labor union that has demonstrated against Walmart has asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to reverse a judge’s decision barring it from entering the retail giant’s property for anything other than shopping. An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union said the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Walmart had sought the order in response to the group demonstrating and picketing at its stores over pay and benefits. ● Nissan said it had completed a deal to take a controlling stake in Mitsubishi and would retain the embattled automaker’s chief executive in a bid to help it recover from a mileage cheating scandal. Carlos Ghosn, who heads Nissan and Renault, will become chairman of Mitsubishi, while Osamu Masuko will remain the chief executive. Nissan is coming to the rescue of Mitsubishi after its admissions about improperly measuring fuel economy and manipulating test data. The two companies have said that they plan to maintain separate identities, brands and dealerships. ● American Airlines, the world’s biggest carrier, reported that third-quarter earnings fell 56 percent and would have dropped further if not for low fuel prices. The company earned $737 million, down from $1.69 billion a year earlier. Revenue slipped 1 percent, but costs rose 5 percent. American was still able to claim that it beat expectations. Excluding non-repeating costs, mostly related to its 2013 merger with US Airways, the company said it would have earned $1.76 a share. That topped the $1.67 forecast by analysts. — From news services Coming Today ● 10 a.m.: State unemployment data. ● Earnings: McDonald’s, Daimler. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

In solar-panel battle, Target's beating Walmart 0 Share: Wearable Tech by Jessica Dolcourt October 20, 2016 1:54 PM PDT @jdolcourt Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? Target and Walmart are two big-box stores getting into solar energy.Photo by John Greim, LightRocket via Getty Images When it comes to US companies installing solar panels on their buildings, Target is in the lead. That's the top takeaway from a Solar Energy Industries Association report this week on companies that use sun-siphoned energy for their buildings. Interestingly, Apple is the only tech company to make the top 10. It comes in at No. 4, while Intel and Verizon come in at Nos. 14 and 15, respectively. Together, the top companies using solar energy have installed cells that can capture more than 1 gigawatt of energy, says the SEIA report. That's enough to power 193,000 homes. Although Walmart has more cells installed, it's Target that wins in bang for the buck with the highest capacity: 147 megawatts compared to Walmart's 145 MW. Target plans to add rooftop solar panels to 500 stores by 2020, the company says on its website. Walmart, meanwhile, aims to procure "7 billion kilowatt-hours of renewable energy" by the same year, a move it says is equivalent to taking 1.5 million cars off the road.

(Source: WOIO) Big Twan's Instagram account. (Source: WOIO) (Source: WOIO) Case closed letter from prosecutor. (Source: WOIO) Big Twan at Drug Mart. (Source: WOIO) GARFIELD HEIGHTS, OH (WOIO) - “I am not a sexual predator.” That’s what a local man tells me, months after a Garfield Heights mom accused him of luring her 12-year old daughter on Instagram. Antoine Mills admits he goes by “Big Twan 146,” and that it’s his picture that appears on the often sexually laced Instagram messages. But Mills insists it was someone else who stole his identity and posted the messages. Back in May, I detailed how Jami Jones posed as her daughter on Instagram, after she says authorities failed to follow up on her complaint against “Big Twan 146.” In an on-camera interview initiated by Mills in September, the 41-year-old former Walmart worker said “I do not bother kids. I don’t mess with kids.” “Was that you?” I asked. “No, no.” “Positive?” “Positive,” replied Mills. When reminded his picture appeared on the posts, Mills said “Anybody can get my Instagram pictures.” For over six months, we have been trying to get someone from ICAC, the Internet Crimes Against Children unit and the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office that operates it, to comment on the case.  As I reported earlier, ICAC Investigators, also posing as the young girl, suddenly stopped communicating with “Big Twan 146” and warned the mom to do the same, suggesting she might be entrapping the message sender.  But the messages continued.  And when the “Big Twan 146” began sending pictures of his anatomy, the mom began engaging again as her 12-year-old daughter Jamice. By May, “Big Twan 146” began hinting that he wanted to meet the girl face to face. “Please let me be your first, Jamice, and you will never forget it,” one message promised. Jami, still acting as her daughter, then agreed to meet “Big Twan 146” at a Euclid Discount Drug Mart, and alerted us. On May 13 shortly after 2 p.m., we went undercover and watched as a green Infinity pulled into the Drug Mart Parking lot.  Who did we see sitting in the driver’s seat? The real Antoine Mills. When we aired the report in May, we covered Mills’ face and didn’t mention his name. Mills now admits it was him who showed up at Drug Mart. But months later, he still has trouble explaining what he was doing there. I asked Mills, if he wasn’t in contact with the girl, how did he end up at Drug Mart on that day? “Now that’s the thing,” he replied.  “I don’t know how that came about.”  “There are 1.5 million people in the Greater Cleveland area,” I pointed out.  “Who shows up at Drug Mart but you.”  “Yeah, that was me at Drug Mart,” said Mills. “But I didn’t meet no girl. I didn’t meet no one. I was just sitting there, playing my music.” Mills revealed that he was interviewed by ICAC investigators last spring. They also searched his personal computer and asked him about the pornographic pictures. “I told them, if you want me to, you can bring the pictures right here and I will drop my pants and I will show you.” ICAC declined the offer. Mills says ICAC told him, if they don’t contact him again, that he was in the clear. He says he never heard from them again. “I don’t like the young kids,” Mills reassured me. “I have four daughters of my own.” Then he turned to the camera with a message for the mom:  “Jami Jones, I don’t want your daughter. I never wanted your daughter.” But Jami Jones still isn’t buying what Mills is selling. “I actually witnessed him that day that he was caught on tape (by Cleveland 19).  Him sitting, waiting for like at least 15 minutes for my daughter to show up.” As much as skepticism Jami has for Mills, she has even more criticism for ICAC and the County Prosecutor. “What I did is what any parent would do. Especially if I continuously see this man trying to get my daughter. And If I’m seeing negligence six weeks, three months and they haven’t even tried to contact him or respond to any of his messages, what am I to think?” Recently, the prosecutor’s office sent a letter to Jami, saying “It has not found sufficient credible evidence to pursue criminal charges.” As far as the prosecutor is concerned, the case is closed. Not so for the mom who says her daughter was stalked by an Instagram predator. “It’s closed to them, but I’m going to do whatever I got to do to try and get this situation resolved,” vowed Jami. “I’m not going to let him do this to another child.” FROM OHIO ICAC: Chat rooms, social media, file sharing, and mobile apps have become extremely popular for children in today’s society. Unfortunately, this technology can be dangerous to children, either through their own actions or their interactions with others.  The internet has created a virtual playground that has allowed individuals to hide their true identity while gaining access to a variety of personal information. In the wrong hands, this information can be used to harass, threaten or intimidate children, further putting them at risk.  The 2010 Youth Internet Safety Survey (YISS) conducted by The Crimes Against Children Research Center revealed that 97% of children ages 10-17 were using the internet from home and 47% of youth were using the internet from their cell phones. Child pornography is created worldwide and is readily available on the Internet to those who actively seek it. Anyone can purchase a computer, gain Internet access and immediately begin collecting and distributing child pornography. Once a pedophile possesses this contraband, he/she can quickly contact children through social media accounts and chat rooms. The scope of this problem is significant: the research center also found that in 2010 approximately 1 in every 11 children using the internet received an unwanted sexual solicitation. Over time, these pedophiles gather personal information from their intended victims and, in the worst cases, may go to great lengths and expense to meet their victims face-to-face. These meetings often result in kidnapping and sexual assault. New child pornography is generated frequently from these assaults, repeating this destructive cycle.

Sheriff's Office) WALHALLA, SC (FOX Carolina) - The Oconee County Sheriff’s Office is seeking the help of the community to solve a shoplifting that happened Oct. 16 at the Seneca Walmart at 1636 Sandifer Boulevard, and to identify two individuals who authorities suspect are related to the case. After an investigation, deputies said a male and a female purchased a few items and then proceeded out of the store. The female then reportedly got into a car and drove the vehicle to one of the exits whereupon the male loaded a mini motorcycle bike, with a retail value of around $528.94, into the vehicle. The individuals are accused of leaving without paying for the items. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC or 864-638-STOP. All information given is confidential. Deputy says that a tip that leads to an arrest can be eligible for a cash reward.  Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

(Source: WOIO) Big Twan's Instagram account. (Source: WOIO) (Source: WOIO) Case closed letter from prosecutor. (Source: WOIO) Big Twan at Drug Mart. (Source: WOIO) GARFIELD HEIGHTS, OH (WOIO) - “I am not a sexual predator.” That’s what a local man tells me, months after a Garfield Heights mom accused him of luring her 12-year old daughter on Instagram. Antoine Mills admits he goes by “Big Twan 146,” and that it’s his picture that appears on the often sexually laced Instagram messages. But Mills insists it was someone else who stole his identity and posted the messages. Back in May, I detailed how Jami Jones posed as her daughter on Instagram, after she says authorities failed to follow up on her complaint against “Big Twan 146.” In an on-camera interview initiated by Mills in September, the 41-year-old former Walmart worker said “I do not bother kids. I don’t mess with kids.” “Was that you?” I asked. “No, no.” “Positive?” “Positive,” replied Mills. When reminded his picture appeared on the posts, Mills said “Anybody can get my Instagram pictures.” For over six months, we have been trying to get someone from ICAC, the Internet Crimes Against Children unit and the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office that operates it, to comment on the case.  As I reported earlier, ICAC Investigators, also posing as the young girl, suddenly stopped communicating with “Big Twan 146” and warned the mom to do the same, suggesting she might be entrapping the message sender.  But the messages continued.  And when the “Big Twan 146” began sending pictures of his anatomy, the mom began engaging again as her 12-year-old daughter Jamice. By May, “Big Twan 146” began hinting that he wanted to meet the girl face to face. “Please let me be your first, Jamice, and you will never forget it,” one message promised. Jami, still acting as her daughter, then agreed to meet “Big Twan 146” at a Euclid Discount Drug Mart, and alerted us. On May 13 shortly after 2 p.m., we went undercover and watched as a green Infinity pulled into the Drug Mart Parking lot.  Who did we see sitting in the driver’s seat? The real Antoine Mills. When we aired the report in May, we covered Mills’ face and didn’t mention his name. Mills now admits it was him who showed up at Drug Mart. But months later, he still has trouble explaining what he was doing there. I asked Mills, if he wasn’t in contact with the girl, how did he end up at Drug Mart on that day? “Now that’s the thing,” he replied.  “I don’t know how that came about.”  “There are 1.5 million people in the Greater Cleveland area,” I pointed out.  “Who shows up at Drug Mart but you.”  “Yeah, that was me at Drug Mart,” said Mills. “But I didn’t meet no girl. I didn’t meet no one. I was just sitting there, playing my music.” Mills revealed that he was interviewed by ICAC investigators last spring. They also searched his personal computer and asked him about the pornographic pictures. “I told them, if you want me to, you can bring the pictures right here and I will drop my pants and I will show you.” ICAC declined the offer. Mills says ICAC told him, if they don’t contact him again, that he was in the clear. He says he never heard from them again. “I don’t like the young kids,” Mills reassured me. “I have four daughters of my own.” Then he turned to the camera with a message for the mom:  “Jami Jones, I don’t want your daughter. I never wanted your daughter.” But Jami Jones still isn’t buying what Mills is selling. “I actually witnessed him that day that he was caught on tape (by Cleveland 19).  Him sitting, waiting for like at least 15 minutes for my daughter to show up.” As much as skepticism Jami has for Mills, she has even more criticism for ICAC and the County Prosecutor. “What I did is what any parent would do. Especially if I continuously see this man trying to get my daughter. And If I’m seeing negligence six weeks, three months and they haven’t even tried to contact him or respond to any of his messages, what am I to think?” Recently, the prosecutor’s office sent a letter to Jami, saying “It has not found sufficient credible evidence to pursue criminal charges.” As far as the prosecutor is concerned, the case is closed. Not so for the mom who says her daughter was stalked by an Instagram predator. “It’s closed to them, but I’m going to do whatever I got to do to try and get this situation resolved,” vowed Jami. “I’m not going to let him do this to another child.” FROM OHIO ICAC: Chat rooms, social media, file sharing, and mobile apps have become extremely popular for children in today’s society. Unfortunately, this technology can be dangerous to children, either through their own actions or their interactions with others.  The internet has created a virtual playground that has allowed individuals to hide their true identity while gaining access to a variety of personal information. In the wrong hands, this information can be used to harass, threaten or intimidate children, further putting them at risk.  The 2010 Youth Internet Safety Survey (YISS) conducted by The Crimes Against Children Research Center revealed that 97% of children ages 10-17 were using the internet from home and 47% of youth were using the internet from their cell phones. Child pornography is created worldwide and is readily available on the Internet to those who actively seek it. Anyone can purchase a computer, gain Internet access and immediately begin collecting and distributing child pornography. Once a pedophile possesses this contraband, he/she can quickly contact children through social media accounts and chat rooms. The scope of this problem is significant: the research center also found that in 2010 approximately 1 in every 11 children using the internet received an unwanted sexual solicitation. Over time, these pedophiles gather personal information from their intended victims and, in the worst cases, may go to great lengths and expense to meet their victims face-to-face. These meetings often result in kidnapping and sexual assault. New child pornography is generated frequently from these assaults, repeating this destructive cycle.

Entrepreneur Sébastien Dupéré of Dupray knows how to blow off steam. Image credit: David Yellen Michelle Goodman Contributor Current Issue Subscribe now October 20, 2016 This story appears in the October 2016 issue of Startups. Subscribe » Sébastien Dupéré thought he’d stumbled on a winning idea with Les Dégommeurs. At first blush, the steam-cleaning business -- which Dupéré launched with two friends in 2006 -- looked successful. Customers were happy with their service, which removed gum and other gunk from public places such as the airport and theaters. References kept new business rolling in. Les Dégommeurs had one big problem: While it was bringing in a ton of cash, a lot of it was lost due to an inefficient operation. Compounding the issue, the Montreal ’treps had no strategy to remedy that. “We really didn’t market ourselves in a way that was conducive to growing our business,” Dupéré says. “We were taking one job here, another job there -- we didn’t have a clear and concise business plan.” Related: Why This Fabric House Looks Like a Science Lab In 2008, after two years of stumbling along, Dupéré and his cofounders sold the company and took stock of lessons learned. Later that year, they scrapped their original business idea and opened a more profitable one, Dupray, which sells home, commercial and industrial steam cleaners and steam irons. Today the company brings in $13 million a year in revenue, selling to individuals, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, auto dealers and real estate and construction companies in North America and Europe. Dupéré is no anomaly. Behind many successful entrepreneurs lies the rubble of a promising venture that hit a wall or, worse, went out of business. Some may see it as a rite of passage. Others call it myopic stupidity by founders who don’t know any better. But whatever happened, the outcome is a tested and hardened business­person with the experience to make everything that comes afterward work. Follow their lead, and perhaps you can skip the painful parts and go straight to success. Find your true customers Selling a product that no one wants to pay for is the granddaddy of business killers. That was PreferredTime’s problem. The Boston-based software platform made it easy for Big Pharma sales reps to set up meetings with doctors too busy to answer their messages. Doctors and reps loved the service. According to founder Stefania Mallett, a third of U.S. pharmaceutical reps used it. Investors were enthralled, too, so much so that they poured $5.6 million into the venture from 2004 to 2007. There was a catch, however: Although reps could obtain more of PreferredTime’s features through a $25 monthly subscription, most of them were happy to stick with the platform’s free version. And it didn’t help that three years into it, the startup had yet to sign up enough doctors and reps to turn a profit. “Our biggest mistake was that it was a ‘boil the ocean’ company,” Mallett says of the business model that chased scale over profits. “We would have needed a much bigger investment to reach a profit.” Mallett pulled the plug in 2007, but she was able to salvage her next venture from PreferredTime’s remains, forming ezCater. The idea evolved from pharma reps’ repeated requests for her to build a simple way to provide meals for their meetings with doctors. The catering platform, which lets businesses order meals for any meeting, opened its doors a week after PreferredTime went dark. Mallett not only enlisted many of PreferredTime’s pharma reps as early testers but also won them as paying customers. This time Mallett has raised $35 million from investors. Today the 160-employee internet company connects startups and Fortune 500s in nearly 23,000 U.S. cities with caterers who can provide meals for on-site and off-site meetings. The platform partners with more than 47,000 restaurants and caterers that clients like Google, Microsoft, Uber and Verizon can choose from. “And it all started because we failed at something else,” Mallet says. For Mark Carpenter, the hard-fought lesson of his first venture was that undercutting the competition on price isn’t necessarily a winning long-term business strategy. He bought Whatco Roofing and Sheet Metal in Tualatin, Ore., back in 1981 to cater to commercial builders who needed roofing. No repairs, no custom work, no residential jobs -- easy, he thought. “But it was all contractors looking for the cheapest possible bid,” Carpenter says. And lowball bids meant he couldn’t give customers his best work, which also meant most didn’t hire him a second time. Five years in and $300,000 in debt, Carpenter liquidated the company and took a day job. We have customers who have been with us for 20 years and continue to hire us.”  -- Mark Carpenter,Columbia Roofing In 1996, Carpenter decided to try owning a business again, launching Columbia Roofing & Sheet Metal. This time, instead of focusing on new construction, he offered repairs, reroofing, sheet metal work, seismic retrofitting and other custom services to commercial building owners. All the while, he stuck to his pricing, refusing to play the lowball game. “There are people who shop at Nordstrom for its quality and service, and people who shop at Walmart for its prices,” Carpenter says. By earning the trust of the Nordie’s crowd, he’s built a $10 million company with customers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and California. “We have customers that have been with us for 20 years and continue to hire us.” Embrace efficiency By his own admission, one of the biggest lessons Dupéré learned from Les Dégommeurs was the need to automate scheduling, payments and customer communications. “We were booking appointments by scribbling them down on paper, whiteboards and even napkins,” Dupéré says of his failed steam-cleaning service. “We definitely didn’t utilize the full power of our smartphones.” Related: The Right (and Wrong) Ways to Track Your Company's Performance Sometimes the company’s schedulers would alert the cleaning team to the day’s jobs by text or email. Other times the cleaners wouldn’t know they needed to be across town in mere minutes until they arrived at the office. Cleaners often showed up late to appointments; sometimes they missed them altogether. “That’s a level of unprofessionalism that’s unacceptable,” Dupéré says. “It’s the type of thing that hurts your business.” This is what success looks like: Dupéré at home in Montreal.   The company’s need to be paid in cash or by check didn’t help either. Checks were lost or misplaced, forcing Dupéré to go through the mortifying task of asking a customer for a new check. And without any database or customer relationship management software, Les Dégommeurs had no uniform way to stay in touch with customers, offer them periodic promotions or follow up on new leads. Dupéré was determined to avoid those same mistakes when he launched Dupray. He wasted no time investing in CRM, scheduling, payment, project management and other productivity software. “Technology keeps us organized,” he says, which has helped him manage 30 employees in six countries. “It keeps us in complete control of our hours, where we have to be, what we have to do and who we have to see.” Jeff Platt, CEO of Sky Zone Trampoline Park, takes organization one step further, using his CRM technology for customer feedback, which he in turn relies on to make sure his business is as profitable as possible. At the start of the year, Platt began using an email survey application that customers can complete after visiting one of Sky Zone’s activity parks scattered around the globe. Besides writing reviews, customers rate each park on the fun factor, perceived value and likelihood of recommending it to friends. Low-gravity area: Sky Zone Trampoline Park.   “An app on my phone lets me see how our customers score us across all our locations,” Platt says. Armed with this real-time feedback daily, he can make adjustments to his business immediately. Complaints about the old, dingy bathroom at one of his parks quickly led to a $15,000 renovation. Reviews of the location improved, as did revenue. Likewise, repeated requests for more park activities convinced Platt to add climbing walls and ninja warrior courses to various locations, features that cost $25,000 to $300,000 apiece to build. But for Platt, the resulting five-star reviews of the upgraded spaces justified the expense. “It doesn’t matter what you think as a business owner,” Platt says. “It only matters what the customer thinks. And when you’re not getting that feedback in your face every day, you won’t take action.” This is a far cry from how Platt operated in his previous business, a 17,000-square-foot trampoline arena for professional athletes that his father spent two years and $2.5 million building only to realize there wasn’t enough of an audience for the acrobatic sport he had dreamed up and hoped to popularize. In contrast, Sky Zone, which his father originally founded in 2006, now operates 150 trampoline parks around the world, with annual revenues of roughly $315 million. Pick your partners well Your business is only as good as the team you assemble. Marco Perry learned this firsthand when forming his product design firm with friends in 2001. All five partners were highly creative designers, but they didn’t have a business bone among them. Their growth strategy was nonexistent. Same goes for their accounting, forecasting, sales and marketing expertise. “We had no complementary skills, no clearly defined roles or responsibilities,” Perry says. “There was no real path to success. We tried a little bit of everything to see what would stick. We were basically masters of none.” Perry admits that this amalgam of designers was little more than a freelance collective or a glorified coworking arrangement. By 2005, after four years of treading water, the partners disbanded. Perry struck out on his own, this time with his wife, who had an MBA, and another partner. They founded Pensa, the Brooklyn-based product design and invention firm he runs today. Thanks to his new cofounders, Perry now had partners who compensated for his operational blind spots. He had a business plan, a brand and a clear road to profitability. It was the smartest move of his career. Today the 16-employee firm makes millions of dollars annually (Perry won’t be more specific), working with clients like OXO, Pepsi and Google and developing everything from smart baby monitors to high-end urban bicycles. This same approach to partners applies to investors, according to Robert Thompson, founder and CEO of Punch Bowl Social, a U.S. chain of gastrodiners -- gaming venues that feature farm-fresh food, craft drinks and games like bowling, shuffleboard, pinball and Skee-Ball. “Not all money is good money,” he says. “There are a lot of pirates out there.” Punch Bowl Social aims to perfect the idea of "eatertainment."   Thompson should know. Before launching his “eatertainment” company in 2012, the Denver-based entrepreneur spent the better part of a decade running Cocktail Concepts, a restaurant company he founded that at its height ran six eateries in three states. But in the early 2000s, one restaurant he had self-financed went under. Another saw a 60 percent drop in customers. Suddenly, keeping the doors open put Thompson neck-deep in debt. To make matters worse, one of his investors attempted to gain control of the company. “I had a pirate in my midst,” Thompson says. “I found myself not only trying to save my business but trying to figure out a way to step outside the traps this guy was laying for me. I was fighting a war on two fronts.” Related: 4 Strategies to Suss Out How Much Your CEO Should Be Paid In 2004, Thompson shuttered Cocktail Concepts and declared bankruptcy, losing his home and cars in the process. He credits the offending investor with helping escalate his company’s fall, a tough blow he is determined to not repeat. With Punch Bowl Social, he diligently researched each of the angel investors who put up the $4.3 million he used to launch the business. He’d learned the hard way that his business and his home depended on it. It has paid off. The company claims each of its current locations earns $7 million to $8 million in annual revenue. “You really need to have a meeting of the minds with your investors before you allow them in,” Thompson says. “Otherwise, you can spend more time protecting your company than you do running it, and that’s bad for everyone.” Michelle Goodman Michelle Goodman is a Seattle-based freelance journalist and author of The Anti 9-to-5 Guide.

Caption(Philip Marruffo/pmarruffo@saukvalley.com) Elite Custom Cycle has moved from Clinton, Iowa, to 1911 New High St. in Rock Falls. The transition to the new shop at should be complete by Nov. 1. By PAM EGGEMEIER peggemeier@saukvalley.com 815-625-3600, ext. 5570 @pam_eggemeier ROCK FALLS – Elite Custom Cycle still is in the process of moving from Iowa to Rock Falls, but for its owners, the Sauk Valley always has felt like home. Todd Felder was born and raised in Sterling, and Chuck McCarty, a native of the Melrose Park area, has lived in Rock Falls for several years. Felder and McCarty opened the custom motorcycle shop about a year ago in Clinton, but both have other full-time jobs, and their busy schedules dictated they cut down on their commuting times. Felder works at the Citgo Refinery in Lemont, while McCarty scrambled from Clinton to his transportation management job at the Walmart Distribution Center. “Business was good in Clinton, but Rock Falls is my hometown, and it was just a matter of logistics – I couldn’t keep losing 2 hours a day in transit,” McCarty said. The competition will be more intense in the Sauk Valley, but the owners say they aren’t worried. “We’re doing something different here, and I know we can find our niche,” Felder said. “We work with 40 different parts companies, and we can get everything in fast.” The transition to the new shop at 1911 New High St. should be complete by Nov. 1. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, but it won’t be unusual to find customers hanging out at the store much later. Felder said custom bike building always has been a big part of his family’s life, while McCarty’s passion for the business is relatively new. “My dad, uncles and I have always been involved in motorcycles, and I’ve had one ever since I was old enough to ride it,” Felder said. Felder’s customizing skills were born of necessity – he learned how to do it himself because he couldn’t afford to have someone else do the work. McCarty met his business partner 4 years ago through Felder’s wife, who works with McCarty at the distribution center. “Todd did some customizing work for me, and I fell in love with it,” McCarty said. “The business relationship has been great, because there was a high level of trust almost instantly.” McCarty said he brings more of a computer-oriented organizational element to the table, making sure the parts are ordered and the bills get paid. Felder showed off one bike he’s particularly proud of – a 30-inch-wheel custom bagger with a CVO Harley-Davidson engine and 110-cubic-inch motor that weighs more than 1,000 pounds. It generally takes him about 2 months to finish his bigger projects. While Harley-Davidson reigns as king of the custom biking world, Felder works on everything from Harleys to mopeds. There is more to the business than the building services. “We want to be the one-stop shop for bikers, where you can come in off the road and get anything from a kickstand to jackets, glasses, and boots,” McCarty said. There are two huge containers full of used parts that the shop sometimes even gives away, although most customers insist on throwing in a few bucks. The shop is the only registered Dirty Bird Concepts dealer within a 1-hour radius. The apparel side of the business will continue to grow. An expansive counter is being built that will include catalogs from which customers can order just about anything related to biking. The location in Rock Falls was a lure for the owners. Right off U.S. 30 and near I-88, the shop is easily accessible for bikers on the move. “This is a big-city-driven business – we get a lot of people out of Peoria, Chicago, and the Quad Cities,” Felder said. “The whole custom scene is just blowing up, and we should be able to get people riding cross-country.” Although the shop isn’t officially open yet, the owners are seeing an increasing number of people pop in while they are getting things organized. A grand opening event will be delayed until late spring, when biking season in the Midwest is getting revved up. If the font on the signage looks familiar, that’s because Felder also owns Elite Auto Sales at 815 First Ave. in Rock Falls.

(Pennsville Police Department) Print Email Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com By Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com Today's Sunbeam Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 20, 2016 at 1:59 PM, updated October 20, 2016 at 3:13 PM comments PENNSVILLE TWP. — Police are seeking two men allegedly involved in a case where unattended cash registers at the local Walmart were pried open and more than $2,000 in cash taken. Pennsville police say the thief seen in video surveillance at the registers was selective in what he took — only grabbing $50 and $20 bills from the open tills. According to police, on Oct. 9 around 7:50 p.m. two elderly men were captured on surveillance video entering the South Broadway store. The video then shows one of the men going behind unattended cash registers and using some type of tool to pry open the cash drawers, police said. Three drawers were opened and over $2,100 removed, police said, but only $20 and $50 bills were taken. Probation for man in copper thefts The man seen taking the money was described as an elderly black male, 60 to 70 years old, with white/gray hair, wearing dark-rimmed glasses, dressed in dark pants, tan shoes and a blue or charcoal gray hooded zip-up sweatshirt. Two men who allegedly pried open three cash registers at the Pennsville Walmart on Oct. 9 are being sought by police. The men allegedly left Walmart in a vehicle like this, police said. (Pennsville Police Department)  The second suspect is described as an elderly black male wearing dark-rimmed glasses, blue jeans, tan shoes, a dark-colored shirt, a dark brown leather jacket and a black leather-type cap. This suspect used a cane, police said. The pair was captured on surveillance cameras after the theft leaving in what police say appears to be an early 1990's model silver Lincoln Town Car. Police are not sure what state the car is registered in. Authorities did not say what role the second suspect, who was not seen on the video taking money, played in the theft. Anyone with information on the pair are asked to call Pennsville Police Department's Det. Gibison at 856-678-3089 Ext. 504. Bill Gallo Jr. may be reached at bgallo@njadvancemedia.com.

(AP) — A former pastor is accused of trying to choke a 4-month-old baby he didn't know at a Kansas City-area Wal-Mart. The Kansas City Star (http://bit.ly/2eacJPj ) reports prosecutors in Kansas' Johnson County charged 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych (OH'-lay zow-nur-VIK') of Clinton, New Jersey, with felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. It was not immediately clear if Zhownirovych has an attorney. Overland Park police say a man walked up to a woman who was in a checkout lane early Wednesday and began choking her baby. The woman screamed, and the man stopped. Police say people in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. The baby was not injured. Investigators say the man possibly was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. ___ Information from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

(AP) — A former New Jersey pastor is accused of trying to choke a 4-month-old baby he didn’t know at a Kansas City-area Walmart. The Kansas City Star reports that prosecutors in Kansas’ Johnson County charged 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych of Clinton, New Jersey, is charged with felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. It was not immediately clear if Zhownirovych has an attorney. Overland Park police say a man walked up to a woman who was in a checkout lane early Wednesday and began choking her baby. The woman screamed, and the man stopped. Police say people in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. The baby was not injured. Investigators say the man possibly was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.   Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hide this Hours, Minutes and Seconds left until Entrepreneur 360™ Long Beach - Limited Seating Available Register Now Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise E360 Event Subscribe 11 min read How to Start a Small Business These Entrepreneurs Succeeded -- But Only After Failing Once Before For a second act success, credit lessons learned at early go-arounds. Entrepreneur Sébastien Dupéré of Dupray knows how to blow off steam. Image credit: David Yellen Michelle Goodman Contributor Current Issue Subscribe now October 20, 2016 This story appears in the October 2016 issue of Startups. Subscribe » Sébastien Dupéré thought he’d stumbled on a winning idea with Les Dégommeurs. At first blush, the steam-cleaning business -- which Dupéré launched with two friends in 2006 -- looked successful. Customers were happy with their service, which removed gum and other gunk from public places such as the airport and theaters. References kept new business rolling in. Les Dégommeurs had one big problem: While it was bringing in a ton of cash, a lot of it was lost due to an inefficient operation. Compounding the issue, the Montreal ’treps had no strategy to remedy that. “We really didn’t market ourselves in a way that was conducive to growing our business,” Dupéré says. “We were taking one job here, another job there -- we didn’t have a clear and concise business plan.” Related: Why This Fabric House Looks Like a Science Lab In 2008, after two years of stumbling along, Dupéré and his cofounders sold the company and took stock of lessons learned. Later that year, they scrapped their original business idea and opened a more profitable one, Dupray, which sells home, commercial and industrial steam cleaners and steam irons. Today the company brings in $13 million a year in revenue, selling to individuals, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, auto dealers and real estate and construction companies in North America and Europe. Dupéré is no anomaly. Behind many successful entrepreneurs lies the rubble of a promising venture that hit a wall or, worse, went out of business. Some may see it as a rite of passage. Others call it myopic stupidity by founders who don’t know any better. But whatever happened, the outcome is a tested and hardened business­person with the experience to make everything that comes afterward work. Follow their lead, and perhaps you can skip the painful parts and go straight to success. Find your true customers Selling a product that no one wants to pay for is the granddaddy of business killers. That was PreferredTime’s problem. The Boston-based software platform made it easy for Big Pharma sales reps to set up meetings with doctors too busy to answer their messages. Doctors and reps loved the service. According to founder Stefania Mallett, a third of U.S. pharmaceutical reps used it. Investors were enthralled, too, so much so that they poured $5.6 million into the venture from 2004 to 2007. There was a catch, however: Although reps could obtain more of PreferredTime’s features through a $25 monthly subscription, most of them were happy to stick with the platform’s free version. And it didn’t help that three years into it, the startup had yet to sign up enough doctors and reps to turn a profit. “Our biggest mistake was that it was a ‘boil the ocean’ company,” Mallett says of the business model that chased scale over profits. “We would have needed a much bigger investment to reach a profit.” Mallett pulled the plug in 2007, but she was able to salvage her next venture from PreferredTime’s remains, forming ezCater. The idea evolved from pharma reps’ repeated requests for her to build a simple way to provide meals for their meetings with doctors. The catering platform, which lets businesses order meals for any meeting, opened its doors a week after PreferredTime went dark. Mallett not only enlisted many of PreferredTime’s pharma reps as early testers but also won them as paying customers. This time Mallett has raised $35 million from investors. Today the 160-employee internet company connects startups and Fortune 500s in nearly 23,000 U.S. cities with caterers who can provide meals for on-site and off-site meetings. The platform partners with more than 47,000 restaurants and caterers that clients like Google, Microsoft, Uber and Verizon can choose from. “And it all started because we failed at something else,” Mallet says. For Mark Carpenter, the hard-fought lesson of his first venture was that undercutting the competition on price isn’t necessarily a winning long-term business strategy. He bought Whatco Roofing and Sheet Metal in Tualatin, Ore., back in 1981 to cater to commercial builders who needed roofing. No repairs, no custom work, no residential jobs -- easy, he thought. “But it was all contractors looking for the cheapest possible bid,” Carpenter says. And lowball bids meant he couldn’t give customers his best work, which also meant most didn’t hire him a second time. Five years in and $300,000 in debt, Carpenter liquidated the company and took a day job. We have customers who have been with us for 20 years and continue to hire us.”  -- Mark Carpenter,Columbia Roofing In 1996, Carpenter decided to try owning a business again, launching Columbia Roofing & Sheet Metal. This time, instead of focusing on new construction, he offered repairs, reroofing, sheet metal work, seismic retrofitting and other custom services to commercial building owners. All the while, he stuck to his pricing, refusing to play the lowball game. “There are people who shop at Nordstrom for its quality and service, and people who shop at Walmart for its prices,” Carpenter says. By earning the trust of the Nordie’s crowd, he’s built a $10 million company with customers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and California. “We have customers that have been with us for 20 years and continue to hire us.” Embrace efficiency By his own admission, one of the biggest lessons Dupéré learned from Les Dégommeurs was the need to automate scheduling, payments and customer communications. “We were booking appointments by scribbling them down on paper, whiteboards and even napkins,” Dupéré says of his failed steam-cleaning service. “We definitely didn’t utilize the full power of our smartphones.” Related: The Right (and Wrong) Ways to Track Your Company's Performance Sometimes the company’s schedulers would alert the cleaning team to the day’s jobs by text or email. Other times the cleaners wouldn’t know they needed to be across town in mere minutes until they arrived at the office. Cleaners often showed up late to appointments; sometimes they missed them altogether. “That’s a level of unprofessionalism that’s unacceptable,” Dupéré says. “It’s the type of thing that hurts your business.” This is what success looks like: Dupéré at home in Montreal.   The company’s need to be paid in cash or by check didn’t help either. Checks were lost or misplaced, forcing Dupéré to go through the mortifying task of asking a customer for a new check. And without any database or customer relationship management software, Les Dégommeurs had no uniform way to stay in touch with customers, offer them periodic promotions or follow up on new leads. Dupéré was determined to avoid those same mistakes when he launched Dupray. He wasted no time investing in CRM, scheduling, payment, project management and other productivity software. “Technology keeps us organized,” he says, which has helped him manage 30 employees in six countries. “It keeps us in complete control of our hours, where we have to be, what we have to do and who we have to see.” Jeff Platt, CEO of Sky Zone Trampoline Park, takes organization one step further, using his CRM technology for customer feedback, which he in turn relies on to make sure his business is as profitable as possible. At the start of the year, Platt began using an email survey application that customers can complete after visiting one of Sky Zone’s activity parks scattered around the globe. Besides writing reviews, customers rate each park on the fun factor, perceived value and likelihood of recommending it to friends. Low-gravity area: Sky Zone Trampoline Park.   “An app on my phone lets me see how our customers score us across all our locations,” Platt says. Armed with this real-time feedback daily, he can make adjustments to his business immediately. Complaints about the old, dingy bathroom at one of his parks quickly led to a $15,000 renovation. Reviews of the location improved, as did revenue. Likewise, repeated requests for more park activities convinced Platt to add climbing walls and ninja warrior courses to various locations, features that cost $25,000 to $300,000 apiece to build. But for Platt, the resulting five-star reviews of the upgraded spaces justified the expense. “It doesn’t matter what you think as a business owner,” Platt says. “It only matters what the customer thinks. And when you’re not getting that feedback in your face every day, you won’t take action.” This is a far cry from how Platt operated in his previous business, a 17,000-square-foot trampoline arena for professional athletes that his father spent two years and $2.5 million building only to realize there wasn’t enough of an audience for the acrobatic sport he had dreamed up and hoped to popularize. In contrast, Sky Zone, which his father originally founded in 2006, now operates 150 trampoline parks around the world, with annual revenues of roughly $315 million. Pick your partners well Your business is only as good as the team you assemble. Marco Perry learned this firsthand when forming his product design firm with friends in 2001. All five partners were highly creative designers, but they didn’t have a business bone among them. Their growth strategy was nonexistent. Same goes for their accounting, forecasting, sales and marketing expertise. “We had no complementary skills, no clearly defined roles or responsibilities,” Perry says. “There was no real path to success. We tried a little bit of everything to see what would stick. We were basically masters of none.” Perry admits that this amalgam of designers was little more than a freelance collective or a glorified coworking arrangement. By 2005, after four years of treading water, the partners disbanded. Perry struck out on his own, this time with his wife, who had an MBA, and another partner. They founded Pensa, the Brooklyn-based product design and invention firm he runs today. Thanks to his new cofounders, Perry now had partners who compensated for his operational blind spots. He had a business plan, a brand and a clear road to profitability. It was the smartest move of his career. Today the 16-employee firm makes millions of dollars annually (Perry won’t be more specific), working with clients like OXO, Pepsi and Google and developing everything from smart baby monitors to high-end urban bicycles. This same approach to partners applies to investors, according to Robert Thompson, founder and CEO of Punch Bowl Social, a U.S. chain of gastrodiners -- gaming venues that feature farm-fresh food, craft drinks and games like bowling, shuffleboard, pinball and Skee-Ball. “Not all money is good money,” he says. “There are a lot of pirates out there.” Punch Bowl Social aims to perfect the idea of "eatertainment."   Thompson should know. Before launching his “eatertainment” company in 2012, the Denver-based entrepreneur spent the better part of a decade running Cocktail Concepts, a restaurant company he founded that at its height ran six eateries in three states. But in the early 2000s, one restaurant he had self-financed went under. Another saw a 60 percent drop in customers. Suddenly, keeping the doors open put Thompson neck-deep in debt. To make matters worse, one of his investors attempted to gain control of the company. “I had a pirate in my midst,” Thompson says. “I found myself not only trying to save my business but trying to figure out a way to step outside the traps this guy was laying for me. I was fighting a war on two fronts.” Related: 4 Strategies to Suss Out How Much Your CEO Should Be Paid In 2004, Thompson shuttered Cocktail Concepts and declared bankruptcy, losing his home and cars in the process. He credits the offending investor with helping escalate his company’s fall, a tough blow he is determined to not repeat. With Punch Bowl Social, he diligently researched each of the angel investors who put up the $4.3 million he used to launch the business. He’d learned the hard way that his business and his home depended on it. It has paid off. The company claims each of its current locations earns $7 million to $8 million in annual revenue. “You really need to have a meeting of the minds with your investors before you allow them in,” Thompson says. “Otherwise, you can spend more time protecting your company than you do running it, and that’s bad for everyone.” Michelle Goodman Michelle Goodman is a Seattle-based freelance journalist and author of The Anti 9-to-5 Guide.

E-commerce has made it easy for consumers to be indecisive without financial consequence --- at least for the shopper. For retailers, it’s a different story. Free shipping and returns are not just about the cost of getting things from one place to another. “Items need to be removed and inspected, people opening the boxes have to have additional training on quality control,” said Brandon Levey, chief executive of Stitch Labs, an inventory management software company. “If it’s too damaged they need to write it off. The delay of getting something back could impact inventory. All these things add to cost.” Now retailers have to find ways to reel in the price of a perk that customers have come to take for granted.

WSJ deputy tech editor Brian Fitzgerald joins Tanya Rivero to discuss. Photo: AP According to research released this week by Body Labs, a company that uses technology to collect and organize information about human body shapes, poses and movement, 23% of all clothing purchased online is returned. Another 22% of apparel purchased in-store is returned. The apparel market is a $1.2 trillion global industry, according to numbers quoted by Body Labs, with U.S. consumers spending $250 billion annually. IHL Group, a research and advisory firm serving the retail and hospitality industries, tallied $642.6 billion in worldwide returns in research published in 2015. Reasons range from defects or poor quality ($162 million) to wrong sizing ($62.4 billion), buyer’s remorse ($88.7 billion) and return fraud ($28.2 billion). Most returns are carried out in stores. In some cases, such as when items are returned for late delivery or because they didn’t match a description, it’s exclusively an e-commerce issue. The mountain of returns, along with out-of-stocks and overstocks plaguing retailers have given rise to what IHL Group calls a “ghost economy.” “Many in e-commerce have said, ‘We’re going to do free returns,’ Greg Buzek, president of IHL Group, told MarketWatch. “That’s just the cost of doing business.” Free shipping and returns have become commonplace primarily because of the rise of e-commerce. Retailers who sell exclusively online such as giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.36%   are typically initially focused on acquiring customers, and without feeling pressure to be profitable immediately, have tended to offer pricey perks. Returns are a big part of what IHL Group calls a “ghost economy,” costs that are tied to inefficiencies in certain retail processes. “The fact that they lost money was irrelevant,” said Antony Karabus, the chief executive of HRC Advisory, a retail consultancy. “Traditional retailers felt they had to match that. I don’t think they realized the implications of this free return policy. It was all about the customer rather than how much this was going to cost.” But it’s not just the shipping activity that raises costs. “It’s the handling, the broken boxes, the cleaning of the item,” said Karabus. “And what if an item comes back two or three weeks later and the peak season has passed?” Offering free returns eats up dollars in a retail industry that has already seen quarterly earnings take a hit. See also: Since no one is buying clothes, here’s what stores are selling instead “Retailers cannot afford it,” said Karabus. “It’s not sustainable.” One solution is to reconfigure fulfillment centers to better handle returns, which would also come with a price tag. Technology upgrades would also help. Another issue that is specific to apparel is fit and sizing. In 2015, $62.4 billion worth of apparel and footwear was returned due to incorrect sizing, according to Body Labs. An upgrade that allowed an e-commerce site gather more customer information to deliver apparel better suited to the customer would help, said Jon Cilley, who has the title of chief evangelist at Body Labs. One other option is to change the rules. Many retailers are trying to challenge Amazon on its terms, rather than by making the most of the advantage they have: brick-and-mortar stores, said HRC’s Karabus. In-person customer service is an advantage that can’t be replicated online. See also: Target is the latest retailer to feel the ‘Amazon effect’ Retailers can change consumer expectations, by setting a deadline for returns, for example,and levying a surcharge for items received after that date. However, retailers have “got to be very careful with modifying the rules,” said Karabus. Customers are unlikely to quietly accept that once-free services will come at a charge. It may be better to be more strategic about services going forward. “Be mindful of additional services you offer to the consumer, particularly when you mix online and offline,” said Stitch Labs’ Levey, who notes that even offering the option to buy online, pick up in-store comes with its own set of inventory issues. “Over the next few years, there’s going to have to be a rebalancing of consumer expectations and what these companies can provide,” he said.

Contributed 1 of 3 i By Andrew Dys adys@heraldonline.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story LAKE WYLIE The two guys pulling a pontoon boat held together with plywood pulled onto the water at dawn Saturday for the big fishing tournament in Lake Wylie. They had Walmart poles and bait they caught themselves and two cans of Chef Boy-R-Dee raviolis. Many of their foes had fancy uniforms, fancier poles, the fanciest electronics. And boats that should be called yachts. “We look around and all these other guys have electronics on their big boats that cost more than our raggedy old boat,” said Preston Starkey of Rock Hill, 27, an electric repairman by trade who decided that fishing after work was easier than dirt track racing. Knight had a cheap fishing card and a boat that cost $3,000 and looked it. The boat looked like it had fought Hurricane Matthew days earlier, and Matthew won. “We was just hoping our boat would stay afloat,” said Jason Knight of Lancaster, 30, who makes a living in an electric supply house but dreams of some day being a paid fishing guide. “We got a good reason, too. Preston can’t swim.” These guys fish a lot for recreation, for fun, and even want to do it in tournaments. But Saturday, they arrived looking like two guys from the lawn crew at Donald Trump’s golf courses, while the other anglers looked like Trump. “We’re just workin’ guys,” Starkey said, “who like to fish.” The sponsored fishermen had fish finders and gear and these two guys had bait they caught themselves. They had no spoon for the ravioli, so they fashioned a spoon out of a plastic Dr. Pepper bottle. The hey hit the lake for the Carolina Cat catfish qualifier. They headed for the North Carolina side of the lake that bisects South Carolina and that other Carolina while all the big shots except one headed for the South Carolina side. “We joked we were lost,” Starkey said. “Those others probably saw us go the other direction and laughed,” Knight said. In a half hour, they have the maximum 10 poles in the water at a spot Knight found on his fish card. “Then one of the poles, it bent down to the water and Jason yelled out there was something big down there,” Starkey said. Knight said what blue-collar guys say: “Good fish.” They reeled and reeled and Knight said: “Real good fish.” They tussled in a blue catfish half the size of Knight and then realized one problem: They had no scale to weigh it on the jalopy of a boat. They put the fish in the live well and caught two more - the limit was three - then went in for the weigh-in. Starkey and Knight chugged up to the dock looking like Germans had hit them with a torpedo. But what matters in fishing is when burly men officially weigh the fish on the dock. The biggest fish caught that day, on a pole from Walmart, weighed 44 and a half pounds. And Starkey and Knight caught it. For total weight of three fish, they came in second overall. They posed for pictures as all fishermen must do. Starkey, as burly as a beer keg, smiling, in his orange t-shirt, looked like the sunset. Knight beamed with the big fish in his arms like a baby boy. The contest cost $130 to enter. They had to pay for gasoline for the truck and the boat and the rods and the ravioli and the Dr. Peppers. Even with the prize of $405 for the biggest fish, the tournament probably didn’t make them twenty dollars. But none of that matters. These two guys plan to enter more big tournaments. They hope to get sponsors. Until then, Starkey has to enter with his new nickname, given to him by the other mechanics at Armor Electric in Rock Hill. The name is shouted and laughed with pride from men with callused hands who dip Copenhagen and still smoke Winstons. Starkey loves his new nickname. “They all are now calling me Catfish,” said Starkey.

Oleh Zhownirovych, 54, of Clifton, N.J., was charged in Johnson County District Court with aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. The incident occurred about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday in the 7700 block of Frontage Road. Overland Park police said the baby’s mother was standing in a checkout line when a man she didn’t know came up and grabbed the baby. He allegedly began choking the infant before a security guard and some bystanders intervened and held him until police arrived. The security guard acted especially quickly to stop the attack, according to Leslee Wright, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. “He did jump in immediately to help,” she said. As is usual at Wal-Mart stores, the guard is not a company employee but rather employed by a security firm. The company does not always encourage security guards or bystanders to get physically involved in every kind of incident, but in this case, Wright said, it seemed the right thing to do. “I think they did act heroically,” she said. “We don’t know what would have happened to that child. I think this definitely rose to the level of potentially life and death.” In a prepared statement, Wal-Mart said the company is working with police. “Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store,” the statement read in part. The baby was not seriously injured, police said, but the felony aggravated battery charge alleges that he attacked the baby in a manner in which “great bodily harm, disfigurement or death” could have occurred. The misdemeanor battery charge involves one of the men who subdued him. Bond for Zhownirovych was set at $100,000. He made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon and is scheduled back in court Oct. 27. A Ukrainian Orthodox church in Clifton is listed as his address on Johnson County jail booking records. Officials there said that Zhownirovych was the former pastor, but had left the position last year.

In fact, businesses struggle to compete with startups that can somehow maximise the value of the new economy, and are able to undermine traditional business models. “Over the past 20 years, IT has been set up for efficiency, cost reduction and doing things as safely as possible,” says Benjamin Wootton, co-founder of Contino. He says companies are now driven by the need to work faster and are becoming more agile in order to improve the customer experience. “This is applying pressure on IT and how we develop software,” he says. Whereas IT heads previously implemented heavyweight internal IT processes and used outsourcing to reduce cost and maintain quality, in Wootton’s experience, this style of running IT slowed down IT departments. “DevOps and continuous delivery allow organisations to operate faster, which is what enterprises want to do today,” he says. But Wootton argues that among the challenges for IT leaders is the fact that big enterprises are risk adverse and tend to stick with a tried and trusted formula, often contrary to contemporary best practices. Shifting the enterprise mindset Kingsley Davis, a partner at Underscore Consulting, adds: “You want to deliver quickly and at pace, which means having a clear strategy about what things are not important for the product.” Technology such as Docker, to enable developers to create code that can run in their own containers, along with the ability to have short feedback loops, helps businesses to adapt more quickly. Such technology and techniques form the basis of the cultural shift that companies of all sizes need to make to enable their developer teams to become more adept at delivering software quickly, says Davis. “Culture is very easy to instil when there is a small group of people,” he says. “Hiring is key.” Davis recommends that IT leaders plan in advance, and hire people appropriate to the direction the IT strategy is taking. Russ Miles, lead engineer at Atomist, believes IT leaders can learn much from the way webscale organisations approach software development. “Organisations of any size have to compete,” he says. The speed of change is such that IT leaders cannot afford not to adapt their business processes. “People look at what Netflix is doing and the thing to take away is that agile software development will only get you so far,” says Miles. “The software itself needs to be as adaptable as the process.” What this boils down to, says Miles, is that IT leaders need to figure out how to adapt systems and the work IT departments need to do, to achieve the speed and flexibility required by the business. A case for smarter analytics If they cannot meet the needs of the business, business users will go elsewhere, or even develop the systems themselves. “Business users are driving software development,” says Frank Ketelaars, big data technical leader for Europe at IBM. This is a form of shadow IT, he adds. “They use spreadsheet data warehouses as their own analytics platform.” Given the need for developers to be productive and create applications quickly, Ketelaars says technologies such as Apache Spark make it possible for businesses to develop machine learning capabilities more easily than before. Also, the availability of deep learning services is pushing the boundaries of analytics in terms of the massive computational intelligence such algorithms can bring to bear on hard-to-solve problems. But with such technological developments comes new challenges. Deep learning is here, but one thing that is missing is context Frank Ketelaars, IBM Ketelaars says the plethora of analytics tools available makes it hard to validate data models. “It is extremely difficult working with the variety of analytics libraries and tools that are available,” he says.  What developers need, says Ketelaars, is a route to analytics services via a common programming interface, giving them the features of an analytics tool within their own applications. Another challenge facing analytics applications is how to make sense of the data. “Deep learning is here, but one thing that is missing is context,” says Ketelaars. “If I have a picture with two people running after each other, and one has a frisbee, I know this image is about playing.” Deep learning algorithms can instantly recognise the image of two people running, he says, but adds: “The context changes dramatically if one of them has a chainsaw. This is where context controls what you should do with the image.”  For Ketelaars, understanding context will be a key requirement in applications, to understand the meaning behind the analytics. “You have to start thinking about what data you have to control the behaviour of your application,” he says. Essentially, applications become smarter, providing users with the information they need based on a deep contextual understanding of what it deems relevant or important. Improving tooling Arguably, there is room for improvement among the array of tools, building blocks and techniques that developers use to create software, says Phil Trelford, founding member of #F Foundation. “A general-purpose programming language is a bit like a spanner and we are all trying to build large systems with spanners,” he says. “What I would like to see is precision tools.” In fact Trelford goes further, saying the industry needs better “meta tools”, in other words software tools to help the developers of programming tools build precision instruments, rather than generic spanners. While, as the saying goes, “a bad workman blame his tools”, software developers are keen to see improvements in the tooling they use. In part, this helps them cope with the added complexities when coding and operations become one, as in DevOps, says Trelford. “Personally, I would like to be able to say, ‘I need to make this thing happen’, then make it as quickly as possible,” says Miles. But today, developers need to draw together a lot of threads to create and run applications successfully, and complexity is increasing all the time, he says. “Smart tooling will help them handle the cognitive overhead,” he adds. Finding out more about our CW@50 panel discussions In this video, we speak to a panel of CIOs about best practices in working with IT startups. Leading technology experts discuss the trends in enterprise software and how this will affect future applications. In this panel debate filmed at our 50th anniversary, we contemplate how IT could evolve over the next 50 years. Enterprises appear to be following smaller companies in adopting new, more productive ways to code. For instance, WhatsApp, which was developed by a handful of Erlang developers, was sold to Facebook for $19bn, while Walmart recently acquired the F#-based Jet.com e-commerce platform for $3bn. While procedural programming languages such as Java and C have been the bread and butter of enterprise software development, what has been particularly interesting for software development is the uptake of functional programming in recent years, particularly among companies that need to support large numbers of internet customers. As Trelford explains: “Apart from Java, which has huge user groups, the biggest programmer user groups in London are those of the functional programming languages. I run the functional London meeting here. We have been meeting here for about six years and we have over 1,000 members. Scala, I believe, has 1,500-2,000 members and Clojure has been growing, as has Erlang.” Many proponents of these programming languages talk about how little code they need compared with using a procedural language, which makes them attractive for writing code quickly, says Davis. The bigger the project, the more likely it is to fail. It is easier to build small software systems Malcolm Sparks, Juxt But among the reasons for the interest in functional programming is reliability. Malcolm Sparks, director and founder of Juxt, says: “One of the issues we still face as developers is how to build really big software systems. The bigger the project, the more likely it is to fail. It is easier to build small software systems.” Sparks argues that, ideally, software developers should look at architecting systems by integrating many small software components, each of which has been developed to be highly reliable. “We are moving to a world where individual software systems are becoming so critical and so important that we had better build them using the best tools and the best languages, and this is why we are seeing a rise in interest in functional programming,” he says. “Functional programming is a better approach for writing highly reliable systems.” Changing software development landscape   Among the changes Miles is seeing is that software development is no longer a factory floor to churn out new products. Rather, he believes software development is evolving into a continuous R&D practice. “Companies that regard software as a driver for them are the ones that will win and one of the pieces of advice I give to company boards is that they should not think of software development as a general problem that we can solve by throwing more people at it,” says Miles. “Think of software development as a place where you might be surprised what comes out.” Enterprises do not often have the luxury of greenfield development, but as Trelford points out, where enterprises need a new system, there is the opportunity to experiment with the least risk. Think of software development as a place where you might be surprised what comes out Russ Miles, Atomist Wootton says: “Everyone is always excited about the new greenfield stuff, but there is a real business case with legacy.” Often, the real business case is actually the J2EE or .Net code that has been running for a decade or more and requires a big support team. “You might do something crazy like services on your mainframe, but it turns out this may be where you get the biggest return on investment,” he says. “Legacy is a bad thing,” says Sparks. While it is exciting to create new code based on microservices and perhaps functional programming, the biggest challenge faced by corporate IT is often how to handle a growing legacy of old stuff. “It can be the millstone that drags you to the bottom of the sea,” says Sparks, who urges CIOs to look constantly at what can be decommissioned, and have development teams write new applications. These not only help to move the business forward but, at the same time, enable IT to decommission something else. Davis believes that the new techniques available to developers, such as reusable microservices, containers, functional programming and continuous delivery, offer enterprises an ideal opportunity to reduce risk and improve reliability. “It is all about safe, small-scale scalability,” he says. The tools and techniques discussed enable IT departments to avoid the risk of modifying mission-critical applications by augmenting them in a highly controlled way, adds Davis. Why software development matters Technology is creating jobs, not just in programming but also in sales, marketing, operations, finance and human resources in tech businesses and traditional industries. Software engineers power technology, and they are increasingly able to come up with innovative solutions that enable UK businesses to compete in a global market. More than 600,000 startups were created in 2015, creating jobs and driving the UK economy. Many of these were either technology businesses or used technology to remove significant barriers to market. Technology has become integral to any business. Marianne Lake, CFO of investment bank JPMorgan, was recently quoted as saying: “We are a technology company.” Retailers, publishers, manufacturers and other industries that might not traditionally be branded as technology companies, increasingly realise that their survival and future success depends on gaining a competitive advantage through technology. They often seek help to drive innovation in their engineering teams through engagement with developer communities such as Skills Matter. Someone put it to me that the UK’s recent decision to leave Europe was as much driven by a discomfort with the speed of innovation and globalisation as it was by other reasons, such as immigration or concerns about sovereignty. He pointed out that my industry, the tech industry, is growing too quickly and perhaps needs to slow down a little. He illustrated this with an example. A truck driver working for a transport company for the past 20 years, probably earning £30k-£35k per year, still a decade or two away from retirement and two kids to raise, is going to be unhappy with innovation such as driverless cars, and so innovation is creating an unfair world. This may of course be true, unless we give his daughter the skills to design that driverless car, his son the ability to come up with new business models that will launch a whole new industry, and his grandchildren the opportunity to gain the work experience they need to take a new concept to a global market. Running a business for just over a decade has taught me you need to pick your fights. Trying to slow innovation is not one I would pick. Coming up with new ideas and approaches to challenges is integral to humankind. Someone invented a car, a delivery truck. Someone invented the business model for a successful transport company. Even if we were able to slow or stop innovation in the UK, we would never be able to do so in the wider world. And if we try, we will deprive our kids of the opportunity to gain the skills they need to be participants in the future economy, to find jobs in this country instead of elsewhere. Technology and software development is powering growth in every industry. It is giving many British businesses a competitive advantage and is creating new industries where our kids can find a successful future.

But it may have a far bigger reach in retail than commonly understood — signaling more threats to mass market retailers.  Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 743.24 +24.17 +3.36% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% ChannelAdvisor Corp ECOM ▼ 13.65 -0.25 -1.80% Piper Jaffray Cos PJC ▼ 65.85 -0.10 -0.15% Amazon's yearly sales account for about 15% of total U.S. consumer online sales, according to the company's statements and the Department of Commerce. But the Seattle e-commerce company may actually be handling double that amount — 20% to 30% of all U.S. retail goods sold online — thanks to the volume of sales it transacts for third parties on its website and app. Only a portion of those sales add to its revenue.   “The punchline is that Amazon’s twice as big as people give them credit for, because there’s this iceberg under the surface, but you only see the tip,” said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of Channel Advisor, an e-commerce software company that works with thousands of online sellers. When third-party sales are taken into account, Amazon's share of what U.S. shoppers spend online could be as high as $125 billion yearly, and it could represent close to 30% of the online goods Americans buy, according to an analysis of Amazon's financial statements. Gene Munster, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray, estimates Amazon touches 30% of total e-commerce in the United States, and its share is growing. “Amazon’s just going to slowly grab more and more of your wallet,” he said. Related slideshow: Jeff Bezos through the years Jeff Bezos through the years Given its growth, it's possible to contemplate a future with Amazon as the nation’s largest single retailer, though what that looks like is unclear.  Walmart was massively disruptive when it came on the scene, laying waste to local retail districts with each megastore it opened. Amazon, which increasingly can offer delivery in one to two hours, promises to be even more disruptive, said Jason Goldberg, senior vice president of commerce at Razorfish, an e-commerce marketing agency. “The more power Amazon gets, the tougher it makes it for those independent retailers,” he said. Amazon by the numbers Estimates of Amazon's true reach in online sales start with its domestic revenue — $63.7 billion in 2015 retail sales in the United States and Canada, with Canada making up a relatively small portion of its sales.  In the United States, total annual retail sales are about $5 trillion, with the Department of Commerce estimating 8% of that is e-commerce. That puts total online sales at around $400 billion, and Amazon’s share at 15%. Amazon's retail revenue, however, doesn't reflect the full value of the items sold on Amazon by other retailers. These are companies that use Amazon as an online sales venue, sometimes their only one. Amazon says 49% of its units sold come from third-party sellers. As an example, think of televisions. Search “32 inch TV” on Amazon, then click “32” and under.” A total of 457 possible matches come up. But only 45 of them are actually sold by Amazon. The rest come from companies like A-Meado Enterprices LLC, with 55, ByBuy with 54 and IPC-Store with 33. These are separate companies that use Amazon as a sales platform. Some have their own warehouses and only take orders on Amazon, some hire Amazon to take care of the entire process, a service called Fulfillment by Amazon.         “Amazon is basically the fronting website for a lot of retailers out there,” said Charles O’Shea, a senior analyst with Moody’s Investors Service. To the average consumer, there's not much difference between something they buy on the Amazon site that comes from Amazon versus something that someone else is selling there, said John Haber, CEO of Spend Management, a supply chain consulting firm in Atlanta that works with many online retailers. “The stuff comes in an Amazon branded box,” Haber said. But to Wall Street, they're different, which is how the measure of how big Amazon looms in the average buyer’s world could be significantly underestimated. Wait, how big? Amazon doesn't release is it gross merchandize volume, or GMV, a measurement of total sales dollar value for merchandise sold through the site. Instead it talks about the ways its sellers are creating jobs and investing in their local communities.  "In 2015, more than 70,000 entrepreneurs achieved over $100,000 in sales selling on Amazon," said Erik Fairleigh, an Amazon spokesman. Without GMV, estimates of how much of the U.S. online retail market Amazon touches comes from its annual sales, made up of what Amazon made selling its own goods plus how much Amazon made selling other people’s goods, the third party vendors. Their number has been growing. The commissions those vendors pay Amazon can vary between 5% to 30% but many experts give 10% as a reasonable average guess. If just 10% of that value appears in Amazon’s revenue stream, the rest would not. That remainder, 90% of everything Amazon sells, represents the value of the third-party goods sold.   “For a $100 lamp, Amazon gets $10 and the seller who used Amazon gets $90. But it’s still $100 going through Amazon as the sales point,” said Razorfish's Goldberg. Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones, estimates Amazon's involvement in all U.S. online sales at 31.3%. “If you look at what they’re actually touching in terms of merchandize. It’s really significant,” he said. Using e-commerce sales data ChannelAdvisor collects to inform his estimate, Wingo goes as high as 36%. "When you 'unpack' the $63.7 billion revenue, that has transactional value (what Wall St. calls Gross Merchandise Value) of $135 billion ($56 billion direct from Amazon and $79 billion from third party sellers)  which is 36% of overall commerce," he said.    All these estimates involve some guesswork. Moody's O’Shea thinks Amazon is bigger than its financials make it appear but doesn’t think it’s possible to accurately gauge exactly how much bigger.  “I don’t think there’s reliable data out there,” he said, Spend Management's Haber thinks 25% could be a tad low, but without Amazon releasing specific GMV figures, “we can’t really tell. Without the numbers you cannot truly ascertain their exact share of consumers’ wallets,” he said. More retail waves Just as Big Box stories killed off mom-and-pop operations, Amazon could kill off Big Boxes, some speculate.  “Think of Office Max and Staples. Those stores all thrived because they had a bigger assortment than the customer was used to. But today they can buy 300 kinds of stapler on Amazon. So those big boxes that used to win on assortment can’t win on assortment anymore,” Razerfish's Goldberg said. Piper Jaffray estimates 44% of the U.S. population now lives within 20 miles of an Amazon fulfillment center. This online dominance could in turn mean the end of malls, which are increasingly dependent on having big box stores as anchors. And as the Amazon effect becomes more prevalent, the same thing could hit strip malls, gradually working its way down to ever smaller stores. The potential effect on the American retail landscape, Goldberg said, could be “remarkable.” Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From USA TODAY Google's app wants to do the scanning for you USA TODAY Police shut down Oklahoma City airport after shooting USA TODAY Report: Snap files for IPO that could value it at $25B USA TODAY The problem with Donald Trump's kids USA TODAY USA TODAY View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter
News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Police: Mom used daughter, 12, as shoplifting accomplice Thursday Oct 20, 2016 at 10:16 AM Wal-Mart on SW 19th Avenue Road Austin L. Miller @almillerosb An Ocala police officer and loss prevention officers on Wednesday detained a mother, her 12-year-old daughter and the woman’s boyfriend in connection with theft from the Wal-Mart at 2600 SW 19th Avenue Road. When Officer Mike Rossi stopped the girl from leaving the store she yelled for her mother. The store’s loss prevention officers apprehended the mother and her boyfriend. Their names are withheld to avoid identifying the minor. One of the loss prevention officers told Rossi that she saw the juvenile walking quickly through the men’s department and met with her mother and the boyfriend. The man was observed picking out several purses, which his girlfriend and the minor used to conceal various clothing chosen by them. Once they were done, the trio walked toward the garden center. The girl first walked outside, where she was stopped by Rossi. When the juvenile shouted for her mother, the woman put down one of the stolen purses that contained store items and tried to leave with another stolen purse. As she and her boyfriend walked outside, they were stopped by loss prevention officers. Officials said the stolen goods were valued at $251.74 before tax. All three were charged with petit theft. The adults were transported to the Marion County Jail. The girl was taken to the juvenile section of the jail. The mom faces an additional charge of contributing the delinquency of a minor. Rossi noted in his report that she has been convicted of larceny and theft in Jacksonville, DeLand and Seminole County. Local court records show the man was adjudicated guilty for possession of a firearm in violation of domestic violence injunction in July 2016. Five years prior, he was adjudicated guilty for possession of cannabis less than 20 grams. The Department of Children and Families was notified about the incident and the arrest. Jail records show the adults were released from jail at 2:56 a.m. Thursday after posting bond. Contact Austin L.

Laptops Acer’s updated Chromebook 15 offers 12 hours of battery life at just $199 By Sohil Nikam - Oct 20, 2016 Acer’s released a brand new Chromebook 15 which improves upon its previous model in terms of battery life and build quality. The ultra-cheap laptop is now being sold via Walmart and will set interested buyers back by $199 (roughly Rs 13300). The refreshed Chromebook 15’s primary appeal is still its 15.6-inch screen, an aspect which sets it apart from other notebooks in Google’s lineup. However, users will have to deal with a very average 1366 x 768p resolution when looking at said display. It’s probably a necessary sacrifice taking into consideration the device’s low price tag. Other than the big panel, the Acer offering promises a very long 12-hour battery life. This is considerably higher than the 9 hours its predecessor could achieve between charges. The manufacturer has also upgraded the laptop’s connectivity options by adding a pair of USB 3.0 slots and faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Also Read: Acer outs world’s first curved screen laptop, 13-inch convertible Chromebook The brand touts that the fresh Chromebook 15 can survive over 130 pounds of force. It could even be dropped at a height of 2 feet and live to tell the tale. The notebook is notably low-end when it comes to specs, sporting just 16GB of storage, 2GB of RAM, and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Celeron N3060 processor. A quick look at the main specifications of the Acer Chromebook 15: – Display: 15.6-inch, 1366 x 768 pixels – OS: Chrome OS – Storage: 16GB – RAM: 2GB – CPU: 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Celeron N3060 – Battery: 3950mAh – Weight: 4.3lb – Connectivity: Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth, HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0 Once again, you can buy the Acer Chromebook 15 via Walmart.

"Kevin is bringing very exciting and unique experience to Experticity and our growing client base," said Tom Stockham, CEO of Experticity. "He has worked with our team in an advisory capacity, and everyone who has had the privilege of working with him has been in awe of his knowledge and expertise, and loved the quality of the specific recommendations he has made. No one is better at helping brands succeed in reaching and building relationships with customers through social channels, and we could not be more excited to have Kevin join our team." Knight comes to Experticity from Pinterest, where he served as the head of creative and brand strategy, leading the team that works directly with the company's largest clients and advertising agencies. He was also the primary creator and leader of the Pin Factory, an in-house content production studio, and led the company's industry relations, agency relations, insights and marketing communications teams during his tenure.  At Pinterest, Knight worked closely with many of the most prominent companies and agencies in the global marketplace. Brands included Target, P&G, General Mills, Walmart, Unilever, PepsiCo, Gap, General Motors and Honda. Agencies included BBDO, Droga5, Deep Focus, Edelman, Mindshare, VaynerMedia, Ogilvy, and many others.

At Google, he developed innovative strategies for helping brands advertise more effectively on Google and YouTube. At Facebook, he led the development and execution of a host of social marketing strategies and campaigns, including some of the most impactful social campaigns ever created.   "I have dedicated most of my career to creating advertising and branding experiences that benefit both brands and consumers, and I've learned from the very best," said Knight.

The man later told police that his Uber ride was rolling along E. 7th Street when he and the driver got into a political argument. He asked the driver to let him out of the car immediately, but the two argued more before they were even able to come to a stop. After he got out of the car, the victim told police the Uber driver began chasing after him while yelling that he was going to "beat his ass." Fork It Over A man went on a robbery spree near Reedy Creek Park while he was truly only equipped for a buffet spree. Two reports filed within minutes of each other show that the suspect went into two businesses to carry out armed robberies, but he wasn't holding a gun. The man, who went into Cottage Express Chinese Food and then Bakery and Deli Salvadoreno demanding cash from employees at each spot, was only armed with a fork. Police showed up shortly after and seized the man's weapon. Not Wasting Time A woman's trip to Wild Wing Café got expensive frighteningly quick last week, and it wasn't because of anything she ordered. The woman told police that she arrived at Wild Wing in Ayrsley with a man who was driving and left her purse in the car at 8 p.m. By 8:30 p.m., she was already receiving alerts that someone was attempting to use her debit card to buy hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise at the Walmart right across the street. She checked the car and found that, sure enough, it was unlocked and her purse was gone. Tarantino Fan It seems that Jules from Pulp Fiction made a stop in south Charlotte last week, and once again, he ran into a problem with that old wallet of his. A 26-year-old man filed a police report after a woman lifted his wallet in a Dunkin' Donuts on Colony Road. In the police report, the man described his missing property as a New York driver's license, seven $100 bills, two $20 bills, two $10 bills, three $1 bills and a wallet that says "Bad Motherfucker" on it. Cold Blooded A 17-year-old girl called police after she was assaulted at work last week by a customer who must not have been happy with their service. The girl told officers that she was working at Zaxby's Chicken in east Charlotte when someone she had never seen before came in and threw a cup of ice in her face. Odd Coinage Police responded to a home break-in in southwest Charlotte last week after someone stole a 61-year-old woman's money, both fake and real. The woman told officers the thief made off with a Crown Royal bag filled with $1,200 worth of loose change. It took much less effort to steal the next $1,000, which was on the top of the dresser in the form of a single bill. But hence, they should be happy with the haul of change because, as they were sure to angrily learn later, the $1,000 bill was a fake. New Strategy While there are plenty of folks outside of Panthers games looking to rip people off by selling fake tickets, there are also those looking to rip off the ticket sellers. One 39-year-old woman said she was trying to get rid of three tickets, $140 each, and was approached by a man who said he wanted to check them to make sure they were real before buying them. He also presented $600 and asked for $280 in change. At some point in the exchange, the man caused the woman to drop all the money and tickets and in the ensuing chaos picked all of it up and ran off. Need Bread A 30-year-old man returned to his home in east Charlotte one morning to find that someone had broken into the home using force at some point overnight. He told officers his door was kicked in and some items were missing, but they weren't the items you'd expect a true burglar to go after. This thief was just after a sandwich and a little cleanliness. According to the report, the only items missing were some pickles, some bacon, some sandwich meat, some cheese and a roll of toilet paper. Numbskulls Each holiday brings new decorations and each set of decorations brings the same delinquents out from their hangouts to see who can steal the most ridiculous lawn ornament. One such troublemaker staked their claim to this year's Halloween decorations contest last week when they stole a 7-foot-tall skeleton decoration from the yard of an East Boulevard-based law firm called Gardner Skelton (ahhh, we see what you did there). Just to reinforce how dedicated these holiday thieves can be, employees at the law firm confirmed to police that the skeleton was secured to the tree by a thick cable that was cut during the caper. Good Samaritans A 21-year-old man learned a lesson about humanity while looking for help last week outside his southwest Charlotte home. The man told police he flagged down a car to ask for help with his own car, which was in the parking lot of his apartment complex. A car carrying three males stopped for him and it appeared for a moment they would help him, but instead they pulled out a gun and robbed him of his cash and cellphone. Blotter items are chosen from the files of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty.

Oleh ZhownirovychJohnson County (Kansas) jail  Oleh Zhownirovych is charged with aggravated battery, Overland Park, Kansas police said. The 4-month-old girl was with her mother at 7:30 a.m. when a man walked up from behind and put his hands around the baby's throat, police spokesman John Lacy said.  The baby's mother, Quisha Hill, told Fox 4 in Kansas City that she didn't know the man. Hill said the man told her he was taking the baby and tried to pull the carrier out of her shopping cart, Fox 4 reported. The mother started screaming and people rushed to help, KMBC.com said. People in the Overland Park store then pinned the man down until police arrived. The infant was not injured, police told. The mother said she didn't know the man, who witnesses said looked to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the report said.  The pastor left his position at the Ukrainian Orthodox Holy Ascension Cathedral in Clifton about 10 months ago, according to KMBC.com and KansasCity.com. Zhownirovych will make his first appearance in court Thursday at 2:30 p.m. EDT. Jeff Goldman may be reached at jeff_goldman@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JeffSGoldman.

The digitization of products, services and commerce models are democratizing current healthcare systems. This helps unlocking new, previously inaccessible segments which traditionally had high gatekeeper costs. Spurred by these shifts in the market environment,  medtech and pharma companies are strategizing on how to move beyond simple product or pill based sales models towards customer-centric 'as a service' solutions (Product as a Service, Platform as a Service and Data as a Service, Insights as a Service). Healthcare 2020—Business Model Transformation Guidebook is new analysis from Frost & Sullivan's Visionary Healthcare Growth Partnership Service program. For complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit http://frost.ly/y4. "CEOs should pay attention to developing innovative business models to monitize emerging opportunities. Scalability is the most critical success factor," said Frost & Sullivan Transformational Health Industry Analyst Kamaljit Behera. "Collaboration and open-source innovation are key ingredients for future restructuring. Companies such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson and Intel will continue to compete outside their domain, forcing traditional healthcare companies to change their dominant business models." Actionable health outcome data will be the new battleground in the healthcare industry. Walmart is planning to take bold steps, from introducing disruptive product-service bundling packages to aiming to become a primary care provider. Medtronic's Diabetes Management's shift to an intelligent-based solutions business model, commitment to differentiating its product, and value to end users has positioned it two to three years ahead of market competition. Healthcare consumerism will boost models such as crowdsourcing and mass customization, enable price transparency, and provide companies with more flexibility by lowering inventory carrying cost. These models also promote the culture of open innovation, enabling data collection on customer preferences, which will lead to optimized new product developments. From a regional perspective, the Asia-Pacific market is ready to embrace innovative business models with growth opportunities existing in chronic disease management, acute homecare, telehealth, and telehealth-enabled homecare solutions. Large vendors, which can provide a one-stop solution, are in high demand. The region is emerging as an epicenter for regenerative medicine launches. About Frost & Sullivan Frost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants. For more than 50 years, we have been developing growth strategies for the global 1000, emerging businesses, the public sector and the investment community.

Comments By Matt Hamblen Follow Computerworld | Oct 20, 2016 3:01 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Mobile Payments Mobile & Wireless Apple iOS Android Comments Apple Pay marks its two-year anniversary this week, and while it supposedly helped spark a revolution for in-store mobile payments, there's not much celebrating by Apple or its payments rivals. While Apple, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and many others keep adding users, the rate of adoption is far below what was expected when Apple Pay arrived on Oct. 20, 2014. More worrisome is the low repeat-user rate. Many consumers will sign up for a payment app and try it out with contactless technology like Near Field Communications (NFC) on a smartphone once to buy something in a store. After that, many don't bother to do it a second time, because it is just too easy to use a credit or debit card -- or even cash, according to a recent survey. The problem is especially pronounced in the U.S. Strategy Analytics estimates there are now 11 million contactless mobile payment users in the U.S., but just 2.3 million who are active users. The firm said there are just a third as many NFC-based mobile payment users as it projected in 2010. Analyst firm eMarketer estimates that more than seven million people use a smartphone mobile in-store payment app at least once every six months in the U.S. higher -- a number that's expected to more than double in 2020. "There are two reasons why mobile in-store payments have failed to take off: conventional payments are not broken and consumers aren't clear on the benefits of switching to mobile payments," said Nitesh Patel, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. Ditto, said other analysts. If it's not broke, fix it "Mobile wallets haven't yet proven they are measurably better than incumbent payment mechanisms, which general work quite well," said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. "It's incredibly easy to swipe or dip a credit or debit card at a payment terminal and U.S. consumers are used to this mature payment application where they know they are well protected from financial loss," added Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst. "It will take a lot of persuasion and financial incentives to get consumers to change their payment habits." Even industry insiders understand the dilemma. In-store mobile payments, "in a way, are a cool ploy with no purpose," said Mark Ranta, director of product management for digital banking at ACI Worldwide. ACI provides mobile and other payments software to banks, merchants and others. "People ask, 'What's the benefit?'" Ranta added. "For someone who's not tech savvy, they have probably tried it once and said, 'What's the big deal with this? Opening up my wallet and swiping my card wasn't a big deal to me, so why do I need to get rid of that habit? Instead of relying on some weird, wireless thing -- screw that. I have a physical card that I can put in a terminal." Not everybody feels that way. The biggest users of mobile wallets are under age 35, according to various surveys, including one in May by The Pew Charitable Trusts. Smartphone users will pay for goods over the internet or through an app without entering a store, but in-store mobile payments are not as popular. "We're still at the early-adopter stage," said Bryan Yeager, an analyst at eMarketer. Ranta, who is in the under-35 age group, likes the idea that he can use his iPhone with Apple Pay instead of a credit card to pay for things. The only problem is that not every store will accept Apple Pay. "I'm pretty outspoken with my frustration with Apple Pay," Ranta said. "I live in New York and can't really use Apple Pay without my wallet for purchases at gas stations and other places. When I pull out my phone to pay, I have to know they accept apple Pay. The biggest problem they have is that it's not universally accepted." Yeager agreed, saying a lack of widespread acceptance by stores of NFC and other forms of contactless payment is the biggest challenge. "I might try it once and then it's really a matter of where I shop next and whether they have it, so you'll have a drop-off in users," he said. "Once we have ubiquity and more promotion of the technology and its security, it will take off." Samsung Pay's play To some extent, Samsung Pay has circumvented the problem with its purchase of LoopPay mobile magnetic payment technology to include the ability to pay at a magnetic stripe reader terminal as well as with NFC. "Samsung Pay has the ability to mimic a swipe of a mag-stripe card, which gives it a little bit of a leg up," Ranta noted. With Apple Pay now two years old, Ranta said it will take another three years before NFC payment terminals are widely available in the U.S. The implementation of smart chip cards mandated by banks and card companies for retailers a year ago is slowly making NFC payment terminals more widely available, even in smaller stores. Those NFC terminals can accept Apple Pay and many other smartphone payment apps, as long as software is turned on to accept it. Ryan Faas Apple Pay sticker on the door at the Crush and Cask in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Some smaller stores, however, may not want to enable every mobile payment app from various banks, merchants and smartphone maker because there are so many. Ranta believes, however, that smartphones will soon be used to store multiple payment apps to increase the chances of having one that works at nearly every store. There are already too many ways to pay for merchandise in stores, which will put demands on the financial services industry to consolidate, he said. "We already have point-of-sale paralysis," Ranta said. "You have 13 different ways to pay for gum: maybe with three different credit cards, cash cards, Apple Pay or another app and you could also have a QR code from Dunkin.'" Starbucks and Dunkin' use QR codes One irony is that despite all the mega-investments Apple, Samsung and others have made in NFC on smartphones, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Walmart Pay let customers pay using a QR code displayed on a smartphone -- a far cheaper alternative. Strategy Analytics estimated that Starbucks customers in 2015 spent almost $3 billion using the Starbucks app with QR code transactions, The biggest reason for the Starbucks' success is not necessarily QR codes, but how well it and other companies are building customer loyalty with their payment apps through coupons and rewards. A free coffee might come on a person's birthday, for example, or a coupon for a special holiday offer might be easily redeemed with a wave of a phone. "So far, mobile wallets, particularly NFC, have yet to integrate payments with loyalty in a compelling way," Patel said. "You need a single tap to redeem or accumulate points and coupons." Added McKee: "It's what you build on top of the payments that truly matters. The ability to use a smartphone as a credit card surrogate isn't sufficient to drive mass market adoption." Ranta said that Walmart Pay "could be big" if only the retailer would credit a user 5 cents right in the app for every candy bar purchase. "They have all the pieces for mobile payments, but not having rewards is killing them," he said. "Rewards are the holy grail of mobile payments." Not everybody agrees. "Loyalty programs aren't right for every type of merchant," Yeager said. "It makes a lot of sense for Starbucks to make the app stickier. The problem for smaller businesses like the local coffee shop is how to create a digital punch card to buy coffee. It will help smaller merchants to have something like Apple Pay." Bank backing matters Consumer incentives to use mobile payments probably need to come from credit card companies and the banks that back them. But they're unlikely to do so without threatening the credit-driven ecosystem they've built over decades, Litan said. "The credit card industry has spent billions on consumer incentives for plastic payment cards, with loyalty programs, marketing and security protection -- and it has definitely worked," Litan said. "I haven't seen the same kind of incentives introduced for mobile payments. But the card industry really doesn't have anything to gain by doing so. "In fact, they could lose, because once U.S. consumers embrace mobile payments big time, the payment software inside mobile payments could move away from credit and debit cards into cash-like payments and then easily erode credit card market share. The bank and credit card industry is highly aware of this fact." What Walmart and many other major retailers want more than anything is to move away from the "swipe" fees they pay banks for each credit card transaction. (Those fees average about 3%.) To do so, they are attempting to use their own mobile payment apps. "Banks are in an enviable spot and still own the keys to the kingdom," Ranta said. "They are too strong today, but there's downward pressure on swipe fees from companies like Square," which charges less for swipes. Ranta doesn't believe that cash loaded onto mobile payment apps will ever replace credit card apps. "Banks won't be displaced, but their position is weakening." He predicted swipe fees will be lowered, eventually, as banks feel pressure to do so. That could create partnerships between banks and card companies with retailers to create consumer rewards and other incentives to use payment apps. "The banking industry has to change," Ranta said. "It's been a monolithic industry with minimal innovation for over 20 years. It's kind of crazy for banks to point out that they added the smart chip to credit cards, but that's not really innovation. It's evolutionary; the old product wasn't secure so they just added a chip for security. We're at an inflexion point with mobile payments. "Where the revolution has to happen is at the banks, most of us agree."

From staff reports / Published: October 20, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Cars burglarized in Kline Twp. Kline Township police are asking the public to be vigilant about locking vehicles. Overnight Monday into Tuesday and again Tuesday into Wednesday, unlocked vehicles were entered and items were taken from inside. Police Chief John Petrilla said it appears as though the illegal entries are being made after midnight. At least four vehicles were entered. Residents are asked to keep vehicles locked and their eyes open. Petrilla said anyone who notices suspicious activity occurring should immediately call 911. Anyone with information on any crime that is not an urgent matter can call the police station at 570-929-2354. Father hitting son caught on video Two witnesses and store video surveillance captured a father hitting his son Saturday morning, police say. State police at Hazleton were dispatched to a report of the assault around 10 a.m. at Wal-Mart in Hazle Township and spoke to witnesses who said John J. Dering, 54, Freeland, hit his child in the head and face. Video footage showed Dering and a 10-year-old leaving the store around 9:40 a.m. and walking toward a bus stop where Dering hit the child with an open and closed fist. Dering was charged with simple assault and child endangerment, misdemeanors along with a summary count of harassment. He was released on $5,000 unsecured bail following a Saturday afternoon arraignment by Magisterial District Judge James Tupper, Trucksville. Thief awakens to drug charges Butler Township police found heroin and paraphernalia on a 26-year-old man they arrested for a theft, court papers say. Court papers state police were being assisted by Hazleton officers Oct. 8 when they served an arrest warrant on Aaron L. Fernandez, who was found sleeping outside the rear of a home at 549 Peace St. While searching Fernandez police said they found a capped syringe, copper cleaning pad, a metal spoon with residue, a metal pipe used for smoking crack cocaine, 52 empty heroin packets and 10 small paper packets of heroin. Fernandez was charged with possession of a controlled substance and paraphernalia and was arraigned Oct. 9 by Magisterial District Judge Joseph Carmody, West Pittston, who set bail at $5,000. Fernandez was previously charged with theft and receiving stolen property after an Oct. 6 theft of jewelry from a home on Nesco Manor Road and was placed in jail after failing to post $10,000 bail in that case. Arrest papers state a ring he’s accused of stealing was found at a local pawn shop. Fernandez remains incarcerated, according to court records. City man cited for animal cruelty A Hazleton man badly neglected a dog, court papers say. A humane society officer with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals cited Lucas H. Torres, 45, with a summary citation for animal cruelty. The citation claims Torres wantonly or cruelly neglected one male hound mix dog by failing to provide veterinary care Sept. 16 at 213 E. Hemlock St. In the citation, the officer requests forfeiture of the dog ownership and prohibition of ownership. The dog, which was picked up as a stray, was on the roof of Torres’ house after climbing out a window. Charges, citations Charges or citations have been filed against the following, according to court documents. Violations for older offenses appear now because they have only recently been filed or served. ■ Nicholas Nolasco, 24, Freeland, two counts driving under the influence and two summary violations by Butler Township police after a July 2 offense. ■ Timothy J. Brotzman, 34, McAdoo, containers used to store a controlled substance by Hazleton police after an Oct. 11 offense.

Home » Outdoors & Gear » Ask the Gear Guy » How to repair rubber rain boots How to repair rubber rain boots My favorite rubber rain boots have a hole in the side. Now they aren’t dry at all. They weren’t really expensive, but I don’t want to get new ones. How can I repair my boot? Please help. — Wet Wade, Portland, Maine I like it when guys decide to learn how to repair their gear rather than just throw it out. First off, get a tube of Shoe Goo, which you can find in many stores like Walmart or the local drugstore. Make sure the boot’s surface is clean where the hole is and put a piece of duct tape on the inside of your boot in that same spot. Apply a small glob of Shoe Goo to the outside of the hole and let it fill it in. Be sure to remove the tape on the inside after about an hour or so or it’ll become stuck to the Shoe Goo repair site forever! You can even make your repair look professional by using an ice cube to smooth out the Goo before it dries. Then just let the Shoe Goo cure for 24 hours, and your boots should be bone-dry once again.

Waterstone Makes $20K Down Payment On Pittsfield Walmart Project By Andy McKeeveriBerkshires Staff 01:18AM / Thursday, October 20, 2016Print | Email PITTSFIELD, Mass. — The developers of the proposed Walmart Supercenter at the William Stanley Business Park has put down $20,000 toward the purchase of the land.   The Pittsfield Economic Development Authority extended the letter of intent with Waterstone Retail Development until the end of December, making more time for the two sides to reach a purchase and sales agreement. In good faith, Waterstone has put down a $20,000 non-refundable deposit toward the purchase.   Once the purchase and sales agreement is signed, Waterstone is expected to make another $45,000 down payment.   "Waterstone is showing good faith in attaching some non-refundable funds to that request, which we believe is more than adequate," PEDA Executive Director Corydon Thurston said. "I am convinced they are absolutely committed."   It is a second extension of the letter of intent to purchase the land, giving the company exclusive right to pursue a purchase and lease agreement on the 16.57-acre parcel known as the teens. Thurston believes the "substantial" part of that agreement has been completed but final engineering needed to file with the city's permitting office has not been finalized.   "The substance of this discussion is that all of the engineering has not quite been finished. Although the board has an opportunity to look at the lease purchase agreement, that are pretty much in their substantial final form, they are not complete because of the inability to finalize all of the necessary exhibits and attachments," Thurston said.    The purchase-and-lease agreement is expected to be finalized, with budget numbers, in December. The scope is that Waterstone would lease the land for approximately two years, depending on the timing, to pursue permitting and prepare the site for construction. Waterstone has recently revised its budget estimate on the site work from $12 million up to $14 million to get the parcel ready for construction of a building.   Once the permitting and site work is completed, the company and PEDA would execute a sale of the parcel. PEDA is selling the land for $65,000 per acre, thus a total price of just over $1.07 million.   Then, construction of the new 190,000 square-foot super center would commence, which would be expected to take about a year. The time frame for the center's development is still very unknown, but estimates say the buildings wouldn't be opened until close to 2019.   Thurston said Waterstone's application for permitting to the city is expected in about a month. Once those documents are prepared, the company would execute a purchase-and-sales agreement, putting $65,000 as a down payment. In asking for another extension of the letter of intent, Waterstone put $20,000 of that $65,000 down.   "The parties agree that in consideration of Waterstone's simultaneous payment of $20,000 as a partial payment due under the lease purchase agreement contemplated under the LOI and by reason of the extensive site engineering required in preparation of Waterstone's application to the Department of Community Development and the City Council, the time frame for the lease purchase is hereby further extended through December 30, 2016," Thurston read from the agreement.   The partial deposit is the first concrete move toward the project by Waterstone. The company announced the project and was given the OK to proceed with planning and negotiations with PEDA for it but no money had been on the table. Waterstone's deposit shows a commitment toward moving the project along.   "We've pretty much gone through the heavy lifting," Thurston said of negotiating a purchase and lease agreement.    Waterstone still has to finish the engineering work to fully outline the scope of work, coupled with a project budget, in the six weeks or so to finalize the document.    The store's development has been a hot topic in the city as a debate over the usage of the former General Electric site has varying viewpoints. The parcel is one of the last large industrial sites in the city and many feel the intent of business park should be on finding manufacturing, and not big box stores.   However, city officials have found little interest in developing the site and it has sat vacant for years.    The plan would be for Walmart to close its store at Berkshire Crossing and then open the new supercenter at the intersection of Woodlawn Avenue and Tyler Street. Overall the project is estimated in the $30 million range.     Related Recent Walmart Stories: Pittsfield Will Not Yet Ask Waterstone For Economic...

It is important to point out that my escape would have been Corpitos, not Corpus Christi. One may be sent to Corpus Christi on business, visit the Sparkling City by the Sea before going deep-sea fishing or even plan a summer stay on the beach. But one escapes to Corpitos. Sin plan, you buy a cold Big Red and a bag of Sabritones y vamonos recio. Once there, you stop at the H-E-B or the Walmart in Flour Bluff and buy a towel or a sabana to keep you from sitting on the sand. And once it’s over, you drive back home a little too pink, a little too sandy and happily reminded that the beach — and beach o’clock — are always a couple of hours away. Most Popular 1 Video: 3 women brawl at H-E-B in San Antonio 2 Student's body found inside Texas State University building 3 DEA, FBI raid West Side family medicine clinic I’m not unique. Many South Texas comadres have done this with their own circle of comadres. And for the many, many comadres of my generation, such escapes included Selena. Selena on the CD player or the iPod. A stop by the Selena statue. A drive past Selena’s house. Whataburger on the beach, like Selena and Chris had in the movie. Even if you weren’t singing along — although, no se hagan! Who wasn’t? — Selena was there, in that deep red lipstick. I was lucky enough to have a tight group of comadres who were always game for a quick trip to Corpitos. We loved the beach. La Chulis, La Lively, Despeinada, Güerincles y La De Corpus were fans of Selena, having a spa day, singing karaoke, going to lunch, dancing, enjoying those just-add-tequila plastic buckets of margarita mix and just having fun. We talked about all the things we wanted and laughed about all the things we couldn’t have for hours. And for a few years before our lives took us in different directions, we kept each other company every single day. But life gets complicated, and escaping to the beach como si nada has become more complicated, too. The unveiling of the cosmetics line brought it all back. “She was my best friend,” Suzette Quintanilla, Selena’s sister, told Time magazine. “We talked about everything. Clearly, we’re girls and makeup was one of the key things we liked to talk about.” She said that a makeup collection, like the one MAC has unveiled with lipgloss called Bidi Bidi Bom Bom and eyeshadow called Fotos y Recuerdos, was something Selena had dreamed about before she was taken from us. Sadly, she didn’t live to see that dream. She did, however, bring a bunch of us together en grupitos, if only for a little while. For some, putting Selena’s name on a compact might be little more than a marketing gimmick. For me, it’s a fun little present from an old friend…from a past life. mariaanglin@yahoo.com Breaking News Hundreds march Alamo Plaza to protest pipeline Photos show demolition of CPS Energy Tuttle power plant Pot-bellied pigs rescued from 'suspicious' home fire San Antonio home sales, prices still rising fast The Latest SAPD: Man shot in head after finding alleged sex offender Ex-WWE star to launch S.A. restaurant 'Daddy's Hands' country star dies at 59 Tony Romo concedes starting quarterback slot Trump gets his man in U.S. House Texas students expelled over blackface video Man in custody after fatal shooting of woman Woman sues Zara USA, Inc. after finding a dead mouse sewn into...

During checkout at stores, customers tap their phones on a payment terminal or scan a QR code. The transaction value of such payments will more than triple in the U.S. this year, to $27 billion, according to EMarketer.   Read the rest of Bloomberg Businessweek’s The Year Ahead in Retail. Photo Illustration: 731; Photos: Getty Images (2)   Loyalty Counts By absorbing the functions of loyalty cards, mobile wallets can beat credit and debit cards for convenience. Launched in October, Kohl’s Pay lets users redeem Kohl’s Cash and coupons, accrue rewards, and pay with the retailer’s branded Charge Card—in one step. Starbucks’s wallet lets customers earn free drinks and order and pay ahead; it makes up about 25 percent of the chain’s U.S. transactions.   Biting Into Apple Two-year-old Apple Pay leads in mobile in-store payments, but most big banks, retailers, and restaurants are expected to get their own wallets in the next year: Chase Pay and CVS Pay are rolling out now.   Convenience Is Key Customers can set up their Walgreens app, which uses Apple Pay as a platform, to recognize when they’re at the pharmacy and automatically bring up the rewards card on their phone’s screen at checkout. Besides displaying rewards balances in users’ wallets, the Kohl’s app lets loyalty members make purchases using rewards via their phones.   The Payoff for Retailers Customers who use a store’s loyalty program tend to shop there more frequently and buy more each time; and about 70 percent of consumers are likelier to join a loyalty program if their points and rewards become immediately visible on their phones, says mobile-marketing firm Urban Airship. So combining loyalty and payments lets retailers woo new users, especially smartphone-savvy millennials. Another bonus: When customers are steered toward a retailer’s branded charge card by its mobile payment service, as they are with Kohl’s Pay, the store can make extra money from incentives it gets from companies providing financing to its customers. It also saves on transaction fees that would have gone to Visa or MasterCard.

School leavers or college dropouts would be trained to speak with an American accent, posing as US Internal Revenue Service officials and scare people into believing they owed the government cash, detectives said. The scheme, which had been operating for over a year, netted more than $150,000 a day, they added. More than 70 people have been arrested after police this month swooped on call centres in western India, from Mumbai to the Gujarat capital of Ahmedabad, but they suspect the network could stretch even further. “We believe that the racket is spread across India, including in the north,” Parambir Singh, commissioner of police in the Mumbai suburb of Thane, said. Police from Thane, on the outskirts of India’s financial capital, rounded up at least 770 employees of bogus call centres on October 4. Most were let go pending further investigations but 72 were arrested while another suspect was detained this week as police try to close in on the 23-year-old alleged mastermind. It is claimed the accused would berate victims for falsely failing to pay taxes and then threaten them with jail if they did not cough up immediately. The con artists would use an altered caller ID number that made it look like they were ringing from the United States and often quoted IRS badge numbers to make them appear legitimate. The fraudsters would trick the victim into sending money, often through pre-paid debit cards that can be purchased at stores like Walmart, or even by buying Apple iTunes gift cards. In both instances transfers are made by the victim handing over the card’s registration number. The iTunes scam has even led Apple to issue a global warning on its website urging people not to give the number to someone they do not know. The IRS has been warning about identical scams for a few years with reports in US media that such schemes might have been operating out of India. In January, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said it was aware of more than 5,000 victims who had paid more than $26.5 million in such scams since October 2013. “It is one of the biggest fraud  cases to surface in recent times in Mumbai,” Parag Manere, Thane police deputy commissioner, said, adding the ringleaders found willing recruits. “Hiring was easy. They just gave out pamphlets about job openings and received applications, mostly from school or college dropouts,” said Manere. Commissioner Singh said ringleaders “lured youngsters with good working knowledge of English and trained them how to speak with an American accent”. Police believe the recruits were paid Rs 30,000-70,000 a month, plus commission. Some made the initial calls while others were employed to “close” deals. They would work through the night to catch Americans during their day and sometimes left threatening voicemail messages if their targets didn’t answer the phone, it is alleged. A victim of a similar-sounding scam told NBC last year the caller had her “so frightened” but felt “embarrassed, guilty and ashamed” when she realised she had been swindled. Singh said Thane police knew of 2,000 people suspected of involvement in the scam, but the force believes there are more, and is working with their counterparts in neighbouring Gujarat state and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Police in Ahmedabad raided more than half a dozen call centres following the Thane operation, a senior crime branch official said, while searches were also carried out in the Gujarati cities of Bhuj, Surat and Vadodara. Police are desperate to find alleged mastermind Sagar Thakkar, known as “Shaggy”, who is from Ahmedabad but may have fled India, possibly to Dubai. Thakkar had half a dozen people working for him in the US and was preparing to expand operations, according to the Ahmedabad officer. “He was planning to set up five more call centres by December,” he said. —AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Economic ties require more than good intentions The shine off Trump in LA? → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman welcomes Yemen ceasefire HM receives greetings from Fahd Higher Committee for Conferences meets Kerry concludes oman visit Read More ...
