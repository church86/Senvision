Officers of the Johnson City Police Department — along with members of the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Elizabethton Police Department, Nuclear Fuel Services/Murray Guard Inc., and East Tennessee State University Public Safety — took 51 deserving children from the Johnson City school system on a shopping spree for Christmas. The children were paired with an officer, and the two discussed their Christmas list during a pizza party. The children were then loaded into party buses and limousines and the entourage was escorted by officers to Walmart on Browns Mill Road. After the shopping spree, participants’ families were provided with a Christmas food box and ham as well as additional gifts for Christmas morning. “Spending time with these kids and being a small part of helping them to enjoy Christmas is the best feeling in the world,” Johnson City Police Officer Brittney Eberhardt said. “We are just so grateful to all of our community partners who made it possible.” Johnson City’s Shop With a Cop has nearly doubled in just one year thanks to a $7,500 donation from Graphic Disorder; fundraising efforts by Smith Brothers Harley-Davidson; toys donated from Toys R Us; sponsorship of approximately 25 children by Keller Williams Realty and Classic Title; monetary donations from citizens; Johnson City Parks and Recreation; Marco’s Pizza, Domino’s Pizza and Papa John’s Pizza; Chick-Fil-A, West Market Street; and Walmart. “We would love to see the event continue growing at this rate so that we can reach even more children,” Eberhardt said. “I feel like our officers get more out of this event than the children do. It’s amazing to see how many of them are so selfless and want to spend their money buying for others. They embody the spirit of Christmas, and we are privileged to be able to be part of it.” Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Debra Clayton, with the Orlando Police Department, was killed in the line of duty on Jan. 9, 2017. (Orlando Police Department/Twitter) On the day she was laid to rest, Orlando police officer Debra Clayton received one final honor from her department. She was promoted to lieutenant. Clayton, 42, was killed Monday as she tried to confront a murder suspect at a Walmart. The suspect is still at large. Her chief, John Mina, told thousands of people gathered Saturday for a memorial service that Clayton did not die alone. “She was surrounded by blue,” he said. With fellow officers, family and friends in attendance, she was remembered at a touching ceremony at First Baptist Church of Orlando. Clayton was well-liked by her coworkers. “She’s going to be missed but never forgotten,” an Orlando officer told CNN affiliate WKMG. “She loved helping people. … We know she made a difference, and the rest of us will continue to try to live in her legacy.” Clayton’s flag-draped casket was brought into the church and a long line of people, many of them crying, came by to pay respects before the service. As it was carried from the hearse one boy saluted the fallen officer. Dozens of family members came for the service. Her brother, Rudy Thomas (not pictured), told the audience she loved deeply and wouldn’t sugarcoat her advice. “There wasn’t no fake-fake about it,” he said. “If she had anything to say that was on her mind, she would tell you and let you know.” Clayton’s body was taken to Woodlawn Memorial Park & Funeral Home. On the route, police officers from around the country lined the road. Many will attend another funeral Sunday for an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy, Norman Lewis, who was killed in a traffic accident while searching for Clayton’s killer. Debra Clayton was recently married and was a member of the Orlando Police Department for 17 years. Clayton devoted herself to helping young members of the community, Mina said earlier this week.

By Steve Almasy CNN (CNN) -- On the day she was laid to rest, Orlando police officer Debra Clayton received one final honor from her department. She was promoted to lieutenant. Clayton, 42, was killed Monday as she tried to confront a murder suspect at a Walmart. The suspect is still at large. Her chief, John Mina, told thousands of people gathered Saturday for a memorial service that Clayton did not die alone. "She was surrounded by blue," he said. With fellow officers, family and friends in attendance, she was remembered at a touching ceremony at First Baptist Church of Orlando. Clayton was well-liked by her coworkers. "She's going to be missed but never forgotten," an Orlando officer told CNN affiliate WKMG. "She loved helping people. ... We know she made a difference, and the rest of us will continue to try to live in her legacy." Clayton's flag-draped casket was brought into the church and a long line of people, many of them crying, came by to pay respects before the service. As it was carried from the hearse one boy saluted the fallen officer. Dozens of family members came for the service. Her brother, Rudy Thomas (not pictured), told the audience she loved deeply and wouldn't sugarcoat her advice. "There wasn't no fake-fake about it," he said. "If she had anything to say that was on her mind, she would tell you and let you know." Clayton's body was taken to Woodlawn Memorial Park & Funeral Home. On the route, police officers from around the country lined the road. Many will attend another funeral Sunday for an Orange County Sheriff's deputy, Norman Lewis, who was killed in a traffic accident while searching for Clayton's killer. Debra Clayton was recently married and was a member of the Orlando Police Department for 17 years. Clayton devoted herself to helping young members of the community, Mina said earlier this week.

See Offers Business Posted January 14 Updated January 14 increase font size Retail ‘skill gap’ spurs entry-level training program As more people shop online, stores say they need workers who come in with more knowledge and can offer better service. By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO Associated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Trying to stem high turnover in store jobs, nonprofit groups and chains such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot and the Home Shopping Network are launching a program to help people develop the skills to land entry-level jobs and advance in a retail career. As more people shop online, stores say they need workers who come in with more knowledge and can offer better service. The training and credential program, led by the nonprofit arm of the National Retail Federation trade group, includes sales and inventory basics, dealing with customers, how to use technology like kiosks and more. “The skill gap is a huge challenge in America broadly,” said Ellen Davis, a senior vice president at the trade group and executive director of the NRF Foundation. “Talent is a significant challenge in retail at all levels.” More than 20 major retailers including Neiman Marcus and Ashley Stewart have pledged general support for the Rise Up program being launched Sunday. It’s part of a broader credential plan that would help workers move up that may include training for store supervisors and in specific areas like retail analytics. Thirty-two percent of all first jobs in the U.S. are in retail, the trade group says, and stores overall have more job openings now than they did a few years ago. Rising wages have increased competition for workers as people take better-paying jobs. The average hourly pay for cashiers and low-level retail sales staff is $9.26, according to a recent Hay Group study — a level labor groups say still isn’t enough to live on. The retail industry says store jobs can be a starting point toward bigger things. In stores, entry-level work isn’t just about folding clothes and ringing up sales. Beyond making change, the Rise Up program includes how to balance a cash drawer and checking for counterfeit currency. Employees also need to understand how stores and online sites work together, use up-to-date handhelds to check inventory, and solve customer-service issues. “It’s crisp, clear lessons,” said James Rhee, CEO of clothing chain Ashley Stewart, which is among the retailers including HSN Inc. that will give the credential weight in their hiring. “It’s not just about buying and selling. It’s extremely service-oriented, but it’s extremely more quantitative and it’s all about the innovation of technology.” The program offers 30 to 40 hours of classroom training or 15 hours of online training, and will be administered through nonprofit groups and public education partners. The overall cost is $50, but many students will be able to get subsidies. The retailers involved are encouraging local nonprofits or high schools to start using it. Some might fund groups in areas where they’re having a hard time hiring skilled workers. Some may use it to replace or supplement their own training. How much of an impact this first industry credential could have remains to be seen. It follows a hodgepodge of certificates backed by government or foundation grants that didn’t hold much sway. The NRF Foundation will evaluate the program at six to ten companies later this year to see if participants get jobs faster, stay longer and get raises faster. It’ll make changes if necessary after that. Wal-Mart, which has training academies for its own workers, said it won’t decide about using the credential in the hiring process until after the study. Dress for Success, which worked with the NRF Foundation on a pilot program in New York with nine women, has seen most of them find work — including at an online merchant, a discounter and a clothing retailer. “Our goal is to not just get them a job,” said Amy Tashjian, senior director of worldwide programs for Dress for Success, “but to continue to build their confidence and to help them not just get a job but a career.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

AP Photo/Evan Vucci By Ira Stoll Special to the Review-Journal Somehow, the left in 2017 has become a place where doing business with Cuba and Iran is fine, but doing business with L.L. Bean or Simon &Schuster is morally questionable. In case you missed the memo, let me explain. The website grabyourwallet.org maintains a long list of “retailers to boycott” and “additional entities to consider boycotting” based on tenuous ties to Donald Trump. L.L. Bean, the Maine-based outdoor goods and clothing manufacturer, turned up on the “consider” list on the basis of one Bean family member’s support for Trump. In a Facebook post, the company responded, “Like most large families, the more than 50 family member-owners of the business hold views and embrace causes across the political spectrum.” It added, “L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. ... To be included in this boycott campaign is simply misguided.” Simon &Schuster, for its part, has come under fire for having a deal to publish a book by Milo Yiannopoulos, described last year by The New York Times magazine as “one of the loudest, most provocative voices at Breitbart News.” A bookstore in Ireland, Raven Books, announced that it would cease stocking all Simon &Schuster books in retaliation. The Chicago Review of Books announced it would punish the publisher by refusing to review any of its books for a year. (An imprint of Simon &Schuster published my biography of Samuel Adams.) Never mind that Simon &Schuster also publishes books by Hillary Clinton, or that the Grab Your Wallet boycott or “consider” boycotting list includes not only L.L. Bean but also Amazon, Macy’s, Walmart, Nordstrom and even People magazine, which it faults as a “media outlet that normalized Trump as a pivotal moment.” Remember, among their objections to Trump is his supposed intolerance. Lest one dismiss this as a fringe phenomenon, consider that President-elect Trump himself addressed it by tweeting his support for L.L. Bean, and that The New York Times business section devoted half of its front page to the Simon &Schuster story. As for Iran and Cuba, President Obama’s farewell address touted as great accomplishments of his administration the ending of strict American trade sanctions on both countries. Yet both Iran and Cuba jail political prisoners under cruel conditions. They restrict freedom of the press and assembly. Iran funds deadly terrorist organizations and attacks and executes gay people. Even the Obama-Kerry State Department reports these facts. The New York Times nonetheless is offering, for 2017, 10 different “Times Journeys” trips, some of them guided by its journalists, to Iran. Prices start at $7,395 and escalate to $135,000 for an around-the-world tour in a customized Boeing 757 with a stop in Iran. When people are OK with spending money that goes to Iran or Cuba but not with spending money on companies such as L.L. Bean or Simon &Schuster that have some highly attenuated connection to someone who might have done something to help the president-elect of the United States, it’s an indication that their actions aren’t based on a single rational standard. No, this is about something else. Maybe it is the herd mentality. Maybe it is public virtue signaling, a kind of showing off. Maybe it’s a way to express anxiety or frustration. It’s easier to stop shopping at L.L. Bean than to persuade a Trump voter to choose the Democrat the next time. It’s possible to detect an element of humor in the whole situation, but be careful. Give liberal friends an L.L. Bean gift card or Simon &Schuster book and they just might take it as a microaggression.

The AAA’s auto service center is nearly complete on Central Avenue in front of the Meijer store. The retail industry is refocusing on services, such as auto repair, rather than retail. THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Buy This Image Phase two of the Westgate Village Shopping Center, on Central Avenue across the street from Costco, will have two restaurants and one service provider. THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Buy This Image THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Retailing in the Toledo area improved last year, resulting in fewer vacancies and higher lease rates for owners of retail space. Vacancies are now at their lowest level — 10.8 percent — since before the commercial real estate market crashed in 2009, according to a 2016 year-end report by the commercial real estate firm Reichle Klein Group of Toledo. A year earlier the rate was 12 percent. Lease rates a year ago averaged $7.44 a square foot per year in the Toledo market but now are at $7.90 a square foot.  And some newer niche properties are at $35 a square foot. “It’s exciting. There’s a lot of positive news,” said Duke Wheeler, a retail specialist with Reichle Klein. Phase two of the Westgate Village Shopping Center, on Central Avenue across the street from Costco, will have two restaurants and one service provider. THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Enlarge | Buy This Image But while retail space in town is filling up, it also is going through an evolution, said Sam Zyndorf, senior vice president and principal at the Toledo office of commercial real estate firm Signature Associates. “It’s either food or service. Nobody’s opening up dress shops anymore.” Mr. Zyndorf said. “Food, service, cell-phone places, that’s what they are putting in strip centers. ... Ma-and-pa stores are dying a slow death.” Vacancy rates fell and lease rates rose in several Toledo-area submarkets — central city, East Toledo/​Oregon/​Northwood, North Toledo, South/​Southwest, and West Toledo/​Sylvania.  Vacancies also rose and lease rates fell in Lambertville/​Temperance and Perrysburg/​Rossford. Reichle Klein said falling vacancies and rising lease rates in some of submarkets stems partly from development of retail-strip centers that have become hotly sought-after sites.  Such sites include the Secor Village retail center on Secor Road, where a 365 by Whole Foods store will soon open, and strip centers on Airport Highway at McCord Road in Springfield Township and on State Rt. 25 at Eckel Junction Road in Perrysburg. “Leases are being signed in these apex-market niches in the range of $35 per square foot. To put this trend in perspective, historically, we would only have seen rents in the mid-$30s in the Toledo area in the premier enclosed mall, Franklin Park,” the report said. New construction of retail space last year totaled 103,708 square feet, which was less than 1 percent of the 21.8 million square feet of retail space in metro Toledo. The report makes it clear that, while new retailers are entering the Toledo market, there is growing demand for retail space from nontraditional users, especially firms providing personal services such as fitness centers and medical services.  Aspire Fitness, for example, had the largest transaction in the metro area last year when it took 36,000 square feet of space at the Miracle Mile Shopping Center at 4925 Jackman Rd. in West Toledo. The AAA’s auto service center is nearly complete on Central Avenue in front of the Meijer store. The retail industry is refocusing on services, such as auto repair, rather than retail. THE BLADE/ANDY MORRISON Enlarge | Buy This Image Demand is small for “big-box” spaces by traditional retailers, such as discount stores or supermarkets, Reichle Klein said.  In response, big-box spaces are being reconfigured into several smaller spaces. For example, the vacant 48,000-square-foot Kroger store in the Spring Meadows Shopping Center in Springfield Township was subdivided last year to accommodate a 23,000-square foot Michael’s Arts & Craft store and a as-yet unnamed retailer occupying the remaining 25,000 square feet.  A 24,000-square-foot former Sears Hardware store at the Alexis Park Shopping Center on Alexis Road at Lewis Avenue is being divided in two 12,000-square foot spaces for a blood-donation clinic and a store that sells fasteners and other industrial products. An old Kroger on State Rt. 20 in Perrysburg is under consideration for subdivision as well. Another trend, according to Reichle Klein, is the re-emergence of retail properties as a desirable investment. Operating income from properties is growing, new construction is limited, and interest rates are low. The report said these factors have created “an excellent window for sellers,” making retail real estate a hot market investment. THE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image Harlan Reichle, managing partner of Reichle Klein Group, said the growing demand for retail space by nontraditional users is key. “What we’re seeing now is traditional retail space being filled but it’s not necessarily being filled by what we think of as retailers,” he said. And of the traditional retailers that are filling space, it’s heavily towards food and services, Mr. Zyndorf said. For example, at Secor Village on Secor Road, anchored by a soon-to-be-ready 365 by Whole Foods market, spaces will be occupied by eateries Fusian, PizzaFire, and First Watch, and service providers OrangeTheory, Citizens Bank, Great Clips, and the Joint Chiropractic clinic. Only PetPeople, a pet supplies store, is a traditional merchandise-based retailer. At the 7,500-square-foot second phase of Westgate Village Shopping Center, which is nearly completed, the tenants will be two eateries, Blaze Pizza and Fuzzy’s Taco Shop, and one service provider, a hair salon called Sports Clips. At 3200 Meijer Dr., off Central Avenue in Sylvania Township, the Automobile Association of America is building an AAA Service Center. The 9,150-square-foot center, which is nearly ready, not only will provide car maintenance and diagnostic and repair service, it has a special charging station for electric vehicles. While service retailers are growing, Mr. Wheeler said most new retail activity in the Toledo area is by eating establishments. Moe’s Southwest Grill, a fast-casual Mexican food restaurant plans to open its first Ohio restaurant at 5299 Monroe St. at Flanders Road near the Shops at Franklin Place. Moe’s is looking for a second site, while Chick-Fil-A is looking at adding two Toledo area stores, Mr. Wheeler said. “On a broader scale, there has been a lot of big boxes [leasing] in Lima and Findlay. A former Walmart in Lima and a former Sears in Findlay will become Big R stores, which is a general merchandiser for farm and ranch clothing and merchandise. “It was busy in ’16 and ’17 will be busier,” Mr. Wheeler said. “I think we’ll see a lot of activity that started in ’16 come to fruition in ’17.” Mr. Zyndorf said he thinks the proliferation of eateries and service providers is because of the growth of online shopping. “My daughter’s generation, they do everything online. They buy shoes and games online, they buy everything online,” Mr. Zyndorf said. “The retail-strip center is no longer ‘retail’ strip center. It’s a service center.” Merchandisers dominate in larger cities, Mr. Zyndorf said. “If you go to Chicago or New York, where you have millions of people walking by, you’ll still have true retail. But here, it’s evolving.” Not long ago, he said, he arranged a leasing deal on Monroe Street for a franchisee opening a business called Three Dog Bakery. “I said, ‘Well, what’s this about? Do you have an affinity for the ’70s and the rock group Three Dog Night? And he said, No, it’s a bakery for dogs,’ ” Mr. Zyndorf said. “I thought, ‘A bakery for dogs. Who’s going to go there? But now I’m working on a second store for them, and there’s 40 of them in the chain,” Mr. Zyndorf said. Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

Debra Clayton was gunned down outside a Wal-Mart store in Orlando last Monday after she approached 41-year-old Markeith Loyd. A young boy salutes as the flag-draped casket is carried during funeral services for Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton at the First Baptist Church in Orlando, Fla.  (Stephen M. Dowell / AP)   By Mike SchneiderThe Associated Press Sat., Jan. 14, 2017 ORLANDO, FLA.—An Orlando police sergeant who was gunned down was remembered Saturday at her funeral service as someone who put everyone at ease with her infectious smile and made every effort to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the community it served. Sgt. Debra Clayton read books to children at elementary schools, would clean the homes of elderly residents and was a motherly figure to young people lacking parental guidance, said Orlando Police Chief John Mina and U.S. Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief. “She was forever using her resources and others’ too, anyone else she could bring along, to help somebody else,” said Demings, who promoted Clayton to the rank of sergeant in 2007. “Buying washing machines, food, clothing, looking for housing for people who didn’t have it ...Debra Clayton was willing to do more than she was paid to do.” Mina said at the service that he was posthumously promoting the 42-year-old Clayton to the rank of lieutenant. Clayton loved programs that involved working with young children or helping people because “it helped humanize police officers,” Mina said. Article Continued Below The flag-draped casket is carried to the hearse during funeral services for Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton at the First Baptist Church in Orlando, Fla.  (Stephen M. Dowell)   The service was attended by Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and hundreds of officers and deputies from all over Florida and beyond. Before the service, friends and family members wept openly as they walked by the American-flag-draped open casket. Outside, four helicopters flew overhead outside and then one peeled away in what is known as a “missing man” formation. Orlando Police Department Chaplain Andrew Wade urged the law enforcement officers not to be consumed by their anger over how Clayton died. Authorities say Clayton was gunned down outside a Wal-Mart store in Orlando last Monday after she approached 41-year-old Markeith Loyd, who was wanted for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend at the time. Hundreds of officers and deputies have been searching for him since Monday, and a $100,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to his arrest. A detective's badge is covered with a black stripe during funeral services for Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton at the First Baptist Church in Orlando.  (Stephen M. Dowell)   Clayton had worked for the Orlando Police Department for 17 years, most recently as a supervisor for a patrol division in the neighbourhood where she was shot. She previously had worked in investigations and as a school resource officer. The master sergeant was one of the officers who responded to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed. Last June’s massacre in Orlando was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Clayton, who is survived by her husband and adult son, had recently authored a book on the topic of law enforcement bridging the gap with the community they served, and written it from a black officer’s perspective, said Sharon Edgecombe, her former co-worker. As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, Clayton wouldn’t accept excuses from people who committed crimes, Edgecombe said. “You could bet they got a stern lecture on their way to jail,” she said.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Letters to the editor: 11/14/16 Saturday Jan 14, 2017 at 7:36 PM Jan 14, 2017 at 7:36 PM My tenure as chairman For the past two years, I have had the honor of serving as the chairman for the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors. Through the collaboration and support of many departments, outside agencies, and elected officials, we have ensured that the county continues to thrive towards a prosperous future for all of its residents. The county is in a better position than it has been in the past. As chairman, I prioritized homelessness as a critical focus area for the board. We executed strategies to end veteran homelessness. After successfully housing more than 500 homeless veterans, we expanded our focus to target the chronically homeless including youth and families. I remain confident that we can dramatically reduce the rate of those affected by this epidemic by continuing to work together. I have been a strong advocate for our employees and I will continue to be one in the future. It is with great pride that my last act as chairman, the board and the county CEO formed a Worker’s Compensation Task Force made up of representatives from our largest employee unions; Sheriff’s Employees’ Benefit Association, Teamsters, and Service Employees International Union as well as representatives from the County Administrative Office, Human Resources and Risk Management. This task force will provide a forum for open dialogue and assist us in understanding and addressing issues that affect employee access to benefits. As a lifelong resident of this county whose ancestors were the first people to call San Bernardino County “home,” serving as board chairman has been a great source of pride for me and my family. I would like to thank my colleagues, our county employees, and the residents of this great county for the support over these past two years. I look forward to continuing to work for the residents of the Third District. James Ramos Third District Supervisor County of San Bernardino Liberty never sleeps Last month the D.C. Court of Appeals issued a decision in Dr. Michael Mann’s defamation case against National Review Magazine and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The court decided en banc to dismiss Dr. Mann’s claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, but upheld the case for defamation to go to trial, which criticized Dr. Mann’s infamous “hockey-stick” graph, as having scientific proof of man-made global warming. NRO and CEI associates Marc Steyn and Rand Simberg suggested that Dr. Mann’s data had been “molested.” Even the Obama Administration’s own Department of Justice looked into the unheard of and dangerous proposition to federally prosecute climate-change deniers for their opposition under a Rico Act stipulation, but finally washed their hands of it realizing such a government venture was a foolish endeavor. So what in tarnation is going on here? For the first time in history, Americans have the ability to get their information unfiltered from the lens of government or from the biases of editorial judgment and national news organizations. Essentially, major media has lost control of their message. Barack Obama was the first president who recognized the power of social media and its ability to connect with far more voters on the Internet. Later he suggested that the “wild West” media atmosphere, which broadcasts “all kinds of crazy, toxic stuff,” needs a filter. Some kind of “curating function,” whereby news would be filtered for “truthiness.” Clearly the First Amendment forbids government from regulating speech in such a way so I assume he was suggesting providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, filter information before letting it reach the masses. Even so there is a problem with these organizations as they have already exhibited bias. Not dissimilar to major broadcast media, and by a margin of three to one, these biases have purged the scientific opposition of climate change and the conservative pop-rhetoric of rabble-rousers such as Milo Yiannopoulos, James O'Keefe and libertarian law professor Glenn Reynolds, respectively. Arbitration and the free flow of information, whether it be by government or an appointed entity, is still considered an affront to speech. We can guard against discrimination by ensuring that technological processes preserve the right to speak, offend, ridicule, hate, or even lie without sanction. The lesson to learn here is that our defense of liberty must never sleep… Bryan A. Cook Phelan Yet more violations Your recent article (“Court: Apple Valley Town Council violated Brown Act in 2013 with Walmart MOU”) is just another example of the double standards of a Town Council that shows no regard for the law. Although the Town attacked the recent citizen initiative (Measure V), in part because Liberty Utilities provided $200,000 to $300,000 in its support, the Town had no objection to Walmart, from 2011 through 2013, putting up in excess of $1.6 million to support the initiative and its ballot measure committee (Apple Valley Consumers for Choice), this according to Walmart Major Donor disclosures on the state website. I have to wonder what the Town paid in legal fees to pursue another losing legal battle in the courts.  Is anyone keeping a tally on the cost of their losses with only a $45,000 budget contingency for litigation? Many were surprised this was still a legal case pursued by the Town, especially with it going through the Superior Court, and then the appeals court, and not appearing on the Council closed session agendas.  More Brown Act violations? Leane Lee Apple Valley Kudos to Liberty A lot of companies and many individuals celebrate the holiday season by donating their time and treasury to those in need. Your article about the charitable giving by Liberty Utilities and their employees made me appreciate them and their efforts for others. Meals for 120 families fed hundreds of our neighbors "displaced by natural disasters and loss of income" who would otherwise have been hungry on Christmas day. One hundred pairs of socks and shoes for needy schoolchildren enabled them to come back to school this week with warm and dry feet and a better outlook on life. Gift cards and thousands of dollars in donations from the employees of the utility showed that their hearts are in the right place. The Liberty employees even donated and delivered toys to children from Apple Valley to Barstow. You know, giving to others truly embraces the reason for the sanson. It gave me great joy to read about it in the Daily Press.

Share Wal-Mart overhaul to escalate growing e-commerce war with kingpins Amazon Independent.ie Wal-Mart is overhauling its e-commerce team and elevating executives from its recently acquired Jet.com business, aiming to better challenge Amazon with more selection and lower prices. http://www.independent.ie/business/world/walmart-overhaul-to-escalate-growing-ecommerce-war-with-kingpins-amazon-35367417.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35368402.ece/6ba2c/AUTOCROP/h342/Wal%20Mart.jpg Email Go To Comments The changes are meant to make Wal-Mart more "customer-centric", Jet founder Marc Lore, who is now ceo of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation, said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg. Wal-Mart bought online retailer Jet in September for about $3.3bn, turning to the startup to bolster its online operation. "Our strategy is about offering more choice, competitive prices - particularly on food and consumables," Lore said. The company is streamlining its web team so that it can serve customers whether they shop online, via smartphones or in stores, according to the memo. Wal-Mart is under pressure as Amazon pushes deeper into the grocery business. Large retailers have traditionally used food to draw shoppers into stores, with hopes that they buy other goods with higher-profit margins. But now Amazon may pick off more of those customers. It is even targeting US food-stamp recipients.
