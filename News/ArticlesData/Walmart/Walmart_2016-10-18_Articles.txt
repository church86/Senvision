But that disappointment has not prevented the mission-oriented business from growing retail distribution to Kroger, Harps, Food Lion and other regional grocers around the country over the past five years. With that retail experience behind it, Westrock is again setting its sights on Walmart and hoping for a second chance. Elizabeth McLaughlin, Westrock’s executive vice president of marketing, told Talk Business & Politics the company is working with an advisor and plans to meet with Walmart’s coffee buyer to get Westrock branded coffee back on the shelf. It recently got the product on Walmart.com, but has yet to secure shelf space in stores. “It’s a very crowded category and our biggest challenge is brand awareness. We don’t have a coffee shop (ready-made audience) but we have thought about it,” McLaughlin noted. “It’s just that the capital spent to get that up and running would be money that couldn’t go to growing our farmer base, which is core to the company’s mission.” Westrock Coffee Company is not just about generating sales revenue. Founders and owners – and father and son team – Joe and Scott Ford wanted to be involved in a company with socio-economic benefits to communities in Africa. The former Alltel execs and shareholders had time on their hands when Alltel sold to Verizon in 2008. Their focus with Westrock was that giving back and supporting communities was essential. WESTROCK ORIGINS A happenstance meeting between Scott Ford and the president of Rwanda occurred during a family trip to Africa in early 2009 in which Ford was looking for his next business opportunity. When he heard the president of Rwanda wanted to meet, he feared the conversation would be about cell phone towers and so he tried to dodge the meeting. But after the president called his hotel room and personally asked the family to dinner at his home Ford ultimately agreed. The two discussed what it might take to help improve the lives of people of Rwanda to rebuild from war and genocide in that country. Four hours later Ford accepted a challenge from the Rwandan President to try and help the people of Rwanda taste the benefits of the free-market system. During the trip Ford saw an opportunity at a washing station used by local coffee bean growers selling fresh beans for 40 cents per handful. As a former commodity trader at Stephens Inc., Ford saw an opportunity to create a crop-to-cup business model that would provide stable earnings for farmers in Rwanda. Later that year Ford purchased the Rwanda Trading Company and got into a vertically integrated coffee business on a global basis. Westrock contracts with 80,000 growers in Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia in Africa and has expanded bean sourcing to Nicaragua, Peru and Brazil in Latin America. In 2012 Westrock purchased the Tembo Trading Company in Tanzania to raise production levels. Having a transparent and ethically sourced supply chain is key to Westrock’s mission as well, which is why the company purchased Falcon Coffees Limited in the United Kingdom two years ago as way to connect roasters and farmers around the world working with partners in Africa, Asia and across Latin America. Beans grown in Africa are shipped to Little Rock and distributed from there. GROWING WITHOUT WALMART On a whim Ford was able to get an early coffee brand version called TradeWinds into Walmart U.S. stores and Sam’s Clubs in 2010 but sales faltered and the TradeWinds brand was pulled from the shelves. Walmart U.S. has since added national brands like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks to their shelves – brands with large followings. McLaughlin said it was fairly easy to get into 800 Walmart stores in 2010, but the young company wasn’t ready to handle it. She said the store locations were outside of Arkansas and the company had no branding equity. Rather than roll up the dream, McLaughlin said the company continued to expand its distribution in retail as a bean wholesaler with clients such as national chains like Starbucks and local coffee houses like Onyx in Northwest Arkansas. Today 85% of the more than 10 million pounds of beans exported from Westrock’s international mills are sold into wholesale market to roasters like Starbucks. The remaining 15% of its production is roasted at the company’s North Little Rock plant, which has a capacity of 33 million pounds per year. The Westrock branded coffee is bagged and sold at retail in national distribution for Kroger and Food Lion, and regional grocers such as Harp’s, Hanford, Winn Dixie and Bi-Lo. Westrock also has a branded product at Amazon.com and Costco.com and more recently Walmart.com. Westrock Coffee Company’s Little Rock roasting facility has a 33 million pound annual capacity and employs 50. Westrock employs about 50 in the Little Rock area who manage the bean roasting and distribution business. While product is sourced largely from Africa, McLaughlin said the roasting is done in Little Rock and that includes a private label business for Sam’s Club. McLaughlin said Westrock is hoping for shelf space in Walmart’s grocery aisle and now the company is better equipped to market the branded product. Westrock is the official coffee of the Denver Broncos as well as the Arkansas Razorbacks, and the company continues to expand its brand into the hospitality sector. She said this past year the company was able to double its growth rate by expanding into foodservice with a few local hospitals, while also garnering a contact with Omni and MGM Hotels and resorts around the world. GOOD FIT Westrock could be a good fit as a Walmart supplier when it comes to sustainability. Westrock boasts of its transparent supply chain for coffee that also benefits some of the poorest countries in the world. In Rwanda, Westrock’s business model has put more than $100 million into the pockets of small coffee farmers over the past six years, according to Westrock’s 2016 Sustainability Report. Through Westrock’s Rwanda Trading Company, nearly 9,000 farmers have taken part in training programs in agribusiness to help increase plant yields while also caring for the land. The training provided by Westrock has helped the average family household coffee yields increase 155% over the past six years, pushing household income up 61%, according to the company. The Tembo Coffee Company in Tanzania has followed a similar model since 2012. Westrock has been able to train more than 5,000 coffee farmers in similar agribusiness programs creating 150% growth in export volume since 2013. Westrock says 53% of the farmers in Tanzania are women. Westrock sources 40 million pounds of coffee beans annually from its contract farmers in Africa. Westrock also has made more than $16 million in pre-harvest loans to small family farmers so the women could afford to send their children to school. Tuition is due before the harvest and families typically don’t have the money to cover school costs until after they are paid for the harvest. Ford saw an opportunity to bridge that gap and routinely makes loans to families which are paid back when the harvest comes in. All of this “do-good” focus by Westrock gives the company a compelling story and it lines up with Wal-Mart’s broad corporate platforms on sustainability, women’s empowerment and ethical sourcing. But McLaughlin said the coffee quality will have to speak for itself. Brad Feagins, company advisor to Walmart agreed, saying one thing he’s learned in three decades of retail is that items matter, not categories when it comes to merchandising. McLaughlin said the owners are mission oriented when it comes to Westrock, but that doesn’t mean it’s a non-profit venture. Coffee is big business, and just last year Westrock spent $60 million sourcing coffee sustainably from around the world and hopes to buy more by growing its distribution further in 2017. Walmart could be key to making that happen, but if not, the company will continue to seek shelf space elsewhere. “We make money and the more we make by expanding our distribution, the more we can give back farmers,” McLaughlin said.

Each bag contains precut and measured vegetables and other ingredients. "Chef Robert Irvine exclusively approached Walmart with his Sidekicks line because of our strong distribution and trusted name that could deliver these fresh side dishes to our stores across the U.S. We have a commitment to quality, healthier products at an affordable price, as well as helping families save time, so we thought this was a great partnership," Walmart spokesperson Marilee McInnis told SN. The line also appealed to Walmart since a portion of the proceeds go to the Robert Irvine Foundation which supports members of the military and their families. “I am excited to announce that my Signature Sidekicks are rolling out to Walmart stores nationwide right now!” said chef Robert Irvine in a Facebook post, Monday. “My personal recipes, fresh ingredients, 3 easy steps, and less than 10 minutes to prepare. A portion of the proceeds goes to my foundation to support our military and their families.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your Supermarket News ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles Clinton lauds Walmart in document released by WikiLeaks 9   Walmart impressed by fresh results   EXCLUSIVE COSMETICS LINE TO DEBUT AT WAL-MART   Hy-Vee Discusses Origin of Exclusive Beer   Aldi Introduces Exclusive Premium Brand   Latest News Stater Bros.'

Quisha Hill said that she shops at a particular Walmart location in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, and early Wednesday morning was no different. At about 7:23 a.m., she was getting to pay for her groceries when the bizarre incident occurred. “I come in to grab couple items, and as I while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby, and he’s like, ‘I’m taking the baby, I’m stealing her. I’m taking her. Call 911. Call 911.'” The man then started choking the baby. Other shoppers heard Quisha’s screams and tackled the man, then held him to the floor until police arrived. In the scuffle, Quisha was able to get her baby back. “That’s when tons of Walmart workers come over to help me get her out. She is still restrained. As soon as they come over to get him, they body slam him down to the ground. He punches one of the security officers. And then that’s when we have the baby back.” Hill says that man at one point tried to put the baby’s car seat on his head and wear it like a hat, according to Fox 6. She also said the man appeared to be intoxicated, and that he spoke a foreign language that she didn’t understand. RT 41ActionNews “Police: Man arrested for choking 4-month-old infant at Walmart in Overland Park – … pic.twitter.com/R2oI9YGgFH” — The Now KC (@TheNowKC) October 19, 2016 Overland Park police have arrested a suspect, but as of this writing, have not released his name or his mugshot. Neither have they confirmed whether or not he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. Fortunately, the baby is going to be OK. Quisha said she turned red for a few seconds but was back to normal pretty quickly, and is no worse for wear. She is expected to make a full recovery. In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson promised to cooperate fully with the police. “Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store, and we’re working with police to make sure they have all the information they need.” In the overwhelming majority of child abuse cases, the perpetrator is close to the victim: a parent or relative, a caregiver, a teacher, or a member of the clergy. Incidents of strangers randomly attacking children and babies are exceptionally rare, but not unheard of. One of the most tragic cases ever of an infant being assaulted by a stranger came out of Georgia in 2013. As CNN reported at the time, Sherry West was pushing her 13-month-old baby in a stroller when two youths approached her and demanded money. “A boy approached me and told me he wanted my money, and I told him I didn’t have any money. And he said, ‘Give me your money or I’m going to kill you and I’m going to shoot your baby and kill your baby,’ and I said, ‘I don’t have any money,’ and ‘Don’t kill my baby.'” West struggled with the youths over her purse, and eventually one of them fired his weapon. One shot grazed the woman’s head, another shot was fired at her leg, and a third shot was fired at the baby’s face, striking and killing him.

That's where they found the 24-year-old bleeding from the chest. Walmart shopper Irma Garcia and others were trying to help him stay alive. "I witnessed two gentlemen, they were standing over here by the tables," said Garcia, who just happen to park nearby. "Both gentlemen walked towards the PT Cruiser (parked on the side.) The gentleman in the gray shirt was arguing with the employee of Walmart. They pushed each other, all of the sudden. The guy in the gray shirt stabbed the employee." The man in the gray shirt quickly ran off. Meanwhile, Garcia jumped into action. "We grabbed some rags to stop the bleeding, that's when these guys showed up and the ambulance took him," she said. Investigators determined the fight was over the affections of a young woman who worked at the McDonald's inside the Walmart. Sheriff K9 units were dispatched, and within a few hours, the suspect was captured by a deputy and his K9. "It's scary when it hits close to home," says Rebecca Slovacek, who runs a neighborhood watch program in the area. "Because we're such a small close knit area, everyone knows everybody. That's the scary part about it, when something like this happens in broad daylight." Crosby Independent School District lifted a lock-in of their campuses after the suspect was captured. Investigators say the worker will survive. In addition, the suspect had to be treated for injuries after he was bitten by a K9.

Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained popularity worldwide due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. Chinese food safety practices have raised concern about contamination in China and in countries where Chinese food products are imported, and the new project aims to trace the movement of meat, vegetables and other products. China's government has identified food authentication and supply chain tracking as a critical step to quickly find and eliminate sources of contamination. With blockchain, the movement of food products can be digitally tracked from suppliers including farms to the store shelves and ultimately to consumers. IBM said this could be done on the blockchain, which provides a permanent record of transactions that cannot be altered. This would serve as a viable alternative to traditional paper tracking and manual inspection systems, IBM added. "Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains," said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president, industry platforms, at IBM in New York. When applied to the food supply chain, product information such as farm origin details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, storage temperatures and shipping details are digitally connected to food items, and the information is entered on the blockchain at every step of the process, IBM said. The information in each transaction is agreed upon by all members of the business network. Once a consensus is reached, it becomes a permanent record that cannot be changed, IBM said. The record created by the blockchain can also help retailers like Walmart better manage the shelf-life of products in individual stores, further strengthening safeguards related to food authenticity. The world's largest retailer also announced the opening of the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing in response to China's initiatives on food safety, and said blockchain technology would be a major part of the program. Walmart said it will be using IBM Blockchain based on the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project, which is an open source software project that builds blockchain tools. Tsinghua University, located in Beijing, will serve as an academic partner and advisor on the blockchain project.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Over the past few years, I have had a brisk, if intermittent, correspondence with a professor of my acquaintance. Our subject: Wal-Mart. Specifically, wages at Wal-Mart, and whether (and then why) they could go up. One of those conversations was already turned into a column, and this morning, he e-mailed me to ask what I thought about Neil Irwin’s latest piece in the New York Times on the outcomes of the company’s fairly recent foray into higher average wages. Irwin’s conclusion: Paying higher wages has allowed Wal-Mart to attract better workers, resulting in cleaner, nicer stores. My conclusion: All is proceeding as I have foreseen. That is, I predicted that workers would like making more per hour, rather than less (who wouldn’t?), and that this would allow Wal-Mart to attract a better class of worker, or at least keep the workers it had around longer, reducing turnover costs and allowing the company to deliver a better customer experience. But I was less sure that this would actually deliver increased profits; indeed, Irwin notes that it hasn't. Revenue is up, as are ratings in customer surveys. But so far, that’s not translating into enhanced profitability. “Operating income for Walmart’s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter,” Irwin writes, “reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments.” It would be great news if Wal-Mart could turn into a higher-wage employer, offering a real path to the middle class for people who aren’t interested in picking up and moving to a bigger city. Its stores are ubiquitous in America’s hinterlands, and as a massive national brand, it could offer real opportunity to folks who don’t seem to be getting much of it right now. But I’ve long been skeptical that Wal-Mart could remake itself as a new-model engine of opportunity to replace America’s vanished manufacturing plants. And so far, Wal-Mart’s not giving me much reason to revisit my skepticism. For years before Wal-Mart finally raised its wages, comparisons between Wal-Mart and Costco were a perennial staple of left-wing writers, a genre that I dubbed “Costco shows it’s possible” (to run a big-box store with highly paid staff). Costco paid its workers generously, ran their argument, and was doing very well; ergo, Wal-Mart could do so, too, and it was only refusing out of stupidity or sheer meanness. This argument naturally segued into arguments for raising the minimum wage to $12 or $15 an hour; if companies were too evil or stupid to see where their best interests lay, then public-spirited politicians would have to take matters into their own hands. This never made much sense: The fact that one retailer manages to pay relatively high wages in no way proves that every retailer should therefore follow suit. Costco and Wal-Mart look a lot alike to the sort of people who write articles comparing Costco and Wal-Mart: large spaces filled with stuff, both of which are visited at best infrequently by the writers. In fact, however, they have completely different business models. Costco provides bulk goods to a relatively affluent demographic that does not do the majority of its shopping there; Wal-Mart is a full-service department store where a lower-income demographic expects to buy the bulk of its daily necessities. Because it needs to be everything to its core customers, Wal-Mart’s stores carry about 25 times the number of individual products (different brands, as well as different sizes) than Costco stores do. This makes Wal-Mart's business vastly more labor-intensive, which in turn means that the company needs to worry more than Costco does about controlling hourly wage costs, and it gets less reward out of paying for skill and experience, because ultimately, there’s an upside limit to how much extra productivity you can wring out of clever, hardworking people engaged in the task of putting things on shelves. Meanwhile, since its business is pitched to a customer base that worries about every extra penny it spends, improving customer service won’t necessarily translate into higher sales; Wal-Mart's core consumer is shopping mostly on price. Though they didn’t realize it, the people who were arguing that Wal-Mart should adopt Costco’s labor policy were also arguing that Wal-Mart should adopt Costco’s business model, because the two are inextricably tied together. Unfortunately, Costco was already executing Costco’s business model brilliantly, which limited the upside to Wal-Mart crowding into its market (when it tried, with Sam’s Club, it didn’t do very well). And if you wanted to create Costco II, it wasn’t clear why you’d decide to reconstruct a massive legacy retailer in Costco’s image, rather than starting over with a new group of people who hadn’t spent decades of their lives learning to operate “big stores in small towns.” However, the “big stores in small towns” business model has reached the natural limits of possible growth; overseas expansions have not gone as swimmingly as Wal-Mart’s conquest of America, and if the company wants to grow further, it’s going to need to do something different. For that matter, with Amazon breathing down its neck, it may have to anyway. So when Wal-Mart went ahead and raised wages, I expected that this presaged some shift in its business model, as managers sought to expand the mass retailer into something beyond its core competency. So far, however, it seems, if anything, to be trimming back toward “big stores in small towns,” closing down many of the smaller, more urban locations that didn’t do as well as the company had hoped. It was never clear that it’s actually profitable to run that kind of business model by hiring and retaining better people, as opposed to simply hiring more warm bodies to put things on shelves at the lowest wage you can get away with paying. The most recent results certainly don’t offer huge encouragement to those who hoped it could. If cleaner stores and better-stocked shelves don't eventually translate into better profitability, the company will be under pressure from shareholders to shift its labor-cost model back toward its older, cheaper style. That’s unlikely to mean wage cuts -- cutting wages is nearly impossible, because it enrages workers, who leave, or stay on and carry out their work with surly indifference. Instead, if the pressure is severe enough, I expect that Wal-Mart will have to try to get by with fewer workers. With stores as big as Wal-Mart's, that will be a challenge, because no matter how good that smaller workforce is, it can’t cover all those square feet three times faster than a less clever or less motivated workforce. So far, my verdict on Wal-Mart’s experiment with higher wages is, as I wrote to my professorial pen pal: “Great if it works, but I’m not sure it works.” And as he wrote back: that “would be a great slogan for 90% of public policy.”   Megan McArdle is a Bloomberg View columnist who writes on economics, business and public policy.

Why is Columbia acting like Walmart? File Photo / Kadaja Brown By Bruce Robbins | October 18, 2016, 10:37 PM It’s hard to know how much money Columbia has already paid to the law firm of Proskauer Rose during its years of struggle against the graduate student effort to form a union, and how much it is still paying. Reliable figures are hard to come by on subjects like this one, but popular estimates run from several million to tens of millions of dollars. Every time I think back to the moments when the administration told my department that there are no “new lines” (that is, permission to hire new faculty members) in such-and-such a field, that retiring faculty members may not be replaced, that things are tight, I think of all that money, the hard-earned result of so much fundraising, and all of it going—for what? To stop the young people who do so much of our teaching and research from having any say in their working conditions. But why would we want to spend money on that? Proskauer Rose is widely referred to as a union-busting firm. Such firms seem pretty good at advertising their services while somehow also keeping a low profile. Common sense being what it is, the busting of unions is not something with which you want to be associated. According to Art Levine, who went undercover at a $1,500 per head union-busting seminar in Las Vegas led by Jackson Lewis attorneys, the name Jackson Lewis didn’t even appear on the sign outside the door. The client list of any given union-busting firm is also hard to come by, but the names of the companies that shell out for them do eventually become known. Alongside many university administrations, these names include Cablevision, Pfizer, IBM, Volkswagen (now infamous for its dishonesty), and Walmart. Unfortunately, it seems that the Columbia administration’s recent memo to faculty follows rather closely Walmart’s advice to its managers about how to fight unionization. What are nonprofits like us doing in the same company as these for-profit corporations? Corporate ruthlessness about employee wages and benefits is ugly, but at least it makes sense in terms of corporate principles, questionable as those principles may be. Universities should have higher principles, no? They are exempted from taxation because they are supposed to be operating in the public interest. How is it in the public interest to make sure that the people who do the University’s essential work have no one to support their interests and grievances and must depend instead on the hypothetical good will of their employers? Many of us faculty members have been wondering lately what it is exactly that administrators, whose numbers seem to increase a lot faster than ours, get paid to do. An upper-level Columbia administrator visited my department recently to explain the administration’s position on the union drive. The students, as I remember him saying, were claiming that their dental coverage had been arbitrarily revoked. This, he said, was untrue. In fact, he said, it was the insurance company that had cancelled the policy, not the University. The University had promptly replaced that policy. Perhaps, he conceded, the administrator in charge (not himself) had not advertised the replacement widely or rapidly enough. An email to a graduate student clarified this problem somewhat. The new coverage, according to the email, included one routine visit and one cleaning per year, pain relief and advice in case of a dental emergency, a $20 copay, and a 10 percent discount on other fees. Comprehensive coverage had disappeared as an option, even an expensive one. Our conversation seemed to indicate that the new policy was saving the University money, and that it was clear whose pockets that money was coming out of. How many graduate students are not living under or around the poverty line? In its memos regarding graduate worker unionization, the University administration all but complained that allowing a union in a private university would plunge us all into a terrifying new world of uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty is what graduate students are already living with. They had no say at all in whether or not they would have comprehensive dental coverage. The administration decided arbitrarily whatever it liked, whenever it liked, with no input from anyone else. Here are some answers, then, to the question of what University administrators do. They try to recruit faculty members into their anti-union drive (why else are they visiting so many departments?) And they… spin. Smoothly. Technically, no lies were told to my department. The substance of the issue had been, I think, misrepresented. But nothing was said, I would guess, that would be actionable in a court of law. The administration has likely been receiving high-quality advice from its very expensive counsel. The putative ill effects of a graduate student union have been mentioned often, and each time they have been soundly refuted. I have been told, for example, that the mentor-mentee relation would be endangered by the existence of a union. That was not my experience, though admittedly, this was at a public institution. Nothing the administration tells me to fear seems any more plausible than its account of the dental coverage replacement issue. What I do have to fear is every new step it takes that makes Columbia more like Walmart.

The funding together with the Walmart Foundation will support projects in applied science, education and communications, according to the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer at a briefing held in Beijing, where it also launched the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center to bring together local and international research. “By bringing together the best food safety thinkers from across the food ecosystem, from farmers to suppliers, retailers to policy regulators, we’ll accelerate food safety awareness and help make Chinese families safer and healthier,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said at the event in Beijing on Wednesday. Wal-Mart, which is overhauling its business globally to meet the challenge from e-commerce, had struggled over the years to adapt its stores to meet Chinese consumers’ tastes and compete with local online grocery providers. The retailer earlier this month boosted its stake in China’s second-largest e-commerce website JD.com Inc., strengthening its China presence after its sales were hit in 2014 by a series of food incidents. The new center will facilitate research in areas such as the root causes of food-borne illnesses, and developing solutions for China’s food supply chain. It also announced Wednesday three projects including one that brings U.S. and China academics together with local poultry producers Fujian Shengnong Food Co., New Hope Liuhe Co. and Guangzhou Jiangfeng Industry Co. to study safety in poultry supply chains. — With assistance by Rachel Chang Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Those without a college degree have found themselves losing relative economic ground since the early 1980s, and nearly all workers have had a rough time of things—facing stagnant pay, for example—since the beginning of this century. It would be really great if workers, and those with less education especially, could find ways to earn more. In an intriguing piece published over the weekend, Neil Irwin, of the New York Times, suggests that Walmart, the massive discount retailer, may have found an answer: pay workers more and you get better workers. It sounds fantastic, a win-win for everyone, and why has it taken firms so long to discover this possibility? Yet the solution might not be as simple as all that. Mr Irwin notes that Walmart has long been one of the most aggressive and influential cost-cutters in the American economy: credited, in some studies, with single-handedly depressing pay in many labour markets and inflation across the economy as a whole. Yet in recent years the retailer has struggled financially. Meanwhile, surveys of its customers' views revealed that many came to hate going to Walmart, where the service was inevitably bad, the store dirty, and the shelves poorly stocked. In 2015 Walmart decided that cost-cutting had gone far enough and decided to raise pay rates for its lowest wage jobs, while also improving conditions for workers and investing more in training. Walmart was not the first company to try this. Given its massive scale, its shift in strategy is noteworthy. Has it worked? At the moment, this is unclear; Mr Irwin writes that customer survey responses have got way better, but its stock price and profits continue to suffer. It's early days, though, and so the more important question is: could it work? Or really: how could it work? Mr Irwin reckons the secret is something economists call "efficiency wages": “Efficiency wages” is the term that economists — who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas — use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return... Economists have found evidence of this in practice in many real-world settings. Higher pay at New Jersey police departments, for example, led to better rates of clearing cases. At the San Francisco airport, higher pay led to shorter lines for passengers. Among British home care providers, higher pay meant less oversight was needed. What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what’s ailing the broader United States economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages. Economists have indeed found evidence that firms sometimes pay efficiency wages and enjoy higher profits as a result. Yet economists also get very nervous when people float the idea that firms are, en masse, failing to take advantage of an opportunity to raise profits.  In fact, it is far from clear that Walmart is paying efficiency wages. (I'm not the first to point this out; Adam Ozimek does so nicely here.) Efficiency wage theory does not simply say that better-paid workers are better workers. Rather, it says that paying a worker more than that worker could get elsewhere in the labour market generates an increase in firm productivity. And in most efficiency wage stories, that improvement comes from reductions in turnover costs or increases in effort.  One classic example of the phenomenon is the $5-a-day wage introduced by Henry Ford, which at the time was well above the market rate for an undifferentiated labourer. The pay rise turned out to be a success, but why? Well, work in Ford's plants was extremely unpleasant—workers spent all day at mind-numbing tasks on the new-fangled assembly line—and when Ford set the wage at the rate workers could get anywhere else, turnover was extremely high. Constantly rehiring to fill open jobs was costly and annoying. By hiking wages, Ford created a cost to workers to quitting; since they were not actually any more productive than other workers in the market, they could not expect to earn nearly as much anywhere else. The long queues of workers outside the Ford plant made the threat credible. Turnover fell, and productivity across the plant rose. Is this what Walmart is doing? It doesn't seem so. Instead the firm appears to be trying to raise worker quality, both by attracting better applicants and by using higher pay to encourage existing workers to enrol in training courses. These aren't efficiency wages; better workers can earn more on the labour market. Neither would it be good for workers generally if every firm decided to pay efficiency wages, which only work if firms can draw on a pool of surplus workers and workers can't do better by quitting and going elsewhere. There is not a free lunch to be had here, sadly. Might it nonetheless be a good idea to pay workers more? There are several reasons why it might. First, if low wages are the result of a lack of worker bargaining power, which allows firms to capture most or all of the surplus created by new hires, then there is scope to boost worker pay without much harming overall employment. Second, as Mr Irwin mentions, diverting a greater share of national income to workers, and especially workers with low incomes and a greater propensity to spend what they earn (rather than tuck it away in a bond fund), could help fix the world's macroeconomic troubles. Much of the rich world is facing chronic slump conditions; interest rates are stuck near zero and central banks seem to be struggling to foster a level of demand adequate to keep the industrialised world operating at full employment. Shifting resources toward those with greater propensity to spend should help. This effect would be even more powerful if (as Janet Yellen herself argued last week) healthy demand growth can induce healthy growth in economic potential. Third, higher wages could change how firms use workers, leading to higher productivity levels. When wages are low, firms will often choose to organise themselves in ways that use lots of cheap workers at low productivity levels; when wages are high, on the other hand, firms will tend to use workers more carefully, by investing more in training and productivity-enhancing technologies. This is closer to what Walmart seems to be doing, and it isn't that difficult to see why the change in strategy is necessary. Big retailers are facing increased competition from online sellers. Just as importantly, pressure is growing around America for substantial increases in the minimum wage. If Walmart is to remain competitive, it needs to shift its model to one which can generate profits while paying higher wages. Finding better workers and providing them with more training is a minimum response to the threat. The critical question is how easily this model can be extended across the economy as a whole. How would firms react to a $12 federal minimum wage, for example? Many would invest more in training, in new technologies, and in reorganisations that allow fewer, higher quality workers to do jobs once done by more, less-skilled workers. There would probably be some employment cost. Some mass-employment business models, like low-end fast food, might simply cease to work when the minimum wage is well above current levels. In other cases, higher wages might lead firms to adopt labour-saving technologies they had not previously deemed worth exploiting: like shelf-stocking robots in warehouses or automated check-out in shops. Ultimately, some workers are better able to or more interested in opportunities to upgrade their skills in return for higher pay than are others. Indeed, in one real sense the Walmart story is quite worrying. Writes Mr Irwin: But at the store level, managers describe a big shift in the kind of workers they can bring in by offering $10 an hour with a solid path to $15 an hour. “We’re attracting a different type of associate,” said Tina Budnaitis, the manager of Walmart No. 5260 in Rogers. “We get more people coming in who want a career instead of a job.” When Walmart—long a sponge for low-skill workers who might struggle to find jobs elsewhere—decides its business can't work unless it becomes choosier in its hires, that bodes very ill indeed for the people Walmart is no longer interested in employing: and, one suspects for America's economy and its politics. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon Be the first to comment Editors’ picks American businessMeet the new boss Businesses may come to love or to fear Donald Trump.

Home Beef Companies Failing in Effort to Slow Amazon Deforestation, Study Says America's top beef buyers have vowed to help stop the clearing of rainforest land for beef production, but haven't gone far enough, says advocacy group. By Georgina Gustin, InsideClimate News Oct 19, 2016 Much of the deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven by beef production. Credit: Getty Images America's top beef buyers have failed to tackle deforestation in South America despite some companies' pledges to source "deforestation-free" beef, according to a report by an environmental advocacy group. The growing global appetite for beef is the single biggest driver behind the disappearance of the planet's rainforests—and that is likely to expand as the world hurtles toward a population of 10 billion in 2050. Those forest suck up millions of tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide every year and are critical to solving the global climate crisis. Ending deforestation and restoring damaged forests could deliver as much as 40 percent of the emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the Paris accord, the international climate agreement that will go into force next month. The study, by the Union of Concerned Scientists, tracked the beef industry's progress toward "deforestation-free" beef, ranking 13 U.S. companies on the strength of their efforts over the past few years in South America, where deforestation rates have skyrocketed over the last four decades. While the beef industry and its customers, including major buyers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart, have made some commitments to sourcing beef raised on land that hasn't been cleared or burned for pasture, UCS researchers said they're not going far enough. Burger King, ConAgra, Kroger and Pizza Hut each earned a score of zero for failing to make any commitment toward buying "deforestation-free" beef. McDonald's, Wal-Mart and Mars earned the report's top scores. They have made public commitments to buying from suppliers that have pledged to raise cattle on land that hasn't been freshly cleared.   Burger King, ConAgra, Kroger, Pizza Hut and McDonald's did not respond to requests for comment. "McDonald's is very progressive and doing much more than other companies, and Wal-Mart also got a good score. Wal-Mart has had a sustainability program for years," said Chris Wille, a co-founder of the Rainforest Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, which did not participate in the UCS study. "When they or McDonalds make the tiniest move, it rocks the whole industry." UCS estimated that 10 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions is linked to the slashing of tropical rainforests. And a United Nations analysis in 2015 showed that the amount of deforestation caused by beef production is more than double caused by soy, palm oil and wood products—the next largest drivers of tropical deforestation. Yet the beef industry has only recently started to limit its impact. Over the past several years, a number of collaborative efforts have outlined pledges to limit deforestation—and accurately guage companies' attempts—but most of the corporate pledges have been aimed at soy, palm oil and paper. A report by the Supply Change project found that 61 percent of the companies active in palm oil have committed to deforestation efforts, whereas only 15 percent of the industries linked to cattle had done so as of last March. "The disparity is alarming because it is estimated that cattle production causes 10 times more deforestation than palm," the report said. "The cattle sector is the last to really address the need for some kind of guidance and metrics, and the last where new omnibus commitments are being made," said Wille. "It's really the laggard industry." The UCS report said even the companies getting high marks could be buying indirectly from ranchers that clear land. That's because cattle are bred, raised and slaughtered by different ranchers in different places, so even when a company buys cattle from a "deforestation-free" supplier, that supplier may have gotten his cattle from elsewhere. "Despite [our] progress, we recognize that there are still major risks of deforestation within our beef supply," Wal-Mart acknowledged in a 2016 company report. "Before cattle arrive at our slaughterhouse, it is possible that they might be traded from high-risk ranches to 'approved' ranches or slaughterhouses."   Wal-Mart, widely considered a leader in supply chain sustainability, also said ranchers "can simply re-register their operations under different names to access clean supply chains," and that a major deforestation pledge by major suppliers only extends to the Brazilian Amazon. "We are exploring ways to deepen transparency within our beef-monitoring system by extending our reach to other sensitive biomes," the company said. Between 1990 and 2005, beef production was responsible for 71 percent of the deforestation in South America. In Brazil, the world's second-largest beef producer after the U.S., 80 percent of the forests cleared were linked to beef production. Ranchers have cleared millions of acres across the continent for grazing land, but also for soy, most of which is fed to livestock, indirectly compounding the problem. "We did the damage 150 years or 200 years ago here in the U.S.," Wille said. "It's ongoing now in Brazil." In 2009, in response to pressure from advocacy groups led by Greenpeace, four of the largest meatpackers operating in Brazil signed a public agreement to stop buying beef from recently deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon. Between 2005 and 2014, deforestation rates in the region dropped 70 percent. This is at least in part because of the industry's actions, according to the UCS  report. In 2014, criteria for sustainable beef production, with deforestation-free measures, was formally approved by the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, a coalition of retailers, producers, processors and environmental groups. Those steps are now being developed by individual member countries, including Brazil and the U.S. At a conference held this month by the Global Roundtable, conservationist groups and the industry acknowledged progress, particularly in the Brazilian Amazon. Now their focus is turning to other massive ecosystems, including the Cerrado, a swath of savanna mostly in Brazil, and the Chaco, a woods and grassland ecosystem mostly in Paraguay and Argentina. "Issues in the Amazon have not been resolved, but there's progress," said Sharon Smith, who leads the tropical forest and climate initiative at UCS. "The conversation is expanding to how we begin tackling these other ecosystems." Earlier this year, an effort called the Forests and Agriculture Markets Initiative launched with the mission of securing deforestation-free commitments from the beef and soy industries in areas beyond the Brazilian Amazon. "The ecosystems of the Cerrado and Chaco aren't dense forests like the Amazon, but they store carbon, provide habitats for wildlife and provide other ecosystem services just like the Amazon," said Carlos Saviani, vice president for food sustainability at the World Wildlife Fund. But conservation groups say the industry will continue to threaten South American forests unless global agreements set stronger criteria, with more oversight of exactly where beef is coming from. "What we need to see is joint collective action, modeled using the lessons from the [2009 Brazilian] Cattle Agreement, that extends to more meatpackers, more ecosystems, like the Cerrado," Smith explained, "and all suppliers including indirect suppliers."

Vudu, which Walmart acquired in 2010, has up to this point served as a destination for customers to rent and buy content. The new program, dubbed Vudu Movies on Us, offers up thousands of movies and TV shows to watch free of charge and on-demand through an ad-supported model. It's a smart move on Walmart's part as it allows the company to generate revenue from older content and potentially attract new customers that may end up buying or renting premium content. To get started, you’ll first need to sign up for a free Vudu account if you don’t already have one. Then, simply navigate to the Movies on Us section to browse the catalog. All free content will stream in full 1080p HD resolution with Dolby Digital sound (when available) and can be viewed across a variety of devices including smart TVs, Blu-ray players and on streaming devices from companies like Roku and Google. You can also view content on your Android or iOS device or with your desktop web browser. Notably absent from the list of compatible devices is Amazon which isn’t all that surprising consider Prime Video is a direct competitor. If you’re looking for new release movies or current TV shows, you’re out of luck. What you will find, however, is a decent collection of older blockbuster and classic titles like True Grit, Mad Max, Abduction, School of Rock and Young Adult, just to name a few. As said Jeremy Verba, vice president and general manager of Vudu, correctly states, nothing is more affordable than free.

Walmart recently launched its grocery pickup service, which allows customers to order online and then drive to the store at a scheduled time to have the order loaded into their car. Pictured are personal shopper Caren Hunter, left, and assistant manager Robert Van Ooijen at the Coors Bypass store. (Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Albuquerque’s two largest grocery retailers want to take some of the work out of shopping — at least the roaming-the-aisles-and-pushing-a-cart part. Walmart last month rolled out its grocery pickup service at four Albuquerque area stores. Now Smith’s plans to bring its own version to the Duke City too. The programs allow customers to buy anything from cauliflower to cat food without entering the store. Instead, they place online orders and schedule a pickup time at the location. Employees bring the bags out to them and even load them into the trunk. Advertisement Continue reading Walmart’s free service is available for orders of $30-plus; Smith’s tacks on a $4.95 fee. Neither chain says how many people use the service around the country, but both are in expansion mode. Smith’s parent, Kroger, launched ClickList in 2015. Smith’s, a Western division in seven states, currently offers it in Utah and Las Vegas, Nev., and Albuquerque should get it this year. The Smith’s at Montgomery and Tramway NE is scheduled to start ClickList pickups in December with some select metro sites to follow, according to Marsha Gilford, vice president of public affairs. “We can definitely say that those who are using it LOVE it and numbers are growing,” Gilford said in an email to the Journal. Walmart, meanwhile, increased availability of its service from five markets to 80 in the last year, according to the Washington Post. Both chains say they use specially trained employees to fulfill each customer’s online order, and that foods are safely stored — frozen or cooled as needed — until pickup. The program is not a way to unload expired yogurt or bruised apples, either. Jimmie Turner, a Walmart e-commerce market coach, said the staff will show the customer the chosen produce before loading it into the car. “If there’s something that they wouldn’t put in their shopping cart, they’re not going to put it in yours,” he said recently from the grocery pickup spots outside the Walmart at 10224 Coors Bypass NW. Walmart also offers the service at 1820 Unser NW, 460 N.M. 528 in Bernalillo and at 901 Unser SE in Rio Rancho. Online grocery shopping represents a significant growth opportunity, according to Morgan Stanley Research, which found that 34 percent of survey respondents expected to order groceries online in 2016. That’s up from 21 percent in 2015. Amazon offers online ordering and home grocery delivery through its Amazon Fresh service, but the program is not available in New Mexico.

Friday's raids, dubbed Operation Get Fit, targeted a dozen businesses owned by 58-year-old Steve Scott of Pelham, as well as his Shelby County home, and led to the arrests of Scott and 15 of his employees. A 17th person is still sought. The four-month investigation was led by the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, which is headed by the office of District Attorney Brandon Falls and the U.S. Secret Service. Falls said "boosters" have been stealing Fitbits, Nest Learning Thermostats, and numerous other items from a variety of area stores and then selling them to Scott's businesses. From there, the stolen items were then sold on eBay and Craigslist. "We feel like we've stopped a major pipeline," Falls said in a Tuesday news conference. Investigators fanned out Friday morning armed with search and arrest warrants at the businesses, which serve as pawn shops and provide payday loans and check cashing. The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Pelham police and the Shelby County District Attorney's Office also took part in Friday's arrests. At 10 a.m., officers descended on stores in Jefferson and Shelby counties, handcuffing employees and seizing dozens of boxes of business records and stolen goods. Jefferson County District Attorney Investigator Chris Clark and Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Raulston said the investigation began months ago when retailers realized hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise was being boosted off the shelves. The Fitbits, iPads and other "smart products" were disappearing from Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreen's, Lowes and Home Depot. Investigators from those stores teamed up with federal and Jefferson County authorities to launch Operation Get Fit, which culminated in Friday's roundup. Authorities believe the organized theft operation has been ongoing for at least two years. Once they realized what was happening, the retailers provided undercover officers with goods to present as stolen to the businesses owned by Scott, said Vestavia Hills police Capt. Kevin York. "The new, in-the-box property was presented as stolen,'' York said. "The clerks knew it was stolen when they took it in." Those taking part in Operation Get Fit with the District Attorney's Office and U.S. Secret Service included: Vestavia Hills, Birmingham, Mountain Brook, and Pelham police; Walmart Global Investigations, Target Special Investigations Team, Home Depot Corporate Investigators, CVS health Organized Retail Crime Unit, Walgreens Organized Retail Crime Unit, and Publix Organized Retail Crime Investigations. The recovered items are valued at more than $500,000. "The U.S. Secret Service is proud to work with its partners to dismantle a large-scale network of traffickers in stolen property and other criminal activities, said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Michael Williams. "This boosting and fencing, this is a criminal enterprise and what it does is add to the destruction of the community as a whole," Falls said. "Because at some point, those stores, those retailers, cannot survive and continue to do business in the community when they suffer the loss from crime." "When that becomes too great, the business just shuts down. That is when the entire community suffers. There is obvious loss of revenue in the form of taxes to the city,'' he said. "When that revenue goes away, so do the services that are provided with it. That's less money for roads, that's less money for schools and that's less money for fire departments." But that's not all it means, Falls said. "It means the loss of jobs for the community. It means there isn't a store down the street for people to go buy groceries, to go buy medicine, to go buy clothes for their kids,'' he said. "Those are the necessities of life, what every community needs to thrive, to survive." Falls said he was recently asked why they have dedicated the effort to white-collar crime and fraud. "When that business closes its doors, we lose all that it provides. It is because those necessities that these businesses provide to the community. They aren't just providing necessities, they are providing hope,'' he said. "In the last two years, we have seen an increase in violent crime in certain cities across the country, and one of the common characteristics in those cities is a lack of economic opportunity,'' Falls said. "In referring to that economic opportunity in Chicago, a city that has certainly seen an increase in violent, a city official said, 'Show me a man without hope, and I'll show you a man willing to pick up a gun.''' Falls said that's why they started the task force – to go after theft and fraud and everything that follows from it, which includes violent crime. "Crime doesn't happen in a vacuum, and the ramifications of it don't happen in a vacuum either, and those ramifications are made worse by the perception of crime in the area,'' he said. "And perception isn't limited to just the boundaries of the city of Birmingham; it affects the entire area. Because if people believe Birmingham is a high-crime area, they are going to think twice about moving their families here or opening businesses here." The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Fall said he'd like to have a detective from every city in Jefferson County, and even Shelby County, join the task force. "You really will be making a difference to fight crime and combat the violence in our area," he said.

Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story For all of Walmart’s ubiquity — the retailer has 4,629 locations in the United States — a singular proposed location in Mission had the apparent effect of stalling an entire development proposal. Now, with Walmart out of the picture for the Mission Gateway project, even skeptics of the plan seem to agree that New York developer Tom Valenti is on the right path with a plan that no longer includes the big box discount retailer. Walmart dropped out Valenti’s plans for Mission Gateway after the Mission City Council wouldn’t approve a preliminary site plan for a Walmart-anchored development at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Johnson Drive. Valenti addressed a crowd of Mission residents at the Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center last week about the future of Mission Gateway. Gone from the discussion was the acrimony over Walmart’s presence that had been a fixture in earlier debates about the project. Instead, a free-flowing conversation about possible tenants took place. “I feel good about the project and what’s in the project,” said Kristin Inman, a Mission council member who was elected in April over an incumbent who supported Valenti’s Walmart-anchored project. Inman’s qualified support — qualified because many details remain unknown about Valenti’s new plan — is crucial for the project’s future. So, too, is the mood of other council members like Nick Schlossmacher, who had also opposed Mission Gateway with a Walmart. “For me, the change to not having a single big-box store is definitely something that I’m excited about,” Schlossmacher said. “I feel a lot better about it.” Instead of a Walmart, Valenti’s plans call for three retailers occupying the east side of the 16-acre Mission Gateway development. That’s the only substantive change from his previous plan. Other elements — an Aloft hotel, an Element extended-stay hotel, other restaurants, smaller retailers and apartments — all remain. Debbie Kring, a council member since 1999 who has seen all of Valenti’s proposals since the Mission Mall met the wrecking ball on that site in 2005, said she objected to any big-box retailer in the project, not just a Walmart. She did welcome the inclusion of a hotel, which has been an on-again-off-again component of Mission Gateway over the years. “That’s a great plot of land and I really wanted that hotel back,” Kring said. It’s unknown how Mission Gateway will be financed. Valenti has made it clear that he will seek tax increment financing and a community improvement district to assist with the project. Both of those tools use taxes generated by the development to pay for certain project costs. Valenti has floated the possibility that he may seek general obligation bonds for at least part of the public financing, which means Mission would cover debt service payments to bondholders in case the development underperforms. Mission Mayor Steve Schwengerdt said previously that he prefers not to involve general obligation bonds. An alternative would be special obligation bonds, which depend solely on the revenues created by a project and don’t incur the city’s guarantee of debt payments. Inman echoed that sentiment. “Special (obligation bonds) would be much better for me,” she said. The other main question mark for Mission Gateway is the identity of those three retail tenants that will take Walmart’s space. Valenti declined to identify specific retailers, but said he is in pursuit of a grocery store, a computer-related business and a sporting goods concept. He said he hopes to start construction in the spring, a timeline that will depend on answering the remaining questions that surround Mission Gateway.

Walmart launches a free streaming service, Vudu Movies on Us Posted Oct 18, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Intel raises restructuring charge to $2.3B as it faces more challenges ahead Who’s copying Amazon? Everyone! But especially Walmart. Speaking of which, the retailer giant announced today the launch of its own video streaming service, called Vudu Movies on Us. The service at launch will include thousands of titles, which will be available in HD and can be streamed for free. To generate revenue, Vudu Movies on Us will be ad-supported. While Amazon’s Prime Video is a perk that comes with an Amazon Prime membership, then offers a variety of commercial-free movies and TV shows, including originals, Vudu Movies on Us will not have new releases. Instead, it will more narrowly focus on distributing free blockbuster titles and other classics, the company says. For example, at launch the service will include movies like “Mad Max,” “True Grit,” “Abduction,” and “School of Rock.” All will be available in 1080p high definition, and will support Dolby Digital sound when available, says Walmart. Vudu, of course, has been around for over a decade, allowing customers to rent and buy movies and TV shows through its marketplace. Walmart bought the service back in 2010. But today’s audience is more interested in streaming than owning, in many cases. With the new venture, Walmart can enter the on-demand streaming market without having to build out its own, exclusive content library – something that would have been a pricey way for Walmart to compete. Instead, Vudu Movies on Us competes with other ad-supported streaming services, like Yahoo View, which is the new home for Hulu’s free content, as well as Sony’s Crackle. In addition, citing research from Deloitte, Walmart notes that over 42 percent of U.S. consumers prefer to stream content at home, and most prefer movies and TV from ad-supported services. (Of course, many also prefer Netflix, according to the streaming service’s still growing numbers, announced yesterday.) The free titles are available now on Vudu, in a new section in the app. To find Movies on Us, click the “New” tab on the desktop or “Spotlight” if on mobile or on a living room device like Roku, Chromecast or consoles. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Walmart Founded 1962 Overview Walmart is a multinational retail corporation that operates several chains of discount department and warehouse stores.

The new service, Vudu Movies on Us, won’t include new releases or current TV series. Those will remain available only as premium-priced options. At launch, free movies include “Mad Max,” “True Grit,” “Abduction,” “School of Rock,” “Hoosiers,” “The Phantom of the Opera” (2004), “Young Adult,” “Margin Call,” “A Walk to Remember” and “The Magnificent Seven” (1960). Vudu says it will be adding more content in the coming months. “There’s no better value than free,” said Jeremy Verba, VP and GM of Vudu. “We see a gap in the marketplace for watching free HD movies on-demand.” With the retail giant’s push into premium ad-supported VOD, Vudu will compete for viewer attention and advertising budgets against AVOD players like Sony’s Crackle, AdRise’s TubiTV and Yahoo View (which has a licensing deal with Hulu to offer free shows), as well as the free, ad-supported services from networks like ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Verba said Vudu considered developing a subscription VOD service, “but we felt the ad-supported model was where we should focus.” According to the company’s research, more than half of Walmart shoppers said they’re interested in watching free or discounted ad-supported video services. More to the point: Competing against the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu would have required considerable investment on Walmart’s part to acquire exclusive, premium-grade content. Vudu’s free streaming service, besides generating new ad dollars, will give it a funnel of potential new customers for its core transactional business offering more than 100,000 titles for rent or purchase. Ever since it launched in 2007, Vudu has focused on delivering high-end digital video tech and earlier this year became the first service to integrate 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos Audio. The company will promote Vudu Movies on Us first to its several million registered users who have made a purchase on the service in the past. Verba said the AVOD service will then be marketed on Walmart.com and in Walmart stores, which receive 140 million visitors each week. “We have a great customer base built in we can promote this to,” said Verba. The Vudu Movies on Us selections will stream in 1080p HD, with Dolby Digital sound available for some titles, and can be watched across dozens of smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and connected-TV devices including Roku, Google’s Chromecast and video-game consoles. Vudu also is accessible on the web and via apps for iOS and Android devices. The free service — which is available only in the U.S., as is Vudu’s transactional storefront — will carry limited commercials, primarily pre-roll ads and some mid-roll spots, Verba said. TracFone Wireless and American Express are among the initial advertising partners, as well as local automotive dealerships whose ads will be targeted to viewers in designated market areas. “This is a big opportunity for advertisers. Consumer viewing habits are changing,” Verba said. “Leading up to this launch, we were very, very focused on making this a great customer experience, and we’ll work with advertising partners to shape the service.” Vudu’s main partner on the advertising sales and tech front is Ooyala, a New York-based online-video company owned by Australia’s Telstra. Vudu will work with Nielsen to track and report viewing of the free service on connected TVs and mobile at launch. Founded in 2004, Vudu was acquired by Walmart in 2010. Today, Vudu has about 100 employees based in Sunnyvale, Calif., while the retailer’s Walmart.com and e-commerce teams are based in San Bruno. Verba joined Vudu in mid-2014. He previously was CEO of online-dating site eHarmony, and has worked at Foundation Capital as an entrepreneur-in-residence, AOL and Zynga.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Walmart's Vudu Launches Free Ad-Supported Video on Demand By Jack Neff. Published on October 18, 2016. Credit: Walmart Most Popular Walmart is getting deeper into the media business, launching a free, ad-supported video-on-demand service, Vudu Movies on Us, offering high-definition feature films and TV titles in 1080p high definition with pre- and mid-roll advertising. The service available across devices will initially include such titles as "Mad Max," "True Grit," "Abduction" and "School of Rock." Vudu's existing offering is a digital rental service with prices ranging from 99 cents to $5.99, along with a service that allows people to get digital versions of DVDs they buy or already own. As part of Walmart, "Vudu is always looking for new ways for customers to save money, and nothing is more affordable than free," said Jeremy Verba, VP-general manager of Vudu. High definition will help set the service apart as offering "free without sacrificing quality," he said. Movies on Us fills a gap in the market as Mr. Verba sees it. He said research shows more than half of Walmart shoppers prefer free ad-supported video-on-demand to subscription services. That matches a recent Hub Entertainment Research study showing 53% had that preference. Yet pure ad-supported options remain sparse, with Hulu recently discontinuing its "free-with-ads" service in favor of a tiered subscription service that offers a discount for people who accept some ads. (Hulu offloaded its ad-supported service to Yahoo View, where it should become part of Verizon's offerings pending the close of its acquisition.) Walmart rival Amazon's Prime Video is ostensibly a subscription service, but the large portion of Prime members who pay the $99 annual subscription fee just for free two-day shipping without using the video or music streaming services in the bundle suggests they're widely viewed as a free throw-in. Mr. Verba said Walmart has opted initially not to bundle Movies on Us with its Prime-fighting $49 Shipping Pass service, which offers free two-day shipping on a wide range of online orders. "We'll watch for opportunities carefully as we go along," he said. "But for now it's a standalone offering." But no matter who's offering it, AVOD has an uphill battle. Despite consumers' stated preference for free ad-supported streaming, Hub's study found avoidance rife with 52%-56% of consumers skipping ads on AVOD when possible, 45% saying fast-forward disabling on VOD and online platforms is a "major frustration," and 83% of DVR users saying they skip ads most or all of the time. Also, plenty of people are willing to pony up to avoid ads. Netflix yesterday delivered an upside surprise in subscriber growth, which reached 46.5 million in the U.S. in the third quarter, up more than 4 million from a year ago. But Vudu, launched in 2004 and acquired by Walmart in 2010, has access to a huge potential customer base in Walmart stores, Walmart.com and Jet.com, including through the many TVs, smartphones, game consoles and other streaming devices sold there. Mr. Verba said Vudu plans to use its in-house advertising and distribution opportunities extensively in addition to advertising on outside digital channels, backed primarily by in-house creative. Vudu points to a 2014 Deloitte Digital Democracy survey showing 43% of U.S. consumers subscribe to a video streaming service, but even with recent growth, that leaves a majority who don't -- with most of them likely shopping at Walmart regularly. "We've been very much working with Walmart customers to bring them into the digital world, which has helped make us into one of the fastest-growing premium services," Mr. Verba said, with millions of users, though he didn't specify how many millions. At the same time, he sees Movies On Us as a way advertisers -- and Walmart suppliers -- can chase ever-elusive eyeballs. And it gets Walmart, which already offers suppliers programmatic digital media buying through its Walmart Exchange and numerous ways of advertising their products in and through its stores and websites, deeper into the business of selling advertising. AVOD is expected to reach nearly $11 billion in annual revenue within five years, Mr. Verba said. "Consumers expect to view content in an on-demand environment. This allows advertisers to reach those consumers where they are and where they're going." Initial advertisers include automotive and credit-card brands, in addition to Walmart. Vudu will work with Ooyala to sell advertising and ultimately "other partners as well," Mr. Verba said. It also will work with Nielsen on audience measurement and analytics initially, he said, but is open to working with other third-party measurement providers.

The retail giant is once again matching every dollar donated by customers at the till, to a maximum of $2,000 per store, until Oct. 28 as part of an annual fundraiser for the Canadian Red Cross to support communities across Canada affected by disaster. While the non-profit organization is best known for helping out during major disasters, they also offer emergency assistance for minor ones. “The things that get the most attention are things like the Fort McMurray fire in the way support was given out because it was on such a large scale, but a lot of the work we do is for individual families,” said Canadian Red Cross spokesperson Andrew Hopkins. “Every three hours, on average, the Red Cross responds to an emergency within Canada’s borders. Sometimes it just comes down to helping people get back to work, say for example, a mechanic loses his tools, but we want to make sure people are able to get back on their feet and back to work and get their lives back to normal, or what we call the new normal after a disaster has occurred. “ Recent recipients of their emergency assistance was a Surrey family who lost their home three months ago. Hairdresser and mother of three Catherine Sonpon came home from work June 22 to find her young family’s Johnson Heights rental apartment ablaze after a computer on the balcony malfunctioned. Nobody was hurt but several units were damaged and her own home was gutted. “I remember feeling sadness and pain,” said Sonpon. “My family was safe, and material losses are not as important, but I was still sad to lose all our stuff.” The City of Surrey provided immediate 72-hour assistance but the family – husband Emmanuel Aryitey and children aged two, three and seven months – required more help as they didn’t have home insurance to cover their losses. The family found themselves living at a local Sandman hotel and many of their immediate needs were met by donations of groceries, toiletries and other necessities of life by Walmart. “The Red Cross was very supportive. They help people in times of need - not just with financial assistance, but they showed us love and support to help us recover from the fire,” said Sonpon, who attended a promotional event Oct. 12 with her husband and kids at Walmart’s Guildford location to show their gratitude. “People usually think of the Red Cross responding to major disasters like an earthquake in other parts of the world. We didn’t even know they help people in Surrey recover from smaller disasters like our apartment fire.” She and Aryitey, also a hairstylist, are now back to work and helping their kids adjust to their new normal in a new home in Whalley. Since 2003, Walmart Canada has raised and donated nearly $29 million in disaster-relief funding. Funds raised during the annual fall campaign are set aside to help local families after disaster strikes in their respective communities and support the distribution of essential emergency supplies, hot meals, new clothing and a safe place to stay for those affected, as well as training and equipment for local volunteer teams.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council to discuss groundwater authority on short agenda Tuesday Oct 18, 2016 at 9:00 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 Does a short agenda mean a short meeting? The Ridgecrest City Council will find out Wednesday. The agenda for the meeting lists only one discussion/action item: providing direction to council rep Mayor Peggy Breeden on the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority regarding potential operational documents. The item is a follow-up to a previous issue. The IWVGA is in the process of developing its organizational structure and governing documents. Breeden previously declined to vote on an item regarding committee structure within the IWVGA and is seeking guidance from council how to proceed in the future. The next IWVGA meeting is scheduled for Oct. 20. An agenda for the meeting is included as an agenda amendment, along with the regular agenda at http://ridgecrest-ca.gov/council-agendas Also on the agenda is a consent calendar item regarding lighting and landscaping maintenance district annexation of the Walmart site and surrounding properties. According to a staff report, the Walmart site “is required to provide a maintenance district to cover the cost of operating and maintaining street lighting and landscaping.” In addition, other “area benefitted developers are required to annex their development into the existing City of Ridgecrest Landscaping and Lighting District. “This initial action by the City Council initiates the annexation process and declares the City’s intention to levy assessments for TPM 11790 and benefitted properties generally located in proximity to Bowman Road and S. China Lake Boulevard area (New Walmart area).” The staff report further states that “[t]he total annual maximum assessment amount being balloted for Annexation No. 2016-2 is $42,600.75 ($27,227.65 for Zone 02 and $15,373.10 for Zone 03). The total assessment proposed for Fiscal Year 2017/2018 is $36,043.96 ($20,827.99 for Zone 02 and $15,215.97 for Zone 03). These assessments if approved will be submitted to the County and collected on the property tax bills for Fiscal Year 2017/2018. Per the RMC, Section 19-2.3h the Walmart TPM is required to pay all costs for after acceptance of the facilities but prior to the time the assessment can be put upon the tax bill for a duration not to exceed one year. The City would be responsible for all costs from the end of the one year until the assessment is funded for by approximately January of 2018.” Also on the agenda is a proclamation honoring regional activist Ed Waldheim for his work with outdoor recreation in the area. A special closed session will kick off at 5 p.m. Six items are listed: potential ligation with Kern County, potential litigation with Southern California Edison, potential litigation with an unnamed potential litigant, existing litigation with William Johnson, USDC Eastern District of California; existing litigation with Matasantos, Sacramento County Superior Court; and existing litigation with Cohen, Sacramento County Superior Court. The regular council meeting is scheduled for October 5 at 6 p.m., at City Council Chambers at City Hall, 100 W. California Ave in Ridgecrest. It will also be broadcast on Mediacom Channel 6 and streamed online at www.ridgecrest-ca.gov/city-media/rc6-live.

Sarah Gindro was shopping in Walmart with her daughter Sophia, 6, when the little complained that her leg was itching 'We went down the aisle and she saw this long one, zebra-colored - but, rainbow-colored, and so she said, "That's the one that I want," so we got it,' Gindro told ABC 15. Ms Gindro said as they continued down the aisles Sophia started to complain that her leg was itching.  'She said, "Mom, my leg itches,"' Ms Gindoro told the news channel.  'I didn't think nothing of it - didn't pay no attention.

She then went to customer service, and told store staff what had happened, showing the employee the bites on her daughter's leg. Ms Gindro said she does not blame Walmart for the incident, but wanted to raise awareness of the risks of buying unpackaged products Ms Gindro said the employee said 'oh my God' and returned the pillow, putting the money straight back on to her card.  She said she does not blame Walmart, but told her story to raise awareness of the risks of buying unpackaged products.  In a statement to ABC15, Walmart said: 'We take this seriously and want to thank Ms. Gindro for bringing it to our attention.  'As soon as our managers found out, they called in a team to inspect the store.'  Read more: Mom: Daughter left Chandler Walmart covered in bed bug bites after buying pillow - ABC15 Arizona Share or comment on this article e-mail 50 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

These strategies can help spell relief. Thinkstock By Kimberly Lankford, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, November 2016 Spending on prescription drugs has reached stratospheric levels, topping $457 billion in the U.S. last year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Most large employers point to the cost of specialty medications as the single biggest impetus for rising health care costs, with no relief in sight. Specialty drugs treat complex conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. They cost more because they usually require special handling and storage, and they may need to be administered via injection or infusion. They usually don’t have generic equivalents. SEE ALSO: Ways to Cut Healthcare Costs In the latest survey by the National Business Group on Health, large employers predict the cost to provide health benefits will rise by 6% in 2017, but they expect a 16.8% increase in spending for specialty medications. “It has really exploded,” says group president Brian Marcotte. “Back in 2014, if you would have asked employers about their top driver of health care costs, specialty drugs wouldn’t even have made the radar screen.” Why are costs rising so fast? More people are living longer with chronic conditions, and drug companies have been introducing new specialty medicines that are expensive to manufacture and administer. They’ve also been hiking prices for other brand-name drugs—with some eye-popping examples grabbing headlines. Finally, fewer patents have expired recently, slowing the introduction of new and cheaper generics. Advertisement In the past, you may have been shielded from the bulk of these costs if you had a low-deductible insurance policy with fixed-dollar co-payments. But employers and insurers have been making changes to their coverage as they search for ways to manage the skyrocketing expenses. They’re dropping some high-priced drugs from their formularies (their lists of covered drugs), imposing new restrictions on coverage, and requiring patients to shoulder a bigger share of the costs themselves. Instead of paying a fixed amount, such as $20 per 30-day supply, you may have to pay a percentage of the cost—such as 20% of the cost of brand-name drugs and 40% or more for pricey specialty medications. And more people now have high-deductible health insurance plans, making them responsible for the full cost until coverage kicks in. Even with a generous insurance policy, you could end up paying hundreds of dollars a month for your medications. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that people with Medicare Part D coverage who took drugs for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer could pay from $4,000 to $12,000 out-of-pocket in 2016 for one drug alone. You will probably have an opportunity to reassess your coverage soon. If you have health insurance through your employer, you generally pick a plan in October or November. Open enrollment runs from November 1 to January 31 for Obamacare exchanges and from October 15 to December 7 for Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. The following strategies can help you cut your drug costs. Keep them in mind as you compare plans during open-enrollment season. Find a Lower-Cost Alternative Advertisement Prescription drug costs can vary widely, and doctors may have no idea how much you’re paying. Switching to a similar, equally effective drug could save you hundreds of dollars. Always ask your doctor if there’s a generic version, which can cost up to 85% less than the brand-name version. Pharmacists can generally switch your medicine to a generic without a new prescription. If no generic is available, ask whether other therapies that do the same thing are available in a generic, says Jon Maesner, chief pharmacy officer for the insurer Cigna. Crestor, for example, a statin that lowers cholesterol levels, can cost $265 per month, and it did not have a generic version until earlier this year. But several other statins have generics, and they cost a lot less. For example, Zocor’s generic version, simvastatin, can cost $8 per month for 40 mg tablets; Lipitor’s generic, atorvastatin, can cost $11.36 per month for 20 mg tablets, says Michael Rea, a pharmacist who founded Rx Savings Solutions, which compares options for employers’ plans. If there’s no generic, you may be able to use another brand-name drug that costs less or has a lower co-payment, says Dr. Jeffrey Rice, CEO of Healthcare BlueBook, which helps people compare costs for medical care and drugs. These “therapeutic alternatives” are in the same class of drugs but vary a bit chemically. SEE ALSO: 11 Common Medicare Mistakes Your insurer or employer may have online tools to look up alternatives and see how much you can save (some doctors are incorporating such tools into their electronic medical records). Cigna, United Healthcare and Humana all have apps that show how much medicines cost under your plan. Advertisement Another option is to order a 90-day supply, which may cost only 2.5 times more than a 30-day supply, says John Lee, senior director of Medicare Part D for Walgreens. Or you might be able to pay less by switching from two tablets at a lower strength to one tablet at a higher strength, says Maesner. Splitting a higher-strength pill may help, but not all pills can be split. Your doctor or pharmacist may know of other creative ways to save. Use a Preferred Pharmacy The pharmacy you choose can also make a big difference in your out-of-pocket costs. Most Medicare Part D plans (and some other plans) now have preferred pharmacies, where you’ll pay a much lower portion of the costs. The Humana/Walmart Part D plan, for example, usually charges a $10 co-pay for preferred generics (those with lower co-payments than other generics). But you’ll have a $1 co-pay at Walmart and Sam’s Club and a $0 co-pay from the Humana Pharmacy mail-order network. Generics that are not on the preferred list have a $4 co-pay at Walmart and Sam’s Club (compared with a $20 co-pay at other pharmacies), and a $0 co-pay from Humana’s mail-order pharmacy. For nonpreferred brand-name drugs, you’d usually pay 45% to 50% coinsurance, but at Walmart and Sam’s Club or through Humana mail order, that drops to 35%. Advertisement If your plan doesn’t have a preferred pharmacy, or if you’re paying full price until you reach your deductible, you could save a lot of money by shopping around. Compare costs at local and mail-order pharmacies at GoodRx.com. (Don’t assume that mail order will be the best deal, says Rice.) Some generics cost less if you pay cash rather than use your insurance, such as the $4 deal at Walmart and Costco, says David Belk, of TrueCostofHealthcare.org. You can get discounts on 8,000 drugs if you use cash with the Walgreens card. More plans now offer specialty pharmacies for complex conditions. You may save money, and you’ll work with specially trained nurses and pharmacists who can complete paperwork for coverage and may know about resources for financial support, says Thom Stambaugh, vice president of specialty pharmacy for Cigna. Get Extra Help Even if your insurer covers the drug, you could face big out-of-pocket costs. And you will have to shoulder the full cost yourself until you reach your insurer’s deductible. But you might be able to piece together several sources of extra help. Ask your doctor and pharmacist about programs to help reduce the costs. Many drug manufacturers offer coupons that lower the cost of their drugs by hundreds of dollars. You can find coupons by looking up your drug at GoodRx.com or by searching the drug manufacturer’s website. Your doctor may also have coupons. Jeffrey Rice says his son was prescribed a medicine that cost $500 and, when his wife called the doctor to ask about alternatives, he gave her a coupon that cut the cost to $10. “The frightening thing is, this happens every day with medicines, and people don’t know,” Rice says. The manufacturer programs aren’t available to Medicare beneficiaries, and some coupons and programs are not available if you use private insurance, either. But if you haven’t met your deductible, you could pay cash for the drugs using the coupon, then submit the receipt after you are closer to meeting the deductible, says Rice. Or you may be eligible for a pharmacy assistance program offered by the drug manufacturer or a private foundation. Some of these programs are based on income, but the income requirements may be as high as 500% of the federal poverty level (which works out to nearly $80,000 for a couple). Other assistance programs may kick in if you’ve spent more than a certain percentage (such as 3%) of your income on out-of-pocket costs for your drugs, says Honora Gabriel, vice president of the Lash Group, which administers many assistance programs. Look up programs at www.needymeds.org. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries can get extra help, too; see www.benefitscheckup.org. Local or state nonprofits may offer assistance. You can find them through advocacy groups for your condition. Your doctor’s office may also know of assistance programs, and some large oncology firms have a financial navigator specifically to help, says Kirsten Sloan, senior policy director for the American Cancer Society. Finally, check out free prescription savings cards, such as FamilyWize.org and GoodRx.com. Make the Most of Tax Breaks Take advantage of tax breaks that can help with your out-of-pocket expenses. You can withdraw money tax-free from a health savings account or a flexible spending account to pay for prescription drugs (insulin is eligible without a prescription). And you can use your account for over-the-counter drugs with a prescription (see a list of eligible expenses at FSAstore.com). Any other drug costs can count toward the tax deduction for medical expenses, if you itemize. You can deduct eligible medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (or 7.5% of AGI in 2016 if you’re 65 or older). Know the Rules and Fight Back If your plan denies coverage for a drug your doctor prescribes, ask why. You or your doctor may only need to complete more paperwork. Almost all large employers now require prior authorization before covering certain expensive medications (requiring your provider to fill out forms about your medical condition) or use step therapy (requiring you to try other, less-expensive drugs first, if possible). Sometimes coverage is denied because the drug is not on the plan’s formulary. “More often than not, when something is not covered, there is an alternative that is covered,” says William Fleming, president of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. You can file an appeal if your doctor wants to use the drug that isn’t covered. Get the doctor to explain why the drug is necessary, says David Lipschutz, senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy. And find out about the appeal rules before you pick a plan, especially if you have a complex medical condition, says Sloan, of the American Cancer Society.

The Wal-Mart center emerged as the media staging area for Monday’s fire scene that startled many residents. Evacuations occurred for Schubarth Trail, the Farish area, Rampart Reservoir and Rampart Range Road, sough of Loy Creek. Fire rescue crews had to fight the blaze on foot due to the terrain. Several area department responded to the scene, along with members of the Colorado Springs Utilities. The fire was started southwest of the reservoir. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation. The firefighting efforts also were assisted by helicopters and air support for much of the afternoon. The blaze broke out shortly after 1:30 p.m. during a time of extreme fire danger, capped by high winds. Kirby advised residents to remain vigilant and keep posted of media reports. The fire didn’t threaten any homes in Woodland Park or the lower Ute Pass, but the area was flooded with emergency service and police vehicles. Despite a flurry of rumors, U.S. Hwy. 24 was not shut down. Fire officials contend that the conditions are ripe for a major blaze. Besides the Rampart blaze, crews had to combat the Junkins fire in Custer County.

Will Xiaomi’s plans to undercut Apple, Amazon, and Roku in the set-top box market succeed? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 17, 2016 at 8:41PM Xiaomi is one of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest rivals in the Chinese smartphone market, but the six-year-old start-up has only taken baby steps into the U.S. market. It launched a U.S. shopping portal for headphones, power banks, fitness trackers, and other accessories last year. Earlier this year, it declared its intentions to enter the U.S. smartphone market despite tough competition and concerns about saturation. But before taking that big step, Xiaomi is taking a swing at another market where Apple looms large -- set-top boxes. Xiaomi recently launched the Mi Box -- an Android TV box which comes with Sling TV, Pandora, and Vudu credit -- as its first major hardware push into the U.S. market. The device is currently available on its U.S. website and at Vudu parent company Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) stores. Image source: Xiaomi. Will Xiaomi gain a foothold in this market? At $69, the Mi Box is one of the cheapest 4K-capable streaming devices on the market. Roku's Premiere and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) second-gen Fire TV both stream 4K video, but respectively cost $80 and $100. The fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at $150, doesn't support 4K video. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Google Chromecast Ultra will support 4K streaming for $69, but it's a casting dongle (which streams content from a mobile device) instead of a full-featured Android TV box. While the Mi Box is competitively priced, it faces tough competition from entrenched market leaders. Strategy Analytics reports that the Chromecast controlled 35% of the global streaming device in 2015, up from 24% in 2014. Apple TV's share slid from 22% to 20% between those two years, while Fire TV and Roku both claimed 15% shares to tie for third place. The remaining 13% of the market was split among smaller players. Image source: Google. Xiaomi's biggest weakness against these bigger players is its lack of brand recognition in the U.S., where it's probably only known to tech enthusiasts. So to compete against Apple, Amazon, and Roku, Xiaomi could boost its marketing spend. But doing so could be tough since Xiaomi's last known operating margin was less than 2% in 2013 -- a figure which is probably now much lower due to the commoditization of the Chinese smartphone market. A smarter idea would be to co-promote the Mi Box with Wal-Mart, which would benefit from sales of set-top boxes pre-loaded with Vudu. Gaining more Vudu users might help Wal-Mart compete more effectively against Amazon Prime's sprawling digital ecosystem of streaming videos, e-books, cloud storage, and "frictionless" orders with Dash buttons and DRS-enabled appliances. Google, which would benefit from strong sales of the Android-powered Mi Box, could also be a strong ally -- the tech giant already promoted the device during the announcement of Google Home in May. Is Xiaomi really making a play for smart homes? On the surface, it seems like Xiaomi is just testing out the U.S. market with the Mi Box to see if it's suitable for a smartphone push in the future. But it could also be about establishing a hub for its other smart home devices. In the Greater China area, Xiaomi already sells smart home devices like smart TVs, air purifiers, water purifiers, smart LED lamps, and even rice cookers. These devices are all tethered together with its Mi Home app. The Mi Box would serve as a great central hub for all those devices. Xiaomi's Air Purifier 2. Image source: Xiaomi. Therefore, selling enough Mi Boxes into U.S. homes could pave the way for Xiaomi to bring its other smart home devices -- which are also sold on the same low-margin model as its smartphones -- to the U.S. market. Selling enough of those devices would make it a household brand, making it much easier to launch smartphones stateside. It's arguably a bolder strategy than Apple's game plan of letting other companies create HomeKit compatible gadgets, and more ambitious than Amazon and Google's dependence on data-gathering smart speakers and partnerships with other hardware makers. But it's still a long shot... Xiaomi might take a bite out of the streaming device market with its low-cost 4K boxes, but it's still a long shot due to the brand's low recognition. Newer smart TVs, which already run Android, could also greatly reduce demand for Android TV set-top boxes this holiday season. But despite those challenges, Xiaomi might surprise Apple, Amazon, and Roku if Wal-Mart heavily promotes the device during the holidays. If the Mi Box can help Xiaomi gain enough momentum in the U.S. market, more Mi branded devices might not be that far behind.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Our View: Walmart's investment in workers is paying off Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 8:46 PM Bulletin Editorial Board In business, sometimes you get what you pay for. That’s the lesson for Walmart, the ubiquitous big-box retailer which is trying to reverse a sales drop and improve its stores by breaking with the long tradition of paying its employees paltry wages. It’s too early to say much about the financial impact, but the move so far seems to be working, according to an analysis from the New York Times. And that suggests something for all employers: Paying your workers well, even above the going rate, and offering more in the way of training and advancement opportunities creates more loyal, hard-working and productive employees — and can actually boost profits, not depress them. A few years ago, less than 1 in 5 Walmart stores was meeting the company’s customer service goals. Customers complained that employees were scarce, checkout lines long, inventory disorganized and bathrooms dirty. Walmart, a public company for more than four decades, posted its first-ever annual revenue decline in 2015. About a year and a half ago, Walmart announced it would start paying workers who completed a training course to $10 an hour. Department manager pay improved from $12 hourly to $15. The company’s average nonmanagerial pay is now $13.69 per hour. At the same time, the company started building new training centers and made a push to create more predictable and flexible schedules to hourly employees. Now, 75 percent of Walmart stores are meeting customer service benchmarks. Sales are creeping up again. The real fiscal impact is yet to be realized, with income down 6 percent at Walmart’s U.S. stores in the last quarter — thanks in some part to higher wages and other investments — and its stock still underperforming. But the experiment suggests a basic truth about workers — that incentivizing us with better pay and opportunity tends to boost our happiness and performance, an idea economists call “efficiency wages.” And if the company’s slump turns around, we will have some evidence that that better performance can lead to higher profits — even though the operating costs are higher. Walmart being the largest private employer in the country, its practices and its fortunes can profoundly influence other employers. We are heartened that the company is starting to set a better example. That’s our opinion. What’s yours? Email letters@norwichbulletin.com.

Monday, Oct. 10 • Police pulled over a man for speeding on Genesee Street. The man didn’t have his license on him, and police found the man had a suspended license from 2013 for failing to pay child support. While conducting an inventory of vehicle contents, a small plastic bag, allegedly containing cocaine, was found on the floor behind the driver seat. Tuesday, Oct. 11 • A Wal-Mart employee was caught allegedly stealing cash from the register on two occasions. Wal-Mart provided security footage that reportedly proved theft on Oct. 9 and 10 from the 4975 Transit Road location. • A man was pulled over on Transit Road at Genesee Street for driving on the shoulder of the road. Police found the man’s license had been suspended three times from different incidents. Depew Monday, Oct. 10 • Police responded to the complaint of a broken down vehicle on Broadway near North Bryant Street. A woman’s vehicle was smoking, and fluids were leaking from the undercarriage; the woman was visibly drunk, reportedly failing field sobriety tests. Tuesday, Oct. 11 • An accident at Transit Road and Harvard Avenue involved property damage only. One of the male drivers was trying to turn onto Harvard Avenue from Transit when the other driver rear -ended him. Depew Fire was called to close the northbound lane of traffic and clean up glass in the roadway. • A woman’s ex-boyfriend broke into her home and stole brand new clothes purchased from Pac Sun. An associate from the store verified that a man returned the clothes that day for cash.

The parking lot was full of parents picking up their students from the Homecoming dance and it was difficult for the woman to identify which car struck hers. School cameras were unable to capture any footage of the accident. • Police responded to a complaint of criminal mischief that happened the night before. The man who called said he was “90 percent sure” an old boyfriend of his girlfriend smashed his truck’s rear taillights while it was parked at his home on Kibler Drive. When asked why he didn’t report the incident when it happened, the man said he didn’t want to bother police. Sunday, Oct. 16 • A female driver gave another woman a ride from a convenience store to the Walden Avenue and Burlington area, after which she noticed her cellphone and wallet were gone. After being given a description of the woman and knowing she lived in the area, police located her at a residence on Olanta Street. The woman reportedly told police that she stole the cellphone but not the wallet; police found the wallet in a closet and the phone under a mattress. (Editors note: The Bee’s police blotter is a sampling of unusual, sometimes humorous calls received by the police department. It is not intended to be a complete record of all incidents reported.)

This is especially true for those military personnel who have recently returned home and are in the process of transitioning back into civilian life. As the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart set out to showcase its military support with a $1.5 million donation to a well-respected military nonprofit organization, the Fisher House Foundation. Fisher Houses provide a home-away-from-home for military and veteran families whose loved ones are in a nearby military or veteran’s hospital receiving care. Walmart wanted to showcase its support for military members and their families during a holiday season that’s cluttered with philanthropic giving campaigns. To effectively accomplish this, Walmart and BRG Communications created a campaign that would rise above other holiday announcements and encourage more Americans to support military and veteran families in their communities over the holiday season. The campaign secured more than 700 national and local media placements, resulting in 31 million media impressions.

Walmart Launches Free Streaming Movie Platform — But Don’t Expect New Releases Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Launches Free Streaming Movie Platform — But Don’t Expect New Releases October 19, 2016 12:24 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler more streaming options Vudu Movies On Us vudu movies streaming ad-supported ADS walmart retail another movie streaming option Free Older Movies Users of Walmart’s streaming video service, Vudu, have been able to pay for TV shows and movies for years. Now, the retailer has launched a companion service that will provide customers with free streaming videos — if you don’t mind commercial interruptions and movies that are a few years old. Walmart announced Tuesday the launch of Vudu Movies On Us, offering customers thousands of (older) movies and TV shows to watch on-demand for free. The service, which is supported by advertisements, will focus on offering customers blockbuster titles and other classic films, so don’t except the latest releases to appear on Vudu Movies on US. “As part of the Walmart family, Vudu is always looking for new ways for customers to save money – and nothing is more affordable than free,” the company says in a statement. “Millions of customers already buy and rent content on Vudu on a monthly basis. This new service provides value for customers who want to watch movies and TV for free, when and how they wish to watch, without sacrificing quality.” TechCrunch points out that while Vudu might be courting some Netflix or Amazon Prime customers, its true competitors will be other free, ad-supported services like Yahoo View or Sony’s Crackle. Despite an abundance of other services on the market, including those that do include new releases, Walmart believes there are enough customers to go around, citing a Deloitte report that found over 42% of U.S. consumers prefer to stream content at home, most from ad-supported services. Walmart, of course, is no stranger to streaming services. In addition to purchasing Vudu in 2010, and offering discounted episodes Emmy winning shows earlier this year, the company has pushed “cut the cable” promotions. In June, the company launched a promo urging shoppers to buy products that focus on streaming services rather than traditional pay-cable.

The baby was not injured, according to the Kansas City Star. A woman was standing in line with her child when a man she didn't know walked up and started to choke the infant. Bystanders intervened and subdued the man until police arrived and arrested him, the Star said. The baby's mother, Quisha Hill, told Fox 4 in Kansas that she often shops at the Wal-Mart where the incident took place. "I come in to grab a couple items and while I was at the counter top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart, has my baby and he's like I'm taking the baby, I'm stealing her, I'm taking her," Hill said, according to Fox 4.

That's when several nearby shoppers wrestled the man to the ground. Hill said the child turned red for a few moments, but is expected to be fine. At one point, the man took the baby's car seat and put it over his head and tried to wear it like a hat, Hill told Fox. Police told the Star the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child," a spokesperson for Wal-Mart said, according to Fox. "We're appalled this happened in our store and we're working with police to make sure they have all the information they need."

The sticks felt clinical, complete with an "active ingredient" list on the packaging. If you wanted to go wild, you could skip the tasteless "original" flavor and spring for cherry or mint. But seven years ago, pastel-colored orbs of lip balm called EOS began to pop up everywhere. They took over shelf space at Walgreens, then Walmart, then Target. Beauty editors at Cosmo and Allure couldn't get enough of the stuff, raving about flavors like honeydew and grapefruit. And then Miley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera, and Kim Kardashian were spotted whipping balls of EOS out of their makeup bags. Products from EOS—the acronym for the company's full name, Evolution of Smooth—are splashed all over beauty and fashion magazines. But the company's founders haven't spoken about their business strategy until now. In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, they told us how they created a $250 million company that has, according to consulting and research firm Kline, become the second best-selling lip balm in the country, after Burt's Bees, and outpaces Chapstick and Blistex, which have been around for far longer. Kline Research says that EOS has singlehandedly driven growth in the oral care category. It currently sells over 1 million units a week and future prospects look promising, since the global lip care market is projected to increase steadily to $2 billion by 2020, driven by demand for natural and organic products, which is EOS's speciality. "Not necessarily building up information about it was something quite deliberate on our part," Sanjiv Mehra, EOS cofounder and managing partner, explains. Mehra points out that as a small startup, they wanted to focus all their attention on creating products and distributing them. "As we've grown, we believe that it is important for consumers to know a little bit more about the business we are and the values we stand for." Rethinking The Tube Nearly a decade ago, Mehra, who had spent his career in consumer packaged-goods companies like PepsiCo and Unilever, joined forces with Jonathan Teller and Craig Dubitsky, who had spent time at startup incubators, to think about how they could shake up the beauty aisle in the drugstore. (Dubitsky left before EOS launched to manage a new oral care company called Hello Products.) The lip balm category struck them as a prime candidate for innovation, since the vast majority of products on the market "were indistinguishable" from their 100-year-old predecessor, Teller says. Many brands appeared to be driven primarily by cutting costs and competing on price, he points out. "It appeared to us that everybody in this category was being lazy. That was an opportunity." Lip balm tended to be treated as a unisex commodity, like toothpaste or shampoo. But, as they did in-depth consumer research, they found that the product was overwhelmingly used by women as part of their beauty regime. On sensory panels, users they spoke to explained that they would lose lip balm tubes in their handbags. Many liked the idea of pots of lip balm that were entering the market, but they did not like to apply it with their fingers, because it seemed unhygienic. But one of their most important findings was that they did not find applying lip balm fun or enjoyable. "The products that women depend on every day should deliver moments of delight that elevate these daily routines," Mehra says. So they set about creating a product that would be tailor-made for women's everyday experiences, using their own funds and startup capital. (They still have not taken in external investment.) They wanted to rethink the lip balm format from the ground up, so they brought in a clay artist who modeled different shapes. "We were trying to to make the product as imaginatively as possible and not create an incremental variant over what was already in market," Teller explains. Even though they were coming up with a radically different take on the lip balm concept, they didn't want to make something that would be a fad. "We had to do it in a way that was not gimmicky, so that it would stand the test of time," Mehra says. "We had to make a product and a package that would be seen as useful for a very long time." In his mind, this meant that the lip balm had to be effective and consistently pleasurable to use, not just a wacky new addition to the lip balm aisle. In they end, they decided to think about how the product would engage all five senses, from soft round packaging that felt good in the hands, to the colors of the orbs, to the smells, to the way the flavors tasted, and even to the clicking sound the sphere makes when it closes. They would price the lip balm at about $3, so that it could compete on price with all the other drugstore lip balms, but they decided to use organic ingredients. (Earlier this year, some customers who had a bad reaction to the product brought a class action lawsuit to the company, but it was quickly settled out of court and EOS was not required to change any of its ingredients.) Throughout it all, they wanted to focus on creating an emotional connection with the user, rather than being simply another commodity. So they picked the tagline, "The lip balm that makes you smile." Big Dreams But it wasn't enough to create an innovative new product. How would a startup compete in a market dominated by giants like Chapstick, which is owned by Pfizer, and Burt's Bees, which is owned by Clorox? Mehra and Teller explain that it wasn't easy getting into stores. Mehra was himself familiar with the process, and they also hired an experienced sales representative. But buyers at drugstores and chain stores didn't know what to make of this new product. Many thought that customers were creatures of habit who were loyal to their existing lip balm brand. "There were a lot of male buyers out there who would say that they didn't understand the product," Mehra says. This makes sense, since the EOS team had carefully designed the product for female users. But then they were lucky enough to get a meeting with a female buyer at Walgreens who loved the little spheres. They landed their first account with her, and after the successful launch of the product, Walmart and Target later decided to sell EOS on their shelves. This brought them to their next big hurdle: To compete with the industry leaders, they would have to scale very quickly. They decided early on to invest in their own equipment, rather than relying on a third-party manufacturer. Mehra and Teller remember going to engineering trade shows to see how they could get experts to create machinery for them. Ultimately, they managed to create a production facility that is almost entirely automated from start to finish. This has served them well, since they were able to meet the demands of every new account they landed very quickly. Marketing To Millennials Besides getting products on shelves, the cofounders wanted to create a buzz around their new product. They decided that their target audience was millennial women between the ages of 25 and 35 who were style conscious. EOS advertised in the same ways that the older brands did, through magazine and television ads, but they also became experts at influencer marketing, which they believed was a smart way to reach their demographic. They contacted beauty bloggers who reviewed the product and talked about it on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. They worked with millennial celebrities to get the word out about the lip balm through product placements and endorsements. EOS appeared in Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears music videos, was a headline sponsor for Demi Lovato's world tour, and Taylor Swift became its Asian spokesperson. "We became the largest advertiser in our category," Teller says. EOS has also worked to build a large social media presence. It now has more than 1.8 million followers on Instagram and nearly 7 million followers on Facebook. A photograph of a new EOS flavor can get over 40,000 likes. Finally, the brand partnered with other major players on the market. It collaborated with Keds to produce an EOS shoe that came with a matching lip balm. It worked on a limited-edition holiday collection with designer Rachael Roy. It created an Alice in Wonderland collection with Disney that sold out in days and showed up on eBay for hundreds of dollars. (Some are still being sold, starting at $75.) All of this work has paid off. In seven short years, the brand emerged from an incubator to become a household product. It has even spawned a host of copycats. Blistex and Revo (made by OraLabs) have spherical lip balms that take a page from EOS's playbook, while Walgreens and Sephora have created their own iterations of it. These days, the company sells over a million lip balms a week, which is more than they sold in their entire first year in business. For all this success, the company is working hard to continue innovating. It comes up with new collections regularly, so that there is a constant stream of new products on shelves. EOS already creates shaving creams and hand lotions, but plans to enter new categories in the future. As Mehra and Teller look back, they believe that their unique backgrounds allowed them to take on a giant of their industry. Mehra, having worked at major corporations, understood the ins and outs of big business, while Teller was immersed in startup culture. Says Mehra: "That approach of using an entrepreneurial mind-set and big-company discipline is part of how we do things every day at the company."

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Police are investigating after a woman said a man tried choking her 4-month-old baby in the checkout lane of an Overland Park Walmart. Authorities said the incident occurred around 7:20 a.m. Wednesday at the Walmart near 75th Street and Frontage Road. According to officials, Oleh Zhownirovych approached the mother and child in the checkout lane. He then grabbed the baby out of the cart and tried to steal the child. A fight ensued, and Zhownirovych began choking the infant until the baby turned red. Bystanders were able to subdue the suspect and held him until police arrived.  Elliott Hurst was almost done with his overnight shift at Walmart when he heard cries for help coming from the front of the store. “Some of the associates were up there and they were hollering, ‘He got the baby, he is choking the baby,’ so me and the security guard went up there and tried to get control of the situation,” Hurst told 41 Action News over the phone. Hurst said the security guard got the suspect’s hands off the baby while he grabbed the car seat. “I don’t believe I done anything different than what my parents or my brother would have done,” Hurst said. “That’s the way I was raised.”  Police said the mother did not know Zhownirovych and that he may have been under the influence.  The infant was treated at the scene and is expected to be fine. Zhownirovych remains in police custody. Police offered some advice if you find yourself in a similar situation. "The first thing I would want someone to do is to scream for help. The more people around, the more people see what's going on. They can probably aid or assist you," said John Lacey with the Overland Park Police Department. Walmart released the following statement:  “Our main concern right now is for our customer and her child. We’re appalled this happened in our store and we’re working with police to make sure they have all the information they need.” Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the Overland Park Police Department at 913-895-6300.

While the rewards of running a family business can be great, there are significant obligations and risks that all family members should be aware of. Sam Burke Sam Burke Denton Record-Chronicle Published: 19 October 2016 05:51 AM Related Sam Burke Family businesses have an important place in America’s economy and our psyche. Family businesses (or businesses that start out that way, i.e. Wal-Mart, Berkshire Hathaway) not only make up a significant share of American businesses, they are tied up in our ideas about the best of the American dream. The benefits and rewards of working with and building something meaningful for your family are obvious. Locally, this ideal has found expression in businesses such as Gohlke Pools. While the rewards (financial and otherwise) of doing business with family can be great, there are significant obligations and risks that all family members should be aware of when deciding whether to run or own a business together. Historically, people who were in business together owed each other the highest duty recognized in civil law. This duty, which creates several obligations, is called a fiduciary duty. Fiduciary duties include the duty of loyalty, utmost good faith, candor, integrity and to refrain from self-dealing. If an allegation of a breach of fiduciary duty has been made, often the person who owed the duty largely shoulders the burden of proving that their conduct satisfied these duties. In the last few decades, there has been a movement to limit or remove these duties from business relationships, particularly between co-owners. For example, if your business is formed as a limited liability company, the duties that you owe to that business and the others who own or operate that business are governed by the Texas Business Organizations Code and the operating agreement of the LLC. These duties will depend on the position you hold in the company, the capital you contributed and your position in day-to-day operations. If desired, the obligations of any given member to the other members of the company can be very limited. For several reasons, the limitation of these obligations can be more difficult in a family business. One reason the limitation of obligations can be difficult in family business is that fiduciary duties can be created in multiple ways. Among them is a pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence. While the existence of a familial relationship does not automatically create this pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence, it is a factor courts will consider, and, as a practical matter, few family members will deny that a relationship of trust and confidence exists between them. The existence of that type of relationship can create fiduciary duties in a family business where ordinarily they would not exist. Also, during transitions of control from one generation to the next, additional complications can arise. As parents or other family members age and their ability to take care of their own day-to-day affairs is diminished, children or other family members often are given powers of attorney (or other written authority) so they can conduct business for their aging family member. Few people are aware that becoming an attorney-in-fact for a parent creates not only a fiduciary duty to the person you are authorized to act for, it also creates a statutory duty to account for every action that you take under that power of attorney. Imagine a situation where a family member who has been helping manage a family business and provide for significant health care has to account for all the actions they took under a power of attorney for a period of several years when they had no knowledge they had a duty to keep track. When this duty is not recognized and understood, it becomes very difficult and, at times, in the context of litigation, very expensive to account for the attorney-in-fact’s actions. A power of attorney or similar arrangement can create other duties that ordinarily would not exist in a business relationship. When well thought out, company agreements are designed to match the partners’ business objectives and contributions. For example, each partner’s obligations match their investment, desired participation in the business and the benefit they hope to receive from the business. However, family businesses at times are structured not with these business objectives in mind but as estate planning or asset protection tools. In this context, parents or grandparents are often identified in company agreements as having control of the business and as the individuals who will primarily benefit from the business, when in fact their responsibilities are limited or delegated to other family members. In such cases and during times of transition, without communication and planning, this can lead to a mismatch of power and responsibility. For instance, a child acting under a power of attorney might be assisting in operating the family business, but is a minority owner in the family business who does not stand to benefit (per the company agreement) from the business. When conflicts arise regarding the care of the parent or grandparent, whether it is time to take away car keys or to consider assisted living, these mismatches can create leverage that can lead to dangerous enabling of parents or grandparents or various types of litigation that can strain, if not destroy, family relationships. As with almost all problems, prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this case, prevention requires communication ahead of the stresses that create conflict. Family businesses deserve the place they have in the hearts and minds of most Americans. In most cases, they embody the best of the American dream. But, like all dreams, they can become a nightmare when communication fails or family members become motivated primarily by fear or self-interest. SAMUEL B.

The movie titles include critically-acclaimed films, family-friendly features, date night movies, thrillers, documentaries and more. They stream in full HD 1080p resolution, with Dolby Digital sound when available, and can be watched across smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and TV connected devices such as Roku, Chromecast and gaming consoles.

MST October 20, 2016 "Positive Pat" Brocco speaks to 12 News about the thril of being on "Ellen" and inspiring others to lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle like he has. (Photo: 12 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST AVONDALE, Ariz. - Pat Brocco lost 300 pounds just by willing himself to walk to Walmart for lunch every day. That willpower turned the man formerly known as "Fat Pat" into "Possible Pat" because he showed himself and others what's possible if you just put your mind to something. Brocco's story of inspiration landed him on "Ellen" last week, and now he's back in Avondale after his experience meeting Ellen Degeneres and receiving a $25,000 check from the show and Walmart to continue spreading his message of positivity. The life decision he made three years ago saved his life and gave him national attention to help others struggling with obesity around the country. "A lot of butterflies, being on 'Ellen,'" he said. "My first thing is I'm going to be doing a bodybuilding show in June. We can talk to people, give them nutrition ideas, workout ideas. No matter how far gone you are, you can take your body and your health to a place that you've never been." As for his motivation, he didn't have to look very far. "I didn't want to not be there for my kids. I didn't want to give up anymore. I wanted to finally make the change," he said. "Just the other day, I posted a picture of playing with my son on the floor. At 600 pounds, I couldn't do that. I couldn't bend down, I couldn't get up. It was hard for me just to walk, and I'm just so happy that I made the change because I know he's going to appreciate it. I know in the future, I might live longer to spend time with him, to watch him grow up, to spend time with his dad." He also said he's gotten positive feedback from those inspired by his story. "A lot of people have been reaching out to me through my social media," he said. "I had a guy tell me I helped him lose 100 pounds, that I'd saved his life." Check out Pat's Instagram page to see how he's doing. You can also find him on Facebook at Possible Pat and Twitter @ItsPossiblePat.

(Photo: Sunday Alamba / AP) The latest tech company to pique Wall Street’s interests is ... Domino’s Pizza? These days, almost every company — from Goldman Sachs to Wal-Mart — fancies itself a tech company. But for the first time in its history, Domino’s is bringing in more sales through smartphones, watches, virtual assistants and other digital channels than from diners walking into stores or phoning in orders. Fifty-five percent of its sales were digital in its latest quarter, compared with 20 percent for the restaurant industry, estimate analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shares in the world’s second-largest pizza chain rose as much as 8 percent Tuesday after it reported a 13 percent increase in U.S. sales in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The sales gains, while impressive on their own, are even more notable when compared to the restaurant industry’s meager performance. Year-over-year restaurant sales have fallen for five consecutive months, according to data from restaurant research firm MillerPulse. Slow sales and a rash of restaurant bankruptcies have stirred worries of a so-called restaurant recession. Wall Street has mostly been cautious about Domino’s because of its pricey valuation — it trades at a 55 percent premium to its peers in the Bloomberg Intelligence North American restaurant index. And its stock has gained 54 percent in the past year, compared to the index’s 14 percent decline. But in the past month, 63 percent of analysts covering the company have raised their price targets, according to Bloomberg’s tally. As I wrote in August, pizza chains tend to deliver in a restaurant recession — there aren’t many other ways to feed a family on $7.99, the price of a large, 3-topping pie at Domino’s. Plus, as minimum wages rise, pizza chains will take less of a labor-cost hit than other employee-heavy, sit-down restaurants. Some Wall Street analysts have also started to assign Domino’s tech-like stock-price targets based on the rapid growth of its digital sales. Domino’s is also asset-light like a tech company. Ninety-seven percent of its 13,000 restaurants are owned by franchisees, so it doesn’t have to spend much on buildings or store upkeep. Instead, it’s using its steady cash flow to invest in better technology and ratchet up dividends and buybacks. Domino’s has reformulated 80 percent of its menu since 2008 and is entering the second year of a loyalty program that has helped it command 15 percent of all pizza industry sales, up from 9 percent in 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. These turbo-charged sales are also attracting franchisees to build more stores. The company on Tuesday said it could add 1,000 more stores in the coming years. That growth translates into a steady cash flow for Domino’s in the form of royalties, transaction fees, and other franchisee charges — without the costs of brick-and-mortar stores. Domino’s will have to keep spending on technology and its supply chain to help franchisees. But its structure means it will get a much bigger bang for its buck than its competitors. 4 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2eOVFPX TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

 Walmart is now letting you stream a bunch of movies for free — with ads Nathan McAlone Oct. 18, 2016, 4:12 PM 10,091 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jennifer Lawrence's breakout movie, "Winter's Bone," is free. Juan Naharro Gimenez/ Getty Images Walmart's Vudu streaming service, which lets you rent and buy movies on-demand, has launched a free section that's entirely supported by advertising. Walmart has dubbed the section "Vudu Movies on Us," and it presents a no-cost alternative to heavyweights like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Though there are streaming services that offer totally free content, it's usually shows or short-form videos, not movies.  Vudu has stocked the free tier with "thousands" of movie and TV titles, but don't expect new releases. There are some quality titles in the catalog: "True Grit," "School of Rock," "Margin Call," "The Magnificent Seven," "Winter's Bone," "Hooisers," and so on. There are some awful movies in there too. But here's the thing: It's free. “Nothing is more affordable than free," Jeremy Verba, VP and GM of Vudu, said in a statement. And he has a point. Netflix has recently taken some heat for a lack of commitment to its older movie catalog. Netflix's selection of the top movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, seems to have gone down a substantial amount over the last two years. It's likely that getting great movies from the past few decades simply isn't the priority for a company pivoting hard into exclusive licenses and original content. And that's fine! But if you are in the mood for some older movies, don't want to spend a single cent, and haven't developed a distaste for advertising while binge-watching Netflix, then take a gander at Vudu's catalog. Just how many ads are we talking about here? "The ad load is pre-roll and mid-roll, so a few ads around 30 seconds before the content and a few breaks during," a Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider. Check out Vudu's free catalog here.

Updated: November 15, 2016 @ 11:55 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds Close AP Did Amazon Just Admit It Screwed Up Grocery Delivery Fees? newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Duprey) Oct 18, 2016 Amazon.com has lowered the cost of its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, while also implementing a monthly fee structure, indicating its previous annual payment program wasn't working out. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) doesn't make too many mistakes when it enters a market, but its new, lower pricing policy for its grocery delivery service is pretty much Jeff Bezos' way of saying he made a bonehead move. A prime reason to shop The e-commerce giant floored the supermarket industry last year when it implemented a $299 annual fee to get AmazonFresh groceries delivered to your door. Like its Prime membership program, customers were essentially paying delivery fees upfront rather than each time an order was placed. That stood the grocery delivery model on its head. Until Amazon's move, companies like Ahold Delhaize's Peapod, NetGrocer, FreshDirect, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) typically imposed nominal per-delivery fees, or if they offered an annual subscription the cost was much lower. Instacart, for example, charged $99 for its Express service.   What Amazon's higher annual fee did, however, was underscore the substantial costs involved in delivery -- and if a business didn't want to end up like Webvan or HomeGrocer.com -- which both went into bankruptcy -- it would need to cover its costs. Instacart subsequently raised its annual fee to $149. Of course, Amazon is also known for its willingness to forego profits in exchange for volume, preferring to build a critical mass before worrying about earning a return on its investment. The annual fee may have been recognition that not all businesses respond the same to that model.  Already past its prime But there are also limits to what a company can charge before it effectively prices itself out of the market, and that's where Amazon's new delivery fee structure seems to admit it was wrong. It's an indication not as many many people were taking advantage of the service because the cost was too high. It also shows that Amazon did a horrible job of explaining the fee when it first rolled it out. The new plan now makes clear that Prime members can have groceries delivered in available markets for $14.99 per month. Grocery delivery is not so simple as loading up the truck and ringing the doorbell. It's a costly model, which Amazon.com's original pricing structure tried to convey. Image source: Getty Images. While the original fee structure also included membership in Prime, it really wasn't communicated all that well, so the actual cost of the grocery delivery service was just $200. While that was still substantially higher than the competition, it may not have been as unsuccessful had Amazon simply explained it better. Grocery delivery is still a new concept to most, so shelling out a big chunk of change like that up front is a leap of faith for many. The new policy makes clear the online grocer didn't count on consumers balking at the cost. Not that the monthly fee really saves customers all that much over the original pricing -- it comes out to just about $279 a year when you factor in the mandatory Prime membership, but doling that out in smaller monthly payments is far more palatable. With tens of millions of households already having Prime memberships, $15 a month isn't a big hurdle to add on the convenience of online grocery shopping. A better way still? It's still a higher cost proposition than what rivals like Wal-Mart are offering, and the retail king still promotes picking up groceries at its stores for even greater savings, which is one of the competitive advantages Wal-Mart has over the competition. Its national store footprint serves as a sort of distribution center network for online sales, whether they're groceries or other goods. It didn't have to build out expensive DCs like Amazon needed to; its local stores already served the purpose. That may be behind Amazon's other big announcement that it is going to begin opening small convenience store-type formats that will sell produce, milk, meat, and other perishable items. But the C-store model is intensely competitive too, with even deep discounters like Dollar General expanding their DG Markets concept to feature fresh produce. Tweaking the model While online grocery shopping has been around for years, it's really only just starting to come into its own, so we'll see retailers making adjustments to the pricing model until the best one is found. Instacart, for example, is exploring having consumer goods companies pay a portion of the fee if customers buy their products. Bloomberg reports that couponing and advertising from these big brand companies now accounts for 15% of Instacart's revenues. Still, it's clear Amazon.com's original pricing structure wasn't the right one. It was an unforced error on its part, as an option for monthly payment could have been included at the start. Now that it has been rectified, we may see AmazonFresh become an even bigger threat to the competition. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Seventeen-year-old Rae-Showna Jones went missing on Dec. 17, 2015, and her mother, Charlena Poole, said she has prayed for her return every night since. On Tuesday, Oct. 18, Poole's prayers were answered when a detective from the Michigan State Police contacted her to tell her that Jones was found by Rio Rancho police wandering near a Wal-Mart. Mother speaks about missing daughter "I just screamed like I hit the lottery," Poole said. MSP Sgt. Jim Lang said that said police from Rio Rancho found out Jones was a reported missing teen after interviewing her once they encountered her at a busy intersection near a Wal-Mart. Poole said that officers told her that her daughter could've been a victim of human trafficking. Lang said that it is a possibility that Jones could've been a victim of trafficking but he wanted to talk to her first. "We want to see what she has been through for the last 10 months," Lang said. Rio Rancho Police Lt. Nicholas Onken said that he was not sure if Jones was a victim of human trafficking. Closure Twannie L. Gray, a therapist with Solutions Behavioral Health, 1010 N. Niagara, said that Jones' disappearance produced a high level of stress on Poole since she was not certain what happened to her daughter. "She didn't have closure for 10 months," Gray said. "She would come up with all of these scenarios but she persevered and stayed in counseling and kept her faith. She's happy right now." Poole faces another problem, though, with trying to get her daughter home. "They said it would cost me a couple of thousand dollars to get her back here if I went myself," Poole said. Poole has set up a GoFundMe account titled "Rae'showna is found!" to raise money to get her daughter home. "I don't want to leave her by herself," Poole said. Lang said that there is not currently a plan to get Jones back home. Onken said that his department was asked by Saginaw County to hold Jones while family members come up with a plan to have her returned to Saginaw. Poole said that she just wants her daughter home. "I just want to see her," Poole said.

What will replace them in N.J.? Print Email Erin O'Neill | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Erin O'Neill | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com NJ.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 18, 2016 at 11:06 AM, updated October 18, 2016 at 4:59 PM comments Retail real estate took a beating this year. The hits started in January when Walmart revealed plans to close more than 150 locations throughout the country. Sears joined the brawl in April when the department store chain announced it would close 78 Kmart and Sears stores. The bankruptcy of Sports Authority dealt another blow. The sporting goods chain shuttered all of its more than 460 stores this summer. Then retail giant Macy's made public it would close 100 locations by early next year. More department store closures are expected in the coming months. The result is a commercial real estate landscape that experts say could be unlike any we've seen before — and that could have major long-term ramifications for local communities.  "Certainly having large-scale retailers close is nothing new," said Neil Stern, senior partner with the retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle in Chicago. "The difference this time around is that there are not new retailers necessarily waiting in the wings to scoop them up." Pressure from online shopping and changing consumer habits have pushed retailers to downsize — or completely eliminate — their physical footprints, dampening the interest in a 40,000-square-foot or larger store like those left vacant by Sports Authority. Expansion in terms of brick-and-mortar stores, meanwhile, is being largely driven by just two sectors: off-price retail and dollar stores. Get a bird's-eye view of N.J. development over 80 years The curtailed demand by retailers for square footage — and the increasing number of store closures — has forced landlords saddled with large vacancies in shopping centers and malls to seek out new types of tenants to fill those massive, empty spaces. Go-kart tracks have replaced sporting good chains and indoor sports facilities have replaced department stores. Medical facilities and health clubs are also taking over spaces once dedicated to retail. Does that mean New Jersey will have a totally altered commercial landscape in the years to come? Is our era of endless shopping plazas lining our highways nearing an end? Maybe not entirely.  While Stern said that landlords will have to become "increasingly creative in finding tenants" on a national level, local commercial real estate professionals said big box retailers still consider the Garden State a worthwhile investment. There are examples in New Jersey of retail properties converted to new uses, including a former Kmart in Paramus now outfitted with turf fields for rent. But the state's wealth and population density still lure traditional retailers, experts said. "Thank goodness New Jersey has the strong demographics that we do," said Chuck Lanyard, president of The Goldstein Group, a Paramus-based retail brokerage firm. "The big box tenants are still looking in New Jersey." Still, the retail vacancy rate increased to 7.2 percent in July, up from 6.2 percent a year ago, according to a report from The Goldstein Group that was released on Monday. (The report tracks more than 4,250 properties on retail corridors in central and northern New Jersey. It doesn't track vacancies at enclosed malls.) Responding to this uptick in vacancy, Lanyard said: "We see this change to be short lived, minimal, and we expect considerable improvement in the coming year." Of the more than 460 Sports Authority locations that shuttered across the country this summer, 21 were in New Jersey, including a 50,000-square-foot store in Paramus at the intersection of routes 4 and 17, a prime retail location. North Plainfield-based Levin Management has been hired to find a new tenant for that property. Joseph Lowry, Levin Management's senior vice president of leasing and acquisitions, said "there's been really strong interest in that space from a lot of different types of users," including traditional retailers and entertainment-oriented tenants. "There aren't too many markets like Paramus," said Lowry, who expects to to have a tenant selected for that store in the next 30 days. Sports Authority shuttered this 50,000-square-foot store in Paramus, as well as 20 others in New Jersey, following bankruptcy. (Levin Management) Another likelihood is that many of the largest big box spaces will persist, but in newly segmented form.  R.J. Brunelli & Co. in Old Bridge is working on leasing a nearly 44,000-square-foot property on Route 9 in Manalapan once occupied by Sports Authority. Ron DeLuca, the chief executive officer of the retail real estate firm, said some of the former Sports Authority stores may be carved into smaller spaces in order to attract tenants, though he said there are tenants interested in the entire space in Manalapan. And while local experts expressed optimism about filling vacant commercial spaces in prime locations in New Jersey, they also acknowledged that many landlords of retail properties are trying to decide where and how they can make changes that will help adapt the properties to an evolving marketplace. Joshua Weinkranz, the president of the northeast region at Kimco Realty, a New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based company that owns and operates open-air shopping centers throughout the state and country, said online shopping has forced many landlords to change the way they market their shopping centers and diversify their offerings to include a mixture of retail, residential and office spaces. "That really is the way things are shifting now," he said. "The mixed-use projects are where people want to be, not only the retailers but the consumers and the people who live there." Although Weinkranz said his company doesn't have any projects underway now that involve adding a residential component to shopping centers in the northern half of the state, which he oversees, he said there are several new mixed-use projects in the state that they are considering. One major redevelopment effort already in the works in New Jersey, however, may provide a glimpse of what the future holds for malls and shopping centers throughout the state. Despite local opposition, Eatontown approved a zoning change in September that allows Kushner Companies to move forward with a plan to convert the Monmouth Mall into an open-air hub that offers retail, dining, entertainment and residential.  "It's no secret that traditional-style malls are struggling across the country, so we're really focused on delivering a fresh, modern project that will meet the needs of area residents for years to come," Jared Kushner said in a statement announcing the project in February. Whether landlords decide to try to lease a large vacancy as is, carve it up into smaller pieces or redevelop the properties entirely, all of them are working toward the same goal: getting empty space filled as quickly as possible.   As the property manager for the Middlesex Mall in South Plainfield — which is currently dividing up a former 81,000-square-foot Macy's store into two to attract new tenants — put it: "Any vacancy is not a good thing."

Figuring out the supply chain for a product made in secret was no easy task for Colorado entrepreneurs Inside the green rush By Brian Hutchinson   O Cannabis database Catch and release Inside the green rush Pot’s retail therapy The fame game Growing opportunities Black market to grey  DENVER, CO. — John Lord steps from his SUV and into his giant cannabis factory, near this city’s deserted stockyards. Cattle once dominated commerce in the Colorado capital, but marijuana is the prized commodity now. Before Colorado voters defied the U.S. government’s longstanding cannabis prohibition and amended their state’s constitution in 2012, making the drug accessible to any local resident or visitor aged 21 or older, Lord used the expansive warehouse to manufacture baby products. His child car seats were sold in major retail stores, such as Walmart, Target and Toys ‘R’ Us. Now he’s a pioneer in what’s being hailed as a lucrative “green rush.” And he’s got some advice for politicians and stakeholders in Canada, in their efforts to legalize recreational pot: Keep the rules simple, he says. Don’t over-regulate, or the whole effort might fail. All over Denver, one notices the sweet, pungent fragrance of pot. It’s not always the smell of marijuana being smoked, either. It’s the scent of healthy, growing plants. After Colorado’s recreational pot laws came into effect in 2014, Denver became a major marijuana production centre, with dozens of indoor growing operations. The marijuana trimming department at the LivWell facility in Denver. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Entrepreneurs have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into raising bushels of high-potency pot. A transplanted New Zealander, Lord grows what seems like an endless number of plants inside his 140,000-square-foot facility. He won’t divulge the precise number he has under cultivation at any one time — that’s a proprietary secret, says the diminutive businessman — but he claims there are enough to make his facility the largest licensed grow-operation in the entire United States. And it’s still not big enough. Lord is planning to expand his factory’s footprint by another 70,000 square feet. His is a vertically integrated, plant-to-sale operation. With the help of some 500 employees, Lord grows and then processes his green gold into dozens of different products. They range from perfectly trimmed dried flower (or “bud”) to powerful concentrates such as oils and wax, to cannabis-infused candies and chocolate. He is also making cannabis vaporizers — the discreet, smokeless devices are considered the new big thing in pot. Lord’s products are intended to give consumers a heady buzz or a relaxing body stone, known among aficionados as “couch lock.” Other concoctions derived from specific marijuana strains are meant simply to help induce sleep or relieve pain, without any psychotropic effects. His privately owned company, LivWell Enlightened Health, sells its home-grown cannabis from 14 retail stores it also owns and operates, in and around Denver. It also offers wholesale cannabis and custom-label edibles to retailers around the state. LivWell’s busiest shop, says one of Lord’s executives, sells US$200,000 worth of processed marijuana every week. “I underestimated the market when I first got involved,” Lord says. “I had no idea how widespread cannabis use is in society.” Other Denver-based entrepreneurs share the sentiment. A few miles south of the LivWell facility sits a nondescript, 10,000-square-foot former mini-blinds factory. It’s now a thriving grow-operation, one of several in a stable co-owned by former high school biology teacher Tim Cullen and Ralph Morgan, a former medical device salesman. Their cannabis venture, Colorado Harvest Company (CHC), produces about 700 pounds of high-grade marijuana every month. That’s a lot of pot, but not enough to supply their four retail stores in the Denver area. The company has to buy wholesale marijuana from other producers just to meet customer demand. Cullen and Morgan have expanded their operations—and their horizons. In addition to forming separate companies that produce high-potency cannabis oils and vaporizer products, they are looking at further expansion and investment opportunities. Annual revenues from all of their operations grew 1,200 per cent in 2014, another 400 per cent last year, and are now between US$50 million and $100 million, says Morgan. CHC has 80 employees, including five scientists with PhDs. And they’re just getting started. Marijuana is weighed at the Colorado Harvest Company facility. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Across the state, where the first legal, recreational marijuana stores opened on Jan. 1, 2014, revenues are exceeding almost everyone’s expectations. In 2015, total revenues from Colorado’s 432 licensed cannabis shops rang in at US$996 million. This year, that figure is expected to reach about $1.2 billion. State-imposed cannabis license fees and levies amounted to $135 million last year, a decent return for taxpayers. But don’t be seduced by the juicy figures. Running a successful, plant-to-sale marijuana conglomerate, even in free-market Colorado, is a high-risk, capital-intensive enterprise filled with legal requirements and regulatory hurdles that keep changing. Keeping in line with Colorado’s marijuana laws is a costly headache, Lord grumbles. “We employ 45 people in our compliance department alone,” he says. “Compliance regulations are the biggest barrier to entry in this business, and the toughest on the small, mom-and-pop operations. There have been 141 regulatory changes in the last year alone.” Cullen agrees that the rules could be less onerous. “Legalization was sold to voters as something to be regulated like alcohol,” says Cullen. “But it’s not even close. We have purchase limits, unlike alcohol, and pretty stringent advertising, packaging and labeling restrictions. All of our ingredients must be declared, including what’s been sprayed on the plant. The bar is set high.” Complicating matters even more is the state’s two-tier system, one for medical marijuana, the other for recreational pot. The state legalized marijuana for medical use in 2009, and continues to tax that product at a rate three times lower than the 22-per-cent rate applied to recreational pot, at the retail end of the supply chain. And at all times, during their cultivation, processing and sale, marijuana intended for the medical and recreational markets must be kept separate. Whatever their intended use, cannabis plants are notoriously high-maintenance. Vulnerable to pests, mould and mildew, they require a massive amount of care to reach their maximum buzz-worthiness. “We’re still learning how to improve something that people used to do secretly, hidden in a closet,” Lord says. “And we’re doing it on an industrial scale.” LivWell CEO and owner John Lord. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) At Lord’s cannabis factory, everything starts in a petri dish. LivWell uses a method of tissue culture to grow pot. Cannabis cells are extracted from selected female, flower-producing plants — there are countless varieties, or strains — and placed on a piece of gel. After one or two weeks, the fledgling plant is transferred to a more robust growth medium, a coconut-fibre mulch, and then into a nursery room. After more time there, the potted plants are placed in a warm, humid and brightly lit “spring” room. There they are fed a proprietary solution of water and nutrients, and receive 24 hours of light every day. Lord says his team has developed a highly efficient LED lighting system to replace conventional, high-pressure sodium bulbs, thus reducing his factory’s electricity bill by about 33 per cent. Even so, he spends a staggering $150,000 a month on electricity. Once the plants are a certain size and ready to flower, they are moved to yet another growing room, with heat and lighting systems set to mimic the cooler, shorter days of late summer and autumn. Large buds begin to develop; once they become full, solid and fragrant, it is time for the harvest. Over at CHC, the growing process is slightly different. The company eschews tissue culture and starts with simple plant cuttings, also known as clones. Like LivWell and every other licensed marijuana grower in Colorado, all of CHC’s plants have their roots in the black market — there was no other source for cannabis when the state legalized medical and recreational pot, so producers had to take genetic material such as cuttings and cells from what had been illicit weed. “We had to start somewhere,” shrugs Cullen. “The important thing is that every plant that’s grown now is in the regulated system.” Clone plants grow at the Colorado Harvest Company facility. Like every other licensed marijuana grower in Colorado, all of CHC’s plants have their roots in the black market. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Under Colorado’s new pot laws, all plants grown in licensed facilities are assigned and tagged with unique identification numbers, which are recorded and shared with state regulators. This allows them to be closely traced, from their brief incubation period through to harvesting. Processed products are also assigned tracking numbers. This “manifesting” procedure is meant to prevent marijuana and marijuana products from leaving Colorado and entering the black market. (None of Colorado’s immediate neighbours allow the cultivation and sale of recreational marijuana.) And of course, every marijuana plant and product meant for the medical and recreational markets is taxed by the state, through every stage of production. Manifesting allows regulators to keep close tabs on what is being produced, and on revenues generated through their sale. “We have to keep track of every frickin’ gram we produce,” Lord says. Even those parts of the plants that aren’t sold must be removed in a state-approved manner. Stems and so-called fan leaves — the large leaves below the flower — are collected after harvest and weighed. Then the waste is mulched and mixed with the used coconut-husk medium, then bagged and removed to local landfills, like regular trash. Producers can also expect random visits from various officials, such as fire, building and insurance inspectors. Potpreneurs such as Lord, Cullen and Morgan keep their facilities sparkling clean. Floors are bleach mopped every night, machinery is wiped down, and staff are instructed to keep themselves looking tidy. Lifecycle of a plant It’s the same story inside their retail operations. “Budtenders” receive several weeks of training before they start work behind the sales counter; they are expected to understand how their products differ, according to their strain and potency. They are also trained to give proper advice to customers looking for specific results. Retail competition is fierce. Local zoning regulations determine where recreational pot shops are located, which means they tend to cluster in certain areas. Along a strip of Denver’s busy S. Broadway corridor south of the downtown core, for example, 17 pot shops are squeezed into a mile-long strip. The Green Mile. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) CHC’s flagship store was among the first shops to open on the so-called Green Mile. “There was a three-hour wait to get inside, when we first opened in January, 2014,” recalls Cullen. The lineups are much shorter now, and non-existent outside the busy hours. But no matter the time of day, no matter the location, every potential marijuana customer in Colorado must provide identification before being allowed to enter a retail outlet and inspect any products for sale. In most stores, the selection and variety is impressive, the budtenders courteous and knowledgeable. As for the customers, there are all kinds. In little more than two years, Lord says, “marijuana has become normalized. I thought our typical customer would be a 20-something guy. But it’s a real melting pot. You’ll see a guy in a suit, then a guy in dreadlocks who will be holding the door open for grandma.” There’s something for everyone inside, he says. Lord likens his product range to the sort of beverage products one might find in a local liquor store. “From low-calorie soda to whisky, we’ve got it covered,” he smiles.

He was rushed into quarantine; doctors worried he was infected with the Ebola virus. His father wasn’t allowed at his bedside without a hazmat suit. Hours before, Morin was at his fiancée’s Whitby, Ont. home after work, where he smoked a bowl of pot, a daily routine for the drywaller accustomed to smoking at least four joints a day. He was overwhelmed by cold sweats, dizziness and nausea. He vomited uncontrollably for about two hours before his fiancée took him to the hospital. Morin had been in and out of hospital for years with similar bouts of being violently ill, which lasted for six hours at times. Doctors told him he suffered from stomach ulcers. He took medication and changed his diet, but it did nothing to stop the overwhelming spells that churned his stomach. “You instantly feel light-headed, like you’re going to pass out, and your stomach starts spinning like crazy,” Morin said. “I was so dehydrated … they couldn’t stick an IV in my arm because my veins kept collapsing.” As Morin lay in isolation in late 2014, doctors brought in a stomach specialist who gave him the diagnosis that would ultimately relieve his misery — he had cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. The condition has been detected in some chronic pot smokers who face the same periodic bouts of violent vomiting. Scientists don’t know for sure what causes the condition, but they believe that avoiding marijuana is the only cure, said Dr. Andrew Monte, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado’s school of medicine who has studied the syndrome. Morin initially balked at the diagnosis, having smoked for well over a decade, but he watched his symptoms disappear after he stayed off marijuana. Now, he has discovered other pot smokers who suffered through similar torment. Researchers haven’t identified how widespread the condition is across Canada, given that the syndrome is newly identified and not well understood, said Dr. John Foote, an emergency physician at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who has written about cannabinoid hyperemesis. He has seen roughly one case every month in the past two years, but says those who end up at emergency departments likely represent the tip of the iceberg. Emergency rooms at two Colorado hospitals have seen a doubling in the rate of patients with cyclical vomiting syndromes like cannabinoid hyperemesis, said Monte, who believes the spike is largely due to the state’s recent legalization of marijuana. Hospitals across Colorado now see several new cases every week. The growing prevalence of the debilitating condition was among several unexpected health effects of legalizing pot for medicinal and, later, recreational use, Monte said. In a two-year period, his hospital alone reported 31 admissions for marijuana-related burns, most of them caused by extracting Tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in marijuana known as THC, from plants using butane as a solvent. Twenty-one cases required skin grafting. Some burns covered 70 per cent of the patients’ bodies. Monte said the most concerning unexpected health effects have involved children who consume marijuana, mostly in edible products, by accident. Pot is often sold in chocolates, candies and other goodies that look attractive to kids who know nothing of the intoxicating contents. In the five years before medicinal pot was legalized, the Children’s Hospital Colorado had not treated any youngsters for mistakenly ingesting marijuana. In the second year of medical legalization, there were 14 cases. A THC chocolate bar. (Tyler Anderson / National Post) Across the state, the rate of children younger than nine being hospitalized for possible marijuana exposure has increased dramatically, according to a public health committee that has been measuring the impact of legalization in Colorado. There was roughly one case for every 100,000 hospitalizations in Colorado from 2001 to 2009, the initial period of medical legalization. The rate spiked to 13 cases per every 100,000 in 2014 through to June 2015, the first year and a half of retail legalization. Children who eat marijuana candy bars or cookies can develop pneumonia from a depressed central nervous system. Their heart rate can double normal levels to 200 beats per minute. They can become comatose. “A hundred milligrams in an adult may cause some hallucinations, may cause their heart rate to go very fast, which may be a risk, but it’s a risk in a subset of patients,” Monte said. “Every single paediatric patient shouldn’t have 100 milligrams, and that’s really only one cookie.” Monte said edible products should not be sold in retail pot shops, given the health risks. According to his research, edibles are responsible for most health care visits due to marijuana intoxication, for patients of all ages. Concentrations of THC in these products can vary wildly, while the effects can take hours to fully kick in. Users who don’t feel high shortly after eating a cookie may eat more, intensifying the effects when they peak. Overconsumption can lead to increased anxiety, rapid heart rates, high blood pressure and vomiting. In 2010, about 330 patients across Colorado were hospitalized with ailments where marijuana was believed to be a contributing factor, according to data published by the public health committee studying the effects of legalization. In the first six months of 2015, there were nearly 600 cases, according to the committee. “The problems outweigh the benefits in the recreational realm with edibles,” says Monte. In Washington state, where retailers began selling recreational pot in July 2014, calls to the poison centre for marijuana exposure have been on the rise, from about 160 a year before legalization to 270 in 2015. Nearly half the calls, 126 of them, involved patients younger than 19. Still, these calls account for a small percentage of the 63,000 total calls the poison centre receives each year. The number of pot-related calls is escalating, in part, because parents are not as worried about child protective services getting involved now that recreational use is legal, said Alexander Garrard, clinical managing director at Washington Poison Center. The public health committee measuring the effects of legalization in Colorado found adolescent and young adult users are at higher risk of developing psychotic symptoms or disorders in adulthood. The same committee also found substantial evidence that pot smoke contains many of the carcinogens that are in tobacco smoke, and that heavy pot smoking is linked to bronchitis, including chronic coughs and wheezing. Cody Morin, pictured above and at top, suffers from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. (Tyler Anderson / National Post) In Canada, those advocating legalization argue public health officials have a better chance of reducing these ill effects by legalizing and regulating marijuana than by keeping it in the illicit market. “We’ll know what’s in it and how it’s grown, what the strength is, and the product will be labelled. We’ll know who made it, who sold it,” said Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, medical health officer at Vancouver Coastal Health. He said regulations should also include childproof packaging and other steps to keep pot away from children. “If there are problematic products out there, then we’ll have them withdrawn off the market. People used to go blind from drinking moonshine; that doesn’t happen anymore. We have to get safe products out there that people can use safely.” At Vancouver’s annual 4/20 pot rally, which draws thousands of users, health officials typically deal with dozens of patients who ingested too much pot. Lysyshyn said these users have usually eaten products without knowing the concentrations or how much to eat. Under a legalized regime, he said, there should be labels on THC contents, and users will become more used to edibles. Reports of pot-related hospitalizations linked to pot use are often met with disbelief on web forums for marijuana users, but the adverse effects are real, said Allan Bays, the grow manager at a pot dispensary in Denver who has been diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Bays continues to smoke, despite his crippling condition, because he loves it and finds relief from migraines. He believes he has been able to control his symptoms by maintaining a healthy diet and exercising, although he still suffers through bouts of vomiting every couple of months or so. “I believe in facts and truth, not in misinformation. The harmful effects of marijuana are well-documented,” he said. “I’m in big favour of marijuana becoming legalized nationwide, but you have to be aware of those effects.” Postmedia News • Email: rsouthwick@postmedia.com | Twitter: ReidSouthwick Catch and release Inside the green rush Pot’s retail therapy The fame game Growing Opportunities Black market to grey © 2016 National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.87 +0.38 +0.54% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.61 +0.90 +0.85% Papa John's International Inc PZZA ▲ 85.13 +0.53 +0.63% Domino's Pizza Inc DPZ ▲ 160.16 +2.99 +1.90% More CEOs are raising their public profiles, speaking out on issues and appearing in ad campaigns, but it remains an unusual move for the world’s largest retailer. In what is believed to be a first, Wal-Mart cast a CEO in a commercial that aired on social media and television for about three months through the end of September. The ad, starring Mr. McMillon, touts the company’s commitment to employees, not the latest deals. Putting top executives in advertisements can build credibility for companies and rally staff, but it can be risky—highly paid executives may garner little sympathy, and some lack the charisma for the job. In cases where the CEO is central to the brand, as with ousted Men’s Wearhouse founder George Zimmer, the company can be left scrambling after that leader leaves. Mr. McMillon’s 30-second spot is part of a wider push by the retailer to shed perceptions that it offers little more than low prices and low-paying jobs, labels that have long dogged the company. “I’m Doug,” he says in the ad, surrounded by produce in one of the company’s stores near its Bentonville, Ark. headquarters, flipping through photos of employees on his Instagram account. “Here at Wal-Mart we are committed to taking care of the people that take care of you,” he tells viewers. The ad ran this summer during “Fox and Friends,” George Lopez and SportsCenter, as well as on Facebook and Instagram. Wal-Mart declined to say how much the ad campaign cost.© Adam Jeffery/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Dan Bartlett, Wal-Mart’s vice president of corporate affairs, conceived of the campaign with his team, say people familiar with the process. The “reputational ad” highlights Wal-Mart’s promise to invest $2.7 billion in higher wages and employee training. An “associate CEO” who started his career in a Wal-Mart warehouse in 1984, Mr. McMillon is a natural to deliver a message aimed at employees and policy makers, Mr. Bartlett said. As CEO since February 2014, Mr. McMillon has raised store employee wages and is building hundreds of management-training academies. Executive pitchmen came into vogue after Chrysler ran memorable ads in the 1980s featuring CEO Lee Iacocca asking shoppers to give the embattled brand another chance. Some companies such as Papa John’s International Inc. featured its CEO in nearly every ad; Apple Inc. recently nodded to its rabid fans by casting Senior Vice President Eddy Cue and other executives alongside late-night host James Corden in an Apple Music TV commercial. Nonetheless, most executives have preferred to remain in the background, unwilling to appear publicity-hungry or risk drawing negative attention to themselves, according to Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at communications firm Weber Shandwick. In the age of hyper-sharing on social media, “everything is different,” she said. Mr. McMillon’s actions on wages and his consistent focus on employees make him a plausible pitchman, Ms. Gaines-Ross said. CEOs generally appear in ads for two reasons: to build credibility or to acknowledge a mistake, says Pradeep Chintagunta, a professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In a 2010 Domino’s Pizza Inc. ad, President Patrick Doyle discussed customer complaints about artificial-tasting pizza with cardboard-like crust and vowed to improve its food. Many customers appreciated his candor, Mr. Chintagunta said. Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton famously believed that his company didn’t need to court elites. But as the retailer grew to the world’s largest company by revenue, scrutiny on its dealings intensified and leaders changed tack. Mr. McMillon in particular has embraced a public profile, posting often to his Facebook and Instagram accounts. It is unlikely that Mr. McMillon’s ad changed many viewers’ minds, says Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, a firm that measures the impact of video advertising and doesn’t work with Wal-Mart. “You have a lot of people who are sensitive to Wal-Mart and labor issues that just didn’t buy into this guy,” questioning his high salary in survey comments, he says. Ace Metrix, which tested the Wal-Mart ad, surveys 500 viewers for each ad tested. (Including stock awards, Mr. McMillon earned $19.8 million in fiscal year 2016 which ended Jan. 31, 2016.) Wal-Mart always will have critics, but employees and policy leaders responded well to the ads, according to Mr. Bartlett. They liked that “the CEO is going on a TV and saying it’s a priority,” to support workers, he said, adding that the company has no plans to put Mr. McMillon in future ads. Google searches for ‘Wal-Mart CEO salary,’ spiked during the summer when the commercial aired to the highest levels since Mr. McMillon was announced as chief executive. Searches for ‘Wal-Mart CEO’ and ‘Doug McMillon’ also rose. He gained about 10,000 followers on his Instagram account, where commenters call him “commercial guy.” Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The Wall Street Journal Harlem se perfila como el próximo enclave del mundo del arte The Wall Street Journal.

Lauren Rohr | Staff Photographer   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     East Dundee may soon serve as a hub for Turkish companies hoping to expand into the U.S. Working with the Turkish government, a group of investors is considering acquiring land in the village to create a Turkish Trade Center -- a project that aims to improve trade and business relations between the two countries, said broker Emin Tuluce of Seven Hills Properties. During a presentation to the village board Monday, Tuluce said the group is interested in redeveloping the former Wal-Mart property, a roughly 12-acre parcel at 620 Dundee Ave., as well as adjacent land belonging to Plote Construction, Inc. The trade center would include new industrial buildings with warehouses, office space, employee training opportunities and showrooms, Tuluce said. The group would also likely retrofit the Wal-Mart building to their needs, he said, and a hotel, restaurants, a bank, retail shops and other commercial space to complement the industrial facilities. Roughly $50 million would be invested in the Turkish Trade Center, which is largely funded by the Turkish government, according to the project proposal, and hundreds of employees would be hired. Eray Utucu, Tuluce's associate and managing director of EVE Group Companies in Chicago, has spent the past four years helping more than 400 Turkish manufacturers and other businesses expand into the U.S. With the trade center project, he said, he wants to create a place for those companies to share resources, work with American corporations and thrive in the Chicago market. "The idea is to bring their U.S. headquarters here," Utucu said, noting all companies involved must be approved by the Turkish government. "That's our intention." He added investors may seek incentives from the village to assist with site acquisition and preparation. A temporary Turkish Trade Center has already been established in a rented space in Elk Grove Village, Utucu said, allowing the group to begin building its portfolio. When the five-year lease is up, he said, those companies would move to the permanent site. Other locations, such as Bolingbrook, Romeoville and some towns in Cook County, are also being considered for the permanent trade center, Utucu said. Tuluce, who has other investments in the village, said East Dundee is ideal because of its proximity to I-90 and O'Hare International Airport. East Dundee trustees welcomed the concept, and Utucu and Tuluce said they would continue discussions with the village and Plote before making a final decision next month.

By Catherine Lindsay October 17, 2016 An off-duty trooper and a police officer resuscitated a man suffering from a “massive heart attack” outside a Walmart Friday in Epping, New Hampshire. Around 3:30 p.m. Friday, trooper Christopher Prenaveau was exiting the Walmart when he observed a crowd gathered and a man on the ground who seemed to be in some sort of distress, New Hampshire State Police said in a statement. Prenaveau discovered the man was lying unconscious, was not breathing, and had no pulse. State police said a witness to the incident was on the phone with 911 receiving CPR instructions. The trooper began CPR on the man, whose identity will not be released, and told the witness to continue providing information to the 911 operator, according to the statement. Epping police then arrived to assist Prenaveau. Advertisement Officer Donald Ross took the automated external defibrillator (AED) out of his cruiser and he and Prenaveau used it on the man. They managed to regain a pulse by using the AED and administering CPR, state police said. The man was taken to Exeter Hospital, where he was treated for a “massive heart attack,” according to the statement. He was still at the hospital as of Sunday but is expected to make a full recovery. State police said Prenaveau had only received “First Aid” training, including CPR, a few weeks ago. TOPICS: Local News Want to see what readers are saying about our stories?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Azusa man accused of Hesperia Wal-Mart stabbing held on $1 million bail Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 11:30 AM Oct 17, 2016 at 5:53 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero HESPERIA — A 31-year-old Azusa man arrested after authorities say he stabbed a man in a motor home in the Wal-Mart parking lot Saturday was being held in lieu of $1 million bail, booking records show. If criminally charged, Darrell Lee Garrett is expected to be arraigned in a Victorville courtroom Tuesday afternoon. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies arrested Garrett on suspicion of attempted murder after responding to the Wal-Mart at 13401 Main Street at approximately 1:51 p.m. Saturday. Authorities said Garrett was found and apprehended inside the business. An 8-year-old boy related to Garrett was also inside the store, authorities said. A deputy was injured during an attempt to apprehend Garrett. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jodi Miller said the deputy was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and was released later Saturday. The boy was taken into custody by Children and Family Services. Authorities found the victim suffering from a stab wound and he was transported to a local hospital. Miller also said that she did not have an update on the victim, but his condition on Saturday was stable. “His injuries were not believed to be life threatening,” Miller said in an email Monday. The store was temporarily evacuated. A witness previously told the Daily Press that a crew cleaned up what appeared to be blood at the store's entrance and near the motor home. Garrett was being held at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, booking records show. Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com.

The signs will provide information about a planned bus system that will transport Hermiston residents for free around town five days a week starting Jan. 2. It will be operated by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation’s Kayak Transit program as a contract with the city of Hermiston. Assistant city manager Mark Morgan said the transit advisory committee, which is helping to plan the bus system, hopes the signs at the proposed stops will work to draw feedback on the route and times before the committee submits a final recommendation to the city council on Nov. 14. The committee will meet one more time on Nov. 1 at 5 p.m. at city hall, and members of the public are encouraged to attend. “If they have any heartburn about it, we want to hear it at the Nov. 1 meeting,” Morgan said. The advisory committee met Tuesday and traveled the initial route the CTUIR put together, making suggestions for minor adjustments. The tribes plan to incorporate those suggestions before handing the city a map to publicize on its website and the proposed bus stops next week. Without those adjustments, the proposed route includes 35 stops around town and takes about an hour to complete one circuit. Stops include Wal-Mart, Blue Mountain Community College, Hermiston Plaza and Good Shepherd Medical Center, as well as multiple stops along major streets like NW 11th Street, NE Fourth Street, Main Street, Orchard Avenue and Highland Avenue. A city survey offered two options for bus route times: continuously from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. or in two chunks of time in the early morning and late afternoon for commuters. Seventy four percent of respondents preferred the 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. option, and Morgan said after further review it looks like the tribes will actually be able to offer the route from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and complete six circuits through town each day Monday through Friday. “We’re pretty excited to be able to increase that,” he said. Survey respondents also indicated that the “north shopping area” encompassing Wal-Mart and Fiesta Foods was their top priority for stops, followed by Good Shepherd Medical Center and the surrounding health clinics. Even after the bus route is up and running, Morgan said CTUIR assesses its transit and makes adjustments to routes and times quarterly, so it won’t be “set in stone.” “By no means are we saying this is a perfect route or perfect times,” Morgan said. “Everyone’s going to have their opinions. There are a thousand ways you can draw a route in town.” Although the city is helping fund the bus system, it plans to continue to also fund the taxi ticket program for senior and disabled riders. ——— Contact Jade McDowell at jmcdowell@eastoregonian.com or 541-564-4536.

That discovery came after police were called to unconscious woman on a bus in Alpena. State Police Troopers were called to an Indian Trails bus in the Walmart parking lot on M-32 in Alpena Township on Tuesday. Troopers found a 21-year-old woman from Flint was overdosing on heroin that may have been laced with fentanyl. Another passenger, a 21-year-old woman from Detroit had heroin in her possession. Police say she admitted to delivering it to the victim, causing the overdose.  She also had valium, needles, and paraphillia, including a crack pipe, in her possession. The victim was taken to Mid-Michigan Medical Center after EMS personnel administered (nal-ox-one) and took other life saving measures.  While at the hospital, officers found the victim also had marijuana and valium in her possession. The suspect was arrested on several drug related charges including delivering heroin, possession of heroin, and an outstanding felony warrant. Delivery of heroin is a felony punishable by up to 20-years in prison and a $25,000 fine. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Local Antique Store Celebrates 30 Years in Business A Center For Healing Private Wounds Help for Women When They Need It The Basics of Carbon Monoxide Safety New Playground Coming To Traverse City The Power of Grandmothers State News DNR Has Tips for Hunters For 2016 Rifle Season Lake Erie Designated as Impaired Nearly $1 Million Awarded to Innovative Health Projects Across the State New Bill Increases Penalty for Riding Motorcycle Without Endorsement Forest Says Huron-Manistee National Forests Open to Hunting this Season New MSP Troopers Graduate From Academy in Lansing World News NHTSA Adds New Sound Regulations for Hybrids and Electric Vehicles RECALL – Kidde Nighthawk Recalls Millions of Smoke Alarms Colorado Votes on Doctor Assisted Suicides Four Cities Pass Taxes on Sodas and Sugar Sweetened Drinks Nine States Vote on Legalizing Marijuana Washington D.C.

They also coincide with news of mono introducing monoONE, a more flexible model for working with clients. The agency did not attribute the layoffs to the new model rollout; in fact, mono tells us that the model has been in the works for about a year since founders Michael Hart, Chris Lange and Jim Scott “came together to find a creative solution to evolving client needs and the current marketing landscape.” An alternative to the ongoing AOR relationship, monoONE is a one-year commitment, during which time the agency will provide a dedicated senior team to work with clients on strategy, design, communication and content development for a brand launch or re-launch. The agreement also includes the development of “a transition plan and brand guide, so during the final months, the work can effectively be taught and handed off to the client to be executed in-house or with specialty production houses to help reduce client budgets in year two, three and beyond.” The new monoONE model will not replace the agency of record model but rather act as an alternative. “While our primary way of working with clients will still be on an AOR-basis, monoONE is part of a model for continuing to create transformative work for our clients, but within a new and inventive relationship structure,” explained a mono spokesperson. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

In both instances transfers are made by the victim handing over the card’s registration number.  The iTunes scam has even led Apple to issue a global warning on its website urging people not to give the number to someone they do not know.  The IRS has been warning about identical scams for a few years with reports in US media that such schemes might have been operating out of India.  In January, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said it was aware of more than 5,000 victims who had paid a total of more than $26.5 million in such scams since October 2013.  “It is one of the biggest fraud cases to surface in recent times in Mumbai,” Parag Manere, Thane police deputy commissioner, said, adding that the ringleaders found willing recruits.  “Hiring was easy. They just gave out pamphlets about job openings and received applications, mostly from school or college dropouts,” said Manere.  Commissioner Singh said ringleaders “lured youngsters with good working knowledge of English and trained them how to speak with an American accent.”  Police believe the recruits were paid 30,000-70,000 rupees a month, plus commission. Some made the initial calls while others were employed to “close” deals.  They would work through the night to catch Americans during their day and sometimes left threatening voicemail messages if their targets didn’t answer the phone, it is alleged.  A victim of a similar-sounding scam told NBC last year the caller had her “so frightened” but felt “embarrassed, guilty and ashamed” when she realized she had been swindled.  Singh said Thane police knew of 2,000 people suspected of involvement in the scam, but the force believes there are more, and is working with their counterparts in neighboring Gujarat state and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Police in Ahmedabad raided more than half a dozen call centers following the Thane operation, a senior crime branch official said, while searches were also carried out in the Gujarati cities of Bhuj, Surat and Vadodara.  Police are desperate to find alleged mastermind Sagar Thakkar, known as “Shaggy,” who is from Ahmedabad but may have fled India, possibly to Dubai.  Thakkar had half a dozen people working for him in the US and was preparing to expand operations, according to the Ahmedabad officer. “He was planning to set up five more call centers by December,” he said.

Officers determined he was drunk and he admitted he had been drinking since 10 a.m. and was most recently at Cork N' Bottle. They told him to call someone to pick him up, but he refused, insisting he would walk home. He was unable to stand on his own and could not care for himself. While being returned to the station, he threatened officers and told them he was going to sue the police department and take their houses. Aggravated robbery, Mayfield Road: The Huntington Bank, 6341 Mayfield Rd., was robbed around 12:15 p.m. Oct. 7 by a male suspect, who left with an unspecified amount of money. He handed a teller a note on a withdrawal slip, which stated, "this is a robbery give me the money." He did not indicate he had a weapon and one was not seen. Officers did not locate the suspect, but found a stack of money covered in red dye in the parking lot, just east of the driveway to the bank. The incident was turned over to the FBI to investigate. An arrest warrant has since been issued for a suspect. Impaired driving, Mayfield Road: Around 2:45 a.m. Oct. 8, officers saw a man exit a vehicle in the Circle K parking lot and begin to walk behind the building. They spoke to the driver of the vehicle and she said the man was her boyfriend and he was going to buy cigarettes. Officers detected an odor of alcohol on her breath and the Willoughby woman, 29, was subsequently arrested for OVI after taking sobriety tests. The man later said his behavior looked suspicious because he was planning to go behind the building to urinate until he saw an officer approaching. He had someone respond to pick him up and bring him home. Traffic offense, Ridgeview Road: Officers suspected a man of being involved in a drug deal in the Walmart parking lot Oct. 8 and stopped his vehicle shortly after when it appeared his registration was expired. There was no evidence of any involvement in a drug deal, but he was found in possession of marijuana and initially lied to officers about his identity. The Moreland Hills man, 25, was subsequently charged with falsification, drug possession, driving under suspension and driving on prohibited through traffic streets. He said he lied about his identity because he was nervous and knew his license was suspended. When he was being taken to the station, he became agitated and told the officer he was going to sue him and the department and he was only pulled over because of his race. It was also confirmed he had renewed the vehicle's license plates that day, but officers advised it could take 24-48 hours to update in the BMV system, especially on weekends. Impaired driving, Mayfield Road: A Cleveland woman, 22, was arrested for OVI and driving under suspension after she was pulled over at 2:20 a.m. Oct. 10 for speeding. Suspicion, Bonnie Lane: Officers checked the area at 7:43 p.m. Oct. 8 for a report of three males in clown masks chasing cars. They were unable to locate them. General assistance, SOM Center Road: A man, 34, reported at 4:52 a.m. Oct. 7 he was having a problem getting a woman to leave his apartment after they went on a date. He called an Uber driver, but she left that ride and returned to his apartment. Responding officers spoke to the woman, 20, who said something physical happened at the apartment, but she would not elaborate and did not want to seek charges. They dropped her off at an RTA bus stop. Harassment, Lander Road: A boy said Oct. 7 two males in clown masks pushed by him and his ten-year-old brother while they were walking home near Lang's Marathon around 11:30 p.m. He said the suspects ran towards the back of the Staples store. Officers spoke to the boy's mother, who asked for special attention to the area. She felt the suspects were just trying to scare her children. Theft from auto, SOM Center Road: Officers responded to the Coppertree apartments parking lot around 9 a.m. Oct. 7 after someone reported finding a wheel and its tire had been removed from her car. A brick was left in its place and the lug nuts were also left behind. Three more vehicles were then located in the parking lot with their tires and wheels missing in similar fashion. One vehicle had two wheels and tires removed from it. There were no suspects identified. See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

October 19 AAPL: 117.12 -0.35 Comment: Apple Pay is available at more places than ever, but key opportunities remain Zac Hall - 4 weeks ago @apollozac Apple Pay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I absolutely love using Apple Pay to checkout in stores. Swiping a debit or credit card isn’t too inconvenient but it’s not the most secure way to pay, and new chip terminals in the US are frustratingly slow and unreliable. I use Apple Pay from my Apple Watch whenever possible, and I’m a serious advocate for the payment service among my family and friends with iPhones. Two years since first launching in the US, Apple Pay is an option at lots of payment terminals all across the country, but you still can’t assume contactless payments like Apple Pay will be supported. It’s still necessary to carry your debit or credit card (or cash) just in case. So we’ve looked at the biggest categories of businesses that still aren’t ready for contactless payments in the US and reached out to a few of the biggest holdouts to ask why they’re still resisting. We’ve also looked at some of the categories that people still want supported to see how things are progressing. When Apple Pay launched in October 2014, there were about eight bank partners and 220,000 terminals ready in the US. Now Apple Pay is supported by hundreds of banks and in February over 2 million businesses were accepting contactless payments. Apple Pay has also expanded to 10 additional markets outside of the United States with more coming soon. Two years ago, I could use Apple Pay at my local McDonalds, Walgreens, Subway, and a local drug store. Apple Pay was easier to use in large cities with more stores than small towns with a handful of businesses. Now I can use Apple Pay at plenty of local businesses thanks to the adoption of contactless payment terminals. Now places where I regularly shop like Best Buy, Khols, Nike, American Eagle, Starbucks, Ulta for my wife, one of the two nearby movie theaters, Chick-Fil-A and plenty more officially support Apple Pay, so my usage has increased. Walgreens even lets you use their loyalty card with Apple Pay; the cashiers are usually grateful that they don’t have to scan yours or ask you to type in your phone number. A local ice cream shop in my town that uses Square recently upgraded to the new contactless reader which enables Apple Pay support, and my local grocery store (a two store chain called Jerry Lees) knows about and accepts Apple Pay. I wrote about the awkwardness of Apple Pay sometimes failing two years ago; when the cashier at my local grocery store actually suggested I pay with my watch that stigma was broken for me. Some people are still impressed which is fun, but for a lot of people it’s just the new normal which is even better. I jokingly tweeted a few weeks ago that Apple Pay has officially gone mainstream when I noticed the place where I get my haircut taping a sign about not accepting Apple Pay on their terminal. Clearly enough people asked and expected to use Apple Pay that a sign was necessary. Apple Pay is also available at almost all places with the contactless payment logo even if there isn’t specifically signage for Apple Pay. The EMV contactless symbol looks like four waves, a small square, a hand, and an oval. When you see this, it means you can probably use Apple Pay (although a few places like CVS manually disable Apple Pay). You can also find Apple Pay in iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch apps and even on the web from iPhone, iPad, and Mac on a growing number of websites. Apple Pay is in a lot more stores today than two years ago, but you still can’t totally replace your debit or credit card with it. Apple regularly works with banks and credit unions across the country to add Apple Pay support and now nearly all banks are supported. But readers often tell us that they want to hear about new businesses accepting Apple Pay too. Flipping that switch is a much bigger task for businesses — it involves replacing payment terminals for one — but some businesses have contactless-ready terminals and block Apple Pay or have chip reader terminals that don’t work with contactless payments. I posed this question on Twitter yesterday: What are the top three places where you’d want to see Apple Pay accepted if you could flip a switch? The responses were very helpful in understanding where the biggest opportunities for Apple Pay adoption exist. The first four were the most popular responses by far with the other results getting a mention or two: Regional grocery store chains Target Walmart Gas stations at the pump Local shops Laundry machines Bus fare Restaurants (split billing, tips, kiosks on tablets, all sit down restaurants) Doctor’s offices CVS In-N-Out Burger Parking meters ATMs Vending machines At least one person responded to say that they’re still waiting for their US bank to support Apple Pay, and people in Spain and Germany said they just want support in their countries. Several people in Canada responded to say the question didn’t really apply to them because Apple Pay is generally accepted everything. I agree with all of the responses above plus the people who said generally anywhere cash is accepted or where credit card readers are available. Solutions like Square’s contactless card reader (and competitors) help make that possible for almost any business. I would also add drive-thrus to the list: plenty of Apple Pay fast food chains don’t properly support drive-thru windows. Let’s look at a few items on the list starting with gas stations. Chevron has said it is planning to accept Apple Pay at the pump but I can report that this hasn’t extended to my neck of the woods yet. Texaco under Chevron is also listed as an Apple Pay partner, but my suspicion is that some of these terminals are found inside and not at the pump. Paying for gas with a card is more convenient for filling up since you don’t know how much to pay ahead of time, and going inside is only really necessary with cash. The only way I’ve been able to Apple Pay for gas in my area is with the Exxon Mobil Speedpass+ app. It’s a bit of a hack: you Apple Pay in the app then fuel up rather than wave your iPhone or Apple Watch by a terminal but it works. It’s just not worth driving out of your way for if you don’t live near a station. Sit down restaurants can accept Apple Pay, which is way more ideal than handing a stranger your debit or credit card to walk away with and swipe. But this is currently limited to select OpenTable restaurants in certain regions. The current list of regions is longer than two years ago but only includes specific restaurants in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, New England, New York, Washington DC, Las Vegas, Portland, Houston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Miami, Baltimore, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Nashville, Detroit, Louisville, Minneapolis, and Central Coast (California). I’m an Apple Pay advocate and dine out often but I’ve never been to one of these restaurants by chance. It’s possible for vending machines and ATMs to work with Apple Pay. Chase and Bank of America already have Apple Pay ATMs that let you withdraw cash with your iPhone or Apple Watch rather than your debit card. (I’ve never seen one personally except on Twitter.) We heard about Apple Pay vending machines and parking spots two years ago but it’s clear replacing hardware takes a while. I’ve seen Coke vending machines with contactless payments and their loyalty card works with Apple Pay. Doctor’s offices are also a great suggestion. Medical billing for me usually involves passing back a credit card over the counter, but I’m sure there are some offices that accept Apple Pay. I’d love an office that accepts Apple Pay and shares medical records for importing into the Health app. Target topped our list for specific businesses, only second to generic regional grocery stores, and it’s a curious case. Target has accepted Apple Pay in its app since day one and accepts chip debit and credit cards in stores, but Apple Pay is not an option when shopping in person. Their CEO expressed interest before the 2015 holiday season, but there hasn’t been any news since then. We’ve reached out for a current comment and will update if we hear back. CVS has the contactless payment hardware in place but goes out-of-the-way to not accept Apple Pay. This was initially because of CurrentC, a competing mobile payment service that fizzled out before launch, and now has more to do with CVS Pay. 9to5Mac asked CVS about the current state of Apple Pay at their stores and received this statement: We currently do not offer Apple Pay. Today we announced the rollout of our CVS Pay solution chainwide and right now we focused on creating the best customer shopping experience and building loyalty within our own Mobile App. With CVS Pay, our customers get more than just payment functionality: they get a convenient and integrated experience that simplifies the entire checkout experience, from picking up their prescription to earning ExtraCare deals.  We will continue to evaluate all potential Mobile Payment solutions that would be able to provide a great shopping experience for our customers. Walmart doesn’t actively block Apple Pay but similarly provides their own mobile payment service that requires an app, Walmart Pay. When asked about supporting Apple Pay in stores, Walmart replied that they are open to a solution that could work similar to Exxon Mobile Speedpass+ but not straight forward Apple Pay: We made a strategic decision to design Walmart Pay to work with almost any smartphone and accept almost any payment type – even allowing for the integration of other mobile wallets in the future. We are currently evaluating several mobile wallets we could potentially integrate into Walmart Pay in the future. The thing for me is this: my local grocery store may have higher prices than Walmart (I’m not comparing but this is probably true), but I’ll go to my grocery store over Walmart whenever possible just to use Apple Pay. The same is true for Walgreens or Rite-Aid over CVS. Hopefully when we revisit this topic in another year, the list continues to shrink even more. I’ll wrap up with a few resources for businesses that don’t accept Apple Pay yet but would consider it. Square Contactless is an affordable card reader that works with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and chip cards and financing options are available to make deploying easier. I did a quick hands-on demo earlier this year to try it in action. I’ve since seen it used in at least two local businesses. Apple also has resources for businesses and Apple Pay: About Apple Pay for merchants Apple Pay glass and register decals Apple Pay feedback for merchants, developers, and customers Add Apple Pay to your Maps listing Finally, if you’re looking for more places to use Apple Pay, my recommendation is first look for the contactless symbol or Apple Pay logo, or just ask if Apple Pay is available. Apple also has a website (apple.com/apple-pay/where-to-use/) that lists specific partners, and you can search Apple Maps for businesses that accept Apple Pay by looking at their business listing. The local ice cream shop I mentioned that uses Square now lists ‘Accepts Apple Pay’ on their listing (and you can use Report an Issue on the listing to tell Apple about businesses that should have it added).

Elyse Betters19 October 2016Phones LeEco Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment LeEco has officially landed in the US. The Chinese company has finished holding its US launch event in San Francisco, where it unveiled a range of new products for American consumers. Here's everything you need to know about the company, its live-streamed event, and all the new stuff it unveiled. What is LeEco? LeEco (short for "Le Ecosystem") is the Beijing-based company that bought TV maker Vizio in 2016 for $2 billion. The Chinese tech giant, which actually started as a web video streaming company called LeTV in 2004, went public on the Shenzhen Stock exchange in 2010, renamed itself last year, and has been hyping its official launch in the US for about a month. Some of its products will be available in the US shortly. LeEco makes and sells connected TVs, smartphones, dash cameras, electric bicycles, headphones, VR headsets, and more. They all run Google’s Android OS and usually cost in the mid-to-low range. The company has also invested in autonomous cars and recently unveiled an electric car concept called LeSee. According to the LA Times, LeEco even has a 70-percent investment in Chinese car-hailing startup Yidao Yongche. LeEco has been moving into Silicon Valley ahead of its US launch. It bought a massive office complex in Santa Clara and plans to hire 12,000 people in the Bay Area, although it currently has around 500 employees in San Jose. LeEco also recently acquihired Adam Goodman, the former president of Paramount Film Group. He is overseeing the US original content division for LeVision, LeEco’s entertainment business. Little is known about LeEco's plans for the US. It might try to be a Xiaomi, which sells everything from hoverboards to laptops, or it could be like Huawei, which tries to sell premium devices at an affordable price. But, right now, it's lacking brand recognition, so it'll be interesting to see what the company unveils on 19 October and whether it can leverage Vizio’s retail partnerships to sell products in places like Walmart. When was LeEco's US launch? LeEco live streamed its US launch on 19 October at 10 am PST. You could join the livestream at www.leeco.com, www.lemall.com, on LeEco social channels, and through the PlutoTV App on Vizio SmartCast and Vizio VIA+ TVs. We've embedded the live-stream video above. What did LeEco announce? LeEco LeEco uMax85 and Super4 4K TVs LeEco unveiled a lineup of TVs sets for the US market. These aren't Vizio TVs but rather from a separate LeEco-branded TV division. There are four new TVs in total, and they all run Android TV. The most notable one is the uMax85. It's an 85-inch 4K TV that features HDR (both HDR10 and Dolby Vision), Harman Kardon speakers, Dolby Digital Plus, 4GB of RAM, 64GB SSD storage, and a quad-core ARM GPU and CPUs. The other three TVs are different versions of its Super4 TV line in the US: the X43 Pro, X55, the X65, all of which will come with support for 4K and HDR, as well as Harman Kardon speakers, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of SSD storage, and quad-core ARM GPUs and CPUs. The uMax85 will cost $4,999 when it's released, while the Super4 X43 Pro will cost $649, and the X55 and X65 will cost $899 and $1,399, respectively. All four TVs will be available from 2 November on Lemall.com and come with user-feedback rebate specials. LeTV Box U4 4K set-top box LeEco LeEco is also bringing the LeTV Box U4 set-top box to the US. It features 4K playback, a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of local storage, and the ability to access both Chinese and international entertainment apps. The LeTV Box U4 will cost $79 when it launches in November. Le Pro 3 flagship phone LeEco LeEco announced that its first smartphone in the US will be the Le Pro3, a flagship phone that launched internationally in September. It runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow and features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 5.5-inch display, and a 16-megapixel camera. Like iPhone, it ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack. It will cost $399 when it launches in the US on 2 November. Le S3 mid-tier phone LeEco LeEco also announced the mid-tier Le S3. It's an Android phone that features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, 32GB of storage, 3GB of RAM, USB-C, a 3,000mAh battery, 5.5-inch Full HD display, Quick Charge 3.0, 16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a fingerprint scanner. It will cost $249 from 2 November and can be bought in grey, rose gold, or gold. LeEco Super Bike LeEco LeEco will bring its Android-enabled “Super Bike” to the US. The bike features a 30-speed shift, on-board lighting, a fingerprint-scanner, built-in alarm and location tracker, and a 4-inch display touchscreen between the handlebars. The company hasn’t said when the bike will be for sale in the US, nor how much it will cost, but the Chinese version currently retails between $800 to $6,000. LeEco ExploreVR headset LeEco LeEco showed off a mobile VR headset called ExploreVR. It draws power from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 inside LeEco's Le Pro 3. It features a "premium memory foam lining", high precision aspheric lenses, a proximity sensor that auto-pauses playback when you take it off, and a 10,000Hz IMU sensor that reduces head-tracking latency. It'll launch 2 November at an unknown price. Is that it? Nope. Video-streaming service LeEco is also launching a new video-streaming service in the US. It will launch with content from Showtime, Lionsgate, MGM, Sling, Vice, The Travel Channel, Awesomeness TV, Machinima, Mitú, Magnolia Pictures, and others. We don't yet know how the service will work, what devices it will be available, when it will launch, or how much it will cost. We expect to hear more in the coming months. Self-driving LeSee Pro car LeSEE Pro, LeEco’s self-driving, electric concept car, was supposed to debut at the event, but Transformers director Michael Bay, who is using the car in his upcoming Transformers 5 film, couldn’t make his scheduled appearance, according to LeEco chairman Jia Yueting. The company did’t say anything more on the car, including how much it costs or when it would be available. Want to know more? Check out Pocket-lint's LeEco hub for other news.

(DJ Corey Photography) By Celia Wren October 19 On Saturday night I found myself facing a political choice of the most agonizing kind: Vote for the presidential candidate who had vowed to bring America more-fashionable dog-poop bags? Or go with the rough-edged populist who had dedicated herself to denouncing small-plate restaurants? The dilemma cropped up at the climax of the diverting interactive show “POTUS Among Us,” a quadrennial satire from Washington Improv Theater. Directed by Mark Chalfant and Melanie Harker, this nutty immersive spoof of a presidential campaign allows theatergoers to winnow down a field of (fictional) crackpot political candidates, based on mini-debates, mini-stump speeches and such game-show-style faceoffs as a competition to shamelessly curry favor with Walmart. Upon checking in at Source, where the show is being performed, audience members are given a handful of (play) money to donate to one or more White House wannabes. An occasion to award the largesse arrives soon, after the office seekers have lined up onstage to introduce their political brands, under the eagle eye of a bell-wielding moderator. (Chalfant, who is WIT’s artistic and executive director, plays the now-deadpan, now-withering moderator character.) At the reviewed performance, an initial 10 delectably flaky presidential hopefuls included the scarf-wearing image consultant Dash Henry (“Let’s Make America Cute Again!”); the bow-tied Ambassador Foster Morissey (aiming to improve America’s acquaintance with European wine cellars); the zealously outdoorsy Dick Thompkins (who carried a piece of driftwood around in his pocket for inspiration); and Franky Doyle, a tattooed ex-con with a strong Australian accent who happened to be the only woman in the race. (These personalities were drolly channeled by, respectively, Ryan Krull, Stewart Walsh, Aaron Mosby and Catherine Deadman. The cast also featured John Heiser, John Carroll, Jamal Newman, Sean Paul Ellis, Chris Ulrich and Matt Winterhalter.) After the intro, the politicians canvass the audience, seeking donations. The candidates who reap the smallest windfall drop out of the race. The remaining hopefuls compete in one-on-one contests, such as a dance-off and a role-playing game involving the nuclear codes. Audience recruits sometimes contribute to the matches by deciding which of two supplicant candidates to have a beer with, for instance. Additionally, the actors solicit audience recommendations for sounding-board issues: At this performance, for example, office-seekers had to take a stand on whether to resurrect the Pony Express. For a change of pace, there are political ads and snapshots of how the race is, say, affecting the Secret Service. (The candidate profiles are devised in advance by WIT team members, but each “POTUS” performance show is otherwise largely improvised. WIT lists a ballpark 90-minute run time, although the show I attended ran almost two hours, including intermission.) Obviously, from a theatergoer’s perspective, the goal is to champion those candidates who provide maximum entertainment value. That outcome certainly transpired on Saturday, with Dash Henry (crusading for the stylish dog-walking supplies) and Franky Doyle (very bearish on small-plate eateries) beating out their rivals to go head-to-head in a climactic race. Audience members were invited to vote, via their phones, on which finalist to send to the White House. Doyle won — doubtless leaving an alternate universe’s worth of tapas restaurants to complain that the system was rigged. POTUS Among Us, directed by Mark Chalfant and Melanie Harker. Tickets: $15-$20. Through Nov. 6 at Source, 1835 14th St. NW.

 $5 billion Stripe has a new tool to help small companies turn away millions in credit card fraud Matt Weinberger Oct. 19, 2016, 12:30 PM 1,937 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stripe President and cofounder John Collison Getty Images/Brian Ach Credit card fraud is still a real problem for online stores — there are whole black markets in place for buying and selling stolen credit card numbers, like the ones obtained in 2013's notorious Target hack. In 2014, online commerce fraud cost stores $32 billion. And while big retailers like Amazon and Walmart might employ huge teams and use advanced data-sifting technology to detect and bounce those fraudulent transactions automatically, it's a big problem for smaller merchants. The talent can be expensive, and the technology is often difficult to use without the expertise. That's why Stripe — the $5 billion startup that helps companies like Best Buy, Lyft, and the Girl Scouts accept credit card payments in their apps — is introducing Stripe Radar, a free tool that helps its customers detect and turn away credit card fraud.  Take, for example, Watsi, a nonprofit that crowdfunds medical care for people in the developing world. It's a modest organization, with only two full-time engineers, neither of whom are fraud detection specialists. Within their first few months using an early version of Stripe Radar, says Stripe President and cofounder John Collison, Watsi turned away $40 million worth of fraud. New normal The idea, Collison says, is that since Stripe handles so many millions of transactions every day (Stripe says half of all Americans have made a purchase from one of its customers), it has a way bigger and deeper set of data from which to draw conclusions about which transactions are fraudulent than most any single retailer. "To say, 'this doesn't seem right,' or 'this doesn't seem normal,' you need to have a baseline for what 'normal' is," Collison explains.  Stripe cofounders Patrick (left) and John (right) CollisonStripe Plus, Stripe has specialties in artificial intelligence that are hard for smaller companies to match, Collison says, that tests that data against whatever the new normal in fraud might be. "We're constantly testing our own experiments against reality," Collison says. Blunt instruments In lacking smart fraud detection tools, Collison says, a lot of smaller companies will actually overcorrect too far for the possibility of fraud: Either they'll insist on reviewing each and every transaction by hand, or else they'll take drastic steps like blocking all international credit card transactions.  In either case, a retailer is blocking themselves from growing the business. Collison calls those techniques a "blunt instrument" that stalls growth. The infamous Target hack of 2013 resulted in lots of credit card numbers hitting the black market. Patrick Hoesly / Flickr, CC And, as the realities of fraud change — where, hypothetically, attacks might start coming from Russia instead of north Africa — Stripe Radar will automatically keep up with the new patterns and flag them, whereas a team of humans might not immediately realize the change. "Human-driven fraud detection is error-prone and doesn't adapt quickly," Collison says. For Stripe, the bigger picture is taking away all the impediments, for companies all over the world, to accepting credit card payments over the internet. If credit card fraud is blocking the ability for retailers to take international payments, then that's where Stripe will intervene.

That's where they found the 24-year-old bleeding from the chest. Walmart shopper Irma Garcia and others were trying to help him stay alive. "I witnessed two gentlemen, they were standing over here by the tables," said Garcia, who just happen to park nearby. "Both gentlemen walked towards the PT Cruiser (parked on the side.) The gentleman in the gray shirt was arguing with the employee of Walmart. They pushed each other, all of the sudden. The guy in the gray shirt stabbed the employee." The man in the gray shirt quickly ran off. Meanwhile, Garcia jumped into action. "We grabbed some rags to stop the bleeding, that's when these guys showed up and the ambulance took him," she said. Investigators determined the fight was over the affections of a young woman who worked at the McDonald's inside the Walmart. Sheriff K9 units were dispatched, and within a few hours, the suspect was captured by a deputy and his K9. "It's scary when it hits close to home," says Rebecca Slovacek, who runs a neighborhood watch program in the area. "Because we're such a small close knit area, everyone knows everybody. That's the scary part about it, when something like this happens in broad daylight." Crosby Independent School District lifted a lock-in of their campuses after the suspect was captured. Investigators say the worker will survive. In addition, the suspect had to be treated for injuries after he was bitten by a K9.

Same-store retail sales in the latest quarter fell 5.9 percent from a year ago, while wholesale revenue fell 5.5 percent. Related Articles Supervalu to sell Save-A-Lot chain for $1.37 billion Supervalu cuts fiscal-year profit guidance Supervalu said Monday it would sell its Save-A-Lot business, a discount grocery chain that has been a rare bright spot for the company, to a private-equity firm. The announcement reversed plans to spin off the chain into its own public company. On Wednesday, Supervalu said Save-A-Lot same-store sales fell 5.2 percent in the latest quarter. Eden Prairie-based Supervalu owns the Cub Foods chain, the Twin Cities’ dominant traditional grocery store chain; but it has faced competition in the market from Target, Walmart and new arrival Hy-Vee. Supervalu also owns supermarket chains Fresh Farm and Shop n’ Save. The company has been stuck in a grocery middle ground as low-price, no-frills chains like Aldi have attracted cost-conscious customers and specialty chains led by Whole Foods Market have lured wealthier shoppers. The Save-A-Lot divestiture means Supervalu will be mostly wholesale — not retail — focused, which could potentially result in better margins thanks to less exposure from the tough store sector. Chief Executive Mark Gross said Wednesday that the company would improve its wholesale revenue in the second half of the year “by adding new customers, securing long-term supply agreements with existing customers, and expanding overall product sales to all customers.” In all, Supervalu said earnings for the latest quarter were $31 million, flat with a year earlier. Per-share earnings came in at 12 cents, up a penny from a year ago on a slightly lower share count. Excluding certain one-time gains and costs, per-share earnings were 10 cents. Revenue fell 4.8 percent to $3.87 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast 10 cents a share in adjusted earnings on $3.95 billion in revenue. Shares in the company, which have fallen 26 percent this year, were down more than 9 percent in midday trading Wednesday.   Tags:  Business News Dow Jones News Service You can help us improve our commenting space.

DUNEDIN, Fla. — A Florida man got an unexpected surprise after a 6-foot-long snake popped out of the hood of his car while he was driving along a busy highway. Tim Mokwa of Clearwater tells news outlets that he was heading home on U.S. Highway 19 in Dunedin when the snake appeared right in front of his windshield.

A shopper who saw the incident tackled the stranger and restrained him until officers arrived, police say. The man was taken into custody and the baby was OK, according to police. The baby's mother, Quisha Hill, told KTLA sister station WDAF in Kansas City, Missouri, that she always shops at this particular Wal-Mart, and on Wednesday she had stopped in for a few items. "While I was at the counter-top, speaking with the lady and bagging up my groceries, this random man comes out of nowhere and yanks the car seat out of the cart," Hill told WDAF. Hill's four-month-old daughter, Alyssa, was in the car seat at the time. "'I'm taking the baby, I'm stealing her. I'm taking her. Call 911,'" Hill said the man told her. She said he began choking her baby and she screamed for help. Nearby shoppers jumped in to help and wrestled the man to the ground. Many Wal-Mart workers came to the mother's and baby's aid. The assailant punched an employee before a security guard body-slammed him to the ground, WDAF reported. According to Hill, the baby turned red for a few moments but was expected to be fine. Hill believes the man was under the influence and said at one point he took the baby's car seat and put it over his head, trying to wear it like a hat. The store's manager said she was "appalled" by the incident and was cooperating with police. 38.982228 -94.670792 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Kansas, Overland Park, Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Watch KTLA 5 News Every newscast plus replays streamed online Popular Video Shows Chili’s Manager Taking Away Free Meal From Army Veteran in Texas Protesters March Through Los Angeles in Fourth Night of Anti-Trump Demonstrations Security Cameras Capture Anaheim Mother and 2-Year-Old Son Attacked by 2 Dogs Ku Klux Klan to Hold Donald Trump Victory Parade in North Carolina Latest News Driver Suspected of Blaring ‘Extremely Loud’ Air Horn, Waking El Segundo Residents, Is Arrested: Police LG’s Signature TwinWash Washer Giveaway Sketch Released in Search for Man Involved in String of Sexual Assaults in Maywood Teen Bicyclist Dies After Being Struck During 2-Vehicle Crash in Pacoima: LAFD Nation/World 1 Dead, 2 Injured as Good Samaritans Save Mom, Baby From Attackers Outside Wal-Mart in Kansas Local News Mom Arrested After Allegedly Leaving Baby in Car While Shopping at Wal-Mart in Palm Springs Nation/World Mother Gives Birth in Checkout Line at Utah Wal-Mart, Insists on Paying for Merchandise Nation/World Woman Dies After Being Run Over by Her Own Vehicle in Parking Lot of Memphis Wal-Mart Nation/World Texas Police Launch Investigation After Facebook Photos Show Man Apparently Dragging Girl By Hair Through Wal-Mart Nation/World Father Shot While Trying to Save Baby During Violent Home-Invasion Robbery in Kansas City Nation/World Police: Pennsylvania Mom Locked Son With Autism, Baby in Car While She Worked Out Nation/World Two Men Arrested After Allegedly Kidnapping, Raping Sheriff’s Deputy in Kansas Nation/World Young Mother Shot, Killed in Front of Her Two Sons During Apparent Road-Rage Incident in Missouri Nation/World Kansas City Teen Killed in Drive-by Shooting ‘Had Her Fingers Crossed’ Before She Died, Witness Says Local News 911 Call: ‘Let My Brother Go,’ 8-Year-Old Glendale Boy Says He Told Would-Be Kidnapper Nation/World Texas Baby Dies After Being Left in Hot Car for 9 Hours in Wal-Mart Parking Lot While Dad Was at Work Nation/World Video Shows Oklahoma Man Fatally Slamming Baby Headfirst Into Floor: Prosecutors Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

School leavers or college drop-outs would be trained to speak with an American accent, posing as US Internal Revenue Service officials and scare people into believing they owed the government cash, detectives said. The scheme, which had been operating for over a year, netted more than 10 million rupees (US$150,000) a day, they added. More than 70 people have been arrested after police this month swooped on call centres in western India, from Mumbai to the Gujarat capital of Ahmedabad, but they suspect the network could stretch even further. Why Hong Kong should send back ‘asylum’ seekers from India “We believe that the racket is spread across India, including in the north,” Parambir Singh, commissioner of police in the Mumbai suburb of Thane, said. Police from Thane, on the outskirts of India’s financial capital, rounded up at least 770 employees of bogus call centres on October 4. Most were let go pending further investigations but 72 were arrested while another suspect was detained this week as police try to close in on the 23-year-old alleged mastermind. It is claimed the accused would berate victims for falsely failing to pay taxes and then threaten them with jail if they did not cough up immediately. The con artists would use an altered caller ID number that made it look like they were ringing from the United States and often quoted IRS badge numbers to make them appear legitimate. The fraudsters would trick the victim into sending money, often through pre-paid debit cards that can be purchased at stores like Walmart, or even by buying Apple iTunes gift cards. In both instances transfers are made by the victim handing over the card’s registration number. The iTunes scam has even led Apple to issue a global warning on its website urging people not to give the number to someone they do not know. The IRS has been warning about identical scams for a few years with reports in US media that such schemes might have been operating out of India. In January, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said it was aware of more than 5,000 victims who had paid a total of more than US$26.5 million in such scams since October 2013. “It is one of the biggest fraud cases to surface in recent times in Mumbai,” Parag Manere, Thane police deputy commissioner, said, adding that the ringleaders found willing recruits. Hiring was easy. They just gave out pamphlets about job openings and received applications, mostly from school or college drop-outs Parag Manere, Thane police deputy commissioner “Hiring was easy. They just gave out pamphlets about job openings and received applications, mostly from school or college drop-outs,” Manere said. Commissioner Singh said ringleaders “lured youngsters with good working knowledge of English and trained them how to speak with an American accent”. Police believe the recruits were paid 30,000-70,000 rupees a month, plus commission. Some made the initial calls while others were employed to “close” deals. They would work through the night to catch Americans during their day and sometimes left threatening voicemail messages if their targets didn’t answer the phone, it is alleged. A victim of a similar-sounding scam told NBC last year the caller had her “so frightened” but felt “embarrassed, guilty and ashamed” when she realised she had been swindled. Singh said Thane police knew of 2,000 people suspected of involvement in the scam, but the force believes there are more, and is working with their counterparts in neighbouring Gujarat state and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Police in Ahmedabad raided more than half a dozen call centres following the Thane operation, a senior crime branch official said, while searches were also carried out in the Gujarati cities of Bhuj, Surat and Vadodara. Police are desperate to find alleged mastermind Sagar Thakkar, known as “Shaggy”, who is from Ahmedabad but may have fled India, possibly to Dubai. Thakkar had half a dozen people working for him in the US and was preparing to expand operations, according to the Ahmedabad officer. “He was planning to set up five more call centres by December,” he said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 4 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre 5 In extraordinary move, Obama condemns FBI for Clinton email disclosure: ‘We don’t operate on innuendo’ Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Hong Kong government slammed for taking too long to test hairy crab samples for dioxins 4 Hong Kong quality of life nears lows of 2003 with sentiments on housing affordability, freedom of speech down 5 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre Commented 1 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 2 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 3 Tesla urges Hong Kong government to keep e-vehicle tax breaks 4 Driver of BMW arrested after cyclist killed in Kowloon Bay crash 5 New Communist Party rules call on top Chinese cadres to inform on each other Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Out on the town: experiencing Macau is far from a gamble In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 The expanded campus at GSIS highlights the school’s commitment to improvement Brought to you by: German Swiss International School Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Staff photo City officials will celebrate the completion of a major phase of the Rupple Road Improvement Project during a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 2 p.m. Friday, Oct. 21 near the intersection of Rupple and Persimmon Street in southwest Fayetteville. Crews are putting the finishing touches on a 1.5-mile extension of Rupple from Persimmon to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which will provide motorists with an easier route to Walmart, Lowe’s and the other businesses on the west side of Interstate 49. » Enlarge Map Once Friday’s ceremony has concluded the new stretch of road will be opened to traffic. The project includes a landscaped median with roundabouts at three intersections, a 5-foot sidewalk on the east side of the road, and a 12-foot trail on the west side. Officials expect the project will drive economic development in southwest Fayetteville as the fields and pastures that separate MLK Boulevard and Wedington Drive give way to commercial and residential developments. The $7.3 million project is being funded using transportation bonds approved by voters in 2006. The state highway department recently approved plans for a traffic signal at Rupple and MLK, which is scheduled to be installed in January 2017. The existing roadway on Rupple from Persimmon to Wedington Drive is also being widened to four lanes, along with a short stretch on the north side of Wedington to Congressional Street.

Police said the baby was not injured. Tammy Ljungblad tljungblad@kcstar.com i By Tony Rizzo trizzo@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A former pastor of a church in New Jersey was tackled by bystanders after he allegedly tried to choke a woman’s baby Wednesday morning inside an Overland Park Wal-Mart. Police said the baby was not injured. The incident was reported just before 7:30 a.m. Wednesday inside the store at 7701 Frontage Road. &nbsp; The woman was standing in a checkout line with her 4-month-old baby when a man she didn’t know walked up and started to choke the child. Other people nearby intervened and subdued the man until police arrived and arrested him. Police said the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He was identified in jail records as a 54-year-old resident of Clifton, N.J. He is being held without bond pending the filing of charges. The Star is not naming him because charges have not been filed. When he was booked in the Johnson County jail on Wednesday, he listed his address as that of a Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral in Clifton, N.J. The current pastor said the man arrested in Overland Park left his position as pastor about 10 months ago.

(WIAT) — Clanton Police are looking for a man they say stole thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise from a Walmart in Clanton. The crime was caught on camera. This happened last week at the store on 7th Street South. Police say the man walked into the store around 2 a.m. He jumped over the fence of the Garden Center and threw items to an accomplice. The thieves were able to fill four shopping carts with flat screen TVs and computers. If you can help solve the case, call the Clanton Police Department at (205) 755-1194.

Wednesday, October 19, 2016  |  Muharram 18, 1438 World Things to do Today UAE Prayer Times People & Politics UAE Weather Sign In Things to do Today UAE Prayer Times People & Politics UAE Weather Edit Profile Sign Out UAE World Business Sport Arts & Life Opinion Blogs Middle East and North Africa Yemen South Asia Americas Europe Asia Pacific Africa Central Asia East Asia Southeast Asia India call centre US tax scam tip of iceberg, police say October 19, 2016 Updated: October 19, 2016 12:38 PM Related India call centre staff arrested over US scam India call centre staff arrested over US scam - video Topics: India MUMBAI // Indian police fear there may be similar fake call centres tricking US citizens into paying bogus tax bills operating across the country. School leavers and college dropouts would be trained to speak with an American accent, posing as US Internal Revenue Service officials and scare people into believing they owed the government cash, detectives said. The scheme, which had been operating for over a year, netted more than 10 million rupees (Dh550,000) a day, they added. More than 70 people have been arrested after police this month swooped on call centres in western India, from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, but they suspect the network could stretch even further. "We believe that the racket is spread across India, including in the north," Parambir Singh, commissioner of police in the Mumbai suburb of Thane, said. Police from Thane rounded up at least 770 employees of bogus call centres on October 4. Most were let go pending further investigations but 72 were arrested while another suspect was detained this week as police try to close in on a 23-year-old alleged mastermind. It is claimed the accused would berate victims for falsely failing to pay taxes and then threaten them with jail if they did not cough up immediately. The con artists would use an altered caller ID number that made it look like they were ringing from the United States and often quoted IRS badge numbers to make them appear legitimate. The fraudsters would trick the victim into sending money, often through prepaid debit cards that can be purchased at stores like Walmart, or even by buying Apple iTunes gift cards. In both instances transfers are made by the victim handing over the card’s registration number. The iTunes scam has led Apple to issue a global warning on its website urging people not to give the number to someone they do not know. The IRS has been warning about identical scams for a few years with reports in US media that such schemes might have been operating out of India. In January, the US treasury inspector general for tax administration said it was aware of more than 5,000 victims who had paid a total of more than $26.5 million in such scams since October 2013. "It is one of the biggest fraud cases to surface in recent times in Mumbai," said Parag Manere, Thane police deputy commissioner. He said the ringleaders found willing recruits. "Hiring was easy. They just gave out pamphlets about job openings and received applications, mostly from school or college dropouts," said Mr Manere. Mr Singh said ringleaders "lured youngsters with good working knowledge of English and trained them how to speak with an American accent". Police believe the recruits were paid 30,000-70,000 rupees a month, plus commission. Some made the initial calls while others were employed to "close deals". They would work through the night to catch Americans during their day and sometimes left threatening voicemail messages if their targets did not answer the phone, it is alleged. A victim of a similar-sounding scam told NBC last year the caller had her "so frightened" but felt "embarrassed, guilty and ashamed" when she realised she had been swindled. Mr Singh said Thane police knew of 2,000 people suspected of involvement in the scam, but the force believes there are more, and is working with their counterparts in Gujarat state and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Police in Ahmedabad raided more than half a dozen call centres following the Thane operation, a senior crime branch official told AFP, while searches were also carried out in the Gujarati cities of Bhuj, Surat and Vadodara. Police are desperate to find alleged mastermind Sagar Thakkar, known as "Shaggy", who is from Ahmedabad but may have fled India, possibly to Dubai. Thakkar had half a dozen people working for him in the US and was preparing to expand operations, according to the Ahmedabad officer. "He was planning to set up five more call centres by December," he said. * Agence France-Presse Pages: Add your comment View all comments More South Asia India raises cap on cash withdrawals to ease public anger - video India’s Modi pledges to ease cash crunch Pakistan warns of escalation after clashes in Kashmir Families ripped apart after Pakistan shrine attack kills 52 MOST VIEWED World | All Supermoon starts to light up the sky around the world – in pictures Now you see it, now you don’t: Massive sinkhole fixed in days Iraq’s battle-hardened Golden Division seek their greatest victory in Mosul Arab nations accuse Iran of sponsoring terrorism Aftershocks as tourists evacuated in quake-hit New Zealand Supermoon rises in Spain - video World in focus – best photos for November 15, 2016 Iraqi special forces blow up ISIL-rigged van in Mosul – video Cows stranded by New Zealand quake live to see an udder day Egypt court overturns Morsi death sentence More Most Viewed Hundreds in Dubai turn out for rare supermoon Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Album review: Hardwired...

Troopers say it all started when they responded to an unconscious 21-year-old Flint woman overdosing on heroin that was possibly laced with Fentanyl. She was on an Indian Trails bus in the Walmart parking lot on M-32 in Alpena. During the investigation troopers found another 21-year-old female passenger on the bus from Detroit had heroin on her. The woman admitted to delivering the heroin to the victim, causing the overdose. Troopers also found Valium, hypodermic needles and paraphilia, including a crack pipe on the suspect. The Detroit woman was arrested on charges of possession and delivery of heroin and a scheduled 4 controlled substance, as well as an outstanding felony warrant. The Flint woman was taken to Mid-Michigan Medical Center after EMS administered Naloxone, which reverses an overdose, and took other lifesaving measures.

All Rights Reserved Newspaper web site content management software and services 2016-10-19 / Business Tweet Print CI Filing Systems to expand in Tonawanda CI Filing Systems, a manufacturer and wholesale distributor of custom-made index tabs, file folders, file backs and legal dividers, will expand its manufacturing operations and create 80 new jobs in Erie County, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The New York Power Authority Board of Trustees recently approved low-cost hydropower allocations and will provide up to $8 million to support CI Filings Systems expansion at its facility in Tonawanda. “New York continues to lead the way in renewable energy, which is a central component to the economic vitality and sustainability of this state,” Cuomo said. “CI Filings Systems recognized the growth potential in Western New York, and we thank the company for choosing to expand its operations here. “With this project, we look forward to the creation of new manufacturing jobs and economic progress in Tonawanda for years to come.” According to a prepared statement, NYPA trustees approved a 1,210-kilowatt allocation to CI Filing Systems, whose products are found in a number of stores, including Home Depot, Victoria’s Secret, Simon & Schuster, Whole Foods and Walmart. The company will occupy a 55,000-square-foot factory and 41,000-square-foot distribution warehouse in Tonawanda. CI Filings Systems expects to complete the project and begin operations in 2018, according to the statement. “CI Filing’s decision underscores the significant value of the economic development incentives tied to the Niagara Power Project,” said NYPA president and CEO Gil Quiniones. “The expansion of these businesses in Western New York is an important vote of confidence for the local workforce,” said Howard Zemsky, Empire State Development president, CEO and commissioner. “Recent college graduates and others looking to return to Western New York are happy to have career opportunities that will allow them to be a part of the region’s economic rejuvenation.” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said, “It is always good news when business chooses to locate or expand here in Erie County, and we have seen that all of Western New York benefits from the proximity of low-cost hydropower thanks to our natural resources and assets. “Thanks to Gov. Cuomo and the NYPA Board of Trustees decision, this allocation will help CI Filings to expand and hire more local workers. It is a win-win for all involved.” Town of Tonawanda Supervisor Joseph Emminger expressed his support and gratitude to NYPA for the low-cost hydropower allocations being offered to CI Filing Systems in connection with its expansion project. “CI Filing Systems has been an important part of our community, and this expansion project will assist the company in continuing to serve their markets and offer good jobs to residents of both the town and the county,” Emminger said. Low-cost Niagara hydropower is reserved for companies within a 30-mile radius of the Niagara Power Plant, or for businesses in Chautauqua County. According to the statement, it has historically been priced up to 30 percent less than wholesale market electricity in the Buffalo-Niagara region. The hydropower is linked to tens of thousands of existing jobs. Return to top Browse Archives

This would make for two consecutive years with absorption totals of this caliber.” Year-over-year, Reith said local office vacancy rates have decreased from 18 percent to 16.1 percent. Class A office space has been holding steady, with a vacancy rate just under 20 percent. The local vacancy rate for Class B office space improved by 2.1 percent, while Class C space has seen its vacancy rate fall by 0.7 percentage points in the last year. Meanwhile, office rents are increasing, with the weighted average monthly rental rate now at $1.83 per square foot and increasing by 2 cents per square foot during each quarter of 2016. In the retail market, year-over-year total vacancy rates improved from 8.6 percent one year ago to 7.8 percent during the third quarter of 2016. After absorbing 450,000 square feet of space in the first two quarters of 2016, that pace slowed during the third quarter, with a positive net absorption of 42,880 square feet in the period. Four large vacancies contributed to a lower absorption total during the third quarter, including store closings Wal-Mart, ABC Food Market and two Office Max locations. At the same time, Walker said retail highlights during the third quarter included the opening of the first Southern Nevada locations for popular restaurant chains like Cracker Barrel and Dave & Buster’s, with Chick-fil-A locations soon to follow. The Southern Nevada industrial market continues to show growth, with year-over-year total vacancy rates improving from 6.2 percent to 5.8 percent. The local industrial market closed the third quarter with a positive total net absorption of 667,316 square feet of space. Through the third quarter of 2016, Walker noted the industrial market has now absorbed just under 2 million square feet of space this year. Reith expects this trend to continue, with more industrial space currently under construction and “coming through the pipeline as pre-leased space.” Xceligent, a rapidly growing provider of commercial real estate information locally and nationally, partners with CALV and local commercial real estate market professionals through their Quarterly Advisory Boards to produce quarterly reports on market trends and conditions in the office, industrial and retail markets in Southern Nevada.

The actress, Yves Saint Laurent muse, and wife of John Paul Getty, Jr. died of a heroin overdose at the age of 30, but not before cementing a now-ubiquitous standard of luxe bohemianism. The Gettys’ Marrakech home (dubbed, aptly, “the Pleasure Palace”) played host to the likes of The Rolling Stones, and the jet-setting duo were famously photographed on its roof in Patrick Lichfield’s now-iconic shot, looking every bit like a pair of doomed romantics, she in brocade and cream leather boots, he in a hooded abaya. Getty’s nomadic, lush wardrobe of caftans, poet’s blouses, bangles, and babouches continues to stoke fire in the imaginations of designers season after season; indeed, if moodboards are any indication, that 1969 Lichfield snap hasn’t aged a bit in the intervening years. And today, in honor of the late icon’s birthday, we’re rounding up five looks that embody a bit of her bewitching brand of glamour.

Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) A state audit found thousands of dollars in potentially fraudulent credit card purchases and shoddy oversight — including five years of unfiled tax returns — at the Economic Development Corporation of Utah. Two top officials have left EDCUtah since the audit began: President and CEO Jeff Edwards announced his retirement Oct. 6, and Todd Brightwell, the chief operating officer, stepped aside earlier this year. Brightwell — who is not directly named in the audit but receives much of the scrutiny for improper purchases and poor management — received a severance package that included a vehicle, several months' pay, health-insurance coverage and electronic equipment. Auditors questioned the generosity of the package. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "There is no doubt mistakes were made in the financial operation. … We've undertaken a robust set of changes to make sure all these recommendations [by the audit] are implemented," Edwards said. "Our business model is sound, and with these recent changes, we'll be able to do even better in the future." A call to a number listed as Brightwell's was not answered Tuesday evening; the line's voicemail box was full. Brightwell was found to have made at least $5,788 of improper credit card purchases that auditors said could be considered fraudulent. For example, Brightwell paid a $148 traffic ticket in Iron County and for a $48 traffic school course, bought two Apple iPhones for $425, paid $173 for two golf outings for, spent $207 at a pottery studio and bought $317 in unspecified goods at Wal-Mart. Brightwell also had another $89,290 in credit-card purchases, more than half of which did not have a receipt or a business purpose — things like $16,000 in travel and another $24,000 in computer hardware, gas, parking, golf fees and a satellite-radio subscription. When he left EDCUtah, Brightwell had $4,000 deducted from his severance package to repay EDCUtah for the unauthorized credit-card purchases, but auditors said that may be below what was actually owed and questioned why he was given such a generous offer. "We believe that it is questionable to further enrich an individual who already improperly benefited from personal charges with a company credit card," the audit said. "With over 60 percent of EDCU funding coming from state and local taxpayer funds, this action by EDCU is strongly questionable." Rep. Brian King, D-Salt Lake City, questioned why the severance was so lavish, and Edwards said that Brightwell had been a valuable part of EDCUtah for years. They agreed to how much they estimated he owed, it was deducted from the final amount and Edwards approved the settlement. Brightwell also bought 15 devices from the Apple Store, although several could not be located after he left — a phone, a tablet and two computers. EDCUtah has a budget of $3.2 million a year, with most coming from taxpayers, either at the state level or through dues paid by cities and counties. As The Salt Lake Tribune reported in May, the audit found that EDCUtah failed to file its required tax returns for five straight years, beginning in 2010, prompting the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status. EDCUtah lost its tax exemption for about two years before it was brought to the management's attention. The audit said Edwards appropriately took the blame for the oversight, but he said Brightwell and the agency's former office manager failed to provide requested data to the corporation's accounting firm despite multiple requests, and that Edwards was never told of the problems. Some of the returns that were eventually filed were incomplete or contained errors that needed to be corrected. The tax forms were eventually filed and the tax-exempt status reinstated, although the audit suggests management may have made misleading statements to the IRS about why the tax forms weren't filed on time. The audit suggests that EDCUtah executives may have broken state ethics law by buying $11,517 in meals and giving $867 in gifts to officials at the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED); the GOED technically contracts with EDCUtah for business recruitment. Many of the meals came at a time the GOED was updating its state contract with EDCUtah, increasing it from $525,000 to $900,000. State law prohibits a contractor from giving gifts to its contracting entity. A legislative attorney called EDCUtah's practice "risky" and a minimum and possibly illegal. » Next page...

Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Police are looking for a group of women they say have been fraudulently buying prepaid credit cards throughout the state. The women, at least four, apparently used fraudulent funds and stolen credit cards to purchase prepaid cards at five Wal-Mart stores — Syracuse, Midvale, Orem, Riverdale and Ogden — on Sept. 18, according to a news release from Unified Police Department. Their operations allegedly have led to a combined $62,000 loss for the affected shops in Utah. Investigators believe the women are from Michigan and traveling the country as part of a fraud ring. They typically target multiple locations on the same day, the release states.

Misdemeanor charge filed in attack on Muslim professor Ron Wilkins , rwilkins@jconline.com 7:15 a.m. EDT October 19, 2016 Austin Bradley Gregory (Photo: File) LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Austin Bradley Gregory faces a formal misdemeanor charge of battery for allegedly attacking a Purdue professor who is Muslim.. The 37-year-old Canadian citizen of Egyptian heritage told the Journal & Courier in September that Gregory's alleged attack started as a road rage incident about 5:45 p.m. Sept. 3. It ended in the his driveway, where the professor said Gregory punched and kicked him while the woman driving the Cadillac yelled, “Kill him! Kill him!" The attack prompted the Council on America-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group for Muslims, to call for Indiana to adopt hate-crime laws. CAIR published a press release last month, calling for Indiana to adopt enhanced sentencing for crimes that target victims based on religion, race or sexual orientation. The professor said last month that his well-meaning friend contacted CAIR after the attack, and he did not want to make the incident into a political one. He did, however, want justice, which he said was criminal charges against Gregory and the driver of the Cadillac. The Labor Day weekend incident started in the Wal-Mart parking lot in West Lafayette. Gregory, 21, was a passenger in the Cadillac that honked at the professor as he backed out of a parking space and into the path of the Cadillac. The woman driving the Cadillac flipped off the Purdue professor, Gregory said during a brief interview on Sept. 7. The victim told the Journal & Courier the driver yelled, "Go home, f---ing foreigner." Gregory accused the professor of flipping off the driver of the car, which the professor denied. The charging information and probable cause affidavit filed with the charge, however, make no mention of this exchange or the flipping off of the professor and the driver. After the dust-up in the parking lot, the two vehicles traveled the same route to their respective homes until Morehouse Road, when Gregory's vehicle attempted to turn left, and the professor passed the Cadillac on the right. That's when the Cadillac began following the professor, Gregory said. They were going to report the professor for trying to run them off the road, he said. The professor told the Journal & Courier he did not drive recklessly or attempt to run the Cadillac from the road. Last month, Gregory told the Journal & Courier that when they got to the professor's home on Ledyard Street, the professor walked up to the car and reached inside. Gregory said he was protecting his family and that's when the fight started. But according to the affidavit, Gregory told police that he got out of the car and the professor yelled at him, so he punched the man once in the left eye, according to the affidavit. Two of the professor's neighbors witnessed the attack, according to the probable cause affidavit filed with the charge. They told police they saw Gregory yelling at the professor, get out of his car and punch the professor several times, according to the affidavit. Gregory, who lives in Country Squire Apartments in rural West Lafayette, was arrested Sept. 3, and he posted bond on Sept. 4. Last month, the professor told the Journal & Courier, "I will not stay here if I don't see justice. This country is not safe. There is no justice now." The Journal & Courier  was unable to contact the professor Tuesday.

HONING IN ON THE HEART OF DIXIE: Chase Elliott’s time to shine is now as the Round of 12 competitor looks to keep his championship hopes alive. The rookie is honing in on Talladega and will essentially need to be victorious in the “Heart of Dixie” this Sunday to advance into the Round of 8. In the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Elliott has already led the second-most laps in two of the five races, trailing only six-time series champion and teammate Jimmie Johnson both times. After the halfway point in NASCAR’s 10-race postseason, Elliott has led laps in all but one race and even though the rookie didn’t lead any laps at Dover, he still reeled off an impressive third-place result at the Delaware track. REIGNING ROOKIE: Elliott leads the 2016 Rookie of the Year contender standings heading into Talladega by 61 points over second-place Ryan Blaney and 90 points over third-place Chris Buescher. Elliott has accumulated a total of 285 rookie points this year through the first 31 races. Additionally, Elliott is one of only three rookies to ever make the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup playoffs. He has yet to win his first race, but claims nine top-five showings – the most by a rookie since Carl Edwards scored 13 in 2005. NO. 24 AT TALLADEGA: The No. 24 team earned its first win at Talladega in 1996 with the Chevrolet piloted by Jeff Gordon. After a rain delay and two red-flag conditions for major incidents, NASCAR halted the race due to darkness and Gordon, who had aptly displayed the art of preservation, was declared the winner. The team has gone on to earn five additional victories at the superspeedway as well as six pole awards and 21 top-10 finishes. Under the guidance of crew chief Alan Gustafson, in 2015 the No. 24 team swept both pole positions in Talladega qualifying and in 2016 Elliott earned his second pole award of the season at the Alabama track as well. At Talladega earlier this year Elliott was the top-finishing driver from Hendrick Motorsports with a fifth-place finish and is looking to improve on those results this weekend. CHASE UNIVERSITY: “Chase University” – Elliott’s collegiate ticket package program – will return this weekend at Talladega Superspeedway. The exclusive ticket package will feature concerts, food, beverages and tailgating games before, during and after the race. Elliott will even make an appearance on race day prior to the green flag. Students with a valid college ID can enroll in Chase University with a special $24 party pass available online at TalladegaSuperspeedway.com. Share the fun using #ChaseU on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. REACHING NEW HEIGHTS: The sky is the limit for Elliott. When the rookie is away from the track he is busy honing his aerial skills. Elliott earned his private pilot license in July 2015 and more recently secured his multi-engine instrument rating. He describes flying as “peaceful” but also “not something that can be taken lightly.” Earlier this month, NBC tagged along for a flight to check out Elliott’s skills. To see Elliott in flight, watch here.

Over his 29 starts at the track, Johnson has an average start of 9.6 and an average finish of 17.1. ‘PUSHY’ TEAMMATE: Restrictor plate racing is known for teammates “pushing” each other through the draft, so one could say Johnson has been a pushy teammate. Johnson has finished second at Talladega three times and each has been behind a Hendrick Motorsports teammate. Johnson and teammate Gordon swept the 2007 season events at Talladega by finishing one-two. Johnson also finished second to teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. one year ago. SO CLOSE: Talladega is known for its close finishes and on May 3, 2015, Johnson finished second by 0.159 seconds behind race-winner and teammate Earnhardt at the 2.66-mile superspeedway. LEADERBOARD: Of the 29 races Johnson has run at Talladega Superspeedway, he has led laps in 26 of them for a total of 467 segments around the 2.66-mile track. LOCAL TIES: Longtime No. 48 front-tire carrier R.J. Barnette hails from nearby Pinson, Alabama, and played football at Samford University. Barnette has been on the Lowe’s team for seven seasons and has earned two championships with Johnson behind the wheel. MOVING ON: Johnson and Kevin Harvick are the only two drivers who have clinched a spot in the Round of 8, which begins next weekend at Martinsville Speedway. Johnson will move on to the penultimate round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup regardless of his finish this weekend at Talladega Superspeedway. AND THEN THERE WERE EIGHT: The odds are in Johnson’s favor as far as success goes at the final four races of the season. Johnson has a total of eight wins at Martinsville, six wins at Texas and four wins at Phoenix. Homestead-Miami is one of the four tracks where Johnson has never scored a win in his career but he has a pair of second-place finishes.

No. 88 Mtn Dew Take It Outside Chevrolet SS / Alex Bowman Driver Alex Bowman Hometown Tucson, Arizona Age 23 Resides Mooresville, North Carolina 2016 Season 6 starts 0 wins 0 pole positions 0 top-five finishes 2 top-10 finishes 6 laps led Career 77 starts 0 wins 0 pole positions 0 top-five finishes 2 top-10 finishes 9 laps led Track Career 4 starts 0 wins 0 pole positions 0 top-five finishes 0 top-10 finishes 0 laps led KANSAS RECAP: After qualifying fifth on Friday, Alex Bowman earned his career-best NASCAR Sprint Cup Series finish on Sunday at Kansas Speedway. Bowman finished seventh driving the No. 88 Chevrolet for the sixth time as the substitute for Earnhardt, who is out for the remainder of the season as he continues to recover from a concussion. MTN DEW TAKE IT OUTSIDE REVEAL: Things might get a little “wild” this weekend at Talladega Superspeedway. Last week, Hendrick Motorsports and Mountain Dew revealed the No. 88 Mtn Dew Take It Outside Chevrolet SS that Bowman will drive at Talladega Superspeedway this weekend. The No. 88 Chevy is white with TrueTimber® camo adorning the bottom half of the race car and the roof. Mountain Dew also has a brand new commercial coming later this week with the tagline, “Answer the Call of the Wild.” Click here for a sneak peek. TALLADEGA STATS: Talladega Superspeedway will mark Bowman’s seventh start in the No. 88 Chevy. In the first six races, he earned two top-10 and three top-15 finishes, and has run inside the top 10 in every event. Bowman has four NASCAR Sprint Cup Series starts at the 2.66-mile superspeedway with a best finish of 16th. He has one start there in the NASCAR XFINITY Series, where he finished 13th. ROWDY RETURNS: William “Rowdy” Harrell, rear-tire carrier for the No. 88 Mtn Dew Take It Outside Chevrolet team, can certainly be called a hometown hero when he returns to Alabama, and particularly to Moundville, the small town where he grew up. After playing football in high school, Harrell was a walk-on linebacker for Nick Saban’s well-known University of Alabama football team, winning three national championships in his four years with the team. The tire carrier can also add race winner to his list of accolades, as he joined the Hendrick Motorsports No. 88 team in 2014 and became one of the six primary over-the-wall crew members in 2015. During those two seasons, the No. 88 team racked up seven wins, including the 2014 Daytona 500. Alabama’s football team is undefeated to this point of the college football season, which the outgoing former linebacker still follows very closely. MARTINSVILLE VICTORY TOUR RECAP: Last Wednesday, Oct. 12, Earnhardt traveled to Martinsville Speedway for his second Victory Tour appearance. He assisted the track in announcing that the half-mile facility will be installing lights. “Light Up Martinsville” is a $5 million project, providing Martinsville Speedway with the first LED lights among major motor sports facilities. Installation will begin shortly following this year’s race on Oct. 30 and is expected to be completed by January 2017. Click here for a photo gallery from the event. Hendrick Motorsports HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS AT TALLADEGA: At Talladega Superspeedway, Hendrick Motorsports has 12 wins, 11 pole positions, 54 top-five finishes and 78 top-10s. Hendrick Motorsports’ most recent Talladega win came last season, when Earnhardt made his way to Victory Lane in the May race after qualifying fourth. SIX MAKE 12: Hendrick Motorsports’ 12 wins at Talladega have come thanks to six different drivers. Ken Schrader earned the organization’s first win at the track in 1988. Gordon contributed six wins, Johnson has earned two, and Brian Vickers, Terry Labonte and Earnhardt have claimed one apiece. ORGANIZATION STATS: To date, Hendrick Motorsports has totals of 243 victories, 209 pole positions, 1,006 top-five finishes and 1,687 top-10 finishes in Sprint Cup competition. Its teams have led 66,058 laps since 1984. QUOTABLE / “I’d love to win in one of these final few races of the season. Each race and each weekend we are getting better as a team and Hendrick Motorsports always brings great cars to the track. Talladega is so challenging because of the draft and all of the variables that are out of your control. This is UniFirst’s first weekend on the car and I’m looking forward to having another strong performance.” Kasey Kahne on racing at Talladega “Talladega is always known for close finishes and I’m excited to get back. The racing there, you can’t really compare it to anything else. Talladega is a special place because it’s a historic racetrack for our sport. I remember watching a lot of races there. My dad still has that qualifying record and it’s obviously very impressive. It says a lot of him, Uncle Ernie and Uncle Dan, and really everybody who worked on those cars back then. They all went the extra mile to make things like that happen. So, when I think about that, it just takes the respect level that I already have for all that they did with what they had back then, and makes it even greater.” Chase Elliott on racing at Talladega “We will just need to go and race our hearts out and try to win. That’s about all we can do. The best place to be at Talladega, as everybody knows, is to try to be out front. That is hard to sustain for a long period of time in those races, but we’ve seen guys who have gotten good at it over the past few years. They make it happen and are able to control a race really well. I do think there is an art to it. There are obviously a lot of things you can’t control and running as close as we do there, that is a big factor, but I do think there is something that you can do better than others rather than just riding around and hoping for the best.” Elliott on Talladega strategy “We haven’t taken anything for granted and we raced last weekend going for a win. We will do the same this weekend in Talladega. It is nice to not have to worry about advancing with Talladega being the cut-off race, but our speedway program is outstanding and we will have a great Lowe’s ProServices Chevy for this weekend. It’s going to be an interesting race with so many good guys going for the Round of 8 and this being their last opportunity to make it through. It’s going to be wild.” Jimmie Johnson on racing at Talladega “I’m excited about getting to Talladega. Speedway racing is always really stressful, but going there we’ve got a great Mountain Dew camo scheme – half the car is invisible (laughs) – so hopefully (No. 88 team spotter) T.J. (Majors) can still see it from the spotter’s stand. Hendrick Motorsports brings such fast race cars to that racetrack, so I’m really excited. Their speedway stuff is amazing, always – especially the No. 88 – so I’m just really looking forward to having a chance to win. I’m going to sit Dale (Earnhardt Jr.) down and have a couple-hour discussion with him about speedway racing because if there’s a speedway racer left in this garage, it’s him, for sure.” Alex Bowman on racing at Talladega ** The opinions expressed on this site are not necessarily those of the publisher.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Caltrans hazmat crew cleans up wash behind Wal-Mart in Victorville Tuesday Oct 18, 2016 at 2:50 PM Oct 18, 2016 at 4:26 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero VICTORVILLE — A Caltrans hazmat crew was busy Tuesday morning cleaning a wash behind the Wal-Mart on Amargosa Road and disposing of mounds of trash and debris. The crew worked the wash area, just west of Amargosa Road, picking up trash and large items, including shopping carts, a microwave oven and even a small freezer. Caltrans Public Information Officer Shelli Lombardo said the the hazmat crew was on scene for biohazard precautions, such as possible human waste and drug paraphernalia in the area. Numerous hypodermic needles could be seen being picked up after they were sprayed with a bleach solution by one of the crew members. While Lombardo was unable to provide an estimated cost for this operation, she said the biohazard removal costs alone are estimated to be $4,000 to $5,000. Over the last fiscal year, Caltrans spent nearly $179,000 on cleaning illegal homeless encampments, according to Lombardo. The figure includes cleaning costs and repairs to damaged fences, irrigation systems and other things. The wash is part of the culvert for runoff rainwater from Interstate 15. “If we get rain this winter, water will come off the freeway and into that drainage. We certainly don’t want any people in there when that happens,” she said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department notified Caltrans after receiving complaints from citizens and sending out their Homeless Outreach and Proactive Enforcement team to the area. Caltrans then posted a notice to vacate the illegal campsite. The notice read that the wash must be vacated by 8 a.m. on Monday. The notice was posted on Oct. 14. Caltrans sent out a maintenance crew on Monday to establish an access point for the crews to start the cleanups on Tuesday. Local business owner Dave Gross, who owns DG’s Lawncare, said he’s been lobbying to have the wash cleaned for a “couple years.” Gross is contracted as the landscape company for the Wal-Mart location and various other shopping centers locally, including Winco on Roy Rogers Drive. Gross said he was pleased to see the area being cleaned up, but he wasn't sure how long it would last. “I give it two, maybe three months before it’s back being filled with trash,” Gross said. “The city previously cleaned the area, not as thorough as Caltrans is doing, and that didn’t really last. I don’t know what it’s going to take but this is a serious problem." Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DD_JQuintero.
