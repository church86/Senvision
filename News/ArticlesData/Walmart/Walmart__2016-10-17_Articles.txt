Walmart recently launched its grocery pickup service, which allows customers to order online and then drive to the store at a scheduled time to have the order loaded into their car. Pictured are personal shopper Caren Hunter, left, and assistant manager Robert Van Ooijen at the Coors Bypass store. (Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Albuquerque’s two largest grocery retailers want to take some of the work out of shopping — at least the roaming-the-aisles-and-pushing-a-cart part. Walmart last month rolled out its grocery pickup service at four Albuquerque area stores. Now Smith’s plans to bring its own version to the Duke City too. The programs allow customers to buy anything from cauliflower to cat food without entering the store. Instead, they place online orders and schedule a pickup time at the location. Employees bring the bags out to them and even load them into the trunk. Advertisement Continue reading Walmart’s free service is available for orders of $30-plus; Smith’s tacks on a $4.95 fee. Neither chain says how many people use the service around the country, but both are in expansion mode. Smith’s parent, Kroger, launched ClickList in 2015. Smith’s, a Western division in seven states, currently offers it in Utah and Las Vegas, Nev., and Albuquerque should get it this year. The Smith’s at Montgomery and Tramway NE is scheduled to start ClickList pickups in December with some select metro sites to follow, according to Marsha Gilford, vice president of public affairs. “We can definitely say that those who are using it LOVE it and numbers are growing,” Gilford said in an email to the Journal. Walmart, meanwhile, increased availability of its service from five markets to 80 in the last year, according to the Washington Post. Both chains say they use specially trained employees to fulfill each customer’s online order, and that foods are safely stored — frozen or cooled as needed — until pickup. The program is not a way to unload expired yogurt or bruised apples, either. Jimmie Turner, a Walmart e-commerce market coach, said the staff will show the customer the chosen produce before loading it into the car. “If there’s something that they wouldn’t put in their shopping cart, they’re not going to put it in yours,” he said recently from the grocery pickup spots outside the Walmart at 10224 Coors Bypass NW. Walmart also offers the service at 1820 Unser NW, 460 N.M. 528 in Bernalillo and at 901 Unser SE in Rio Rancho. Online grocery shopping represents a significant growth opportunity, according to Morgan Stanley Research, which found that 34 percent of survey respondents expected to order groceries online in 2016. That’s up from 21 percent in 2015. Amazon offers online ordering and home grocery delivery through its Amazon Fresh service, but the program is not available in New Mexico.

Friday's raids, dubbed Operation Get Fit, targeted a dozen businesses owned by 58-year-old Steve Scott of Pelham, as well as his Shelby County home, and led to the arrests of Scott and 15 of his employees. A 17th person is still sought. The four-month investigation was led by the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, which is headed by the office of District Attorney Brandon Falls and the U.S. Secret Service. Falls said "boosters" have been stealing Fitbits, Nest Learning Thermostats, and numerous other items from a variety of area stores and then selling them to Scott's businesses. From there, the stolen items were then sold on eBay and Craigslist. "We feel like we've stopped a major pipeline," Falls said in a Tuesday news conference. Investigators fanned out Friday morning armed with search and arrest warrants at the businesses, which serve as pawn shops and provide payday loans and check cashing. The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Pelham police and the Shelby County District Attorney's Office also took part in Friday's arrests. At 10 a.m., officers descended on stores in Jefferson and Shelby counties, handcuffing employees and seizing dozens of boxes of business records and stolen goods. Jefferson County District Attorney Investigator Chris Clark and Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Raulston said the investigation began months ago when retailers realized hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise was being boosted off the shelves. The Fitbits, iPads and other "smart products" were disappearing from Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreen's, Lowes and Home Depot. Investigators from those stores teamed up with federal and Jefferson County authorities to launch Operation Get Fit, which culminated in Friday's roundup. Authorities believe the organized theft operation has been ongoing for at least two years. Once they realized what was happening, the retailers provided undercover officers with goods to present as stolen to the businesses owned by Scott, said Vestavia Hills police Capt. Kevin York. "The new, in-the-box property was presented as stolen,'' York said. "The clerks knew it was stolen when they took it in." Those taking part in Operation Get Fit with the District Attorney's Office and U.S. Secret Service included: Vestavia Hills, Birmingham, Mountain Brook, and Pelham police; Walmart Global Investigations, Target Special Investigations Team, Home Depot Corporate Investigators, CVS health Organized Retail Crime Unit, Walgreens Organized Retail Crime Unit, and Publix Organized Retail Crime Investigations. The recovered items are valued at more than $500,000. "The U.S. Secret Service is proud to work with its partners to dismantle a large-scale network of traffickers in stolen property and other criminal activities, said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Michael Williams. "This boosting and fencing, this is a criminal enterprise and what it does is add to the destruction of the community as a whole," Falls said. "Because at some point, those stores, those retailers, cannot survive and continue to do business in the community when they suffer the loss from crime." "When that becomes too great, the business just shuts down. That is when the entire community suffers. There is obvious loss of revenue in the form of taxes to the city,'' he said. "When that revenue goes away, so do the services that are provided with it. That's less money for roads, that's less money for schools and that's less money for fire departments." But that's not all it means, Falls said. "It means the loss of jobs for the community. It means there isn't a store down the street for people to go buy groceries, to go buy medicine, to go buy clothes for their kids,'' he said. "Those are the necessities of life, what every community needs to thrive, to survive." Falls said he was recently asked why they have dedicated the effort to white-collar crime and fraud. "When that business closes its doors, we lose all that it provides. It is because those necessities that these businesses provide to the community. They aren't just providing necessities, they are providing hope,'' he said. "In the last two years, we have seen an increase in violent crime in certain cities across the country, and one of the common characteristics in those cities is a lack of economic opportunity,'' Falls said. "In referring to that economic opportunity in Chicago, a city that has certainly seen an increase in violent, a city official said, 'Show me a man without hope, and I'll show you a man willing to pick up a gun.''' Falls said that's why they started the task force – to go after theft and fraud and everything that follows from it, which includes violent crime. "Crime doesn't happen in a vacuum, and the ramifications of it don't happen in a vacuum either, and those ramifications are made worse by the perception of crime in the area,'' he said. "And perception isn't limited to just the boundaries of the city of Birmingham; it affects the entire area. Because if people believe Birmingham is a high-crime area, they are going to think twice about moving their families here or opening businesses here." The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Fall said he'd like to have a detective from every city in Jefferson County, and even Shelby County, join the task force. "You really will be making a difference to fight crime and combat the violence in our area," he said.

Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story For all of Walmart’s ubiquity — the retailer has 4,629 locations in the United States — a singular proposed location in Mission had the apparent effect of stalling an entire development proposal. Now, with Walmart out of the picture for the Mission Gateway project, even skeptics of the plan seem to agree that New York developer Tom Valenti is on the right path with a plan that no longer includes the big box discount retailer. Walmart dropped out Valenti’s plans for Mission Gateway after the Mission City Council wouldn’t approve a preliminary site plan for a Walmart-anchored development at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Johnson Drive. Valenti addressed a crowd of Mission residents at the Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center last week about the future of Mission Gateway. Gone from the discussion was the acrimony over Walmart’s presence that had been a fixture in earlier debates about the project. Instead, a free-flowing conversation about possible tenants took place. “I feel good about the project and what’s in the project,” said Kristin Inman, a Mission council member who was elected in April over an incumbent who supported Valenti’s Walmart-anchored project. Inman’s qualified support — qualified because many details remain unknown about Valenti’s new plan — is crucial for the project’s future. So, too, is the mood of other council members like Nick Schlossmacher, who had also opposed Mission Gateway with a Walmart. “For me, the change to not having a single big-box store is definitely something that I’m excited about,” Schlossmacher said. “I feel a lot better about it.” Instead of a Walmart, Valenti’s plans call for three retailers occupying the east side of the 16-acre Mission Gateway development. That’s the only substantive change from his previous plan. Other elements — an Aloft hotel, an Element extended-stay hotel, other restaurants, smaller retailers and apartments — all remain. Debbie Kring, a council member since 1999 who has seen all of Valenti’s proposals since the Mission Mall met the wrecking ball on that site in 2005, said she objected to any big-box retailer in the project, not just a Walmart. She did welcome the inclusion of a hotel, which has been an on-again-off-again component of Mission Gateway over the years. “That’s a great plot of land and I really wanted that hotel back,” Kring said. It’s unknown how Mission Gateway will be financed. Valenti has made it clear that he will seek tax increment financing and a community improvement district to assist with the project. Both of those tools use taxes generated by the development to pay for certain project costs. Valenti has floated the possibility that he may seek general obligation bonds for at least part of the public financing, which means Mission would cover debt service payments to bondholders in case the development underperforms. Mission Mayor Steve Schwengerdt said previously that he prefers not to involve general obligation bonds. An alternative would be special obligation bonds, which depend solely on the revenues created by a project and don’t incur the city’s guarantee of debt payments. Inman echoed that sentiment. “Special (obligation bonds) would be much better for me,” she said. The other main question mark for Mission Gateway is the identity of those three retail tenants that will take Walmart’s space. Valenti declined to identify specific retailers, but said he is in pursuit of a grocery store, a computer-related business and a sporting goods concept. He said he hopes to start construction in the spring, a timeline that will depend on answering the remaining questions that surround Mission Gateway.

Walmart launches a free streaming service, Vudu Movies on Us Posted Oct 18, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Intel raises restructuring charge to $2.3B as it faces more challenges ahead Who’s copying Amazon? Everyone! But especially Walmart. Speaking of which, the retailer giant announced today the launch of its own video streaming service, called Vudu Movies on Us. The service at launch will include thousands of titles, which will be available in HD and can be streamed for free. To generate revenue, Vudu Movies on Us will be ad-supported. While Amazon’s Prime Video is a perk that comes with an Amazon Prime membership, then offers a variety of commercial-free movies and TV shows, including originals, Vudu Movies on Us will not have new releases. Instead, it will more narrowly focus on distributing free blockbuster titles and other classics, the company says. For example, at launch the service will include movies like “Mad Max,” “True Grit,” “Abduction,” and “School of Rock.” All will be available in 1080p high definition, and will support Dolby Digital sound when available, says Walmart. Vudu, of course, has been around for over a decade, allowing customers to rent and buy movies and TV shows through its marketplace. Walmart bought the service back in 2010. But today’s audience is more interested in streaming than owning, in many cases. With the new venture, Walmart can enter the on-demand streaming market without having to build out its own, exclusive content library – something that would have been a pricey way for Walmart to compete. Instead, Vudu Movies on Us competes with other ad-supported streaming services, like Yahoo View, which is the new home for Hulu’s free content, as well as Sony’s Crackle. In addition, citing research from Deloitte, Walmart notes that over 42 percent of U.S. consumers prefer to stream content at home, and most prefer movies and TV from ad-supported services. (Of course, many also prefer Netflix, according to the streaming service’s still growing numbers, announced yesterday.) The free titles are available now on Vudu, in a new section in the app. To find Movies on Us, click the “New” tab on the desktop or “Spotlight” if on mobile or on a living room device like Roku, Chromecast or consoles. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Walmart Founded 1962 Overview Walmart is a multinational retail corporation that operates several chains of discount department and warehouse stores.

The new service, Vudu Movies on Us, won’t include new releases or current TV series. Those will remain available only as premium-priced options. At launch, free movies include “Mad Max,” “True Grit,” “Abduction,” “School of Rock,” “Hoosiers,” “The Phantom of the Opera” (2004), “Young Adult,” “Margin Call,” “A Walk to Remember” and “The Magnificent Seven” (1960). Vudu says it will be adding more content in the coming months. “There’s no better value than free,” said Jeremy Verba, VP and GM of Vudu. “We see a gap in the marketplace for watching free HD movies on-demand.” With the retail giant’s push into premium ad-supported VOD, Vudu will compete for viewer attention and advertising budgets against AVOD players like Sony’s Crackle, AdRise’s TubiTV and Yahoo View (which has a licensing deal with Hulu to offer free shows), as well as the free, ad-supported services from networks like ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Verba said Vudu considered developing a subscription VOD service, “but we felt the ad-supported model was where we should focus.” According to the company’s research, more than half of Walmart shoppers said they’re interested in watching free or discounted ad-supported video services. More to the point: Competing against the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu would have required considerable investment on Walmart’s part to acquire exclusive, premium-grade content. Vudu’s free streaming service, besides generating new ad dollars, will give it a funnel of potential new customers for its core transactional business offering more than 100,000 titles for rent or purchase. Ever since it launched in 2007, Vudu has focused on delivering high-end digital video tech and earlier this year became the first service to integrate 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos Audio. The company will promote Vudu Movies on Us first to its several million registered users who have made a purchase on the service in the past. Verba said the AVOD service will then be marketed on Walmart.com and in Walmart stores, which receive 140 million visitors each week. “We have a great customer base built in we can promote this to,” said Verba. The Vudu Movies on Us selections will stream in 1080p HD, with Dolby Digital sound available for some titles, and can be watched across dozens of smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and connected-TV devices including Roku, Google’s Chromecast and video-game consoles. Vudu also is accessible on the web and via apps for iOS and Android devices. The free service — which is available only in the U.S., as is Vudu’s transactional storefront — will carry limited commercials, primarily pre-roll ads and some mid-roll spots, Verba said. TracFone Wireless and American Express are among the initial advertising partners, as well as local automotive dealerships whose ads will be targeted to viewers in designated market areas. “This is a big opportunity for advertisers. Consumer viewing habits are changing,” Verba said. “Leading up to this launch, we were very, very focused on making this a great customer experience, and we’ll work with advertising partners to shape the service.” Vudu’s main partner on the advertising sales and tech front is Ooyala, a New York-based online-video company owned by Australia’s Telstra. Vudu will work with Nielsen to track and report viewing of the free service on connected TVs and mobile at launch. Founded in 2004, Vudu was acquired by Walmart in 2010. Today, Vudu has about 100 employees based in Sunnyvale, Calif., while the retailer’s Walmart.com and e-commerce teams are based in San Bruno. Verba joined Vudu in mid-2014. He previously was CEO of online-dating site eHarmony, and has worked at Foundation Capital as an entrepreneur-in-residence, AOL and Zynga.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Walmart's Vudu Launches Free Ad-Supported Video on Demand By Jack Neff. Published on October 18, 2016. Credit: Walmart Most Popular Walmart is getting deeper into the media business, launching a free, ad-supported video-on-demand service, Vudu Movies on Us, offering high-definition feature films and TV titles in 1080p high definition with pre- and mid-roll advertising. The service available across devices will initially include such titles as "Mad Max," "True Grit," "Abduction" and "School of Rock." Vudu's existing offering is a digital rental service with prices ranging from 99 cents to $5.99, along with a service that allows people to get digital versions of DVDs they buy or already own. As part of Walmart, "Vudu is always looking for new ways for customers to save money, and nothing is more affordable than free," said Jeremy Verba, VP-general manager of Vudu. High definition will help set the service apart as offering "free without sacrificing quality," he said. Movies on Us fills a gap in the market as Mr. Verba sees it. He said research shows more than half of Walmart shoppers prefer free ad-supported video-on-demand to subscription services. That matches a recent Hub Entertainment Research study showing 53% had that preference. Yet pure ad-supported options remain sparse, with Hulu recently discontinuing its "free-with-ads" service in favor of a tiered subscription service that offers a discount for people who accept some ads. (Hulu offloaded its ad-supported service to Yahoo View, where it should become part of Verizon's offerings pending the close of its acquisition.) Walmart rival Amazon's Prime Video is ostensibly a subscription service, but the large portion of Prime members who pay the $99 annual subscription fee just for free two-day shipping without using the video or music streaming services in the bundle suggests they're widely viewed as a free throw-in. Mr. Verba said Walmart has opted initially not to bundle Movies on Us with its Prime-fighting $49 Shipping Pass service, which offers free two-day shipping on a wide range of online orders. "We'll watch for opportunities carefully as we go along," he said. "But for now it's a standalone offering." But no matter who's offering it, AVOD has an uphill battle. Despite consumers' stated preference for free ad-supported streaming, Hub's study found avoidance rife with 52%-56% of consumers skipping ads on AVOD when possible, 45% saying fast-forward disabling on VOD and online platforms is a "major frustration," and 83% of DVR users saying they skip ads most or all of the time. Also, plenty of people are willing to pony up to avoid ads. Netflix yesterday delivered an upside surprise in subscriber growth, which reached 46.5 million in the U.S. in the third quarter, up more than 4 million from a year ago. But Vudu, launched in 2004 and acquired by Walmart in 2010, has access to a huge potential customer base in Walmart stores, Walmart.com and Jet.com, including through the many TVs, smartphones, game consoles and other streaming devices sold there. Mr. Verba said Vudu plans to use its in-house advertising and distribution opportunities extensively in addition to advertising on outside digital channels, backed primarily by in-house creative. Vudu points to a 2014 Deloitte Digital Democracy survey showing 43% of U.S. consumers subscribe to a video streaming service, but even with recent growth, that leaves a majority who don't -- with most of them likely shopping at Walmart regularly. "We've been very much working with Walmart customers to bring them into the digital world, which has helped make us into one of the fastest-growing premium services," Mr. Verba said, with millions of users, though he didn't specify how many millions. At the same time, he sees Movies On Us as a way advertisers -- and Walmart suppliers -- can chase ever-elusive eyeballs. And it gets Walmart, which already offers suppliers programmatic digital media buying through its Walmart Exchange and numerous ways of advertising their products in and through its stores and websites, deeper into the business of selling advertising. AVOD is expected to reach nearly $11 billion in annual revenue within five years, Mr. Verba said. "Consumers expect to view content in an on-demand environment. This allows advertisers to reach those consumers where they are and where they're going." Initial advertisers include automotive and credit-card brands, in addition to Walmart. Vudu will work with Ooyala to sell advertising and ultimately "other partners as well," Mr. Verba said. It also will work with Nielsen on audience measurement and analytics initially, he said, but is open to working with other third-party measurement providers.

The retail giant is once again matching every dollar donated by customers at the till, to a maximum of $2,000 per store, until Oct. 28 as part of an annual fundraiser for the Canadian Red Cross to support communities across Canada affected by disaster. While the non-profit organization is best known for helping out during major disasters, they also offer emergency assistance for minor ones. “The things that get the most attention are things like the Fort McMurray fire in the way support was given out because it was on such a large scale, but a lot of the work we do is for individual families,” said Canadian Red Cross spokesperson Andrew Hopkins. “Every three hours, on average, the Red Cross responds to an emergency within Canada’s borders. Sometimes it just comes down to helping people get back to work, say for example, a mechanic loses his tools, but we want to make sure people are able to get back on their feet and back to work and get their lives back to normal, or what we call the new normal after a disaster has occurred. “ Recent recipients of their emergency assistance was a Surrey family who lost their home three months ago. Hairdresser and mother of three Catherine Sonpon came home from work June 22 to find her young family’s Johnson Heights rental apartment ablaze after a computer on the balcony malfunctioned. Nobody was hurt but several units were damaged and her own home was gutted. “I remember feeling sadness and pain,” said Sonpon. “My family was safe, and material losses are not as important, but I was still sad to lose all our stuff.” The City of Surrey provided immediate 72-hour assistance but the family – husband Emmanuel Aryitey and children aged two, three and seven months – required more help as they didn’t have home insurance to cover their losses. The family found themselves living at a local Sandman hotel and many of their immediate needs were met by donations of groceries, toiletries and other necessities of life by Walmart. “The Red Cross was very supportive. They help people in times of need - not just with financial assistance, but they showed us love and support to help us recover from the fire,” said Sonpon, who attended a promotional event Oct. 12 with her husband and kids at Walmart’s Guildford location to show their gratitude. “People usually think of the Red Cross responding to major disasters like an earthquake in other parts of the world. We didn’t even know they help people in Surrey recover from smaller disasters like our apartment fire.” She and Aryitey, also a hairstylist, are now back to work and helping their kids adjust to their new normal in a new home in Whalley. Since 2003, Walmart Canada has raised and donated nearly $29 million in disaster-relief funding. Funds raised during the annual fall campaign are set aside to help local families after disaster strikes in their respective communities and support the distribution of essential emergency supplies, hot meals, new clothing and a safe place to stay for those affected, as well as training and equipment for local volunteer teams.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council to discuss groundwater authority on short agenda Tuesday Oct 18, 2016 at 9:00 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 Does a short agenda mean a short meeting? The Ridgecrest City Council will find out Wednesday. The agenda for the meeting lists only one discussion/action item: providing direction to council rep Mayor Peggy Breeden on the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority regarding potential operational documents. The item is a follow-up to a previous issue. The IWVGA is in the process of developing its organizational structure and governing documents. Breeden previously declined to vote on an item regarding committee structure within the IWVGA and is seeking guidance from council how to proceed in the future. The next IWVGA meeting is scheduled for Oct. 20. An agenda for the meeting is included as an agenda amendment, along with the regular agenda at http://ridgecrest-ca.gov/council-agendas Also on the agenda is a consent calendar item regarding lighting and landscaping maintenance district annexation of the Walmart site and surrounding properties. According to a staff report, the Walmart site “is required to provide a maintenance district to cover the cost of operating and maintaining street lighting and landscaping.” In addition, other “area benefitted developers are required to annex their development into the existing City of Ridgecrest Landscaping and Lighting District. “This initial action by the City Council initiates the annexation process and declares the City’s intention to levy assessments for TPM 11790 and benefitted properties generally located in proximity to Bowman Road and S. China Lake Boulevard area (New Walmart area).” The staff report further states that “[t]he total annual maximum assessment amount being balloted for Annexation No. 2016-2 is $42,600.75 ($27,227.65 for Zone 02 and $15,373.10 for Zone 03). The total assessment proposed for Fiscal Year 2017/2018 is $36,043.96 ($20,827.99 for Zone 02 and $15,215.97 for Zone 03). These assessments if approved will be submitted to the County and collected on the property tax bills for Fiscal Year 2017/2018. Per the RMC, Section 19-2.3h the Walmart TPM is required to pay all costs for after acceptance of the facilities but prior to the time the assessment can be put upon the tax bill for a duration not to exceed one year. The City would be responsible for all costs from the end of the one year until the assessment is funded for by approximately January of 2018.” Also on the agenda is a proclamation honoring regional activist Ed Waldheim for his work with outdoor recreation in the area. A special closed session will kick off at 5 p.m. Six items are listed: potential ligation with Kern County, potential litigation with Southern California Edison, potential litigation with an unnamed potential litigant, existing litigation with William Johnson, USDC Eastern District of California; existing litigation with Matasantos, Sacramento County Superior Court; and existing litigation with Cohen, Sacramento County Superior Court. The regular council meeting is scheduled for October 5 at 6 p.m., at City Council Chambers at City Hall, 100 W. California Ave in Ridgecrest. It will also be broadcast on Mediacom Channel 6 and streamed online at www.ridgecrest-ca.gov/city-media/rc6-live.

SLIDE SHOW 10 States With the Scariest Death Taxes TOOL What Is My IRA Required Minimum Distribution? BUILDING WEALTH Kiplinger's Wealth Creation Web Conference Series Advertisement Health Care & Insurance 5 Ways to Save on Prescriptions The skyrocketing cost of drugs is inflicting pain. These strategies can help spell relief. Thinkstock By Kimberly Lankford, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, November 2016 Spending on prescription drugs has reached stratospheric levels, topping $457 billion in the U.S. last year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Most large employers point to the cost of specialty medications as the single biggest impetus for rising health care costs, with no relief in sight. Specialty drugs treat complex conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. They cost more because they usually require special handling and storage, and they may need to be administered via injection or infusion. They usually don’t have generic equivalents. SEE ALSO: Ways to Cut Healthcare Costs In the latest survey by the National Business Group on Health, large employers predict the cost to provide health benefits will rise by 6% in 2017, but they expect a 16.8% increase in spending for specialty medications. “It has really exploded,” says group president Brian Marcotte. “Back in 2014, if you would have asked employers about their top driver of health care costs, specialty drugs wouldn’t even have made the radar screen.” Why are costs rising so fast? More people are living longer with chronic conditions, and drug companies have been introducing new specialty medicines that are expensive to manufacture and administer. They’ve also been hiking prices for other brand-name drugs—with some eye-popping examples grabbing headlines. Finally, fewer patents have expired recently, slowing the introduction of new and cheaper generics. Advertisement In the past, you may have been shielded from the bulk of these costs if you had a low-deductible insurance policy with fixed-dollar co-payments. But employers and insurers have been making changes to their coverage as they search for ways to manage the skyrocketing expenses. They’re dropping some high-priced drugs from their formularies (their lists of covered drugs), imposing new restrictions on coverage, and requiring patients to shoulder a bigger share of the costs themselves. Instead of paying a fixed amount, such as $20 per 30-day supply, you may have to pay a percentage of the cost—such as 20% of the cost of brand-name drugs and 40% or more for pricey specialty medications. And more people now have high-deductible health insurance plans, making them responsible for the full cost until coverage kicks in. Even with a generous insurance policy, you could end up paying hundreds of dollars a month for your medications. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that people with Medicare Part D coverage who took drugs for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer could pay from $4,000 to $12,000 out-of-pocket in 2016 for one drug alone. You will probably have an opportunity to reassess your coverage soon. If you have health insurance through your employer, you generally pick a plan in October or November. Open enrollment runs from November 1 to January 31 for Obamacare exchanges and from October 15 to December 7 for Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. The following strategies can help you cut your drug costs. Keep them in mind as you compare plans during open-enrollment season. Find a Lower-Cost Alternative Advertisement Prescription drug costs can vary widely, and doctors may have no idea how much you’re paying. Switching to a similar, equally effective drug could save you hundreds of dollars. Always ask your doctor if there’s a generic version, which can cost up to 85% less than the brand-name version. Pharmacists can generally switch your medicine to a generic without a new prescription. If no generic is available, ask whether other therapies that do the same thing are available in a generic, says Jon Maesner, chief pharmacy officer for the insurer Cigna. Crestor, for example, a statin that lowers cholesterol levels, can cost $265 per month, and it did not have a generic version until earlier this year. But several other statins have generics, and they cost a lot less. For example, Zocor’s generic version, simvastatin, can cost $8 per month for 40 mg tablets; Lipitor’s generic, atorvastatin, can cost $11.36 per month for 20 mg tablets, says Michael Rea, a pharmacist who founded Rx Savings Solutions, which compares options for employers’ plans. If there’s no generic, you may be able to use another brand-name drug that costs less or has a lower co-payment, says Dr. Jeffrey Rice, CEO of Healthcare BlueBook, which helps people compare costs for medical care and drugs. These “therapeutic alternatives” are in the same class of drugs but vary a bit chemically. SEE ALSO: 11 Common Medicare Mistakes Your insurer or employer may have online tools to look up alternatives and see how much you can save (some doctors are incorporating such tools into their electronic medical records). Cigna, United Healthcare and Humana all have apps that show how much medicines cost under your plan. Advertisement Another option is to order a 90-day supply, which may cost only 2.5 times more than a 30-day supply, says John Lee, senior director of Medicare Part D for Walgreens. Or you might be able to pay less by switching from two tablets at a lower strength to one tablet at a higher strength, says Maesner. Splitting a higher-strength pill may help, but not all pills can be split. Your doctor or pharmacist may know of other creative ways to save. Use a Preferred Pharmacy The pharmacy you choose can also make a big difference in your out-of-pocket costs. Most Medicare Part D plans (and some other plans) now have preferred pharmacies, where you’ll pay a much lower portion of the costs. The Humana/Walmart Part D plan, for example, usually charges a $10 co-pay for preferred generics (those with lower co-payments than other generics). But you’ll have a $1 co-pay at Walmart and Sam’s Club and a $0 co-pay from the Humana Pharmacy mail-order network. Generics that are not on the preferred list have a $4 co-pay at Walmart and Sam’s Club (compared with a $20 co-pay at other pharmacies), and a $0 co-pay from Humana’s mail-order pharmacy. For nonpreferred brand-name drugs, you’d usually pay 45% to 50% coinsurance, but at Walmart and Sam’s Club or through Humana mail order, that drops to 35%. Advertisement If your plan doesn’t have a preferred pharmacy, or if you’re paying full price until you reach your deductible, you could save a lot of money by shopping around. Compare costs at local and mail-order pharmacies at GoodRx.com. (Don’t assume that mail order will be the best deal, says Rice.) Some generics cost less if you pay cash rather than use your insurance, such as the $4 deal at Walmart and Costco, says David Belk, of TrueCostofHealthcare.org. You can get discounts on 8,000 drugs if you use cash with the Walgreens card. More plans now offer specialty pharmacies for complex conditions. You may save money, and you’ll work with specially trained nurses and pharmacists who can complete paperwork for coverage and may know about resources for financial support, says Thom Stambaugh, vice president of specialty pharmacy for Cigna. Get Extra Help Even if your insurer covers the drug, you could face big out-of-pocket costs. And you will have to shoulder the full cost yourself until you reach your insurer’s deductible. But you might be able to piece together several sources of extra help. Ask your doctor and pharmacist about programs to help reduce the costs. Many drug manufacturers offer coupons that lower the cost of their drugs by hundreds of dollars. You can find coupons by looking up your drug at GoodRx.com or by searching the drug manufacturer’s website. Your doctor may also have coupons. Jeffrey Rice says his son was prescribed a medicine that cost $500 and, when his wife called the doctor to ask about alternatives, he gave her a coupon that cut the cost to $10. “The frightening thing is, this happens every day with medicines, and people don’t know,” Rice says. The manufacturer programs aren’t available to Medicare beneficiaries, and some coupons and programs are not available if you use private insurance, either. But if you haven’t met your deductible, you could pay cash for the drugs using the coupon, then submit the receipt after you are closer to meeting the deductible, says Rice. Or you may be eligible for a pharmacy assistance program offered by the drug manufacturer or a private foundation. Some of these programs are based on income, but the income requirements may be as high as 500% of the federal poverty level (which works out to nearly $80,000 for a couple). Other assistance programs may kick in if you’ve spent more than a certain percentage (such as 3%) of your income on out-of-pocket costs for your drugs, says Honora Gabriel, vice president of the Lash Group, which administers many assistance programs. Look up programs at www.needymeds.org. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries can get extra help, too; see www.benefitscheckup.org. Local or state nonprofits may offer assistance. You can find them through advocacy groups for your condition. Your doctor’s office may also know of assistance programs, and some large oncology firms have a financial navigator specifically to help, says Kirsten Sloan, senior policy director for the American Cancer Society. Finally, check out free prescription savings cards, such as FamilyWize.org and GoodRx.com. Make the Most of Tax Breaks Take advantage of tax breaks that can help with your out-of-pocket expenses. You can withdraw money tax-free from a health savings account or a flexible spending account to pay for prescription drugs (insulin is eligible without a prescription). And you can use your account for over-the-counter drugs with a prescription (see a list of eligible expenses at FSAstore.com). Any other drug costs can count toward the tax deduction for medical expenses, if you itemize. You can deduct eligible medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (or 7.5% of AGI in 2016 if you’re 65 or older). Know the Rules and Fight Back If your plan denies coverage for a drug your doctor prescribes, ask why. You or your doctor may only need to complete more paperwork. Almost all large employers now require prior authorization before covering certain expensive medications (requiring your provider to fill out forms about your medical condition) or use step therapy (requiring you to try other, less-expensive drugs first, if possible). Sometimes coverage is denied because the drug is not on the plan’s formulary. “More often than not, when something is not covered, there is an alternative that is covered,” says William Fleming, president of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. You can file an appeal if your doctor wants to use the drug that isn’t covered. Get the doctor to explain why the drug is necessary, says David Lipschutz, senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy. And find out about the appeal rules before you pick a plan, especially if you have a complex medical condition, says Sloan, of the American Cancer Society.

The Wal-Mart center emerged as the media staging area for Monday’s fire scene that startled many residents. Evacuations occurred for Schubarth Trail, the Farish area, Rampart Reservoir and Rampart Range Road, sough of Loy Creek. Fire rescue crews had to fight the blaze on foot due to the terrain. Several area department responded to the scene, along with members of the Colorado Springs Utilities. The fire was started southwest of the reservoir. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation. The firefighting efforts also were assisted by helicopters and air support for much of the afternoon. The blaze broke out shortly after 1:30 p.m. during a time of extreme fire danger, capped by high winds. Kirby advised residents to remain vigilant and keep posted of media reports. The fire didn’t threaten any homes in Woodland Park or the lower Ute Pass, but the area was flooded with emergency service and police vehicles. Despite a flurry of rumors, U.S. Hwy. 24 was not shut down. Fire officials contend that the conditions are ripe for a major blaze. Besides the Rampart blaze, crews had to combat the Junkins fire in Custer County. Stage One fire restrictions are now in place for unincorporated El Paso County until further notice, according to the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office.

Will Xiaomi’s plans to undercut Apple, Amazon, and Roku in the set-top box market succeed? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 17, 2016 at 8:41PM Xiaomi is one of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest rivals in the Chinese smartphone market, but the six-year-old start-up has only taken baby steps into the U.S. market. It launched a U.S. shopping portal for headphones, power banks, fitness trackers, and other accessories last year. Earlier this year, it declared its intentions to enter the U.S. smartphone market despite tough competition and concerns about saturation. But before taking that big step, Xiaomi is taking a swing at another market where Apple looms large -- set-top boxes. Xiaomi recently launched the Mi Box -- an Android TV box which comes with Sling TV, Pandora, and Vudu credit -- as its first major hardware push into the U.S. market. The device is currently available on its U.S. website and at Vudu parent company Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) stores. Image source: Xiaomi. Will Xiaomi gain a foothold in this market? At $69, the Mi Box is one of the cheapest 4K-capable streaming devices on the market. Roku's Premiere and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) second-gen Fire TV both stream 4K video, but respectively cost $80 and $100. The fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at $150, doesn't support 4K video. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Google Chromecast Ultra will support 4K streaming for $69, but it's a casting dongle (which streams content from a mobile device) instead of a full-featured Android TV box. While the Mi Box is competitively priced, it faces tough competition from entrenched market leaders. Strategy Analytics reports that the Chromecast controlled 35% of the global streaming device in 2015, up from 24% in 2014. Apple TV's share slid from 22% to 20% between those two years, while Fire TV and Roku both claimed 15% shares to tie for third place. The remaining 13% of the market was split among smaller players. Image source: Google. Xiaomi's biggest weakness against these bigger players is its lack of brand recognition in the U.S., where it's probably only known to tech enthusiasts. So to compete against Apple, Amazon, and Roku, Xiaomi could boost its marketing spend. But doing so could be tough since Xiaomi's last known operating margin was less than 2% in 2013 -- a figure which is probably now much lower due to the commoditization of the Chinese smartphone market. A smarter idea would be to co-promote the Mi Box with Wal-Mart, which would benefit from sales of set-top boxes pre-loaded with Vudu. Gaining more Vudu users might help Wal-Mart compete more effectively against Amazon Prime's sprawling digital ecosystem of streaming videos, e-books, cloud storage, and "frictionless" orders with Dash buttons and DRS-enabled appliances. Google, which would benefit from strong sales of the Android-powered Mi Box, could also be a strong ally -- the tech giant already promoted the device during the announcement of Google Home in May. Is Xiaomi really making a play for smart homes? On the surface, it seems like Xiaomi is just testing out the U.S. market with the Mi Box to see if it's suitable for a smartphone push in the future. But it could also be about establishing a hub for its other smart home devices. In the Greater China area, Xiaomi already sells smart home devices like smart TVs, air purifiers, water purifiers, smart LED lamps, and even rice cookers. These devices are all tethered together with its Mi Home app. The Mi Box would serve as a great central hub for all those devices. Xiaomi's Air Purifier 2. Image source: Xiaomi. Therefore, selling enough Mi Boxes into U.S. homes could pave the way for Xiaomi to bring its other smart home devices -- which are also sold on the same low-margin model as its smartphones -- to the U.S. market. Selling enough of those devices would make it a household brand, making it much easier to launch smartphones stateside. It's arguably a bolder strategy than Apple's game plan of letting other companies create HomeKit compatible gadgets, and more ambitious than Amazon and Google's dependence on data-gathering smart speakers and partnerships with other hardware makers. But it's still a long shot... Xiaomi might take a bite out of the streaming device market with its low-cost 4K boxes, but it's still a long shot due to the brand's low recognition. Newer smart TVs, which already run Android, could also greatly reduce demand for Android TV set-top boxes this holiday season. But despite those challenges, Xiaomi might surprise Apple, Amazon, and Roku if Wal-Mart heavily promotes the device during the holidays. If the Mi Box can help Xiaomi gain enough momentum in the U.S. market, more Mi branded devices might not be that far behind.

Roku's Premiere and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) second-gen Fire TV both stream 4K video, but respectively cost $80 and $100. The fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at $150, doesn't support 4K video. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Google Chromecast Ultra will support 4K streaming for $69, but it's a casting dongle (which streams content from a mobile device) instead of a full-featured Android TV box. While the Mi Box is competitively priced, it faces tough competition from entrenched market leaders. Strategy Analytics reports that the Chromecast controlled 35% of the global streaming device in 2015, up from 24% in 2014. Apple TV's share slid from 22% to 20% between those two years, while Fire TV and Roku both claimed 15% shares to tie for third place. The remaining 13% of the market was split among smaller players. Image source: Google. Xiaomi's biggest weakness against these bigger players is its lack of brand recognition in the U.S., where it's probably only known to tech enthusiasts. So to compete against Apple, Amazon, and Roku, Xiaomi could boost its marketing spend. But doing so could be tough since Xiaomi's last known operating margin was less than 2% in 2013 -- a figure which is probably now much lower due to the commoditization of the Chinese smartphone market. A smarter idea would be to co-promote the Mi Box with Wal-Mart, which would benefit from sales of set-top boxes pre-loaded with Vudu. Gaining more Vudu users might help Wal-Mart compete more effectively against Amazon Prime's sprawling digital ecosystem of streaming videos, e-books, cloud storage, and "frictionless" orders with Dash buttons and DRS-enabled appliances. Google, which would benefit from strong sales of the Android-powered Mi Box, could also be a strong ally -- the tech giant already promoted the device during the announcement of Google Home in May. Is Xiaomi really making a play for smart homes? On the surface, it seems like Xiaomi is just testing out the U.S. market with the Mi Box to see if it's suitable for a smartphone push in the future. But it could also be about establishing a hub for its other smart home devices. In the Greater China area, Xiaomi already sells smart home devices like smart TVs, air purifiers, water purifiers, smart LED lamps, and even rice cookers. These devices are all tethered together with its Mi Home app. The Mi Box would serve as a great central hub for all those devices. Xiaomi's Air Purifier 2. Image source: Xiaomi. Therefore, selling enough Mi Boxes into U.S. homes could pave the way for Xiaomi to bring its other smart home devices -- which are also sold on the same low-margin model as its smartphones -- to the U.S. market. Selling enough of those devices would make it a household brand, making it much easier to launch smartphones stateside. It's arguably a bolder strategy than Apple's game plan of letting other companies create HomeKit compatible gadgets, and more ambitious than Amazon and Google's dependence on data-gathering smart speakers and partnerships with other hardware makers. But it's still a long shot... Xiaomi might take a bite out of the streaming device market with its low-cost 4K boxes, but it's still a long shot due to the brand's low recognition. Newer smart TVs, which already run Android, could also greatly reduce demand for Android TV set-top boxes this holiday season. But despite those challenges, Xiaomi might surprise Apple, Amazon, and Roku if Wal-Mart heavily promotes the device during the holidays. If the Mi Box can help Xiaomi gain enough momentum in the U.S. market, more Mi branded devices might not be that far behind.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Our View: Walmart's investment in workers is paying off Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 8:46 PM Bulletin Editorial Board In business, sometimes you get what you pay for. That’s the lesson for Walmart, the ubiquitous big-box retailer which is trying to reverse a sales drop and improve its stores by breaking with the long tradition of paying its employees paltry wages. It’s too early to say much about the financial impact, but the move so far seems to be working, according to an analysis from the New York Times. And that suggests something for all employers: Paying your workers well, even above the going rate, and offering more in the way of training and advancement opportunities creates more loyal, hard-working and productive employees — and can actually boost profits, not depress them. A few years ago, less than 1 in 5 Walmart stores was meeting the company’s customer service goals. Customers complained that employees were scarce, checkout lines long, inventory disorganized and bathrooms dirty. Walmart, a public company for more than four decades, posted its first-ever annual revenue decline in 2015. About a year and a half ago, Walmart announced it would start paying workers who completed a training course to $10 an hour. Department manager pay improved from $12 hourly to $15. The company’s average nonmanagerial pay is now $13.69 per hour. At the same time, the company started building new training centers and made a push to create more predictable and flexible schedules to hourly employees. Now, 75 percent of Walmart stores are meeting customer service benchmarks. Sales are creeping up again. The real fiscal impact is yet to be realized, with income down 6 percent at Walmart’s U.S. stores in the last quarter — thanks in some part to higher wages and other investments — and its stock still underperforming. But the experiment suggests a basic truth about workers — that incentivizing us with better pay and opportunity tends to boost our happiness and performance, an idea economists call “efficiency wages.” And if the company’s slump turns around, we will have some evidence that that better performance can lead to higher profits — even though the operating costs are higher. Walmart being the largest private employer in the country, its practices and its fortunes can profoundly influence other employers. We are heartened that the company is starting to set a better example. That’s our opinion. What’s yours? Email letters@norwichbulletin.com.

Aside from not keeping your purse on your car seat, truck toppers can seriously protect your belongings. "You can't tell if there's anything in it or not unless you get in it," says Wingrob. There are other ways to keep your belongings out of the hands of lurkers. "We always recommend parking as close to the store as you can, park near surveillance cameras," says Detective David Allard with the Beckley Police Department. This way police can track down the person with the sticky fingers faster.  Even if police can't catch them in the act, they have other ways to find these criminals. "We have a pawn shop database here in Beckley, every pawn shop reports to it, it's all electronic so the second something is pawned were are able to check," says Detective Allard. Once the police track down the criminal, the consequences are serious. "If it's over $1,000 it becomes a felony and it becomes 1 to 10 years, if it's under $1,000 it's up to one year." The Beckley Police Department also highly recommends if you suspect someone being suspicious, report it. A good way to report crimes is to visit crimestoppersofraleighcounty.org.

 Walmart's price cuts should terrify Target, Dollar General, and Family Dollar Hayley Peterson Oct. 17, 2016, 5:25 PM 25,804 facebook linkedin twitter email print A woman and child shop at Walmart to Go convenience store in Bentonville Thomson Reuters Walmart is slashing prices, and that's having a ripple effect across the retail industry. The companies most vulnerable to Walmart's price cuts, which were launched earlier this year, include Target, Family Dollar, and Dollar General, according to a 56-page UBS analysis published Monday.  All three companies stand to lose a collective $35 billion in revenue as a result of Walmart's cuts, according to the report. Target has about $21.5 billion in sales at risk (or about 30% of its total sales), Dollar General has about $9 billion in sales at risk (39% of sales), and Family Dollar has about $4.5 billion in sales at risk (20% of sales), analysts said. The UBS analysts measured the potential risk to each company by looking at how exposed they are geographically to Walmart stores, as well as how much of their product assortment overlaps. Target is among the most exposed, with 71% of its stores within a 10-minute drive of Walmart, and 90% of its stores within a 20-minute drive of Walmart. A Target store team member places an item back on the shelf near the pharmacy department at a Target store in Los Angeles, California August 18, 2009. Reuters If Target, Dollar General, and Family Dollar respond to Walmart's price cuts by also slashing prices, then earnings per share for each company could drop by 6%, 5%, and 3% respectively, as a result, according to the analysts. If they don't follow Walmart's lead and also cut prices, then all three companies could lose sales due to loss in market share — meaning customers could choose to shop at Walmart over Target or dollar stores because it's cheaper.  Walmart's price cuts  are part of a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment that the company launched in the first quarter of the year. Since December, the company has dropped prices by 10% in its grocery department, according to Business Insider's most recent price check at a Richmond, Virginia store. Target, by comparison, is about 15% more expensive than Walmart in the grocery department. No matter how the price wars shake out, they are are good news for customers, because the cost of goods is only going to get cheaper.  SEE ALSO: Target's groceries are shockingly more expensive than Walmart's — and it highlights a huge challenge for the business NOW WATCH: These are the best watches at every price point Loading video...

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Oct 17th 2016 3:52PM Walmart is becoming a better place to shop because it started paying employees more. For many years, the company was plagued by widespread complaints about poor customer service at its stores. SEE ALSO: You shouldn't order this kind of meat at a restaurant That was until last year when Walmart, under pressure from investors following several quarters of same-store sales declines, decided to invest billions of dollars in wage increases and training for workers. Specifically, Walmart committed to investing $2.7 billion over two years in higher wages, scheduling improvements, and employee training, following in the footsteps of companies like Costco. Walmart's efforts so far have translated into a pay raise of about 16% to $13.69 per hour for non-managerial full-time employees, The New York Times reports. In the meantime, widespread issues in Walmart stores such as empty shelves and cleanliness have significantly improved. 31 PHOTOS 30 items to avoid buying at Wal-Mart See Gallery 30 items to avoid buying at Wal-Mart 1. Any food with a long or short shelf life According to Michael Catania, consumer savings expert and co-founder of PromotionCode.org, you'll want to stay away from Walmart foods that have longer and shorter shelf lives. Foods with shorter shelf lives tend to cost more, and foods with longer shelf lives might turn stale before consumption. "Once the cereal goes stale and you throw it away, you've also thrown away the initial savings," said Catania. But, that doesn't mean you have to avoid all of Walmart's canned and packaged foods. Catania recommends buying small and medium-sized foods at Walmart — they "will net you the best result for both cost and freshness," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 2. Snacks Store-brand snacks at Walmart are cheaper than at some of its retailer competitors. But Walmart just can't beat the low cost of dollar store food. Stock up on crackers, chips, cookies and other goods for only a buck at discount stores — just make sure you check the expiration dates. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 3. Organic Fruits and Vegetables Although Walmart has upped its selection of organic foods to accommodate the health-conscious subsection of its shoppers, you're usually better off buying organic foods from stores with organic roots, like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. "Shopping at stores with organic roots makes sense when these are the items you are purchasing," said Kerry Sherin, a savings expert from Offers.com. According to Sherin, these stores tend to have better selections and lower prices on organic foods. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 4. Fresh Produce When shopping for fresh produce, you're most likely better off shopping at your go-to grocery store than at Walmart. Even you're not happy with your grocery store's offerings, try Sprouts. "I often find Sprouts has better deals on fresh produce compared to Walmart," said Kendal Perez, a savings expert with coupon and deals site CouponSherpa.com. "For example, Sprouts recently had avocados on sale for 88 cents each, compared to $1.88 each from Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 5. Brand-Name Diapers Most retailers can't beat the price of Walmart's store-brand diapers. However, if you prefer brand names, like Pampers, you'll be better off buying from Amazon where diapers tend to be just a tad bit cheaper. Plus, if you join Amazon Family, you could get 20 percent off qualifying diaper purchases. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 6. Batteries As far as batteries go, experts tend to agree you're better off buying them at warehouse stores rather than Walmart. "Batteries are always a better buy in bulk, with Costco and Sam's Club offering more batteries for less per unit," said Perez. Sherin from Offers.com agrees. "If you want to get the best deal on batteries, buy them from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club, which will have the best rate on the largest pack of batteries." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 7. Straight Talk Wireless Straight Talk Wireless aims "to get people on America's best networks without the expense — or the commitment that comes with contracts," according to its website. However, many people report Straight Talk Wireless has poor coverage and bad customer service. "The absolute worst item to buy at Walmart is their Straight Talk Wireless service," said Benjamin K. Glaser, features editor of online deals site, DealNews.com. "Every time we write about it on DealNews, our readers flood the comments with tales of terrible customer service driving them back to their old carriers. Many also received poor coverage, but even those who were happy with their phones and connections were driven away by the customer service." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 8. Music Unless you're looking for vinyl records, skip Walmart's CDs and stick to online streaming services for your music needs. Spotify Premium only costs $9.99 a month, as does Apple Music. Even Jay Z's new streaming service, Tidal, is affordable at $9.99 or $19.99 a month. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 9. Gift Bags and Wrapping Paper Don't head to Walmart for wrapping paper or gift bags — you'll find cheaper prices (and a wider selection) elsewhere. "Walmart strives on its convenience of being able to offer up everyday items at low prices," said Sherin. "But when it comes to gift wrap and gift bags, you can find the real savings at dollar stores." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Remember: If you save money on wrapping paper, that's more money you have available to spend on gifts. 10. Gift Cards Yes, you can find a generous selection of gift cards in Walmart's checkout lines, whether you're looking for retail or restaurant certificates. Buy why buy full-price gift cards at Walmart when you can buy discounted gift cards online? "Walmart is a great stop for gifts and last-minute items," said Sherin. "However, if you have the time to plan ahead on your purchase of a gift card, look at sites like Raise and Cardpool, which offer discounted gift cards. You can find savings of 20 percent to 30 percent off what you would pay for face value at Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 11. PC Laptops Walmart sells laptops, but you'll find better, high-quality laptops somewhere. "Walmart has low prices on electronics like laptops and TVs, but the brands are also lower quality," said Perez of CouponSherpa.com. You can also find better laptop deals by doing a little comparison shopping. Glaser of DealNews.com revealed that Walmart has not had any notable laptop deals in a while. "Walmart has not had an Editors Choice laptop deal in the last two months," he said. Instead, you're likely to find better prices on laptops from Lenovo, Dell, Microsoft, eBay and Newegg. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 12. Televisions "While it can be hard to resist paying $150 for a 40-inch TV, sometimes if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is," explained Sherin. "If you are really wanting to invest in a quality TV, stick with retailers like Best Buy whose specialty is electronics." Glaser adds that you can even find better deals on high-end TVs at other competitors. "For the higher quality TVs, Dell Home and eBay consistently offer better deals," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 13. Books Online retailers give Walmart a run for its money in the books and music department. "When it comes to entertainment — be it books, music or TV shows — you're typically better off shopping Amazon," reports MarketWatch. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 14. Printer Ink Running out of printer ink is annoying. Not only does it happen at the worst time, but ink cartridge packages can cost as much as $60 at Walmart. However, you can usually find cheaper printer ink online. "Unless a store is doing a ridiculous sale, printer ink is always less expensive online," said Paul Moyer of SavingFreak.com. "You can purchase re-manufactured cartridges for as much as 50 percent off the price you would pay in Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 15. Jewelry With discounted jewelry at Walmart, you get what you pay for — low-quality pieces. "If you are buying jewelry at what would be deemed a discount store, don't expect to get the best quality items," said Sherin. Instead, she advised you try shopping at Macy's or Kay's, "who have experts that can walk you through the process of picking out a quality piece of jewelry." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 16. Wood Furniture Walmart is famous for the incredibly low prices on furniture — particularly bookshelves and television consoles. And although Walmart's furniture is great for college students or those who have a small budget, it's always best to invest in higher-quality furniture that will last longer — even if it will cost you extra, said Sherin. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 17. Bedding Walmart's bedding selection isn't always the highest quality, and you can often do better elsewhere. If you prefer quality over price, wait for sales and buy bedding from similar stores. "You can find similar pricing for much higher quality at a discount retailer like HomeGoods or Marshalls," said Andrea Woroch, a consumer and money-saving expert. "Otherwise, shop sales at department stores like Macy's and JCPenney, and look for coupons via CouponSherpa.com to find applicable deals to get high-quality bedding for less." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 18. Pet Food Before buying pet food at Walmart, compare the cost of buying in bulk from Amazon or a wholesale club. I compared Walmart prices with Sam's Club and found that the latter offered a generally better deal when purchasing in bulk. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 19. Small Kitchen Appliances Amazon and Walmart offer similar prices on some of their household appliances — but not on everything. A good rule of thumb is to buy smaller items in bulk online, and price compare anything bigger before buying it at Walmart. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 20. Large Kitchen Appliances If your dishwasher or fridge breaks down, fight the urge to run to Walmart. You might find a better deal at competing retailers. "If you are needing to replace that pesky dishwasher or looking for a new refrigerator, Walmart may not be the place to find the sweetest deal," said Sherin. "We see stores like Sears and Best Buy excel in the appliance department, often offering free installation, home delivery and removal of the old appliance." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 21. Kitchenware It doesn't matter if you're buying glasses, mugs or dinnerware — I've found that Walmart's prices can't beat the dollar stores when it comes to kitchenware. Try browsing Dollar General's selection — you'll get more items for your money. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 22. Tires Need new tires? Skip Walmart, and get your next set of wheels from Sam's Club or Costco. Costco, for example, even offers free tire balancing and rotations. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 23. Greeting Cards Rather than spend $2 or $3 per greeting card at Walmart, check out the selection of cards at Dollar General or the Family Dollar. I found cards for every occasion at Dollar General starting at $1. Woroch and Perez had the same experience. "The best deal for greeting cards and gift wrap is at the dollar store; you can't beat their prices," said Woroch. "While Walmart sells a few cards for 99 cents, most of their greeting cards are $3 to $5," added Perez. "I can buy two-for-$1 greeting cards from Dollar Tree, plus pay just $1 for gift wrap, bags, tissue, bows and more." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 24. Outdoor Items You'll find ample garden supplies, lawn care equipment and patio furniture at Walmart, and the prices aren't bad, either. Unfortunately, in my experience, the quality isn't great. You might get more use out of outdoor equipment purchased from Home Depot or Lowe's, which both have a better selection and higher-quality merchandise. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 25. Hair Supplies It doesn't make sense to spend several bucks for single hair accessories at Walmart. You can get many of the same items for $1 at dollar stores. I've found that Walmart prices tend to be higher for hair bows, headbands, combs and other hair supplies. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 26. Disposable Utensils A plastic kitchen utensil set at Walmart could run you between $10 and $15 for six or nine pieces, whereas I found individual pieces at Dollar Tree for as low as $1. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 27. Office and School Supplies Walmart's back-to-school deals might be cheaper than the deals advertised by other retailers, but if you're shopping for office or school supplies during other times of the year, I've found Walmart to be far more expensive than discount stores like the Dollar Tree. There, you'll find better deals on crayons, pens, markers, tape, glue, packing supplies and storage. Woroch recommends checking other stores' sales before heading to Walmart. "During back-to-school season, office suppliers like Office Depot and Staples run lots of sales where you can find penny deals on essentials like folders, notebooks and pencils," she said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 28. Party Supplies Walmart has an entire aisle dedicated to party supplies, but these items are more expensive than other discount retailers. According to my research, you can stock up on party supplies at the Dollar Tree for far less. Purchase invitations, balloons, party favors and decorations — all for just a buck each. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 29. Cleaning Supplies From laundry detergent to disinfecting wipes, Walmart's cleaning supplies are more expensive than the Family Dollar and Dollar General. You'll typically save between 30 cents and 50 cents by shopping at these discount retailers instead. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 30. Personal Hygiene Products If you don't mind buying generic lotion, toothpaste or deodorant, stock up on personal hygiene products at the Dollar Tree. Walmart does have a huge selection of personal hygiene products, and in many cases it offers better deals than its big-box competitors. Still, Walmart's generic brands can't match dollar store prices. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Three out of four Walmart stores now meet the company's own customer service standards, according to the Times. A couple years ago, just 16% of its stores met those goals. It turns out that paying people more may have made them better employees. "Associates are feeling a little bit more engaged," Walmart US President Greg Foran told reporters earlier this year. The company is even seeing sales and traffic improvements. Walmart recently reported its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales increases in the US. In the most recent quarter, Walmart's US same-store sales rose 1.6%, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. The changes aren't going unnoticed by customers. "Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call in August. Walmart has said it's raising wages because "it's the right thing to do," however one recent pay hike appears to be the result of President Obama's new overtime rule, which takes effect December 1. The rule requires employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year. Last week, Walmart announced that it would raise starting salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for full-time employees. The strategy of investing more in training and career development has proven to be massively successful for companies like Costco, which gets high ratings from both employees and customers. Costco's minimum wage is no less than $13 an hour, which is among the highest starting salaries in the retail industry. By comparison, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Walmart's investments have brought its starting wages to $10 an hour, according to the company. At Costco employees also get to advance quickly. It takes about four years for employees to reach the top of Costco's hourly pay scale, according to Bloomberg. Labor groups argue however that Walmart and others still have a long way to go in improving pay and working conditions for their employees. The union-backed group Making Change At Walmart has been pushing Walmart to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. The group claims that not all Walmart's workers are making a minimum of $10, as the company claims.

 Walmart is copying one of Costco's winning strategies — and it's working Hayley Peterson Oct. 18, 2016, 9:03 AM 13,700 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is paying employees more. David McNew/Getty Images Walmart is becoming a better place to shop because it started paying employees more. For many years, the company was plagued by widespread complaints about poor customer service at its stores. That was until last year when Walmart, under pressure from investors following several quarters of same-store sales declines, decided to invest billions of dollars in wage increases and training for workers. Specifically, Walmart committed to investing $2.7 billion over two years in higher wages, scheduling improvements, and employee training, following in the footsteps of companies like Costco. Walmart's efforts so far have translated into a pay raise of about 16% to $13.69 per hour for non-managerial full-time employees, The New York Times reports. In the meantime, widespread issues in Walmart stores such as empty shelves and cleanliness have significantly improved. Three out of four Walmart stores now meet the company's own customer service standards, according to the Times. A couple years ago, just 16% of its stores met those goals. It turns out that paying people more may have made them better employees. Shoppers look at merchandise at a Walmart store in Secaucus, New Jersey Thomson Reuters "Associates are feeling a little bit more engaged," Walmart US President Greg Foran told reporters earlier this year. The company is even seeing sales and traffic improvements. Walmart recently reported its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales increases in the US. In the most recent quarter, Walmart's US same-store sales rose 1.6%, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. The changes aren't going unnoticed by customers. "Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call in August. Walmart has said it's raising wages because "it's the right thing to do," however one recent pay hike appears to be the result of President Obama's new overtime rule, which takes effect December 1. The rule requires employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year. Last week, Walmart announced that it would raise starting salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for full-time employees. Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images The strategy of investing more in training and career development has proven to be massively successful for companies like Costco, which gets high ratings from both employees and customers. Costco's minimum wage is no less than $13 an hour, which is among the highest starting salaries in the retail industry. By comparison, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Walmart's investments have brought its starting wages to $10 an hour, according to the company. At Costco employees also get to advance quickly. It takes about four years for employees to reach the top of Costco's hourly pay scale, according to Bloomberg. Labor groups argue however that Walmart and others still have a long way to go in improving pay and working conditions for their employees. The union-backed group Making Change At Walmart has been pushing Walmart to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. The group claims that not all Walmart's workers are making a minimum of $10, as the company claims. "We continue to hear from Walmart workers who have been making less than $10 for months," Making Change At Walmart spokeswoman Jess Levin said last month.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Azusa man accused of Hesperia Wal-Mart stabbing held on $1 million bail Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 11:30 AM Oct 17, 2016 at 5:53 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero HESPERIA — A 31-year-old Azusa man arrested after authorities say he stabbed a man in a motor home in the Wal-Mart parking lot Saturday was being held in lieu of $1 million bail, booking records show. If criminally charged, Darrell Lee Garrett is expected to be arraigned in a Victorville courtroom Tuesday afternoon. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies arrested Garrett on suspicion of attempted murder after responding to the Wal-Mart at 13401 Main Street at approximately 1:51 p.m. Saturday. Authorities said Garrett was found and apprehended inside the business. An 8-year-old boy related to Garrett was also inside the store, authorities said. A deputy was injured during an attempt to apprehend Garrett. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jodi Miller said the deputy was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and was released later Saturday. The boy was taken into custody by Children and Family Services. Authorities found the victim suffering from a stab wound and he was transported to a local hospital. Miller also said that she did not have an update on the victim, but his condition on Saturday was stable. “His injuries were not believed to be life threatening,” Miller said in an email Monday. The store was temporarily evacuated. A witness previously told the Daily Press that a crew cleaned up what appeared to be blood at the store's entrance and near the motor home. Garrett was being held at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, booking records show. Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com.

Celebrity News 19 0 0 October 17, 2016 Miley Cyrus Wants ‘Pansexual’ Added To LGBT Terms, Liam Hemsworth Wedding Called Off Over Pot? Joanne Eglash Miley Cyrus has transformed herself from her Hannah Montana days and her “Wrecking Ball” singer wild-child stage to a coach on The Voice. Now, the reinvented singer is speaking out about her views on everything from politics to sexuality and, in the process, sharing her own coming-out story and hopes for helping others. Good work: @MileyCyrus foundation Happy Hippie supports at-risk LGBTQ & homeless youth – On @NBCTheVoice to drive ithttps://t.co/8UMm6vhzlD — Dr Bradley Fordham (@doctorfordham) October 11, 2016 Cyrus told Variety that she has a goal of helping homeless and at-risk LGBTQ youth. Reflecting on her journey to become a woman with that goal after growing up in the public spotlight on Hannah Montana, Miley recalls a milestone that reflects her choices. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart. And you see what I did — I chose weed.” Another pivotal moment occurred in 2013 at the VMAs, where she performed an infamous dance involving teddy bears. But rather than view it as a mistake, the “Wrecking Ball” singer feels she was misunderstood, describing it as a joke. Since then, Cyrus has chosen a professional path that centers on her Happy Hippie foundation, which is designed to provide support to at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. As for how being a coach on The Voice fits into that goal? Miley Cyrus recalls her journey from her Disney Channel days. [Image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for iHeartMedia] “I am only doing The Voice‘ because that helps Happy Hippie,” she clarified. Miley traveled a long road to becoming involved with the LGBTQ community, revealing that she did not “understand my own gender and my own sexuality,” tracing her “eyes opening” back to fifth or sixth grade. She emphasized she is wary of certain labels. “I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. My first relationship in my life was with a chick.” Although she grew up in “a very religious Southern family,” the singer has faith in her parents, noting that she “just felt that one day they are going to understand.” But it’s not just her parents to whom she’s reaching out now with an explanation of her gender identification journey. Cyrus also is opening up about how she first identified as pansexual. “I went to the LGBTQ center here in L.A., and I started hearing these stories. I saw one human in particular who didn’t identify as male or female,” she recalled. “I related to that person more than I related to anyone in my life.” Miley believes that individual “was the first gender-neutral person” she had ever met, leading to her comprehension of her sexuality. “Once I understood my gender more, which was unassigned, then I understood my sexuality more.” Moreover, Cyrus feels that although the “LGBTQ alphabet” could grow, there’s one letter that she particularly wants added to the term. “There’s a ‘P’ that should happen, for ‘pansexual,'” she stated. Where does Miley’s relationship with Liam Hemsworth fit into her journey, including their alleged plans to tie the knot? #LiamHemsworth is NEVER going to forgive #MileyCyrus after doing this ???? https://t.co/67ycYRnQBH pic.twitter.com/wKn3ZNHBlK — Life & Style (@Life_and_Style) October 15, 2016 Life & Style cites a source who revealed that Miley has called off her wedding to Hemsworth and is “rethinking the whole relationship.” The insider explained that she feels that their personalities no longer are a good match. “[She] doesn’t think their personalities mesh anymore. She’s a free spirit and full of energy and she’s starting to find Liam a little boring.” However, despite those dismal allegations about the wedding being called off, E! News reports that Liam is re-engaged to his girlfriend and that the two are happily nesting. Miley Cyrus really loves living with Liam Hemsworth, because who wouldn't love being at home with Liam Hemsworth? https://t.co/ZVRPJA8OX6 pic.twitter.com/9DqgPw7onV — E! News (@enews) October 13, 2016 Hemsworth and the 23-year-old singer are keeping their love alive, a source told E! News, sharing that she “really loves nesting with Liam.” Included in that nesting? Lots of good food. “She cooks a lot,” added the insider. “She loves trying out new recipes all the time.” Will wedding bells ring for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus? [Image by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images] While that description of the couple sounds cozy, the Daily Mail reported on October 16 that new footage has emerged from a 2014 gig that might haunt her. The newly surfaced footage, which dates from the singer’s wild-child stage, shows her performing at London’s G.A.Y nightclub. Fans were allowed to get so close when she leaped into the crowd that some fans touched her intimately, according to the Daily Mail. However, that incident occurred two years ago, and the media outlet notes that she has “calmed down significantly,” joining Liam in attempting to keep their romance out of the public spotlight. EXCLUSIVE: #LiamHemsworth fighting with #MileyCyrus over her smoking! https://t.co/J31h6u84Uk pic.twitter.com/khlXQ5ZInh — Life & Style (@Life_and_Style) October 17, 2016 Life & Style reported new details on October 17 of what allegedly went wrong between Miley and Hemsworth, citing a friend of the couple’s who discussed a fight that occurred just before she called off the wedding. The friend revealed that Cyrus and Liam fought after Hemsworth criticized her for “smoking too much pot,” and the battle was “really bad,” according to the duo’s pal. “She was screaming at him, telling him he was holding her back and making her hide who she truly is,” revealed the pal. “It wasn’t long after the argument that she ended their engagement.” But Hemsworth has not given up, even though both of them are “so upset and angry,” noted the friend. “[Liam] still hopes they can work things out,” another source told Life & Style.

Opening October 24th, 2016 at the Walmart at 510 Jefferson Highway, Harahan, LA 70123, Cellairis will provide quality repairs for iPhones, iPads and many other mobile devices. HARAHAN, LA (PRWEB) October 17, 2016 - Cellairis has risen in popularity around the country as more and more people depend on smartphones for their communication. The mobile device repair company began by offering accessories and repair for cell phones and now offers a wide list of services for repairing tablets, iPhones and even computers. Their quick service and affordable prices make them an excellent addition to many Walmart stores, including the new location in the Harahan Walmart. People depend on their smartphones for convenient communication for work and personal uses. Many even use their smartphones as their sole internet connection. A study performed by Pew Research Center in 2015 revealed that the majority of adults own smartphones, an estimated two-thirds of the population. Many of these adults are described as “smartphone-dependent,” using their smartphones as their only broadband access. Considering how important it is today to stay connected, this makes a service like Cellairis with same day repairs on smartphones a hot commodity. Taki Skouras, the co-founder and CEO of Cellairis, recognizes this growing need for quick, quality repairs on smartphones and other mobile devices. “We understand the importance of staying connected,” says Skouras. “We provide a valuable service for our customers that depend on their mobile devices on a daily basis, and we make it easy to access our services by providing convenient locations like the new store in the Harahan Walmart.” Smartphone repair is a big portion of Cellairis’ business, but it is not all they offer. In addition to fixing iPhones, Samsung Galaxies and other cell phones, they also repair tablets and computers. Cellairis is known for its quick turnaround on repairs and their fantastic warranty. In addition, they offer a wide array of accessories for mobile devices, including cases, covers and tech gear. They also buy old cell phones and tablets for cash, making them an excellent source for electronic recycling of old devices.

The regulation, effective December 1, will double (to $47,476) the salary threshold under which virtually all workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay whenever they work more than 40 hours in a given week. The rule also indexes the salary threshold to inflation. The business groups filed a lawsuit in September alleging that the salary threshold was too high and that the rule “exceeds DOL’s regulatory authority under the FLSA by establishing an unprecedented ‘escalator’ provision that will dramatically increase the minimum salary over time.” The request for expedited summary judgment came two days after 21 state attorneys general who also filed a lawsuit against the rule similarly requested an emergency preliminary injunction. Both cases have been assigned to the Obama-appointed Judge Amos Louis Mazzant, III. Read the business groups’ motion here. Story Continued Below GOOD MORNING.

THE GSA IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO SUPPLY OFFICE SPACE AND EQUIPMENT TO PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION TEAMS? Not sure? No problem. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be sharing the resources you’ll need to navigate the changing landscape in Washington. From the “Five Things You Need to Know” (where you’d learn the answer to the above question is true) to the big names under consideration for key positions, you’ll be 100 percent ready for Transition 2017. Sign up now. NLRB FOCUSES MCDONALD’S CASE: Lauren Esposito, the National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge presiding over the McDonald’s case in New York, last week directed the parties to proceed solely on the question of whether the fast-food giant should be considered a joint employer. That order defers, for now, the question of whether the franchisees in this case and in dozens of other McDonald’s NLRB cases around the country committed unfair labor practices (for which a joint employer could be held jointly liable). Esposito’s ruling severs the New York case from these other cases, which are scheduled for future hearings in Los Angeles and Chicago, in the interest of reducing delays. Bloomberg BNA has a full rundown here. EEOC APPEALS TRANSGENDER DISCRIMINATION CASE: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed an appeal last week of a district court’s decision that a Michigan funeral home was permitted under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to fire a transgender employee. In the case, RG & GR Harris Funeral Homes Inc., fired the employee for dressing as a female, in violation of its dress code. The funeral home claimed that the employee’s choice to wear a female uniform went against the owner’s religious beliefs, threatening his rights under the RFRA. The agency filed its appeal in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the court will hold a mediation call on the issue Nov. 15. The notice of appeal is here. PALANTIR REJECTS DOL’S ASIAN BIAS CHARGES: The data-mining firm Palantir Technologies Inc. pushed back Friday against the Labor Department’s allegations that it discriminated against Asians, reports Bloomberg Technology’s Lizette Chapman. The company, which holds contracts with the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, and other government agencies, said DOL used a flawed analysis in concluding that Palantir’s hiring and selection process shut out Asian applicants. “Palantir argues that Asians are well represented across the company, with two of its four senior leaders identifying themselves as Asian,” Chapman writes. “At least 37 percent of its U.S. product engineering team and 25 percent of Palantir’s entire workforce are Asian, the company said. Palantir also says the agency findings were a result of a random audit, conducted over a short period of time with incomplete data, and not a result of any injured parties suing.” More from Bloomberg Technology here. IMMIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT: A public interest law firm working to curb legal and illegal immigration will file a lawsuit today in federal court alleging that the Department of Homeland Security failed to evaluate the effects of immigration under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a law that requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before making decisions. The firm — Immigration Reform Law Institute, a supporting group of the Federation for American Immigration Reform — will file the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. “For the last 46 years, NEPA has required any agency considering an action that will affect the environment to analyze and publicize those effects,” reads a draft statement. “DHS, like its predecessor agency Immigration and Naturalization Services, has never considered or analyzed the enormous ‘impacts to the human environment’ of legal and illegal immigration, as required by NEPA.” The lawsuit will be brought by a mix of plaintiffs, including the Whitewater Draw Natural Resource Conservation District, the Arizona Association of Conservation Districts, Californians for Population Stabilization, and New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association. Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, a Democrat, is a plaintiff as a member of Californians for Population Stabilization. “Conservatives and liberals alike should be shocked at the environmental effects of out-of-control immigration,” Lamm said in the draft release. “It is environmental malpractice to ignore immigration.” Lamm, you may recall, stirred up a hornet’s nest of controversy 32 years ago when he said that elderly people who were terminally ill had a “duty to die and get out of the way” like “leaves falling off a tree and forming humus for the other plants to grow up.” Lamm turned 81 last month. CALIF. COURT: NLRA DOES NOT PREEMPT TRESPASS CLAIM: Law360’s Melissa Daniels reports that a California state appeals court on Friday upheld an injunction that barred union members from staging demonstrations inside Walmart stores on the grounds that they constituted trespassing. The United Food and Commercial Workers and the Organization United for Respect at Walmart had argued that because Walmart filed a charge on the matter with the NLRB, its trespassing claim was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. But the court ruled that “a trespass claim can be considered a local interest exception.” Even though Walmart filed an unfair labor charge, the court said, the “controversies” presented in that charge were not precisely the same as in the trespass action. Read more here. Speaking of Walmart, the New York Times’ Neil Irwin writes that the retailer’s 2015 decision to raise wages, increase training, and offer more predictable scheduling seem to be paying off. “By early 2016,” Irwin reports, “the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again.” Walmart’s experiment may have broader implications for the country’s economy, Irwin writes. “Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people.” Read more in the New York Times. DC METRO SUES ATU: The Washington Post’s Martine Powers reports that the embattled D.C. Metro is suing its largest union over disciplinary policy. The agency filed a lawsuit last week in U.S. District Court arguing that it had the right to make its own decisions about penalties for employee violations without approval from union negotiators. But last month an arbitrator said otherwise, Powers writes, ruling that Metro must negotiate with Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689 to “institute a new policy on the criteria managers must use to determine punishments.” The lawsuit, Powers write, “is the latest legal battle between Metro and the union. In July, the union sued Metro to force it to rehire a mechanic who falsified a report on a tunnel fan inspection” two months before a passenger died nearby of smoke inhalation. “Metro filed a counterclaim, arguing that rehiring the worker would be a ‘serious risk.’” The Washington Post has more here. HARVARD STRIKERS ARRESTED: The Boston Globe’s Adam Vacarro reports that nine striking Harvard cafeteria workers were arrested Friday, along with two union officials, after they staged a sit-in in Harvard Square. Seven hundred and fifty dining hall workers have been on strike 13 days, demanding that the world’s richest university lower their health care costs and furnish them a $35,000 salary floor. A rally Friday focused on the health care issue for female workers and their families; the sit-in followed. All nine workers arrested were female. “It marked the second straight day of more boisterous action from the union,” Vacarro writes. UNITE HERE Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck said that the arrested cafeteria workers and union officials were all released Friday evening, and will appear in court today on charges of disturbing the peace. Read more here. MINNESOTA CHAMBER SUES OVER PAID SICK DAYS: The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit Friday to stop the city of Minneapolis from requiring businesses to offer employees paid sick time. The city ordinance, passed in May, requires private business owners to offer employees one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year. The chamber is requesting an injunction against the ordinance on the grounds that it conflicts with state law, writes the Star Tribune’s Eric Roper. Minnesota already has a state law regulating sick leave, the Chamber argues, that does not require businesses to offer any. More here. WHISKEY REBELLION: Employees at Beam, the world’s largest bourbon producer, went on strike at two Kentucky distilleries after voting last week to reject a new contract proposal, reports the Courier-Journal’s Bailey Loosemore. More than 200 union workers walked off the job Saturday, citing extended hours, increasing use of temporary workers, and a disregard for seniority. More than 95 percent of the world’s bourbon comes from Kentucky, where production last year reached a near-50-year high. Beam’s original proposal would have increased wages and eliminated a two-tiered wage system for “almost all employees,” according to a company statement. It also had new language about temporary workers, a representative from the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 111D said, but that wasn’t enough. The union wants Beam to commit to hiring more full-time workers. Until the strike ends, the company said it has “contingency plans” to keep up production and distribution. More here. COLLECTIVE BALLIN’ AGREEMENT: The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are scheduled to meet this Wednesday as they rush to finish a new collective bargaining agreement, ESPN’s Ian Begley and Dave McMenamin report. “The meeting is the latest signal, sources told ESPN, that a new deal to avoid a work stoppage is looming in the near future. Sources say there is rising optimism on both sides of the bargaining table that the basic framework of a deal can be achieved as early as this month.” The last CBA negotiations in 2011 led to a five-month work stoppage, eliminating 16 regular season games. Read more here. Meanwhile, in college basketball, Wisconsin Badgers’ basketball player Nigel Hayes appeared Saturday on ESPN to protest the NCAA’s policy of no compensation. Hayes carried a poster that read, “Broke college athlete anything helps,” and directed readers to donate to a Venmo account. Hayes has repeatedly spoken out against the NCAA for not paying its student athletes. More from the Huffington Post here.

In a news release, Surrey Mounties said the group of men were seen in the underground parkade of the Guildford Mall Walmart at about 8:40 p.m. on Saturday. “Members of the Surrey RCMP immediately attended to the location, and located the group of males, some of them still wearing masks, and with what appeared to be pistols in their hands,” the release said. “The group of males was detained at gunpoint, and it was determined that the handguns that they had were actually imitation firearms. The group of males were just playing around, and could not give any legitimate reason for their actions in the parkade.” Police issued a warning to the public that trained officers can’t tell the difference between real guns and imitation firearms until they can be seen up-close and properly identified. “Police have to deal with the situation as if the weapon was real,” cops said.   © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

This pseudo-farmer’s market is held after school once a week, during which the children are given fake money to “purchase” fruits and vegetables from the farmer’s market. The markets started in 2012 through a similar grant by Walmart; the free pilot-program was held at only one school then. However, the kids farmers markets have grown to serve two preschools and five elementary schools. With consistent success and an increase in funding, YBF hopes to eventually expand to all of the 17 schools that qualify for the kids farmer’s market. Schools that can join the program must have over 50 percent of students who qualify to receive free or reduced lunch. There are about 20 to 275 kids at each school, with a total of about 1,000 children. Jeanée Natov, program coordinator, discussed the mission and goals of KFM for this year: increasing year-round access to fresh fruit and vegetables among low-income Yolo County children, increasing food literacy and physical activity of KFM participants, increasing students’ attitudes and behaviors related to fruit and vegetable intake, expanding KFM to all elementary school sites in Yolo County — in which at least 50 percent of students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program — and increasing public awareness of the KFM program. Stephanie Villegas, director of programs at YBF, is excited to bring the program back for another year of educating even more students. “It helps kids get exposed to produce they’ve never eaten before and also encourages them to take it home and encourages their families to eat along with them,” Villegas said. “We also do nutrition education at each site through recipe cards and educational programs with the help of interns and nutrition based community organizations.” YBF gains access to the produce through a program created by California Association of Food Banks called Farm to Family (FTF), along with donations from local farmers. FTF works with farmers, ranchers, pickers and shippers to donate produce to food banks. FTF provides basic produce kids are accustomed to seeing, like oranges or apples, and varies considerably, depending what time of the year it is. The children also gain exposure to other foods through the help of various grants the program receives. Each week, a few kids are able act as vendors behind the food stands, selling produce to their peers. The interns and volunteers ensure that everything operates smoothly, even with the farmer’s market being predominantly “run” by the kids. Surprisingly, the kids are often open to trying a variety of fruits and veggies. The program provides samples of the produce in select recipes to try at the market but plans to incorporate more of these for the kids to taste. “We are implementing a lot more nutrition education in the program,” Natov said. “We are also taking UC Davis interns that are nutrition or public health majors.” The interns help promote the produce and educate the students about the fruits and vegetables. Jennifer Tong, a fourth-year nutrition in public health major, has interned with KFM since last  June 2016. She enjoys working with the kids and teaching them about food nutrition. “It’s a cool thing because we’re teaching them to be able choose and pick nutritious examples of things they can have […] at home,” Tong said.

(Photo: Sunday Alamba / AP) The latest tech company to pique Wall Street’s interests is ... Domino’s Pizza? These days, almost every company — from Goldman Sachs to Wal-Mart — fancies itself a tech company. But for the first time in its history, Domino’s is bringing in more sales through smartphones, watches, virtual assistants and other digital channels than from diners walking into stores or phoning in orders. Fifty-five percent of its sales were digital in its latest quarter, compared with 20 percent for the restaurant industry, estimate analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shares in the world’s second-largest pizza chain rose as much as 8 percent Tuesday after it reported a 13 percent increase in U.S. sales in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The sales gains, while impressive on their own, are even more notable when compared to the restaurant industry’s meager performance. Year-over-year restaurant sales have fallen for five consecutive months, according to data from restaurant research firm MillerPulse. Slow sales and a rash of restaurant bankruptcies have stirred worries of a so-called restaurant recession. Wall Street has mostly been cautious about Domino’s because of its pricey valuation — it trades at a 55 percent premium to its peers in the Bloomberg Intelligence North American restaurant index. And its stock has gained 54 percent in the past year, compared to the index’s 14 percent decline. But in the past month, 63 percent of analysts covering the company have raised their price targets, according to Bloomberg’s tally. As I wrote in August, pizza chains tend to deliver in a restaurant recession — there aren’t many other ways to feed a family on $7.99, the price of a large, 3-topping pie at Domino’s. Plus, as minimum wages rise, pizza chains will take less of a labor-cost hit than other employee-heavy, sit-down restaurants. Some Wall Street analysts have also started to assign Domino’s tech-like stock-price targets based on the rapid growth of its digital sales. Domino’s is also asset-light like a tech company. Ninety-seven percent of its 13,000 restaurants are owned by franchisees, so it doesn’t have to spend much on buildings or store upkeep. Instead, it’s using its steady cash flow to invest in better technology and ratchet up dividends and buybacks. Domino’s has reformulated 80 percent of its menu since 2008 and is entering the second year of a loyalty program that has helped it command 15 percent of all pizza industry sales, up from 9 percent in 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. These turbo-charged sales are also attracting franchisees to build more stores. The company on Tuesday said it could add 1,000 more stores in the coming years. That growth translates into a steady cash flow for Domino’s in the form of royalties, transaction fees, and other franchisee charges — without the costs of brick-and-mortar stores. Domino’s will have to keep spending on technology and its supply chain to help franchisees. But its structure means it will get a much bigger bang for its buck than its competitors. 4 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2eOVFPX TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

 Walmart is now letting you stream a bunch of movies for free — with ads Nathan McAlone Oct. 18, 2016, 4:12 PM 10,085 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jennifer Lawrence's breakout movie, "Winter's Bone," is free. Juan Naharro Gimenez/ Getty Images Walmart's Vudu streaming service, which lets you rent and buy movies on-demand, has launched a free section that's entirely supported by advertising. Walmart has dubbed the section "Vudu Movies on Us," and it presents a no-cost alternative to heavyweights like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Though there are streaming services that offer totally free content, it's usually shows or short-form videos, not movies.  Vudu has stocked the free tier with "thousands" of movie and TV titles, but don't expect new releases. There are some quality titles in the catalog: "True Grit," "School of Rock," "Margin Call," "The Magnificent Seven," "Winter's Bone," "Hooisers," and so on. There are some awful movies in there too. But here's the thing: It's free. “Nothing is more affordable than free," Jeremy Verba, VP and GM of Vudu, said in a statement. And he has a point. Netflix has recently taken some heat for a lack of commitment to its older movie catalog. Netflix's selection of the top movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, seems to have gone down a substantial amount over the last two years. It's likely that getting great movies from the past few decades simply isn't the priority for a company pivoting hard into exclusive licenses and original content. And that's fine! But if you are in the mood for some older movies, don't want to spend a single cent, and haven't developed a distaste for advertising while binge-watching Netflix, then take a gander at Vudu's catalog. Just how many ads are we talking about here? "The ad load is pre-roll and mid-roll, so a few ads around 30 seconds before the content and a few breaks during," a Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider. Check out Vudu's free catalog here.

Updated: November 13, 2016 @ 9:15 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds Close AP Did Amazon Just Admit It Screwed Up Grocery Delivery Fees? newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Duprey) Oct 18, 2016 Amazon.com has lowered the cost of its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, while also implementing a monthly fee structure, indicating its previous annual payment program wasn't working out. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) doesn't make too many mistakes when it enters a market, but its new, lower pricing policy for its grocery delivery service is pretty much Jeff Bezos' way of saying he made a bonehead move. A prime reason to shop The e-commerce giant floored the supermarket industry last year when it implemented a $299 annual fee to get AmazonFresh groceries delivered to your door. Like its Prime membership program, customers were essentially paying delivery fees upfront rather than each time an order was placed. That stood the grocery delivery model on its head. Until Amazon's move, companies like Ahold Delhaize's Peapod, NetGrocer, FreshDirect, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) typically imposed nominal per-delivery fees, or if they offered an annual subscription the cost was much lower. Instacart, for example, charged $99 for its Express service.   What Amazon's higher annual fee did, however, was underscore the substantial costs involved in delivery -- and if a business didn't want to end up like Webvan or HomeGrocer.com -- which both went into bankruptcy -- it would need to cover its costs. Instacart subsequently raised its annual fee to $149. Of course, Amazon is also known for its willingness to forego profits in exchange for volume, preferring to build a critical mass before worrying about earning a return on its investment. The annual fee may have been recognition that not all businesses respond the same to that model.  Already past its prime But there are also limits to what a company can charge before it effectively prices itself out of the market, and that's where Amazon's new delivery fee structure seems to admit it was wrong. It's an indication not as many many people were taking advantage of the service because the cost was too high. It also shows that Amazon did a horrible job of explaining the fee when it first rolled it out. The new plan now makes clear that Prime members can have groceries delivered in available markets for $14.99 per month. Grocery delivery is not so simple as loading up the truck and ringing the doorbell. It's a costly model, which Amazon.com's original pricing structure tried to convey. Image source: Getty Images. While the original fee structure also included membership in Prime, it really wasn't communicated all that well, so the actual cost of the grocery delivery service was just $200. While that was still substantially higher than the competition, it may not have been as unsuccessful had Amazon simply explained it better. Grocery delivery is still a new concept to most, so shelling out a big chunk of change like that up front is a leap of faith for many. The new policy makes clear the online grocer didn't count on consumers balking at the cost. Not that the monthly fee really saves customers all that much over the original pricing -- it comes out to just about $279 a year when you factor in the mandatory Prime membership, but doling that out in smaller monthly payments is far more palatable. With tens of millions of households already having Prime memberships, $15 a month isn't a big hurdle to add on the convenience of online grocery shopping. A better way still? It's still a higher cost proposition than what rivals like Wal-Mart are offering, and the retail king still promotes picking up groceries at its stores for even greater savings, which is one of the competitive advantages Wal-Mart has over the competition. Its national store footprint serves as a sort of distribution center network for online sales, whether they're groceries or other goods. It didn't have to build out expensive DCs like Amazon needed to; its local stores already served the purpose. That may be behind Amazon's other big announcement that it is going to begin opening small convenience store-type formats that will sell produce, milk, meat, and other perishable items. But the C-store model is intensely competitive too, with even deep discounters like Dollar General expanding their DG Markets concept to feature fresh produce. Tweaking the model While online grocery shopping has been around for years, it's really only just starting to come into its own, so we'll see retailers making adjustments to the pricing model until the best one is found. Instacart, for example, is exploring having consumer goods companies pay a portion of the fee if customers buy their products. Bloomberg reports that couponing and advertising from these big brand companies now accounts for 15% of Instacart's revenues. Still, it's clear Amazon.com's original pricing structure wasn't the right one. It was an unforced error on its part, as an option for monthly payment could have been included at the start. Now that it has been rectified, we may see AmazonFresh become an even bigger threat to the competition.

This change could be Jeff Bezos' mea culpa. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 18, 2016 at 3:18PM Amazon.com has lowered the cost of its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, while also implementing a monthly fee structure, indicating its previous annual payment program wasn't working out. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn't make too many mistakes when it enters a market, but its new, lower pricing policy for its grocery delivery service is pretty much Jeff Bezos' way of saying he made a bonehead move. A prime reason to shop The e-commerce giant floored the supermarket industry last year when it implemented a $299 annual fee to get AmazonFresh groceries delivered to your door. Like its Prime membership program, customers were essentially paying delivery fees upfront rather than each time an order was placed. That stood the grocery delivery model on its head. Until Amazon's move, companies like Ahold Delhaize's Peapod, NetGrocer, FreshDirect, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) typically imposed nominal per-delivery fees, or if they offered an annual subscription the cost was much lower. Instacart, for example, charged $99 for its Express service.   What Amazon's higher annual fee did, however, was underscore the substantial costs involved in delivery -- and if a business didn't want to end up like Webvan or HomeGrocer.com -- which both went into bankruptcy -- it would need to cover its costs. Instacart subsequently raised its annual fee to $149. Of course, Amazon is also known for its willingness to forego profits in exchange for volume, preferring to build a critical mass before worrying about earning a return on its investment. The annual fee may have been recognition that not all businesses respond the same to that model.  Already past its prime But there are also limits to what a company can charge before it effectively prices itself out of the market, and that's where Amazon's new delivery fee structure seems to admit it was wrong. It's an indication not as many many people were taking advantage of the service because the cost was too high. It also shows that Amazon did a horrible job of explaining the fee when it first rolled it out. The new plan now makes clear that Prime members can have groceries delivered in available markets for $14.99 per month. Grocery delivery is not so simple as loading up the truck and ringing the doorbell. It's a costly model, which Amazon.com's original pricing structure tried to convey. Image source: Getty Images. While the original fee structure also included membership in Prime, it really wasn't communicated all that well, so the actual cost of the grocery delivery service was just $200. While that was still substantially higher than the competition, it may not have been as unsuccessful had Amazon simply explained it better. Grocery delivery is still a new concept to most, so shelling out a big chunk of change like that up front is a leap of faith for many. The new policy makes clear the online grocer didn't count on consumers balking at the cost. Not that the monthly fee really saves customers all that much over the original pricing -- it comes out to just about $279 a year when you factor in the mandatory Prime membership, but doling that out in smaller monthly payments is far more palatable. With tens of millions of households already having Prime memberships, $15 a month isn't a big hurdle to add on the convenience of online grocery shopping. A better way still? It's still a higher cost proposition than what rivals like Wal-Mart are offering, and the retail king still promotes picking up groceries at its stores for even greater savings, which is one of the competitive advantages Wal-Mart has over the competition. Its national store footprint serves as a sort of distribution center network for online sales, whether they're groceries or other goods. It didn't have to build out expensive DCs like Amazon needed to; its local stores already served the purpose. That may be behind Amazon's other big announcement that it is going to begin opening small convenience store-type formats that will sell produce, milk, meat, and other perishable items. But the C-store model is intensely competitive too, with even deep discounters like Dollar General expanding their DG Markets concept to feature fresh produce. Tweaking the model While online grocery shopping has been around for years, it's really only just starting to come into its own, so we'll see retailers making adjustments to the pricing model until the best one is found. Instacart, for example, is exploring having consumer goods companies pay a portion of the fee if customers buy their products. Bloomberg reports that couponing and advertising from these big brand companies now accounts for 15% of Instacart's revenues. Still, it's clear Amazon.com's original pricing structure wasn't the right one. It was an unforced error on its part, as an option for monthly payment could have been included at the start. Now that it has been rectified, we may see AmazonFresh become an even bigger threat to the competition. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Seventeen-year-old Rae-Showna Jones went missing on Dec. 17, 2015, and her mother, Charlena Poole, said she has prayed for her return every night since. On Tuesday, Oct. 18, Poole's prayers were answered when a detective from the Michigan State Police contacted her to tell her that Jones was found by Rio Rancho police wandering near a Wal-Mart. Mother speaks about missing daughter "I just screamed like I hit the lottery," Poole said. MSP Sgt. Jim Lang said that said police from Rio Rancho found out Jones was a reported missing teen after interviewing her once they encountered her at a busy intersection near a Wal-Mart. Poole said that officers told her that her daughter could've been a victim of human trafficking. Lang said that it is a possibility that Jones could've been a victim of trafficking but he wanted to talk to her first. "We want to see what she has been through for the last 10 months," Lang said. Rio Rancho Police Lt. Nicholas Onken said that he was not sure if Jones was a victim of human trafficking. Closure Twannie L. Gray, a therapist with Solutions Behavioral Health, 1010 N. Niagara, said that Jones' disappearance produced a high level of stress on Poole since she was not certain what happened to her daughter. "She didn't have closure for 10 months," Gray said. "She would come up with all of these scenarios but she persevered and stayed in counseling and kept her faith. She's happy right now." Poole faces another problem, though, with trying to get her daughter home. "They said it would cost me a couple of thousand dollars to get her back here if I went myself," Poole said. Poole has set up a GoFundMe account titled "Rae'showna is found!" to raise money to get her daughter home. "I don't want to leave her by herself," Poole said. Lang said that there is not currently a plan to get Jones back home. Onken said that his department was asked by Saginaw County to hold Jones while family members come up with a plan to have her returned to Saginaw. Poole said that she just wants her daughter home. "I just want to see her," Poole said.

Print Email Erin O'Neill | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Erin O'Neill | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com NJ.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 18, 2016 at 11:06 AM, updated October 18, 2016 at 4:59 PM comments Retail real estate took a beating this year. The hits started in January when Walmart revealed plans to close more than 150 locations throughout the country. Sears joined the brawl in April when the department store chain announced it would close 78 Kmart and Sears stores. The bankruptcy of Sports Authority dealt another blow. The sporting goods chain shuttered all of its more than 460 stores this summer. Then retail giant Macy's made public it would close 100 locations by early next year. More department store closures are expected in the coming months. The result is a commercial real estate landscape that experts say could be unlike any we've seen before — and that could have major long-term ramifications for local communities.  "Certainly having large-scale retailers close is nothing new," said Neil Stern, senior partner with the retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle in Chicago. "The difference this time around is that there are not new retailers necessarily waiting in the wings to scoop them up." Pressure from online shopping and changing consumer habits have pushed retailers to downsize — or completely eliminate — their physical footprints, dampening the interest in a 40,000-square-foot or larger store like those left vacant by Sports Authority. Expansion in terms of brick-and-mortar stores, meanwhile, is being largely driven by just two sectors: off-price retail and dollar stores. Get a bird's-eye view of N.J. development over 80 years The curtailed demand by retailers for square footage — and the increasing number of store closures — has forced landlords saddled with large vacancies in shopping centers and malls to seek out new types of tenants to fill those massive, empty spaces. Go-kart tracks have replaced sporting good chains and indoor sports facilities have replaced department stores. Medical facilities and health clubs are also taking over spaces once dedicated to retail. Does that mean New Jersey will have a totally altered commercial landscape in the years to come? Is our era of endless shopping plazas lining our highways nearing an end? Maybe not entirely.  While Stern said that landlords will have to become "increasingly creative in finding tenants" on a national level, local commercial real estate professionals said big box retailers still consider the Garden State a worthwhile investment. There are examples in New Jersey of retail properties converted to new uses, including a former Kmart in Paramus now outfitted with turf fields for rent. But the state's wealth and population density still lure traditional retailers, experts said. "Thank goodness New Jersey has the strong demographics that we do," said Chuck Lanyard, president of The Goldstein Group, a Paramus-based retail brokerage firm. "The big box tenants are still looking in New Jersey." Still, the retail vacancy rate increased to 7.2 percent in July, up from 6.2 percent a year ago, according to a report from The Goldstein Group that was released on Monday. (The report tracks more than 4,250 properties on retail corridors in central and northern New Jersey. It doesn't track vacancies at enclosed malls.) Responding to this uptick in vacancy, Lanyard said: "We see this change to be short lived, minimal, and we expect considerable improvement in the coming year." Of the more than 460 Sports Authority locations that shuttered across the country this summer, 21 were in New Jersey, including a 50,000-square-foot store in Paramus at the intersection of routes 4 and 17, a prime retail location. North Plainfield-based Levin Management has been hired to find a new tenant for that property. Joseph Lowry, Levin Management's senior vice president of leasing and acquisitions, said "there's been really strong interest in that space from a lot of different types of users," including traditional retailers and entertainment-oriented tenants. "There aren't too many markets like Paramus," said Lowry, who expects to to have a tenant selected for that store in the next 30 days. Sports Authority shuttered this 50,000-square-foot store in Paramus, as well as 20 others in New Jersey, following bankruptcy. (Levin Management) Another likelihood is that many of the largest big box spaces will persist, but in newly segmented form.  R.J. Brunelli & Co. in Old Bridge is working on leasing a nearly 44,000-square-foot property on Route 9 in Manalapan once occupied by Sports Authority. Ron DeLuca, the chief executive officer of the retail real estate firm, said some of the former Sports Authority stores may be carved into smaller spaces in order to attract tenants, though he said there are tenants interested in the entire space in Manalapan. And while local experts expressed optimism about filling vacant commercial spaces in prime locations in New Jersey, they also acknowledged that many landlords of retail properties are trying to decide where and how they can make changes that will help adapt the properties to an evolving marketplace. Joshua Weinkranz, the president of the northeast region at Kimco Realty, a New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based company that owns and operates open-air shopping centers throughout the state and country, said online shopping has forced many landlords to change the way they market their shopping centers and diversify their offerings to include a mixture of retail, residential and office spaces. "That really is the way things are shifting now," he said. "The mixed-use projects are where people want to be, not only the retailers but the consumers and the people who live there." Although Weinkranz said his company doesn't have any projects underway now that involve adding a residential component to shopping centers in the northern half of the state, which he oversees, he said there are several new mixed-use projects in the state that they are considering. One major redevelopment effort already in the works in New Jersey, however, may provide a glimpse of what the future holds for malls and shopping centers throughout the state. Despite local opposition, Eatontown approved a zoning change in September that allows Kushner Companies to move forward with a plan to convert the Monmouth Mall into an open-air hub that offers retail, dining, entertainment and residential.  "It's no secret that traditional-style malls are struggling across the country, so we're really focused on delivering a fresh, modern project that will meet the needs of area residents for years to come," Jared Kushner said in a statement announcing the project in February. Whether landlords decide to try to lease a large vacancy as is, carve it up into smaller pieces or redevelop the properties entirely, all of them are working toward the same goal: getting empty space filled as quickly as possible.   As the property manager for the Middlesex Mall in South Plainfield — which is currently dividing up a former 81,000-square-foot Macy's store into two to attract new tenants — put it: "Any vacancy is not a good thing."

Figuring out the supply chain for a product made in secret was no easy task for Colorado entrepreneurs Inside the green rush By Brian Hutchinson   O Cannabis database Catch and release Inside the green rush Pot’s retail therapy The fame game Growing opportunities Black market to grey  DENVER, CO. — John Lord steps from his SUV and into his giant cannabis factory, near this city’s deserted stockyards. Cattle once dominated commerce in the Colorado capital, but marijuana is the prized commodity now. Before Colorado voters defied the U.S. government’s longstanding cannabis prohibition and amended their state’s constitution in 2012, making the drug accessible to any local resident or visitor aged 21 or older, Lord used the expansive warehouse to manufacture baby products. His child car seats were sold in major retail stores, such as Walmart, Target and Toys ‘R’ Us. Now he’s a pioneer in what’s being hailed as a lucrative “green rush.” And he’s got some advice for politicians and stakeholders in Canada, in their efforts to legalize recreational pot: Keep the rules simple, he says. Don’t over-regulate, or the whole effort might fail. All over Denver, one notices the sweet, pungent fragrance of pot. It’s not always the smell of marijuana being smoked, either. It’s the scent of healthy, growing plants. After Colorado’s recreational pot laws came into effect in 2014, Denver became a major marijuana production centre, with dozens of indoor growing operations. The marijuana trimming department at the LivWell facility in Denver. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Entrepreneurs have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into raising bushels of high-potency pot. A transplanted New Zealander, Lord grows what seems like an endless number of plants inside his 140,000-square-foot facility. He won’t divulge the precise number he has under cultivation at any one time — that’s a proprietary secret, says the diminutive businessman — but he claims there are enough to make his facility the largest licensed grow-operation in the entire United States. And it’s still not big enough. Lord is planning to expand his factory’s footprint by another 70,000 square feet. His is a vertically integrated, plant-to-sale operation. With the help of some 500 employees, Lord grows and then processes his green gold into dozens of different products. They range from perfectly trimmed dried flower (or “bud”) to powerful concentrates such as oils and wax, to cannabis-infused candies and chocolate. He is also making cannabis vaporizers — the discreet, smokeless devices are considered the new big thing in pot. Lord’s products are intended to give consumers a heady buzz or a relaxing body stone, known among aficionados as “couch lock.” Other concoctions derived from specific marijuana strains are meant simply to help induce sleep or relieve pain, without any psychotropic effects. His privately owned company, LivWell Enlightened Health, sells its home-grown cannabis from 14 retail stores it also owns and operates, in and around Denver. It also offers wholesale cannabis and custom-label edibles to retailers around the state. LivWell’s busiest shop, says one of Lord’s executives, sells US$200,000 worth of processed marijuana every week. “I underestimated the market when I first got involved,” Lord says. “I had no idea how widespread cannabis use is in society.” Other Denver-based entrepreneurs share the sentiment. A few miles south of the LivWell facility sits a nondescript, 10,000-square-foot former mini-blinds factory. It’s now a thriving grow-operation, one of several in a stable co-owned by former high school biology teacher Tim Cullen and Ralph Morgan, a former medical device salesman. Their cannabis venture, Colorado Harvest Company (CHC), produces about 700 pounds of high-grade marijuana every month. That’s a lot of pot, but not enough to supply their four retail stores in the Denver area. The company has to buy wholesale marijuana from other producers just to meet customer demand. Cullen and Morgan have expanded their operations—and their horizons. In addition to forming separate companies that produce high-potency cannabis oils and vaporizer products, they are looking at further expansion and investment opportunities. Annual revenues from all of their operations grew 1,200 per cent in 2014, another 400 per cent last year, and are now between US$50 million and $100 million, says Morgan. CHC has 80 employees, including five scientists with PhDs. And they’re just getting started. Marijuana is weighed at the Colorado Harvest Company facility. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Across the state, where the first legal, recreational marijuana stores opened on Jan. 1, 2014, revenues are exceeding almost everyone’s expectations. In 2015, total revenues from Colorado’s 432 licensed cannabis shops rang in at US$996 million. This year, that figure is expected to reach about $1.2 billion. State-imposed cannabis license fees and levies amounted to $135 million last year, a decent return for taxpayers. But don’t be seduced by the juicy figures. Running a successful, plant-to-sale marijuana conglomerate, even in free-market Colorado, is a high-risk, capital-intensive enterprise filled with legal requirements and regulatory hurdles that keep changing. Keeping in line with Colorado’s marijuana laws is a costly headache, Lord grumbles. “We employ 45 people in our compliance department alone,” he says. “Compliance regulations are the biggest barrier to entry in this business, and the toughest on the small, mom-and-pop operations. There have been 141 regulatory changes in the last year alone.” Cullen agrees that the rules could be less onerous. “Legalization was sold to voters as something to be regulated like alcohol,” says Cullen. “But it’s not even close. We have purchase limits, unlike alcohol, and pretty stringent advertising, packaging and labeling restrictions. All of our ingredients must be declared, including what’s been sprayed on the plant. The bar is set high.” Complicating matters even more is the state’s two-tier system, one for medical marijuana, the other for recreational pot. The state legalized marijuana for medical use in 2009, and continues to tax that product at a rate three times lower than the 22-per-cent rate applied to recreational pot, at the retail end of the supply chain. And at all times, during their cultivation, processing and sale, marijuana intended for the medical and recreational markets must be kept separate. Whatever their intended use, cannabis plants are notoriously high-maintenance. Vulnerable to pests, mould and mildew, they require a massive amount of care to reach their maximum buzz-worthiness. “We’re still learning how to improve something that people used to do secretly, hidden in a closet,” Lord says. “And we’re doing it on an industrial scale.” LivWell CEO and owner John Lord. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) At Lord’s cannabis factory, everything starts in a petri dish. LivWell uses a method of tissue culture to grow pot. Cannabis cells are extracted from selected female, flower-producing plants — there are countless varieties, or strains — and placed on a piece of gel. After one or two weeks, the fledgling plant is transferred to a more robust growth medium, a coconut-fibre mulch, and then into a nursery room. After more time there, the potted plants are placed in a warm, humid and brightly lit “spring” room. There they are fed a proprietary solution of water and nutrients, and receive 24 hours of light every day. Lord says his team has developed a highly efficient LED lighting system to replace conventional, high-pressure sodium bulbs, thus reducing his factory’s electricity bill by about 33 per cent. Even so, he spends a staggering $150,000 a month on electricity. Once the plants are a certain size and ready to flower, they are moved to yet another growing room, with heat and lighting systems set to mimic the cooler, shorter days of late summer and autumn. Large buds begin to develop; once they become full, solid and fragrant, it is time for the harvest. Over at CHC, the growing process is slightly different. The company eschews tissue culture and starts with simple plant cuttings, also known as clones. Like LivWell and every other licensed marijuana grower in Colorado, all of CHC’s plants have their roots in the black market — there was no other source for cannabis when the state legalized medical and recreational pot, so producers had to take genetic material such as cuttings and cells from what had been illicit weed. “We had to start somewhere,” shrugs Cullen. “The important thing is that every plant that’s grown now is in the regulated system.” Clone plants grow at the Colorado Harvest Company facility. Like every other licensed marijuana grower in Colorado, all of CHC’s plants have their roots in the black market. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) Under Colorado’s new pot laws, all plants grown in licensed facilities are assigned and tagged with unique identification numbers, which are recorded and shared with state regulators. This allows them to be closely traced, from their brief incubation period through to harvesting. Processed products are also assigned tracking numbers. This “manifesting” procedure is meant to prevent marijuana and marijuana products from leaving Colorado and entering the black market. (None of Colorado’s immediate neighbours allow the cultivation and sale of recreational marijuana.) And of course, every marijuana plant and product meant for the medical and recreational markets is taxed by the state, through every stage of production. Manifesting allows regulators to keep close tabs on what is being produced, and on revenues generated through their sale. “We have to keep track of every frickin’ gram we produce,” Lord says. Even those parts of the plants that aren’t sold must be removed in a state-approved manner. Stems and so-called fan leaves — the large leaves below the flower — are collected after harvest and weighed. Then the waste is mulched and mixed with the used coconut-husk medium, then bagged and removed to local landfills, like regular trash. Producers can also expect random visits from various officials, such as fire, building and insurance inspectors. Potpreneurs such as Lord, Cullen and Morgan keep their facilities sparkling clean. Floors are bleach mopped every night, machinery is wiped down, and staff are instructed to keep themselves looking tidy. Lifecycle of a plant It’s the same story inside their retail operations. “Budtenders” receive several weeks of training before they start work behind the sales counter; they are expected to understand how their products differ, according to their strain and potency. They are also trained to give proper advice to customers looking for specific results. Retail competition is fierce. Local zoning regulations determine where recreational pot shops are located, which means they tend to cluster in certain areas. Along a strip of Denver’s busy S. Broadway corridor south of the downtown core, for example, 17 pot shops are squeezed into a mile-long strip. The Green Mile. (Mark Yuen / Postmedia News) CHC’s flagship store was among the first shops to open on the so-called Green Mile. “There was a three-hour wait to get inside, when we first opened in January, 2014,” recalls Cullen. The lineups are much shorter now, and non-existent outside the busy hours. But no matter the time of day, no matter the location, every potential marijuana customer in Colorado must provide identification before being allowed to enter a retail outlet and inspect any products for sale. In most stores, the selection and variety is impressive, the budtenders courteous and knowledgeable. As for the customers, there are all kinds. In little more than two years, Lord says, “marijuana has become normalized. I thought our typical customer would be a 20-something guy. But it’s a real melting pot. You’ll see a guy in a suit, then a guy in dreadlocks who will be holding the door open for grandma.” There’s something for everyone inside, he says. Lord likens his product range to the sort of beverage products one might find in a local liquor store. “From low-calorie soda to whisky, we’ve got it covered,” he smiles.

He was rushed into quarantine; doctors worried he was infected with the Ebola virus. His father wasn’t allowed at his bedside without a hazmat suit. Hours before, Morin was at his fiancée’s Whitby, Ont. home after work, where he smoked a bowl of pot, a daily routine for the drywaller accustomed to smoking at least four joints a day. He was overwhelmed by cold sweats, dizziness and nausea. He vomited uncontrollably for about two hours before his fiancée took him to the hospital. Morin had been in and out of hospital for years with similar bouts of being violently ill, which lasted for six hours at times. Doctors told him he suffered from stomach ulcers. He took medication and changed his diet, but it did nothing to stop the overwhelming spells that churned his stomach. “You instantly feel light-headed, like you’re going to pass out, and your stomach starts spinning like crazy,” Morin said. “I was so dehydrated … they couldn’t stick an IV in my arm because my veins kept collapsing.” As Morin lay in isolation in late 2014, doctors brought in a stomach specialist who gave him the diagnosis that would ultimately relieve his misery — he had cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. The condition has been detected in some chronic pot smokers who face the same periodic bouts of violent vomiting. Scientists don’t know for sure what causes the condition, but they believe that avoiding marijuana is the only cure, said Dr. Andrew Monte, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado’s school of medicine who has studied the syndrome. Morin initially balked at the diagnosis, having smoked for well over a decade, but he watched his symptoms disappear after he stayed off marijuana. Now, he has discovered other pot smokers who suffered through similar torment. Researchers haven’t identified how widespread the condition is across Canada, given that the syndrome is newly identified and not well understood, said Dr. John Foote, an emergency physician at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who has written about cannabinoid hyperemesis. He has seen roughly one case every month in the past two years, but says those who end up at emergency departments likely represent the tip of the iceberg. Emergency rooms at two Colorado hospitals have seen a doubling in the rate of patients with cyclical vomiting syndromes like cannabinoid hyperemesis, said Monte, who believes the spike is largely due to the state’s recent legalization of marijuana. Hospitals across Colorado now see several new cases every week. The growing prevalence of the debilitating condition was among several unexpected health effects of legalizing pot for medicinal and, later, recreational use, Monte said. In a two-year period, his hospital alone reported 31 admissions for marijuana-related burns, most of them caused by extracting Tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in marijuana known as THC, from plants using butane as a solvent. Twenty-one cases required skin grafting. Some burns covered 70 per cent of the patients’ bodies. Monte said the most concerning unexpected health effects have involved children who consume marijuana, mostly in edible products, by accident. Pot is often sold in chocolates, candies and other goodies that look attractive to kids who know nothing of the intoxicating contents. In the five years before medicinal pot was legalized, the Children’s Hospital Colorado had not treated any youngsters for mistakenly ingesting marijuana. In the second year of medical legalization, there were 14 cases. A THC chocolate bar. (Tyler Anderson / National Post) Across the state, the rate of children younger than nine being hospitalized for possible marijuana exposure has increased dramatically, according to a public health committee that has been measuring the impact of legalization in Colorado. There was roughly one case for every 100,000 hospitalizations in Colorado from 2001 to 2009, the initial period of medical legalization. The rate spiked to 13 cases per every 100,000 in 2014 through to June 2015, the first year and a half of retail legalization. Children who eat marijuana candy bars or cookies can develop pneumonia from a depressed central nervous system. Their heart rate can double normal levels to 200 beats per minute. They can become comatose. “A hundred milligrams in an adult may cause some hallucinations, may cause their heart rate to go very fast, which may be a risk, but it’s a risk in a subset of patients,” Monte said. “Every single paediatric patient shouldn’t have 100 milligrams, and that’s really only one cookie.” Monte said edible products should not be sold in retail pot shops, given the health risks. According to his research, edibles are responsible for most health care visits due to marijuana intoxication, for patients of all ages. Concentrations of THC in these products can vary wildly, while the effects can take hours to fully kick in. Users who don’t feel high shortly after eating a cookie may eat more, intensifying the effects when they peak. Overconsumption can lead to increased anxiety, rapid heart rates, high blood pressure and vomiting. In 2010, about 330 patients across Colorado were hospitalized with ailments where marijuana was believed to be a contributing factor, according to data published by the public health committee studying the effects of legalization. In the first six months of 2015, there were nearly 600 cases, according to the committee. “The problems outweigh the benefits in the recreational realm with edibles,” says Monte. In Washington state, where retailers began selling recreational pot in July 2014, calls to the poison centre for marijuana exposure have been on the rise, from about 160 a year before legalization to 270 in 2015. Nearly half the calls, 126 of them, involved patients younger than 19. Still, these calls account for a small percentage of the 63,000 total calls the poison centre receives each year. The number of pot-related calls is escalating, in part, because parents are not as worried about child protective services getting involved now that recreational use is legal, said Alexander Garrard, clinical managing director at Washington Poison Center. The public health committee measuring the effects of legalization in Colorado found adolescent and young adult users are at higher risk of developing psychotic symptoms or disorders in adulthood. The same committee also found substantial evidence that pot smoke contains many of the carcinogens that are in tobacco smoke, and that heavy pot smoking is linked to bronchitis, including chronic coughs and wheezing. Cody Morin, pictured above and at top, suffers from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. (Tyler Anderson / National Post) In Canada, those advocating legalization argue public health officials have a better chance of reducing these ill effects by legalizing and regulating marijuana than by keeping it in the illicit market. “We’ll know what’s in it and how it’s grown, what the strength is, and the product will be labelled. We’ll know who made it, who sold it,” said Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, medical health officer at Vancouver Coastal Health. He said regulations should also include childproof packaging and other steps to keep pot away from children. “If there are problematic products out there, then we’ll have them withdrawn off the market. People used to go blind from drinking moonshine; that doesn’t happen anymore. We have to get safe products out there that people can use safely.” At Vancouver’s annual 4/20 pot rally, which draws thousands of users, health officials typically deal with dozens of patients who ingested too much pot. Lysyshyn said these users have usually eaten products without knowing the concentrations or how much to eat. Under a legalized regime, he said, there should be labels on THC contents, and users will become more used to edibles. Reports of pot-related hospitalizations linked to pot use are often met with disbelief on web forums for marijuana users, but the adverse effects are real, said Allan Bays, the grow manager at a pot dispensary in Denver who has been diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Bays continues to smoke, despite his crippling condition, because he loves it and finds relief from migraines. He believes he has been able to control his symptoms by maintaining a healthy diet and exercising, although he still suffers through bouts of vomiting every couple of months or so. “I believe in facts and truth, not in misinformation. The harmful effects of marijuana are well-documented,” he said. “I’m in big favour of marijuana becoming legalized nationwide, but you have to be aware of those effects.” Postmedia News • Email: rsouthwick@postmedia.com | Twitter: ReidSouthwick Catch and release Inside the green rush Pot’s retail therapy The fame game Growing Opportunities Black market to grey © 2016 National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

In what is believed to be a first, Wal-Mart cast a CEO in a commercial that aired on social media and television for about three months through the end of September. The ad, starring Mr. McMillon, touts the company’s commitment to employees, not the latest deals. Putting top executives in advertisements can build credibility for companies and rally staff, but it can be risky—highly paid executives may garner little sympathy, and some lack the charisma for the job. In cases where the CEO is central to the brand, as with ousted Men’s Wearhouse founder George Zimmer, the company can be left scrambling after that leader leaves. Mr. McMillon’s 30-second spot is part of a wider push by the retailer to shed perceptions that it offers little more than low prices and low-paying jobs, labels that have long dogged the company. “I’m Doug,” he says in the ad, surrounded by produce in one of the company’s stores near its Bentonville, Ark. headquarters, flipping through photos of employees on his Instagram account. “Here at Wal-Mart we are committed to taking care of the people that take care of you,” he tells viewers. The ad ran this summer during “Fox and Friends,” George Lopez and SportsCenter, as well as on Facebook and Instagram. Wal-Mart declined to say how much the ad campaign cost.© Adam Jeffery/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Dan Bartlett, Wal-Mart’s vice president of corporate affairs, conceived of the campaign with his team, say people familiar with the process. The “reputational ad” highlights Wal-Mart’s promise to invest $2.7 billion in higher wages and employee training. An “associate CEO” who started his career in a Wal-Mart warehouse in 1984, Mr. McMillon is a natural to deliver a message aimed at employees and policy makers, Mr. Bartlett said. As CEO since February 2014, Mr. McMillon has raised store employee wages and is building hundreds of management-training academies. Executive pitchmen came into vogue after Chrysler ran memorable ads in the 1980s featuring CEO Lee Iacocca asking shoppers to give the embattled brand another chance. Some companies such as Papa John’s International Inc. featured its CEO in nearly every ad; Apple Inc. recently nodded to its rabid fans by casting Senior Vice President Eddy Cue and other executives alongside late-night host James Corden in an Apple Music TV commercial. Nonetheless, most executives have preferred to remain in the background, unwilling to appear publicity-hungry or risk drawing negative attention to themselves, according to Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at communications firm Weber Shandwick. In the age of hyper-sharing on social media, “everything is different,” she said. Mr. McMillon’s actions on wages and his consistent focus on employees make him a plausible pitchman, Ms. Gaines-Ross said. CEOs generally appear in ads for two reasons: to build credibility or to acknowledge a mistake, says Pradeep Chintagunta, a professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In a 2010 Domino’s Pizza Inc. ad, President Patrick Doyle discussed customer complaints about artificial-tasting pizza with cardboard-like crust and vowed to improve its food. Many customers appreciated his candor, Mr. Chintagunta said. Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton famously believed that his company didn’t need to court elites. But as the retailer grew to the world’s largest company by revenue, scrutiny on its dealings intensified and leaders changed tack. Mr. McMillon in particular has embraced a public profile, posting often to his Facebook and Instagram accounts. It is unlikely that Mr. McMillon’s ad changed many viewers’ minds, says Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, a firm that measures the impact of video advertising and doesn’t work with Wal-Mart. “You have a lot of people who are sensitive to Wal-Mart and labor issues that just didn’t buy into this guy,” questioning his high salary in survey comments, he says. Ace Metrix, which tested the Wal-Mart ad, surveys 500 viewers for each ad tested. (Including stock awards, Mr. McMillon earned $19.8 million in fiscal year 2016 which ended Jan. 31, 2016.) Wal-Mart always will have critics, but employees and policy leaders responded well to the ads, according to Mr. Bartlett. They liked that “the CEO is going on a TV and saying it’s a priority,” to support workers, he said, adding that the company has no plans to put Mr. McMillon in future ads. Google searches for ‘Wal-Mart CEO salary,’ spiked during the summer when the commercial aired to the highest levels since Mr. McMillon was announced as chief executive. Searches for ‘Wal-Mart CEO’ and ‘Doug McMillon’ also rose. He gained about 10,000 followers on his Instagram account, where commenters call him “commercial guy.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The Wall Street Journal Harlem se perfila como el próximo enclave del mundo del arte The Wall Street Journal.

Lauren Rohr | Staff Photographer   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     East Dundee may soon serve as a hub for Turkish companies hoping to expand into the U.S. Working with the Turkish government, a group of investors is considering acquiring land in the village to create a Turkish Trade Center -- a project that aims to improve trade and business relations between the two countries, said broker Emin Tuluce of Seven Hills Properties. During a presentation to the village board Monday, Tuluce said the group is interested in redeveloping the former Wal-Mart property, a roughly 12-acre parcel at 620 Dundee Ave., as well as adjacent land belonging to Plote Construction, Inc. The trade center would include new industrial buildings with warehouses, office space, employee training opportunities and showrooms, Tuluce said. The group would also likely retrofit the Wal-Mart building to their needs, he said, and a hotel, restaurants, a bank, retail shops and other commercial space to complement the industrial facilities. Roughly $50 million would be invested in the Turkish Trade Center, which is largely funded by the Turkish government, according to the project proposal, and hundreds of employees would be hired. Eray Utucu, Tuluce's associate and managing director of EVE Group Companies in Chicago, has spent the past four years helping more than 400 Turkish manufacturers and other businesses expand into the U.S. With the trade center project, he said, he wants to create a place for those companies to share resources, work with American corporations and thrive in the Chicago market. "The idea is to bring their U.S. headquarters here," Utucu said, noting all companies involved must be approved by the Turkish government. "That's our intention." He added investors may seek incentives from the village to assist with site acquisition and preparation. A temporary Turkish Trade Center has already been established in a rented space in Elk Grove Village, Utucu said, allowing the group to begin building its portfolio. When the five-year lease is up, he said, those companies would move to the permanent site. Other locations, such as Bolingbrook, Romeoville and some towns in Cook County, are also being considered for the permanent trade center, Utucu said. Tuluce, who has other investments in the village, said East Dundee is ideal because of its proximity to I-90 and O'Hare International Airport. East Dundee trustees welcomed the concept, and Utucu and Tuluce said they would continue discussions with the village and Plote before making a final decision next month.

By Catherine Lindsay October 17, 2016 An off-duty trooper and a police officer resuscitated a man suffering from a “massive heart attack” outside a Walmart Friday in Epping, New Hampshire. Around 3:30 p.m. Friday, trooper Christopher Prenaveau was exiting the Walmart when he observed a crowd gathered and a man on the ground who seemed to be in some sort of distress, New Hampshire State Police said in a statement. Prenaveau discovered the man was lying unconscious, was not breathing, and had no pulse. State police said a witness to the incident was on the phone with 911 receiving CPR instructions. The trooper began CPR on the man, whose identity will not be released, and told the witness to continue providing information to the 911 operator, according to the statement. Epping police then arrived to assist Prenaveau. Advertisement Officer Donald Ross took the automated external defibrillator (AED) out of his cruiser and he and Prenaveau used it on the man. They managed to regain a pulse by using the AED and administering CPR, state police said. The man was taken to Exeter Hospital, where he was treated for a “massive heart attack,” according to the statement. He was still at the hospital as of Sunday but is expected to make a full recovery. State police said Prenaveau had only received “First Aid” training, including CPR, a few weeks ago. TOPICS: Local News Want to see what readers are saying about our stories?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Azusa man accused of Hesperia Wal-Mart stabbing held on $1 million bail Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 11:30 AM Oct 17, 2016 at 5:53 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero HESPERIA — A 31-year-old Azusa man arrested after authorities say he stabbed a man in a motor home in the Wal-Mart parking lot Saturday was being held in lieu of $1 million bail, booking records show. If criminally charged, Darrell Lee Garrett is expected to be arraigned in a Victorville courtroom Tuesday afternoon. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies arrested Garrett on suspicion of attempted murder after responding to the Wal-Mart at 13401 Main Street at approximately 1:51 p.m. Saturday. Authorities said Garrett was found and apprehended inside the business. An 8-year-old boy related to Garrett was also inside the store, authorities said. A deputy was injured during an attempt to apprehend Garrett. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jodi Miller said the deputy was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and was released later Saturday. The boy was taken into custody by Children and Family Services. Authorities found the victim suffering from a stab wound and he was transported to a local hospital. Miller also said that she did not have an update on the victim, but his condition on Saturday was stable. “His injuries were not believed to be life threatening,” Miller said in an email Monday. The store was temporarily evacuated. A witness previously told the Daily Press that a crew cleaned up what appeared to be blood at the store's entrance and near the motor home. Garrett was being held at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, booking records show. Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com.

I jumped at the chance to use my electric chainsaw even though I was pretty sure the electric knife my granddad used to carve the Thanksgiving turkey back in the day was more powerful. Why do I have an electric chainsaw? Because my garage is a graveyard of gas chainsaws I can no longer crank. Instead of blowing another couple of hundred bucks on a onetime deal, I got the cheapest electric chainsaw I could find at Walmart. This was my chance to see if I could rip through a branch with it. The problem was when I arrived at my mom’s house in Melrose Heights, I found her powers of underestimation were immense. This was no “branch.” It wasn’t exactly a Sequoia either, but for my tiny little chainsaw it might as well have been. This tree was uprooted and lying across my mom’s driveway. It was not completely on the ground due to a couple of trees and their branches propping it up. I thought if I could cut it near the trunk the rest of it would come crashing to the ground, and I could attempt to go to work with my tiny chainsaw. To my astonishment, it worked, but instead of crashing to the ground in sync with my manliest of “TIIIIMMMBBBEEERRR!” yells, the tree just hung there like a Christmas decoration. Turns out vines were holding it up. After witnessing this, I’m convinced we could rebuild the Cooper River bridge with South Carolina vines. These things have the tensile strength of the steel used to construct the Freedom Tower. Tarzan would be fortunate to swing from such vines. Well, I was completely unprepared to deal with a “floating” log and “super” vines, so I slinked back to my mom with my tail between my legs and confessed I was not the man for this job. I could immediately see the disappointment in her face. Not only was she going to have to pay someone, but she’d raised a tender-handed office boy. I drove home feeling a little ashamed but sure I had done all I could with the tools God and Walmart had given me. I hoped I would get another chance to reclaim my manliness. Little did I know that chance would come the very next day. My mom called once more and said the floating log had somehow broken away from the grasp of the super vines and was now safely lying in the driveway. I rushed back to the scene of the crime where I once again tried to wrap my head around the fact my mom called this thing a “branch.” Then my tiny electric Walmart chainsaw and I went to work. We were a blur of leaves, twigs, logs, sawdust, arms, legs, and extension cords. I was the Tasmanian Devil of Shandon tearing through that mass of oak. OK, maybe I’m exaggerating a bit. It was more like I sawed for a second or two then stopped to fix the chain (Ironically, it was those pesky vines that popped it off its tracks instead of the thick branches). Saw. Stop. Fix. Repeat. By the time I got that thing cut up enough to drag away, I felt more like a repairman than a lumberjack, but I did get it removed. My mother’s driveway and my manlinesss were restored. I was no tender-handed office boy. The blisters on my palms were proof. So what if I had to coat the blisters in Neosporin and cover them with Mickey Mouse Bandaids...I am a manly man.

Shoppers were fed up. They complained of dirty bathrooms, empty shelves, endless checkout lines and impossible-to-find employees. Only 16 percent of stores were meeting the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company's customer service goals. The dissatisfaction showed up where it counts. Sales at stores open at least a year fell for five straight quarters; the company's revenue fell for the first time in Wal-Mart's 45-year run as a public company in 2015 (currency fluctuations were a big factor, too). To fix it, executives came up with what, for Wal-Mart, counted as a revolutionary idea. This is, after all, a company famous for squeezing pennies so successfully that labor groups accuse it of depressing wages across the U.S. economy. As an efficient, multinational selling machine, the company had a reputation for treating employee pay as a cost to be minimized. But in early 2015, Wal-Mart announced it would actually pay its workers more. That set in motion the biggest test imaginable of a basic argument that has consumed ivory-tower economists, union-hall organizers and corporate executives for years on end: What if paying workers more, training them better and offering better opportunities for advancement can actually make a company more profitable, rather than less? Amazon's holiday staffing plan: Hire 120,000 seasonal workers It is an idea that flies in the face of the prevailing ethos on Wall Street and in many executive suites the last few decades. But there is sound economic theory behind the idea. "Efficiency wages" is the term that economists -- who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas -- use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return. Wal-Mart's experiment holds some surprising lessons for the U.S. economy as a whole. Productivity gains have been slow for years; could fatter paychecks reverse that? Demand for goods and services has remained stubbornly low ever since the 2008 economic crisis. If companies paid people more, would it bring out more shoppers -- benefiting workers and shareholders alike? Deep in a warren of windowless offices here, the home office, in corporate-speak, executives in early 2015 sketched out a plan to spend more money on increased wages and training, and offer more predictable scheduling. They refer to this plan as "the investments." The results are promising. By early 2016, the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again. That said, the immediate impact on earnings and the company's stock price have been less rosy. The question for Wal-Mart is ultimately whether the short-run hit from these make the company a stronger competitor in the long-run. Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Wal-Mart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around? The future of the U.S. economy, and well-being of its workers, may well depend on the answer. Wal-Mart is the largest employer in Texas, with 166,131 employees working in 564 stores, according to 247wallst.com.

(Melissa Lukenbaugh/The New York Times) Pressure From Investors On the morning of Feb. 19, 2015, Wal-Mart's 1.2 million employees across the United States gathered -- many in front of their stores' vast walls of televisions for sale -- to watch a video feed by their chief executive. Doug McMillon, wearing a sweater and sitting in the office once occupied by the company founder Sam Walton, more or less acknowledged that Wal-Mart had made a mistake. It had gone too far in trying to cut payroll costs to the bone. "Sometimes we don't get it all right," McMillon said in the video. "Sometimes we make policy changes or other decisions and they don't result in what we thought they were going to. And when we don't get it right, we adjust." What most store employees probably didn't know was that McMillon and his executive team, who had been promoted into their jobs a year earlier, were under extraordinary pressure from investors. They needed to reverse a slide in business and fight off threats in all directions -- dollar discounters on the low end, Amazon online, direct competitors like Target and countless rivals specializing in one slice of Wal-Mart's business, from grocery chains to home-improvement warehouses. People were shopping more -- at Wal-Mart's rivals. Jeans, toys, electronics: What to skip and what to buy in October The company offers its millions of shoppers a simple way to make their dissatisfaction known. On the back of sales receipts is a message, "Tell us about your visit today," along with instructions to log on to a website and answer questions about the store: Was it clean? Were they able to get what they came for quickly? Were employees friendly? In early 2015, the answers that poured into Wal-Mart's global headquarters were, in a word, awful. The people paid to analyze the company tended to agree, too. A report by analysts at Wolfe Research in 2014 included photographs from a visit to Wal-Mart of a sad-looking display of nearly empty bins of oranges and lemons and disorganized shelves of crackers. "Walmart U.S.'s relentless focus on costs does seem to have taken some toll on in-store conditions and stock levels," they wrote. The analysts wryly added: "If an item is not on the shelf, you cannot sell it." The company had been busy raising profits by cutting labor costs. The number of employees in the United States fell by 7 percent from early 2008 to early 2013, for example, a span in which the square footage of stores rose 13 percent. Some of that reflects technological advances, like self-checkout kiosks. But when McMillon and a new team came in to reverse the slide starting in early 2014, they diagnosed the problem as having taken the cost-cutting logic too far. From store managers nationwide, they heard that years of cost-cutting meant Wal-Mart had become viewed as a last-ditch option for employment -- not the place that ambitious people might want to work. They were under such pressure to keep labor costs low that the employees they hired showed little loyalty or career-building devotion to their jobs. "We realized quickly that wages are only one part of it, that what also matters are the schedules we give people, the hours that they work, the training we give them, the opportunities you provide them," said Judith McKenna, who became chief operating officer in late 2014, in a recent interview. "What you've got to do is not just fix one part, but get all of these things moving together." That is how Wal-Mart decided to build 200 training centers to offer a clearer path for hourly employees who want to get on the higher-paying management track. And it said it would raise its hourly pay to a minimum of $10 for workers who complete a training course and raise department manager pay to $15 an hour, from $12. It said it would offer more flexible and predictable schedules to hourly workers. The news from Bentonville made headlines worldwide. The federal minimum wage had been $7.25 since 2009, and the labor market had awarded meager pay gains for people at the lower end of the spectrum for decades -- facts that helped increase Wal-Mart's bottom line. Now, the United States' largest private employer was signaling it was about to gingerly try a different approach -- and put $2.7 billion where its mouth was. Wal-Mart says its average pay for a full-time nonmanagerial employee is now $13.69 an hour, up 16 percent since early 2014. In the same span, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent. A Walmart associate inspects the placement of threads in the sewing department in Fayetteville, Ark. (Melissa Lukenbaugh/The New York Times) Back to the Classroom On a Thursday morning in late summer, at a Wal-Mart Supercenter No. 359 in Fayetteville, Wal-Mart trainees followed instructors around to learn what this particular store was doing right, and wrong, on this particular day. Teresa Rasberry praised a display of University of Arkansas tailgating equipment -- coolers, grills and folding chairs -- complemented by a fluttering effect created by putting electric fans beneath overhead banners for Razorbacks football. "See how it pulls the eye?" she asked the trainees. "Step back and think about how the customer sees it." Not so good was an end display of Mr. Clean, in which the various colors of the cleaning solution were jumbled together. Lining up the bottles so they make vertical stripes of color pulls more buyers in, she said. "It may sound silly," Rasberry said, "but it works! I've tested it myself!" Back in a classroom, Wal-Mart department managers discussed why a $15.86 bottle of Clairol hair coloring might be a bad fit for a store located in a place with an $80,000 average income. Women in that income bracket are more likely to get their hair colored at a salon, an instructor, Amanda Forslund, explained. This is one of the first of Wal-Mart's planned 200 training academies. New department managers will come in for two weeks of training covering general retail principles (customer service, inventory management) as well as specialized training for their specific area (the bakery or electronics, for example). Wal-Mart's pay increases got most of the attention. But the new training and prospect of better career paths for hourly staff members could be more significant in the long term. Wal-Mart touts employee bonuses — how do they compare to what the Waltons get? It's not that the retail industry doesn't offer potential paths to good incomes. Starting pay for an assistant store manager at Wal-Mart is $48,500, and the manager of one of its large stores can make comfortably above $100,000. The problem -- described by Wal-Mart managers and people outside the company who study labor markets -- is that there is no clear path for an entry-level worker to get there. Much training is impromptu, and chains have tended to view their hourly workers as interchangeable cogs rather than resources worth investing in. That reputation has been particularly strong at Wal-Mart. "I didn't used to think this would be something I would want to do, to work at Wal-Mart," said Garrett Watts, a 22-year-old newly promoted customer service manager at a store in Fayetteville. "There's a stigma with it. It used to be, if you worked at a Wal-Mart, it was the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant." He had gone to college for two years, suspended his education and was working as a desk clerk at a hotel when he switched to Wal-Mart this year, lured not by the starting wage but by what he had heard from a friend about the potential to rise within a giant company. He was soon promoted to department manager and runs customer services for the store. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13. "I wanted something that wasn't a stopgap, but could be a real career," Watts said. He is starting to set his sights on one of those $48,000-a-year assistant store manager jobs. In 2014, demonstrators marched toward the Park Avenue home of Alice Walton, a Walmart heir, to protest low wages and poor conditions in the service economy. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)  'Step in the Right Direction' Wal-Mart's announcement of what it refers to as "the investments" became something of a Rorschach test. To macroeconomists, it suggested that a falling unemployment rate was finally creating the response that theory suggests it should: employers raising wages to attract the workers they need. To labor activists, it was a sign that political campaigns to raise the minimum wage were paying off. To Wall Street analysts, it was the company owning up to the weaknesses long apparent in customer surveys and sales numbers. And in the company's own framing, it was about doing the right thing. "It's clear to me that one of the highest priorities today must be an investment in you, our associates," McMillon said in the video. It was all of these things, McKenna acknowledged. The improving economy made it harder for Wal-Mart to get good workers without paying more. Political momentum toward a higher minimum wage meant that entry-level pay would soon be rising in many places anyway. And executives really had concluded that customer service woes and slumping sales were because of underinvestment in employees. J.C. Penney plans to hire for the holidays like it's, umm, Christmas To some critics, though, it still amounted to a half-measure, and one framed to maximize public attention. "In our minds this is certainly a step in the right direction, but it's typical Wal-Mart in that it's minimal and there's a lot of spin on top of what's really happening," said Daniel Schlademan, a founder of the labor group OUR Walmart, which advocates the company have a starting wage of $15 an hour. In particular, new hires typically do not receive the $10 minimum wage until they finish a training program that is supposed to take six months but frequently stretches longer. And a promised increase in the predictability and flexibility of hourly workers' schedule is being tested in only 650 smaller "neighborhood market" stores. It has not been rolled out to the full 4,500 Wal-Marts. "The economic reality is that they put a great deal of pressure on managers to keep labor costs and hours down," Schlademan said. And the actions fall well short of what Zeynep Ton, an associate professor of operations at the Sloan School of Business at MIT, calls a "good jobs strategy," in which a retailer builds its entire operating philosophy around better-compensated staff members who are empowered to make decisions. Companies like Costco and the grocer Wegman's have a base pay closer to that of what the retail activists seek and are successful by many measures. (Costco pays entry-level workers at least $13 an hour, with hourly pay reaching up to $22.50). But while Wal-Mart's changes aren't as extensive as advocates would prefer, the company has shifted, in relative terms, up the industry's pay scale. In early 2014, Wal-Mart's self-reported average full-time pay was 3.7 percent higher than the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial workers at general merchandise stores calculated by the Labor Department. Now, it is 13.7 percent higher. "It's about being competitive in the market and making sure the talent pool of applicants was the right talent pool," McKenna said. That sounds an awful lot like a reference to the concept of an "efficiency wage." Customer Service Manager Garrett Watts at the Walmart in Fayetteville, Ark. (Melissa Lukenbaugh/The New York Times) Above the Market Rate The idea is that, sometimes, it is in an employer's best interest to pay more than necessary to get a worker into a job. The 18th-century economic thinker Adam Smith described the need to pay a goldsmith particularly well to dissuade him from stealing from you. More recently, economists (including Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, who worked on these topics as an academic economist in the 1980s) have found evidence that people are more productive when they are paid above the market rate. An employee making more than the market rate, after all, is likely to work harder and show greater loyalty. Workers who see opportunities to get promoted have an incentive not to mess up, compared with people who feel they are in a dead-end job. A person has more incentive to work hard, even when the boss isn't watching, when the job pays better than what you could make down the street. Economists have found evidence of this in practice in many real-world settings. Higher pay at New Jersey police departments, for example, led to better rates of clearing cases. At the San Francisco airport, higher pay led to shorter lines for passengers. Among British home care providers, higher pay meant less oversight was needed. Asian population growth brings new specialty retail center to Frisco What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what's ailing the broader U.S. economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages. Employers have succeeded at holding down labor costs. The "labor share" of national income -- the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers' pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere -- has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy. This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don't see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing. Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people. Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Wal-Mart, circa 2014 -- and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century. "The management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run," said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. "But in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability." Wes Stevenson, a Walmart Academy student, climbs a ladder to perfect the cereal display in Fayetteville, Ark. (Melissa Lukenbaugh/The New York Times) Customer Surveys Improve If you buy that theory -- and, to be clear, it is more theory than settled fact -- it means that the results of the Wal-Mart experiment matter a great deal. That implies that if large companies were to spend more to pay and train their workers, it could create gains for the economy as a whole. And it would ultimately be better for those same businesses. So, 19 months in, what is Wal-Mart finding? Those customer surveys that were so terrible at the start of 2015 have improved, with "clean, fast, friendly scores" rising for 90 consecutive weeks. Surveys by outside groups, like the investment banker Cowen & Co., point to more satisfied customers as well. That seems to have done the trick in reversing the sales slump. At stores open at least a year, sales were up 1.6 percent over a year earlier in the most recent quarter. That's better than it sounds. Overall sales at general merchandise retailers are down 0.4 percent this year compared with last, according to census data. The profit landscape is less sunny. Operating income for Wal-Mart's U.S. stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter, reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments. The company's stock has underperformed the overall U.S. stock market and an index of major retailers since the program was announced, suggesting investors are not convinced that these investments will pay a lucrative return anytime soon. But at the store level, managers describe a big shift in the kind of workers they can bring in by offering $10 an hour with a solid path to $15 an hour. "We're attracting a different type of associate," said Tina Budnaitis, the manager of Wal-Mart No. 5260 in Rogers. "We get more people coming in who want a career instead of a job." It's not the time for business groups to delay U.S.' new overtime labor rules Senior executives speak in the language you might expect from a manager worried about paying an efficiency wage. "Our associates are an asset," said McKenna, the chief operating officer. "You don't try to have the very lowest cost of an asset. You try to have the right asset. So rather than thinking about the lowest cost, the question is how do you get the best productivity." The question for Wal-Mart, and perhaps the economy as a whole, is whether these changes turn out to be one-off, or part of a shifting philosophy of how work and compensation should work in a 21st-century megacorporation. "Out of the gate, they've seen some improvement, but I think that's because they were doing Retail 101 so poorly," said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Co. "The better question is what happens next year and the following year. The low-hanging fruit has been harvested." McKenna declined to be specific about what might come next. And of course in a volatile corporate world, an unexpected recession or management change, or rise of a new competitor, could upend any plans. But she suggests that the company's changes should not be viewed as a one-time event. "This is a journey," she said. In the short term, the Wal-Mart experiment shows pretty clearly that paying people better improves both the workforce and the shoppers' experience, but not profitability, at least not yet. Still, here is one other nugget the company has found. The extra wages it is paying its workers don't all go out the door on payday, executives said. Spending at the stores by employees has risen -- offering a possible metaphor for what those efficiency-wage economists argue might happen across the economy, if wages were to climb.

Our endorsements for ANC in Ward 7 by Endorsements   •   October 17, 2016 DC's Ward 7 covers the northern half of neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, plus a few adjacent sections on its western shore. This election, Ward 7 has one of the highest numbers of contested seats for Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners in all of DC, a testament to these engaged citizens grappling with the changes in our city. Here are our recommendations for nine of these competitive races. Map created with Mapbox, data from OpenStreetMap. 7B01 - Debra Walker 7B05 - Villareal "VJ" Johnson 7B07 - Jimmie Williams 7C05 - Joseph C. Thomas   7D01 - Bob Coomber 7D04 - Cinque E. Culver 7E04 - Myron Smith 7E06 - Dontrell A. Smith 7F01 - Maria (Mafe) Jackson What are ANCs, and why should I care? Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, or ANCs, are neighborhood councils of unpaid, elected representatives who meet monthly and weigh in with the government about important issues to the community. ANCs are very important on housing and transportation. An ANC's opposition to new housing, retail, a bike lane, bus improvements, etc. can stymie or significantly delay valuable projects. On the other hand, proactive and positive-thinking ANCs give the government suggestions for ways to improve the neighborhood and rally resident support. Each ANC is divided into a number of Single Member Districts (SMDs), averaging about 2,000 voters. Races often hinge on a small handful of votes; Your vote—every vote—really counts. Not sure which SMD you live in? Find out here. Here are our endorsements After reviewing the candidate responses from each competitive race in Ward 7, we chose nine candidates to endorse. You can read their positions for yourself here, along with responses from many unopposed candidates. Pennsylvania Avenue, heading southeast. Photo by Tim Evanson on Flickr. In ANC 7B we endorse Debra Walker, Villareal "VJ" Johnson, and Jimmie Williams ANC 7B follows Pennsylvania Avenue from the bridge crossing the Anacostia River to the Maryland border, encompassing the Penn Branch area south of Fort Dupont Park and north of Naylor Road. The Penn Branch Shopping Center is an important area of focus in this area, as its redevelopment has been stalled for years, and just this summer it was auctioned off to a new owner. Residents also have their eye on the Skyland Town Center, a neighborhood area where shops and housing were razed to make room for redevelopment, but that still sits vacant after the recent withdrawal of Walmart as an anchor store. Many Ward 7 citizens felt strongly that the District government botched this and the nearby Capitol Gateway deal, leaving the neighborhoods with with a large patches of dirt where retail, investment, housing, and jobs should be. In the district between the Anacostia River and Minnesota Avenue, 7B01, we're endorsing Debra Walker. While not providing the most detailed answers, Debra seemed in step with many of Greater Greater Washington's values, including a focus on multiple levels of housing affordability and neighborhood investment and growth. In contrast, her opponent, Patricia Howard-Chittams, thinks that "more housing would be a detriment to 7B01," and seemed overly protective of parking when asked about bicycle lanes and improving bus infrastructure. Farther south near the Maryland border in 7B05, we were impressed by Villareal "VJ" Johnson. In general, it is clear that VJ knows his community well and has a detailed vision and plan for how to make it better. He had well thought-out answers for the different redevelopment sites in the area, and suggested a specific site for the development of more housing. VJ's energy and experience are exciting to us, and we look forward to his example of what a pro-active, not a reactive, commissioner can do in a changing neighborhood. 7B07 is at the northeastern edge of the ANC, bordering Fort Dupont Park. Jimmie Williams is an impressive candidate here. He wants to see his neighborhood "experience measured and sustainable growth" and details his support of mixed use plans at both Skyland Town Center and Penn Branch Shopping Center. According to him, the area "is changing and the newer residents are younger with various incomes," are "diverse... [and] don't want to drive to shop," signaling the need to improve alternative transportation options, including bike lanes. Even though he is "aware that there are some in [his] area that view the lanes as a omen of gentrification," he views them as "healthy and viable transportation alternative[s]." We like the sensitivity VJ brings in his approach to growth and development, and we think he will do well. The streetcar on Benning Road. Photo by BeyondDC on Flickr. In ANC 7C, we endorse Joseph Thomas The right-hand corner of the DC diamond is much of ANC 7C, including neighborhoods like Deanwood, Burrville, and others north of East Capitol Street on it's way towards Maryland. What the future holds for Capitol Gateway, the other large redevelopment site abandoned by Walmart, is on the minds of many here, as well as what changes the coming streetcar development along Benning Road will bring. One candidate stood out to us in this ANC: Joseph Thomas for 7C05. He believes the streetcar will "connect [the neighborhood] to greater economic growth," and wants more retail options to be developed at Capital Gateway, especially dining options for families. Joseph projects humility, but has good ideas for how to incorporate new housing into the neighborhood, and talks about tackling crime through increasing job opportunities and community outreach rather than more punitive enforcement. RFK stadium. Photo by Katja Schulz on Flickr. In ANC 7D, we endorse Bob Coomber and Cinque Culver Just north and west of 7C lies 7D, a district that includes large stretches of river water and park space. Kenilworth, Parkside, Kingman Park and River Terrace are some of the main neighborhoods within this district, which is bordered by East Capitol Street on the south and the Anacostia River on the west. Besides the extension of the streetcar on Benning Road, the major issue facing residents here are the plans for how to redevelop RFK stadium and the surrounding parking lots and parkland. 7D01 stretches west across the Anacostia into Kingman Park, and for this district we really like incumbent Bob Coomber. At RFK, he sees an opportunity to replace parking lots with new parks and trails (even housing if rules can allow), and wants to work with planners to "encourage neighborhood amenities before professional sports stadiums." His record includes improved pedestrian infrastructure along Oklahoma Avenue, and he has plans for more bike and pedestrian friendly changes. As a commissioner, Bob also has: Helped establish a community garden Fought against evictions in his neighborhood Actively supported family-leave legislation before the DC CouncilKeep up the good work, Bob. Immediately east of the river is 7D04 and the River Terrace community. In this district, Cinque Culver seems like a good candidate. He is supportive of an NFL Stadium at RFK, but wants to make sure that the stadium acts "as an economic multiplier, employing additional residents of all tax-brackets, as well as incentivizing... streetscape and public space maintenance around the site." He is also supportive of developing more housing in the neighborhood and of using the streetcar plans as opportunity to improve bike transit along Benning Road, and he seems generally open and balanced in his views.

Hugging the Maryland border south of the eastern-most tip of DC, 7E includes neighborhoods like Marshall Heights and Dupont Park. Here Myron Smith is our pick for ANC 7E04. He wants to increase the development of more housing near the two metro stations in the ANC, and is adamant about improving access across the river, especially for pedestrians and bikes. We're also endorsing Dontrell Smith, who is in a three-person race for 7E06, which is along the northeastern edge of the ANC. He plans to advocate for more and more affordable housing, in particular at the Capitol Gateway site. He is supportive of bike lanes along Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road, as well as other trail and lighting improvements throughout the area. One of Dontrell's opponents, Lakeshia Lloyd-Lee, also completed our questionnaire, but her answers were vague and non-committal. To be honest, what most impressed us in this race were Dontrell's notable efforts to catch our attention. He organized over 20 of his supporters to write in favorable remarks on our feedback form, and while we did not use those scores to determine our endorsement, the effort demonstrated the breadth of the candidate's neighborhood support, his organization, and his willingness to engage with the Greater Greater Washington community.

An portion stretches across the river to the RFK site, while the majority of the ANC surrounds the intersections of Minnesota Avenue and East Capitol Street, and is bordered by Benning Road on the north. 7F01 is a hotly contested race between four candidates, all of which completed our questionnaire. Of the four, Maria (Mafe) Jackson is as our top choice. Maria's answers to our questionnaire showed an in depth understanding of the issues and revealed a stand-out intellect. Her analysis of the current proposals at RFK was thorough, and included a proposal to look at adding an Oklahoma Avenue Metro station, as well as dramatic improvements to pedestrian and bike infrastructure across the Whitney Young Houston Bridge. She also is an advocate of extending the streetcar even farther towards Southern Avenue to improve transit options for that part of the city. She gave detailed plans for improving access across the ANC. Residents who live east of the Anacostia, she says "are locked in their community because of the poorly-designed existing bridges. The current design of the roads fails to provide safe access to the rest of the city for residents, families, and seniors. Beautiful parks surround this area, but they are not easily or safely accessible to residents by walk or bike." Maria was also solid on housing. She proposed building more housing at a nearby shopping center and vacant lots, and was strongly for home ownership support programs and education. "Advocating for these opportunities for our residents is what revitalization of my neighborhood looks like to me," she said. Many readers agreed that Maria would make an excellent commissioner, writing in our survey that she seemed "energetic, positive, responsible, and qualified." Two of Maria's opponents, Gia Stancell and Tyrell Holcomb, seemed reasonable but did not measure up to Maria's strengths. David Belt, the fourth candidate, responded negatively to many our questions about increased development and transit. Maria is the clear choice here. Want to read the responses of all of the Ward 7 ANC candidates who responded to our questionnaire and judge for yourself? Check out the full PDF for Ward 7. You can also see responses and our endorsements for all 8 wards on our 2016 ANC Endorsements Page, and we'll publish our rationale for those in upcoming posts. These are official endorsements of Greater Greater Washington. To determine this year's endorsements, we sent a reader-generated candidate questionnaire to all ANC candidates. We then published candidate responses and collected feedback. Staff evaluated all candidate responses and feedback for contested races and presented endorsements to our volunteer editorial board, which then made the final decision. 8 comments Comments Add a comment » Hey all, I have a couple of questions: 1) what's with the 7D01 outline? looks like they have almost no people, and tons of park. That seems...well... useless. why would they include mostly parkland and so few residential streets? 2) how do the boundaries get decided? they are all shapes and sizes. Thanks! by Transit User on Oct 17, 2016 11:56 am You obviously</> don't know 7B05 or Villareal. Bad choice. The seat would be better left vacant! by Ward 7 Voter on Oct 17, 2016 12:21 pm @Transit User 7D01 comprises the Kingman Park neighborhood, which you can see in the top left hand corner of the SMD. It does contain a lot of parkland because of RFK Stadium as well as Kingman & Heritage Islands. I suppose they have to be included somewhere in the off chance that someone were to develop those sites in between the decennial redistricting. by RBAP on Oct 17, 2016 12:29 pm Did you mean to include the "NEED IMAGE" after the paragraph regarding "Cinque Cilver"? If not, maybe a photo of the stadium? by Charity on Oct 17, 2016 12:31 pm @Charity, thanks for pointing that out! Leaving it in was an error. -Jonathan by Jonathan Neeley on Oct 17, 2016 12:41 pm Thanks for the endorsement for 7B07! I think you might have a typo in the last paragraph. "We like the sensitivity VJ brings in his approach to growth and development, and we think he will do well." I think you intended to type "We like the sensitivity JW brings in his approach to growth and development." by Jimmie Williams on Oct 17, 2016 1:30 pm @RBAP, You're correct, the Kingman Park neighborhood is what would account for the 2,000 residents in that district. But in addition to being important for sorting the residential population, the boundaries are also important for determining which ANC is given primacy in weighing in on any type of proposal or service change involving the area -- not just development proposals. When Kingman Island was in Ward 6, for instance, there was a proposal to turn it into a children's theme park. There was even a lease signed to do exactly that, under the fourth Barry administration. One of the biggest reasons that the plan was scuttled and the island left in its natural state was the activism of ANC 6B and its chairman, Tommy Wells. by PLKDC on Oct 17, 2016 2:32 pm Ward 7 Voter you're the only one with a negative comment directed at a person. Did your person not get endorsed? You didn't even list your name. People who "throw stones & hand their hands" are the worst. Kudos to GGW and everyone else trying to make a difference in their community. by Angela Jones. on Oct 19, 2016 9:17 am Add a Comment Name: (will be displayed on the comments page) Email: (must be your real address, but will be kept private) URL: (optional, will be displayed) You can use some HTML, like <blockquote>quoting another comment</blockquote>, <i>italics</i>, and <a href="http://url_here">hyperlinks</a>.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Peoria Public Schools accepting formal proposals for stadium site Monday Oct 17, 2016 at 10:24 AM Oct 17, 2016 at 10:52 AM Pam Adams Journal Star education reporter @padamspam PEORIA — In a follow-up to last month’s community forum on the future of Peoria Stadium, Peoria Public Schools is accepting formal proposals to renovate the iconic recreational space along War Memorial Drive. The School Board’s building committee also floated the idea of a ‘Save our Stadium’ committee that would raise funds for potential projects. The School Board could vote on a final proposal by March 2017. PPS board member Dan Walther pointed out potential proceeds from a county schools facilities sales tax referendum won’t be used for the stadium if the referendum passes in November. And the district has made it clear the site won’t be sold to a business, for instance Wal-Mart Inc., for commercial purposes. “If there are people who are really committed to saving our stadium, maybe they should help us,” Walther said during a building committee meeting Monday. Building committee chairman Dan Adler said the district needs to develop partnerships to follow through on the main sentiments expressed at the September forum. Dozens of people turned out for the public forum to tell board members to preserve the stadium’s historical significance and expand its recreational use. Adam White, co-owner of Running Central, presented one of the most detailed suggestions at the community forum. His proposal involves creating a public-private partnership that would demolish the 111-year-old grandstand and replace it with a new multi-use facility, including a covered stadium and a turf field. His vision, an estimated $10 million project, features a not-for-profit board and director who would be responsible for marketing the facility. “Certainly there was a large voice in the room that night,” Adler said, referring to the forum. “But maybe there are other ideas that weren’t represented that night or haven’t had time to be fleshed out.” The committee also wants more information about the feasibility of developing a citywide high school on the stadium site. That’s another idea that came up several times as the district assessed the public’s suggestions for the site. The controversy over a 2013 plan to sell the site to Wal-Mart and the stadium’s badly needed repairs spurred the district’s current efforts at public discussions about the stadium’s future. Adler set a timeline for a proposal process that considers the district’s annual budgeting process and the football season. The deadline for formal proposals, brief letters of intent, to the district is Nov. 10. Proposals should be submitted by email to Chief Financial Officer Mick Willis, mick.willis@psd150.org. Finalists will be announced by mid-December. Detailed discussions of each proposal are scheduled to occur from December to February, with a public meeting on the project in February 2017.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

Twin Falls Police Looking for Owners of Stolen Property By Benito Baeza October 17, 2016 5:52 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter TWIN FALLS, Idaho (PRESS RELEASE) Twin Falls Police Detectives have identified and recovered property believed to be stolen during a recent vehicle burglary. Detectives believe a GPS device and a Radar Detector were stolen from a vehicle parked at the Magic Valley Mall or the Twin Falls Walmart during the month of September 2016. The Twin Falls Police Department is asking for assistance to identify the owner(s) of these devices. During the months of August and September 2016, if you left your vehicle parked at the Twin Falls Walmart or at the Magic Valley Mall and discovered that either or both of these items were stolen from your vehicle, please contact Detective Ken Rivers at (208) 735-4357. "By taking a few extra minutes to make sure you are using your locks and protecting your property, you can greatly reduce the odds of becoming a victim of these crimes." Records indicate that 31 residential and vehicle burglary reports were filed with the Twin Falls Police Department during the month of September 2016. The vast majority of burglaries are crimes of opportunity, and can be some of the easiest crimes to prevent. Most criminals look for an easy target when it comes to burglaries of vehicles and homes. The Twin Falls Police Department wants to remind our community to make sure you take time to secure doors and windows, and don’t leave valuables in your vehicle overnight or when you are away from it. Also, exterior lighting is a strong deterrent to criminal behavior. Be sure to limit dark hiding places around your property and park your vehicles in well-lit areas. By taking a few extra minutes to make sure you are using your locks and protecting your property, you can greatly reduce the odds of becoming a victim of these crimes.

Promises Articles People Elections Subjects Says Donald Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break."   — Bernie Sanders on Wednesday, October 5th, 2016 in a speech Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump plan to end estate tax would give $53 billion break to Walton heirs By Tom Kertscher on Monday, October 17th, 2016 at 5:00 a.m. Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump's tax plan would give the Walton Walmart family a "$53 billion tax break." Campaigning for Hillary Clinton on Oct. 5, 2016 in Madison, Wis., the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination hit hard at the Republican nominee. On one front, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont attacked Donald Trump for his plan to repeal the federal estate tax, claiming the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break." Sanders was repeating a claim he had made on Medium, Twitter and elsewhere. We found that broadly speaking, the descendants of Walmart founder Sam Walton could face a tax bill of about $53 billion that would go away if Trump’s proposal became law. But that figure is based on estimates and without knowing the family members’ tax planning. And another Trump proposal would mean the descendants would face capital gains taxes on their inheritance perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars. The estate tax A few preliminary points before we dig into the Waltons’ wealth: The federal estate tax, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, is a tax "on your right to transfer property at your death." It consists of an accounting of everything you own, or have certain interests in, at the date of death. For 2016, an estate tax return must be filed if the estate is worth roughly $5.45 million or more. Trump is worth $3.7 billion, according to estimates done by Forbes for its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, although he has claimed he’s worth $10 billion. Clinton, who with Bill Clinton is worth perhaps $62 million, proposes to increase the estate tax for multimillionaires and billionaires, with rates as high as 65 percent. The Walton family Three times, twice on statements made by Sanders, we have rated claims that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. (Wealth being assets such as savings and retirement accounts, minus liabilities such as credit card debts and what’s unpaid on a home mortgage.) PolitiFact National in 2012, PolitiFact Wisconsin in 2013 and PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, each arrived at a rating of True. In those fact checks, we considered six people as being the Walton family. However, a seventh family member (Lukas Walton) joined the Forbes list in 2016. Here is their wealth, according to "real time" estimates by the Forbes 400 on the day Sanders made his claim: Jim Walton (son): $35.1 billion S. Robson Walton (son): $35 billion Alice Walton (daughter): $34.9 billion Lukas Walton (grandson): $11.2 billion Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $6.2 billion Christy Walton (daughter-in-law to Sam): $5.5 billion Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4.5 billion That’s a total of more than $132 billion. Under current law, and if the wealth estimates are accurate, that amount would be subject to a federal estate tax of 40 percent when the individuals die -- roughly the $53 billion that Sanders said. We consulted with five experts: Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center; Howard Erlanger, a trusts and estates expert and emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School; Edward Koren, University of Miami adjunct professor in estate planning and a partner at the international law firm Holland & Knight; Texas Tech University Law School professor Gerry Beyer, who edits the Wills, Trusts & Estates Prof Blog; and Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. According to the experts, there are at least two factors indicating that the actual tax due would be less than $53 billion -- possibly much less. 1. Charitable donations Wealthy people often designate a substantial portion of their assets to be donated to charity upon their death. Those funds are not subject to the estate tax. Koren gave this example: If $100 billion of the total $132 billion were designated for charity, the estate tax owed would be $13 billion, not $53 billion. It’s also possible that some assets could be shielded by tax avoidance techniques, Viard said. 2. Trump’s other proposal In addition to proposing a repeal of the estate tax, Trump has proposed to repeal a tax rule that, if approved, would result in the Walton heirs paying more in capital gains taxes. So, under Trump’s plan, there wouldn’t be an estate tax -- under which taxes must be paid essentially right away -- but an increase in capital gains taxes, which don’t have to be paid until assets are sold. It is impossible to know exactly how much of a capital gains tax the Waltons would face under Trump’s proposed change, but it could be tens of billions of dollars. On the other hand, unlike the estate tax, the next generation of Waltons could defer paying the capital gains tax for as long as they hold onto the assets they inherit. Our rating Sanders says Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break." Based on the collective wealth of seven Sam Walton descendants, they could face a tax of about $53 billion under the current estate tax law. But that amount is based on estimates of their wealth and it would be reduced based on any charitable donations the family members might arrange for upon their death. Meanwhile, Trump also proposes higher capital gains taxes, which could amount to a tax bill of tens of billions for the Walton heirs -- although that tax wouldn’t be imposed until they sell assets such as Walmart stock For a claim that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9673993-3e57-4e72-a28f-a546f1e4376e Advertisement About this statement: Published: Monday, October 17th, 2016 at 5:00 a.m. Researched by: Tom Kertscher Edited by: Greg Borowski Subjects: Families, Taxes, Wealth Sources: YouTube, WisconsinEye video (36:30) of Bernie Sanders speech, Oct. 5, 2016 Internal Revenue Service, "Estate tax," Oct. 3, 2016 Interview, Howard Erlanger, emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Oct. 6, 2016 Email, Texas Tech University Law School professor Gerry Beyer, Oct. 6, 2016 Email, Tax Policy Center Sol Price fellow Roberton Williams, Oct. 5, 2016 Email, Bernie Sanders campaign spokesman Warren Gunnels, Oct. 5, 2016 Email, Alan Viard, tax policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Oct. 6, 2016 Email, Holland & Knight partner and University of Miami adjunct professor in estate planning Edward Koren, Oct. 5, 2016 Forbes, 2016 Forbes 400 list (and profiles for Walton family members as of Oct. 5, 2016) How to contact us We want to hear your suggestions and comments.

You might also be thinking, “How am I going to afford it?” The good news is there are ways to save on iPhones and iPods. From trading in your iPhone at the Apple Store to scoring a cheap iPod from a discount website, here are five ways to pay less for an iPod or iPhone. guteksk7 / Shutterstock.com Buy Refurbished Buying refurbished iPhones and iPods can mean getting a great discount on a solid device that often boasts up to a full year’s warranty. “The amount of cash consumers can save by opting for refurbished iPhones or iPods depends on the generation, capacity and seller,” said Kendal Perez, a savings expert with CouponSherpa.com. “In the case of iPhones, it also depends on the carrier and whether or not the device is unlocked.” For instance, buying through Apple will get you discounts of about 15 percent for fifth-generation iPod touches, saving you around $30 to $40, assuming prices from $169 to $209. These devices come with the same one-year warranties as new ones. Perez also found deals at Walmart for the iPod nano at up to 35 percent off the $149 sticker price, bringing the cost down to about $99. And Amazon came through with a certified refurbished seventh-generation nano for $104.99. As for iPhones, you can find refurbished ones at places like JemJem.com, which lists a 64GB iPhone 6 for $449.99. That’s $200 off the cost of a new model at Best Buy — which is notoriously good for deals on Apple products. Perez also found refurbished iPhone 6 16GB phones at Walmart for as little as $369. “Ultimately, consumers should compare prices and review sellers to ensure they’re working with a well-rated and reputable company,” said Perez. ptnphoto / Shutterstock.com Trade in Your iPod or iPhone for Cash Maybe you’d rather get cash — or at least some digits in your PayPal account — for your old iPhone. And if you don’t want to use Craigslist or eBay, there are sites that make doing so easy. On Glyde.com, you can provide information about which phone you’d like to unload and what condition it’s in and get an estimate of what the site can sell it for. For instance, a recent search revealed that a 64GB iPhone 6 in good shape was expected to fetch $359. Perez also found that a seventh-generation iPod nano would net $62.95. However, she cautions that sellers might have to wait to get their money. “Glyde gives you a ‘market price’ bid for your device and suggests this bid will result in a quick sale. However, you do not receive money until the device sells, and in that time you might decide to drop the price to expedite the sale,” she said. Gazelle.com and NextWorth.com are two more sites to check out, said Perez. “Gazelle offers payment in the form of check, Amazon gift card or PayPal. You also receive packing materials to send your device free of charge to Gazelle,” she said. “NextWorth sends sellers packaging materials for their devices and offers payment in the form of PayPal or check within a week or so of receipt. Finally, Perez recommends trying uSell.com, which works with a network of buyers to get you a range of bids from interested companies. “Choose the bid you like best and receive a pre-paid shipping kit with tracking from uSell to send in your device. You’ll receive payment via PayPal or check,” said Perez.

But, said Perez, make sure you shop around. “If you’re considering trading your iPhone or iPod for a store gift card, compare bids from multiple retailers to determine which one offers the most value,” she said, adding that rates vary dramatically. “Best Buy and Amazon offered better rates for both my iPhone 6 16 GB and iPod nano. Target’s bid for my iPod nano was laughable compared to Best Buy and Amazon and also came in lowest for my iPhone bid.” Here is a snapshot of Perez’ findings: Target: $152.50 for iPhone 6 16GB, $4.85 for iPod Best Buy: $200 for iPhone, $45 for iPod nano Amazon: Up to $204 for iPhone, up to $55 for iPod nano Walmart: $180 for iPhone, $25 for iPod nano You can also get Apple Store gifts cards through Apple’s Renew recycling program. For instance, an iPhone 6 in good shape garnered a $275 bid, subject to quality verification. Simon Greig / Shutterstock.com Trade in Your iPod or iPhone for a New iPhone Since the release of the iPhone 7, Apple resellers have been offering incentives to customers who want to trade in their old devices for the latest models, said Perez. While most of the big wireless carriers are offering discounts on the iPhone 7 with eligible device trade-in as well, the offers aren’t always as good as they sound. As a result, customers need to pay close attention to the fine print. “Customers receive monthly billing credits throughout the life of the 18-month to 30-month contract they sign with the carrier,” said Perez. “You’ll also owe taxes at the time of purchase and be required to pay the remaining device balance if you cancel services early. Finally, only well-qualified buyers are eligible for these offers.” Find Out: What Is a Good Credit Score? Here are two options being offered by big-name providers: Verizon is offering the iPhone 7 for as little as $99.99 with a qualified trade-in. Trade-in values range from $300 for a 5 or 5s to $550 for a 6s. AT&T is offering the iPhone 7 32GB for $0 when users switch to AT&T and have DIRECTV service. Esther Purple / Shutterstock.com Shop the Scratched or Dented Sections If you’re okay with a few scratches or dents on your iPhone, you can score some great deals at certain retailers. “While you won’t be sold an iPhone or iPod with a cracked screen, the device might feature scratches on the screen or shell and might still have custom engraving from the previous owner or evidence of engraving which has been scraped off,” said Perez. “Since most of us buy fancy phone covers, scratches and dents on the shell aren’t much of an issue.” She added that at reputable dealers, like JemJem.com, the phones are tested to ensure full functionality. Currently, you can buy an iPhone 6 in the “Scratch & Dent” category for as low as $399 from JemJem.com and $274 from Glyde.com. There might be some differences in the condition between the two, but that’s up to a 39 percent savings from the retail price, said Perez.

The actress, Yves Saint Laurent muse, and wife of John Paul Getty, Jr. died of a heroin overdose at the age of 30, but not before cementing a now-ubiquitous standard of luxe bohemianism. The Gettys’ Marrakech home (dubbed, aptly, “the Pleasure Palace”) played host to the likes of The Rolling Stones, and the jet-setting duo were famously photographed on its roof in Patrick Lichfield’s now-iconic shot, looking every bit like a pair of doomed romantics, she in brocade and cream leather boots, he in a hooded abaya. Getty’s nomadic, lush wardrobe of caftans, poet’s blouses, bangles, and babouches continues to stoke fire in the imaginations of designers season after season; indeed, if moodboards are any indication, that 1969 Lichfield snap hasn’t aged a bit in the intervening years. And today, in honor of the late icon’s birthday, we’re rounding up five looks that embody a bit of her bewitching brand of glamour.

Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) A state audit found thousands of dollars in potentially fraudulent credit card purchases and shoddy oversight — including five years of unfiled tax returns — at the Economic Development Corporation of Utah. Two top officials have left EDCUtah since the audit began: President and CEO Jeff Edwards announced his retirement Oct. 6, and Todd Brightwell, the chief operating officer, stepped aside earlier this year. Brightwell — who is not directly named in the audit but receives much of the scrutiny for improper purchases and poor management — received a severance package that included a vehicle, several months' pay, health-insurance coverage and electronic equipment. Auditors questioned the generosity of the package. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "There is no doubt mistakes were made in the financial operation. … We've undertaken a robust set of changes to make sure all these recommendations [by the audit] are implemented," Edwards said. "Our business model is sound, and with these recent changes, we'll be able to do even better in the future." A call to a number listed as Brightwell's was not answered Tuesday evening; the line's voicemail box was full. Brightwell was found to have made at least $5,788 of improper credit card purchases that auditors said could be considered fraudulent. For example, Brightwell paid a $148 traffic ticket in Iron County and for a $48 traffic school course, bought two Apple iPhones for $425, paid $173 for two golf outings for, spent $207 at a pottery studio and bought $317 in unspecified goods at Wal-Mart. Brightwell also had another $89,290 in credit-card purchases, more than half of which did not have a receipt or a business purpose — things like $16,000 in travel and another $24,000 in computer hardware, gas, parking, golf fees and a satellite-radio subscription. When he left EDCUtah, Brightwell had $4,000 deducted from his severance package to repay EDCUtah for the unauthorized credit-card purchases, but auditors said that may be below what was actually owed and questioned why he was given such a generous offer. "We believe that it is questionable to further enrich an individual who already improperly benefited from personal charges with a company credit card," the audit said. "With over 60 percent of EDCU funding coming from state and local taxpayer funds, this action by EDCU is strongly questionable." Rep. Brian King, D-Salt Lake City, questioned why the severance was so lavish, and Edwards said that Brightwell had been a valuable part of EDCUtah for years. They agreed to how much they estimated he owed, it was deducted from the final amount and Edwards approved the settlement. Brightwell also bought 15 devices from the Apple Store, although several could not be located after he left — a phone, a tablet and two computers. EDCUtah has a budget of $3.2 million a year, with most coming from taxpayers, either at the state level or through dues paid by cities and counties. As The Salt Lake Tribune reported in May, the audit found that EDCUtah failed to file its required tax returns for five straight years, beginning in 2010, prompting the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status. EDCUtah lost its tax exemption for about two years before it was brought to the management's attention. The audit said Edwards appropriately took the blame for the oversight, but he said Brightwell and the agency's former office manager failed to provide requested data to the corporation's accounting firm despite multiple requests, and that Edwards was never told of the problems. Some of the returns that were eventually filed were incomplete or contained errors that needed to be corrected. The tax forms were eventually filed and the tax-exempt status reinstated, although the audit suggests management may have made misleading statements to the IRS about why the tax forms weren't filed on time. The audit suggests that EDCUtah executives may have broken state ethics law by buying $11,517 in meals and giving $867 in gifts to officials at the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED); the GOED technically contracts with EDCUtah for business recruitment. Many of the meals came at a time the GOED was updating its state contract with EDCUtah, increasing it from $525,000 to $900,000. State law prohibits a contractor from giving gifts to its contracting entity. A legislative attorney called EDCUtah's practice "risky" and a minimum and possibly illegal. » Next page...

Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Police are looking for a group of women they say have been fraudulently buying prepaid credit cards throughout the state. The women, at least four, apparently used fraudulent funds and stolen credit cards to purchase prepaid cards at five Wal-Mart stores — Syracuse, Midvale, Orem, Riverdale and Ogden — on Sept. 18, according to a news release from Unified Police Department. Their operations allegedly have led to a combined $62,000 loss for the affected shops in Utah. Investigators believe the women are from Michigan and traveling the country as part of a fraud ring. They typically target multiple locations on the same day, the release states.

Misdemeanor charge filed in attack on Muslim professor Ron Wilkins , rwilkins@jconline.com 7:15 a.m. EDT October 19, 2016 Austin Bradley Gregory (Photo: File) LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Austin Bradley Gregory faces a formal misdemeanor charge of battery for allegedly attacking a Purdue professor who is Muslim.. The 37-year-old Canadian citizen of Egyptian heritage told the Journal & Courier in September that Gregory's alleged attack started as a road rage incident about 5:45 p.m. Sept. 3. It ended in the his driveway, where the professor said Gregory punched and kicked him while the woman driving the Cadillac yelled, “Kill him! Kill him!" The attack prompted the Council on America-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group for Muslims, to call for Indiana to adopt hate-crime laws. CAIR published a press release last month, calling for Indiana to adopt enhanced sentencing for crimes that target victims based on religion, race or sexual orientation. The professor said last month that his well-meaning friend contacted CAIR after the attack, and he did not want to make the incident into a political one. He did, however, want justice, which he said was criminal charges against Gregory and the driver of the Cadillac. The Labor Day weekend incident started in the Wal-Mart parking lot in West Lafayette. Gregory, 21, was a passenger in the Cadillac that honked at the professor as he backed out of a parking space and into the path of the Cadillac. The woman driving the Cadillac flipped off the Purdue professor, Gregory said during a brief interview on Sept. 7. The victim told the Journal & Courier the driver yelled, "Go home, f---ing foreigner." Gregory accused the professor of flipping off the driver of the car, which the professor denied. The charging information and probable cause affidavit filed with the charge, however, make no mention of this exchange or the flipping off of the professor and the driver. After the dust-up in the parking lot, the two vehicles traveled the same route to their respective homes until Morehouse Road, when Gregory's vehicle attempted to turn left, and the professor passed the Cadillac on the right. That's when the Cadillac began following the professor, Gregory said. They were going to report the professor for trying to run them off the road, he said. The professor told the Journal & Courier he did not drive recklessly or attempt to run the Cadillac from the road. Last month, Gregory told the Journal & Courier that when they got to the professor's home on Ledyard Street, the professor walked up to the car and reached inside. Gregory said he was protecting his family and that's when the fight started. But according to the affidavit, Gregory told police that he got out of the car and the professor yelled at him, so he punched the man once in the left eye, according to the affidavit. Two of the professor's neighbors witnessed the attack, according to the probable cause affidavit filed with the charge. They told police they saw Gregory yelling at the professor, get out of his car and punch the professor several times, according to the affidavit. Gregory, who lives in Country Squire Apartments in rural West Lafayette, was arrested Sept. 3, and he posted bond on Sept. 4. Last month, the professor told the Journal & Courier, "I will not stay here if I don't see justice. This country is not safe. There is no justice now." The Journal & Courier  was unable to contact the professor Tuesday.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Caltrans hazmat crew cleans up wash behind Wal-Mart in Victorville Tuesday Oct 18, 2016 at 2:50 PM Oct 18, 2016 at 4:26 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero VICTORVILLE — A Caltrans hazmat crew was busy Tuesday morning cleaning a wash behind the Wal-Mart on Amargosa Road and disposing of mounds of trash and debris. The crew worked the wash area, just west of Amargosa Road, picking up trash and large items, including shopping carts, a microwave oven and even a small freezer. Caltrans Public Information Officer Shelli Lombardo said the the hazmat crew was on scene for biohazard precautions, such as possible human waste and drug paraphernalia in the area. Numerous hypodermic needles could be seen being picked up after they were sprayed with a bleach solution by one of the crew members. While Lombardo was unable to provide an estimated cost for this operation, she said the biohazard removal costs alone are estimated to be $4,000 to $5,000. Over the last fiscal year, Caltrans spent nearly $179,000 on cleaning illegal homeless encampments, according to Lombardo. The figure includes cleaning costs and repairs to damaged fences, irrigation systems and other things. The wash is part of the culvert for runoff rainwater from Interstate 15. “If we get rain this winter, water will come off the freeway and into that drainage. We certainly don’t want any people in there when that happens,” she said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department notified Caltrans after receiving complaints from citizens and sending out their Homeless Outreach and Proactive Enforcement team to the area. Caltrans then posted a notice to vacate the illegal campsite. The notice read that the wash must be vacated by 8 a.m. on Monday. The notice was posted on Oct. 14. Caltrans sent out a maintenance crew on Monday to establish an access point for the crews to start the cleanups on Tuesday. Local business owner Dave Gross, who owns DG’s Lawncare, said he’s been lobbying to have the wash cleaned for a “couple years.” Gross is contracted as the landscape company for the Wal-Mart location and various other shopping centers locally, including Winco on Roy Rogers Drive. Gross said he was pleased to see the area being cleaned up, but he wasn't sure how long it would last. “I give it two, maybe three months before it’s back being filled with trash,” Gross said. “The city previously cleaned the area, not as thorough as Caltrans is doing, and that didn’t really last. I don’t know what it’s going to take but this is a serious problem." Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DD_JQuintero.

Home News Business Sports Lifestyle Opinions Obituaries Contact Us Pay Bill Heroin addict caught attempting to break into car Editor October 18, 2016 Comments Off on Heroin addict caught attempting to break into car SLIDELL — Slidell Police Officers arrested an alleged heroin addict who was caught attempting to break into a vehicle on Saturday, October 8, according to Slidell Police Department Assistant Chief Kevin Swann. Slidell police responded to an attempted vehicle burglary in progress in the parking lot of Walmart located at 39142 Natchez Drive. Witnesses stated that they noticed a subject, later identified as Justin Davis, acting suspicious and erratic, according to Swann. He began pulling on vehicle door handles in an attempt to break into a vehicle. Witnesses then stated that Justin Davis momentarily got into his own vehicle with another subject, later identified as Tiffany Singletary, Swann said. Officers detained the suspects and investigated the incident further, at which point they found and seized packages of heroin on Justin Davis, and used and unused hypodermic needles in the possession of Tiffany Singletary. Tiffany Singletary admitted on scene that she is battling a heroin addiction. Justin Davis was arrested and charged with attempted simple burglary of a vehicle, and possession of a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance to-wit heroin. Tiffany Singletary was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. Slidell Police are still investigating other aspects of this case, and expect more charges to come. “The heroin epidemic is affecting our families, our businesses, our community, and our way of living in various destructive ways. Addicts must find the inner strength and courage to turn to and get help from organizations like Operation Angel or A.C.E.R., and not turn to a life of crime victimizing others to feed their addiction,” Slidell Police Chief E.J. Howard said.

But many remain vacant in other provinces. Jason Payne / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Twelve of 19 former Target stores across B.C. have been filled since the U.S. retailer’s retreat from Canada last year, outpacing the national rate at which landlords have been able to fill their empty Target spaces, experts say. In B.C., four of those vacated were taken up by Lowe’s; four by Canadian Tire; and four by Walmart, according to numbers provided by Jason Schouten, a principal with Avison Young in Vancouver. He said the remaining seven locations in B.C. are either sitting unused or being renovated to make them suitable for other big-box retailers like Winners, Sport Chek and Marshalls. “There are some (Target locations) that, in my opinion, are going to struggle to be filled with traditional retail because of the tertiary or secondary nature of some of these markets,” Schouten said in an interview last week, pointing to the empty Target site in Campbell River as an example. He said urban locations with strong overall retail markets have proven to be more desirable for other replacement retailers. “Those (properties) were back-filled quickly either by other large format retailers or by multiple mid-size retailers.” At marquee locations still left vacant by Target, such as Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby and Lansdowne Centre in Richmond, the landlords are comfortable taking their time to find the right full-time tenant, Schouten said. That’s valuable space that would be easy to fill on their own terms, he said. “In some instances landlords were happy to take that space back for renovations,” he said.  Owners in secondary markets with empty Target shells “wouldn’t call the past year an easy time,” agreed Jim Smerdon, a vice-president and director of retail consulting with Colliers International. “But as B.C. leads the country once again in retail growth, and could see a six per cent sales growth through 2016, it’s clear that we could have fared much worse,” he said. Retailers are looking to do more than fill in competitive gaps and are looking for markets with growth potential, Smerdon said. “That used to be Alberta, but it’s definitely B.C. once again.” Craig Patterson, a retail consultant and the editor in chief of Retail Insider, confirmed that 12 of B.C.’s 19 vacant Target locations have so far been filled. “The Lower Mainland is probably a little more protected because it’s a unique market compared to other parts of Canada,” he said. “But in other parts of Canada, we’ve definitely got Target spaces that haven’t been filled.” Target announced in January 2014 that it would be closing all of its 133 Canadian locations. The news came only two years after Target’s rapid expansion into Canada — a move hamstrung by poor inventory management, problems with point of sales, and complaints of high prices. The Minneapolis-based company said at the time that it did not expect to turn a profit until 2021. About 17,600 employees lost their jobs across Canada as a result of the Target closures. “Target had some exceptional locations in Canada and it also had some real estate that was a challenge at the best of times,” Patterson said. “When Target took over the Zellers leases, it got all of the company’s real estate basically. They got the good and the bad.” Patterson said that about half of the former Target locations Canada-wide are unoccupied. “A lot of real estate came onto the market all at once and I think that a lot of landlords around Canada have really struggled to find the best uses for these spaces once they became vacated by Target,” he said. “I think it was a real tragedy that Target had to leave, and it really created a major problem for landlords across this country.” He said there are still notable empty Target locations in Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Brandon and Winnipeg. “The Greater Toronto Area has lots.” B.C. landlords have mostly fared better, he said. “I think British Columbia is a bit of a better news story. More of the Target spaces in B.C. have been spoken for.” Patterson added that there are troubling signs for holders of large-scale vacant retail spaces on the horizon. He said Walmart announced on Oct. 6 that it would be slowing down brick and mortar expansion, and focusing more on online sales development. “It may be a case that some of these Target spaces will be a challenge to fill,” he said. “That’s a lot of real estate that has to be dealt with.” evan@evanduggan.com twitter.com/EvanBDuggan Offices evolving as millennials take over with their team approach Reverse 'horrific' decision on First Nations financial disclosure, B.C.

Gil Johnson, president of Saginaw Valley Ford Lincoln, said he read about Rae-Showna Jones, 17, being found by police in New Mexico, and how her mother, Charlena Poole, was trying to raise money to bring her home. Rae-Showna JonesCourtesy | Charlena Poole  "I just want to get her home to her mother," Johnson said. Jones went missing on Dec. 17, 2015. She was briefly spotted in Saginaw Township and her mother received reports she was later spotted in Chicago. Police from Rio Rancho, N.M. contacted Michigan State Police the morning of Oct. 18 to inform them they had found Jones wandering near an intersection by a Walmart and that she seemed agitated. MSP contacted Poole to inform her that her daughter had been located. Poole then began trying to put a plan together to get her daughter home. Poole believes her daughter was a victim of human trafficking. Police said it could be a possibility, but they want to interview her before drawing any conclusions. Missing Saginaw teen found in New Mexico Johnson said he read about the story and felt he needed to help. Johnson offered to buy a plane ticket to help get Jones home. "I have a daughter," Johnson said. "If my daughter was somewhere stranded or missing I would hope someone would help me." Poole said she is thankful for Johnson's offer. "He is one of God's angels and I thank him for doing what's right," Poole said. "I want to thank everyone that has been trying to help me and my family." Poole said she prayed every night that her daughter was missing for her safe return. "I do believe this is God blessing her," Poole said.

This story is part of Small business Monica Vernon is no stranger to hard work You should get to know: Chelsea Gavin This Iowa man can put your face on a bobblehead Clusters, crowdfunding and other ways small businesses survive Frank Mokosak, For the Register 2:03 p.m. CDT October 18, 2016 Frank Mokosak (Photo: Special to the Register) Small-business owners must rely on their own ingenuity and innovation to survive. Fortunately, over the past decade, innovation has emerged in networks supporting small businesses, helping them acquire much-needed resources. Clusters — strength in numbers Clusters are groups of businesses, suppliers, academic institutions and other related organizations working within the same industry and concentrated in the same geographic region. Cluster businesses can benefit from access to necessary resources such as talent, raw materials, research, and financing opportunities. Examples include the medical centers in Massachusetts, the high-tech industry in Silicon Valley and the wineries in northern California. The advantages gained from organizations working together can include economies of scale and political influence — benefits typically associated with corporate giants such as Walmart and Apple. In 2010, the Small Business Administration unveiled the Clusters Initiative, a program that invests in 14 regional clusters representing various industries throughout the United States. A third-party organization has been tasked with evaluating the SBA program each year. Results from the 2014 report (the most recent data available) include the following: A majority of small and large businesses have established at least one alliance with other cluster members; Nearly 40% of small businesses said cluster services had some influence on their access to capital;; Revenues in cluster-associated small businesses increased an average of 6.9%, twice as fast as benchmark firms; Average monthly payroll in small businesses grew an annualized 14% during the two-year period ending in September 2013. Crowdfunding — online investing What started more than a decade ago as a way for art and music lovers to help fund their favorite artists’ latest endeavors has evolved into a sophisticated means for small-business owners to raise capital. In fall 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released final rules governing equity crowdfunding, or the ability for entrepreneurs to issue equity to individual investors over the internet. Government regulations include providing certain information to the SEC, potential investors and the funding portals, including: A description of the business and how the funds will be used; The price of securities or method of determining the price; The target offering amount, the fundraising deadline, and whether the company will accept investments exceeding the target; Financial statements, possibly reviewed by an independent public accountant and accompanied by the company’s tax returns. Incubators and accelerators — fueling growth Incubators and accelerators are similar in terms of providing valuable resources and mentoring to new businesses; however, one is intended to help “incubate” the budding business owner’s idea, while the other is generally designed to “accelerate” the growth of an existing company. Incubators provide companies with programs, services and space for varying lengths of time based on company needs and incubator policies. By contrast, accelerators take a group of companies through a specific process over a defined period of time, typically three to four months. The program often culminates in a funding pitch or demo day. While accelerators make seed investments in companies in exchange for small equity stakes, incubators typically do not make such investments.

He did not address the future of President Barack Obama's ban on lobbyists joining the administration. Story Continued Below NEW BUSINESS: — Capitol Counsel's Clint Robinson, Shannon Finley and Jeffery Walter are joining the lobbying team for Bayer, through Gephardt Government Affairs, on federal review of the Monsanto acquisition. — Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics, competing with Paris and Budapest, tapped Matthew Bernstein of DLA Piper to lobby.

In July, Congress passed a joint resolution supporting the bid, and the International Olympic Committee will decide next September. — The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida has retained HBW Resources, including former Rep. James Hayes. For decades, the Miccosukee Tribe has insisted that its casino gaming revenue is exempt from federal tax. The IRS disagrees, and so did a federal court in August, paving the way for the government to collect $1 billion in back taxes from the tribe’s 600 members. — Former Sens. John Breaux and Trent Lott of Squire Patton Boggs are lobbying for LCMC Health, a statewide health care provider in Louisiana with plans to expand its network into New Orleans next spring. LCMC Health manages University Medical Center, a New Orleans teaching hospital funded by the state government, and last month it renegotiated its public-private partnership with Gov.

REVOLVING DOOR: Bloomberg Politics has a new graphic tracking former officials' lucrative positions corporate boards. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, now at Moelis & Co., was the highest-earning in 2015. Boards should have members with a mix of skills and backgrounds, said And he said it isn’t realistic to expect members of Congress to never pursue another livelihood. “You can’t outlaw people from working,” Alec Levenson, a senior research scientist at the Center for Effective Organizations in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, said. “We’re always going to be in this imperfect world where the people who have the money and the power, they are going to have a better advantage than the ones who don’t.” JOBS REPORT: — Peck Madigan Jones hired Jay Heimbach, previously a special representative at the World Bank, as partner, The Hill’s Megan Wilson reports. Heimbach was also senior director of the ONE campaign; White House special assistant to the president for legislative affairs under President Barack Obama; and chief of staff to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). The firm’s clients include biotechnology company Amgen, Entergy Corporation, health insurer Anthem, the Business Roundtable, Mastercard, Spotify, Microsoft and the Environmental Defense Action Fund. — Lauren Beck was promoted to senior director in charge of U.S. government affairs at Kellogg’s. — Greg Chopskie joined law firm Morrison & Foerster from Gilead Sciences, where he was associate general counsel for IP. PRISONER'S DILEMMA: Private prison company GEO Group, which recently hired three lobbying firms, contributed $150,000 to Rebuild America Now, a pro-Donald Trump super-PAC led by developer Tom Barrack, writes Mother Jones’ Russ Choma. The first $100,000 of that sum a day after the Justice Department announced it would phase out the use of private prisons. During the Republican primary, the company donated to a super PAC backing Sen. Marco Rubio. As Bloomberg's Zach Mider tweeted, it's unusual for a large publicly traded company to donate to a presidential super PAC. TRANSATLANTIC: The National Retail Federation led a delegation of executives from Wal-Mart Stores, Whole Foods Market, Crate & Barrel, Dunkin’ Brands, QVC and Tiffany & Co. to meet with European Commission officials in Brussels about the effect of EU e-commerce and data protection regulations on international trade.

Bill Clinton attended. — Fifty members of the Government Relations Leadership Forum lunched Tuesday at Charlie Palmer’s and heard from Bruce Evans, the staff director of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Yet some vets have to overcome hurdles as they begin their new careers. When you hear glowing words like these about veterans, it seems like it should be a breeze for them to find jobs: "They've had more experiences, they've been around the world, which certainly lends to the global environment that we have in our industry." "They have the work ethic, the dependability, the maturity." "I hired a veteran about a month ago, and I'll tell you what, he shows up every day and he works his butt off." Those were a few people who set up booths at a recent job fair for veterans at the war memorial. Sue Davis of Walmart went on about veteran job applicants. "With the last one I talked to on the phone, I got yes ma'am, no ma'am, when I said can you be there at 10, he was there 10 minutes early, showed up dressed professionally and ready to work," Davis says. The employers told us that like anyone looking for a job, where veterans land depends on their experience. Carl Surtees of In-Place Machining Company in Milwaukee says he seeks out vets to hire. He says they smoothly transition into new careers with his firm. It does mobile machining work, including for the military. "You know, diesel mechanics, you know, we've got employees that were on Navy ships as machinists, and so they've been able to relate it to what actually they have been working on, whether it be a vessel or something like that. A lot of them are mechanically inclined," Surtees says. Yet some veterans who may have impressive and transferrable skills haven't yet connected with civilian jobs. Take Army veteran Mathew Armstrong, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. "If you put 'I led 300 missions in a combat zone,' it's obviously going to sound great on a resume, but it's not going to transfer over to corporate America very well," Armstrong says. Armstrong says he learned organizational skills and how to manage a team – and all while under duress. "I did do a lot of operations and everything like that with moving pieces around. We had our cannons on like six different locations, so we had to set up air flights for them and helicopters and stuff like that. A lot of that stuff is super transferrable over to a civilian world, it's just super hard to get it down on paper where people actually understand it," Armstrong says. "It's just a matter of being able to articulate their skill sets," says Antonio Guajardo, campus director for Springfield College in Milwaukee. He helps veterans fine-tune their resumes upon graduation. "A lot of times a lot of the vets don't write those skill sets down, and when you look at the resume, this is your talking points, basically," Guajardo says. Guajardo says he's a veteran so he can cut through military jargon, and list vets' work experiences in terms civilian employers will understand. Chuck Olsen says he appreciates when veterans seeking work are prepared. He's with Boucher Automotive Group, and says it's eager to hire veterans. But Olsen adds, in order to get their foot in the door they need to be able to make their case. "Employers like me look for resumes that are one-page long, that show good knowledge management, not everything you did, but what can apply that would be attractive to a corporation," Olsen says. Olsen believes the sky's the limit for vets willing to work their way up in the company. He speaks from experience. The corporate sales manager is a 21-year Army veteran. Yet veterans beginning civilian careers don't just have to modify their resumes. On Wednesday, we’ll report on another big adjustment they must make: living without the structure and camaraderie of military life.

Bodegas are next. SounderBruce The world’s largest internet retailer is gearing up to launch real-world grocery stores. Amazon has plans to open brick-and-mortar convenience stores in an effort to woo spenders away from the likes of Walmart and Kroger, according to the Wall Street Journal and MIT. The average American household spends roughly $5,500 a year during grocery store visits, and Amazon wants a piece of the action. The retailer’s Fresh grocery-delivery service has been operational for several years, but sources at the company revealed plans for physical shops that would also offer drive-through grocery pickup and same-day delivery. Walmart, the United States’ largest food retailer, will sell an estimated $140 billion worth of groceries in 2016 alone. With Walmart poised to launch it’s own online-ordering-with-curbside-pickup program, it makes sense that Amazon would try to grab a chunk of the market.

We meet our heroine in a Walmart car park whereupon she stumbles upon the clan of misfits selling door to door magazines. Jake (Shia LaBeouf) entices her with the promise of a new life; one of freedom and exploration. She soon enough runs away with them, following this new ‘Americana’ version of the classical American dream. Star discovers the life which these misfits lead, recounting extensive lies to guilt trip-people into buying the magazines which no one ever wants. It is viewed as a game, as the cruel reality that people do not care about them or their pain is too much to handle so they focus on making their money and their claimed freedom. Throughout, there are these threats of hard hitting truths about social inequality, which follow these doomed youths across their wild road trip. It is gritty in its portrayal of not only sexual abuse but the hypocrisy of American society to shut doors on all they dislike. Alongside this there is beauty, not only in the continuously kind nature of Star but also in the young reckless love story between Star and Jake. One that is messy, however honest in its passion and power over the two who have found love and loyalty to be something hollow. Cinematographer, Robbie Ryan brings out a rawness in the tale, allowing it a kind of genuine quality which only enhances the iridescence of the film. American Honey itself is young in its wild and chaotic nature, throwing constant questions at the audience to which there are few answers. The film carries a hard punch in its take on the classic coming of age story yet there is a roughness and violence to this film which leaves a larger impression than expected.  Expect from this film a savage confrontation on not only pre-conceived assumptions but also accepted truths.

Leading up to seeing this movie things weren’t looking good. The Maximum Ride series is close to my heart and so I was shocked to see that somehow it had come together under my radar. For the sake of this review I will try to pretend that I haven’t been patiently waiting for a Maximum Ride film since I was 11, the movie could not have been more disappointing. Maximum Ride didn’t make me mad, it was just boring and disappointing. Before the movie my one remaining glimmer of hope was that maybe it would reach cult-film status bad like Birdemic. No such luck. I wanted the movie to be over no more than two minutes into it. To start, the CGI is unforgivable. Sure it’s expensive, but if the core concept of your film is that the main characters all have giant bird wings, you should probably either save up, figure out a way to artistically shoot around it or make a different movie. One of the first things that seemed wrong with the movie was the opening credits scene. It was long and the music seemed to loop. Unlike in other more intelligently put together films, the scene playing in the background during the credit roll did nothing for the movie. It looked like the DVD menu of a movie bought from a Walmart bargain bin and left on all night in 2009. This leads me to the first of many stylistic issues I had with the movie. In the novels, the flock (main characters/mutant bird kids) have big (up to 14ft.) wing-spans like angels. They are constantly struggling to hide these massive limbs tucked behind their backs. They have to adjust clothing, wear baggy shirts, sweaters and jackets, and they even have to alter backpacks. I can’t even begin to comprehend why the moviemakers decided that it would be better if the wings were impossibly hidden in their backs, and jut out through big gory slits. Far and away the worst aspect of Maximum Ride is that, for some unexplainable reason, the filmmakers decided to throw in overly drawn out, weird dream-like prelude sequences often lasting a full minute. Not only do these scenes look horrific, but they accomplish little for the plot, and derail the pacing. Interestingly, these prelude sequences are more or less the only portions of the film with scoring. The rest of it is basically silent – accentuating the excruciating performances. The acting on the parts of main characters Max, Fang and Ari was nearing horrific. Max’s characterization is dripping with the failure of constructing a strong tween female role model and instead ends up being weak and submissive. If we briefly move back to the books, Max was in charge of every situation; in this movie she is constantly being saved. To make matters worse, she is always saved by a male who happens to also be the love interest. The final bitter complaint I will end with is that the group of six homeless, mutant kids are all outfitted in what appears to be Forever XXI’s brand new “3Edgy5Me” collection. They all match in style, except Max who later in the film dons a Rancid tee-shirt which I won’t comment on because it’s even more poignant if I leave you to fill in the blanks. I give Maximum Ride a 5/100: utterly unwatchable. 2016film reviewMaximum Ride About Kostyn Petrunick View all posts by Kostyn Petrunick → Tweet Pin It Related Posts Late Trent comeback ends Brock’s bid for...

News Business Business News Tesco increases market share for first time in five years Extra 228,000 shoppers visit the firm’s stores over last three months, but Asda's slide continues Ben Chapman Tuesday 18 October 2016 10:45 BST Tesco begins to turn around business after five years of losing ground to rivals Reuters Tesco has shrugged off its battle with Unilever over Brexit price hikes, for now at least. The nation’s largest supermarket increased its market share for the first time in five years and grew sales, which had fallen every quarter from March 2015.  An extra 228,000 shoppers visited the firm’s stores over the last three months, boosting sales by 1.3 per cent and market share to 28.2 per cent, the latest figures from industry analysts Kantar showed. These are tricky times for Britain’s supermarkets and Tesco’s losest rival Sainsbury's till receipts edged down 0.4  per cent, although its market share also grew by a percentage point to 16 per cent as other chains struggled. Read more Marmite-gate is over. The real Brexit battle will be harder to settle Morrisons’ sales tumbled 3 per cent after it sold its convenience stores, but this didn’t dent market share which held at 10.4 per cent. The supermarket price war, sparked by discounters Aldi and Lidl, again hit Asda hardest – sales crashed 5.2 per cent lower at the Wal-Mart owned supermarket, continuing its woeful performance of recent years. Read more Marmite supply row resolved with Tesco, Unilever says Minister claims Marmite disappearance has nothing to do with Brexit Tesco and Unilever shares tumble as price row takes its toll Tesco running out of Marmite and PG Tips amid Brexit price row Aldi and Lidl yet again posted strong sales boosts, up 11.4 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: “Tesco was the only one of the Big Four to see a year-on-year increase and has started to attract new shoppers again, with two-thirds of households visiting them in the last four weeks. “They are well-placed to benefit from the ‘little-and-often’ mode of shopping behaviour which we see as a key driver of future growth across the entire industry.” Least ethical supermarkets 11 show all Least ethical supermarkets 1/11 11) The Co-operative With an 11.0 rating, the Co-op comes out as the most ethical supermarket 2/11 10) M&S At 10, Marks and Spencer is relatively high Rex 3/11 9) Ocado Delivery service Ocado's motto is "quality food that doesn't cost the earth" 4/11 8) Waitrose Waitrose was the 4th most ethical on the list 5/11 7) Aldi Aldi surprisingly beat some of its up-market rivals 6/11 6) Sainsburys Sainsburys received a score of 9 for environmental ethics Rex 7/11 5) Morrisons Morrisons is the 5th least ethical supermarket in Britian AP 8/11 4) Tesco was the 4th least ethical, with an environmental score of 7 9/11 3) Iceland Iceland was the third least ethical 10/11 2) Lidl Lidl was Britain's second most unethical supermarket for its impact on the environment and its reputation for throwing away unused food. 11/11 1) Asda Asda is the least ethical, Ethical Consumer added: "In most cases your local independent grocery or wholefood shop will be the most ethical place to shop." He added: “While currency-related cost price increases are casting a shadow over next year, the supermarket price war will keep retail prices in check for the time being. “Retailers with a multi-format or multi-channel proposition are well placed to gain new shoppers and incremental spend, particularly when food sales are under increasing pressure from the discounters and now Amazon.” Tesco said it is on track to deliver £1.2bn profits this year, despite taking hits from a damaging accounting scandal and the Unilever spat.

The UK's biggest grocer increased sales by 1.3% over the last quarter, attracting a further 228,000 shoppers though its doors to expand its share of the market to 28.2% - its first year-on-year market share gain since 2011, Kantar Worldpanel said. http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/new-shoppers-help-boost-tesco-sales-and-expand-market-share-35139562.html http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/article35141460.ece/6b563/AUTOCROP/h342/B3tesco1.jpg Email Tesco expanded its share of the market to 28.2% - its first year-on-year market share gain since 2011 Tesco has increased its market share for the first time in five years, figures show. The UK's biggest grocer increased sales by 1.3% over the last quarter, attracting a further 228,000 shoppers though its doors to expand its share of the market to 28.2% - its first year-on-year market share gain since 2011, Kantar Worldpanel said. Its 1.3% sales growth, bolstered by family shoppers, is ahead of the overall market, where sales increased by 0.8% on last year. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Sainsbury's sales fell by 0.4% but its market share also grew by a percentage point to 16%. Morrisons sales were down 3% due to the effect of the sale of its convenience stores late last year but its market share remained at 10.4%. Asda's sales dropped 5.2% - the slowest rate of decline for four months for the Walmart subsidiary - despite a premium own-label sales increase of 8%, while its market share declined by one percentage point to 15.6%. Meanwhile, shoppers enjoyed the 27th consecutive period of grocery price deflation, albeit easing to 0.8% on last year. Kantar Worldpanel head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt said: "Foods including ready meals and produce have been among the fastest growing areas at Tesco, helped by its 'Farm Brands' but also its standard own-label lines. "Tesco has attracted a further 228,000 shoppers through its doors to help the grocer grow to a 28.2% share of the market - its first year-on-year market share gain since 2011. "While the threat of rising prices is on a lot of minds at the moment, we've seen the 27th consecutive period of grocery price deflation, albeit at a slower rate. "The price of everyday groceries fell by 0.8% compared with a year ago and in contrast to the minus 1.1% reported last month, with deflation particularly noticeable among pork, crisps and poultry products." Aldi's sales increased by 11.4% and at Lidl they grew by 8.4%, taking market share up to 6.2% and 4.6% respectively and maintaining the combined market share high of 10.8%. which the two discount retailers achieved last month. Meanwhile, Nielsen figures show Tesco experienced its best year-on-year sales figures for more than three years with a 1.4% year-on-year increase in money taken at the tills. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: "Tesco was the only one of the Big Four to see a year-on-year increase and has started to attract new shoppers again, with two-thirds of households visiting them in the last four weeks. "They are well-placed to benefit from the 'little-and-often' mode of shopping behaviour which we see as a key driver of future growth across the entire industry." He added: "Whilst currency-related cost price increases are casting a shadow over next year, the supermarket price war will keep retail prices in check for the time being. "Retailers with a multi-format or multi-channel proposition are well-placed to gain new shoppers and incremental spend, particularly when food sales are under increasing pressure from the discounters and, now, Amazon."

Dick's Sporting Goods Inc are set to release their Q3 2014 earnings November 18, 2014. (Reuters) Report: Dick's Prepares Bid for Golfsmith's U.S. Stores Published October 18, 2016 Industries Reuters Facebook Twitter Print Dick's Sporting Goods is preparing a bid for the U.S. business of bankrupt Golfsmith International Holdings, challenging an offer by rival retailer Worldwide Golf Shops, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Continue Reading Below While bids for Golfsmith, owned by OMERS Private Equity, the buyout arm of one of Canada's largest pension funds, were due earlier on Monday, Dick's was given an extension until Tuesday morning to submit its offer, the people said. The bankruptcy auction will the test the value of Golfsmith, which suffered because of competition from discount retailers Wal Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc, as well as golf's waning popularity among younger customers. Interest in gold has dropped in line with the fading career of star golfer Tiger Woods, who once attracted many young fans to the sport. Privately-held Worldwide Golf Shops was preparing to submit a bid for Golfsmith on Monday, in partnership with liquidators from Great American Group, one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the bids were not public. Golfsmith filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Canada last month. Spokespeople for Dick's, Golfsmith, Worldwide Golf and Great American's parent company, investment bank B. Riley Financial, did not immediately return requests for comment. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A winner will be selected after an auction scheduled for Wednesday. The goal is to close a sale, which a U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve, before the start of the holiday shopping season. Golfsmith may also reorganize its debt and emerge from bankruptcy with the support of its existing lenders. As part of its bid, Worldwide Golf would keep open a number of Golfsmith's existing U.S. stores, the person said. While Golfsmith operated 109 U.S. stores at the time of its bankruptcy filing last month, and has been closing stores since then, Worldwide Golf has 85 stores operating under names including Roger Dunn Golf Shops and Golfers' Warehouse in 19 states. Dick's operates its own specialty golf shops, Golf Galaxy, and it's unclear what Dick's plans are for Golfsmith. Earlier this year, Dick's won the auction for the intellectual property of bankrupt competitor Sports Authority Inc with a bid of $15 million. Golfsmith last month announced a deal to sell its Canadian shops, operating under the name Golf Town, to a group led by Fairfax Financial Holdings and CI Investments.

Joel Villanueva x Home  >  Overseas Pinoy group in Canada joins call for wage increase Krystle Alarcon, ABS-CBN North America News Bureau Posted at Oct 18 2016 02:09 PM Share Facebook Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Pinterest CANADA – A group of Filipino Canadian workers and students joined hundreds in Montreal demanding a minimum wage increase in Quebec. Students, union representatives, anti-poverty groups and political cohorts took over the streets and demanded government to increase the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. The group, Pinay Quebec, marched with the crowd. One of its members believes her employer, Walmart, can afford the increase. "Justifiable naman yung 15 dollars kasi matagal naman it's $10.75, pag nag increase naman masyadong maliit so it’s best siguro give and take naman na bigyan nila ang trabahador nila na sapat na augmento para productive yung trabaho," said Agnes Calgo.   The Immigrant Workers Centre said immigrants working in service sector get exploited the most with low wages.   "They look towards immigrants because they’re desperate; they’re unaware of their rights. This is where we’re actually seeing the need for a 15-dollar an hour minimum wage, is to help and support these workers to be able to live above a poverty line and to be able to keep the wealth that they create for these large corporations," said Mostafa Henaway.   Young Filipino students also demanded a wage increase. They say juggling school and work is a struggle.   "Ako’y nagbabayad ng tuition fee, ng phone bills, tapos pagkain, tapos renta sa bahay. So kung ikaw ay isang estudyante na merong part-time, yung 10.75 kulang talaga ito," said Renz Cerospe of Anakbayan Montreal.  But the government isn’t budging. Quebec's Ministry of Work said that the minimum wage is appropriate, that it has increased by 47 percent since 2003, higher than the inflation rate of 24.5 percent. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he chooses to help workers by investing in education and child benefits.  The Quebec Coalition that organized the protest say they will apply more pressure on the government by demonstrating all over Quebec in the coming months.

October 18 2016 at 08:47am By Moti Ankari Washington Post Stella McCartney in collaboration with Adidas athleisure Athleisure, the elevated-sporty clothing category that rocketed such brands as Lululemon and Under Armour to global success over the past half decade, appears to be hitting a plateau this year. Prices on units have been generally decreasing, and the growth of sales in active-wear is levelling off. But it's flattening out at an extremely high level, and prices are dropping because huge outfitters such as Walmart and Sports Authority are offering discounted versions of the items you might buy at a pricey yoga boutique. So, as a matter of fact, more people have access to athleisure apparel, and it's becoming more mass. Basically, it's settling in for the long haul. If you can't beat it, join it, right? READ: Beards can give better jawlines The Dos and Don'ts of wearing Athleisure: Neoprene is now a safe fabric for everyday wear, and not just in leggings. But embrace it in unique ways, such as the Adidas sneakers. If you wear a material in the same manner that it's used in athletic wear (as in shorts), there's no way to avoid giving off the impression that you just got done with a workout. Athleisure Varsity jacket by Nike. Credit: Supplied Keep your athletic wear and athleisure separate. Don't mix and match. Wear your gym clothes to the gym and your casual, comfortable clothes on the weekends and to low-key social events. Never together! A varsity jacket or a sporty handbag is athleisure. You're not afraid of those, right? Racing stripes, bright colours, and black-and-neon colour combos like the mesh dress by Marianne Fassler, pictured above, are all hallmarks of athleisure, so try a little bit of each and see what you like. Athleisure mesh dress by Marianne Fassler. Credit: Supplied Test one piece at a time, and pair them with more formal attire. Wear nicely tapered jersey pants with a polo shirt or even an untucked button-down. Wear a snug sweatshirt with jeans. Don't jump in with both feet. Athleisure Top Shop lace trim running shorts. Credit: Supplied READ: Beauty report: Nano gold for a glowing face The fit is key. Don't wear anything baggy, it will look like you're not trying. The reason athleisure works is because it looks as though the wearer put in some effort and spent some money, even though he's wearing comfortable clothes. Go too slouchy, and you'll just tell the world that you've given up.   Most Viewed Join us Twitter Facebook Subscribe to newsletter Subscribe via RSS Pictures A taste of legendary Korean cuisine October 14 2016 #Miss2017 semi-finalist revealed October 13 2016 More Pictures TV Highlights Horoscopes Get your TV Highlights here         Get your Horoscopes here          Property Business Directory <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a0fa4c9b&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=9&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a0fa4c9b&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a59f832e&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=4&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a59f832e&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9c7fc8d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9c7fc8d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2b61fcc&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=6&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2b61fcc&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a857db3a&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=7&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a857db3a&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a206f84d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=8&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a206f84d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> You are here: IOL / Lifestyle / Style / Fashion / Get the look: Athleisure trend!

Yet some vets have to overcome hurdles as they begin their new careers. When you hear glowing words like these about veterans, it seems like it should be a breeze for them to find jobs: "They've had more experiences, they've been around the world, which certainly lends to the global environment that we have in our industry." "They have the work ethic, the dependability, the maturity." "I hired a veteran about a month ago, and I'll tell you what, he shows up every day and he works his butt off." Those were a few people who set up booths at a recent job fair for veterans at the war memorial. Sue Davis of Walmart went on about veteran job applicants. "With the last one I talked to on the phone, I got yes ma'am, no ma'am, when I said can you be there at 10, he was there 10 minutes early, showed up dressed professionally and ready to work," Davis says. The employers told us that like anyone looking for a job, where veterans land depends on their experience. Carl Surtees of In-Place Machining Company in Milwaukee says he seeks out vets to hire. He says they smoothly transition into new careers with his firm. It does mobile machining work, including for the military. "You know, diesel mechanics, you know, we've got employees that were on Navy ships as machinists, and so they've been able to relate it to what actually they have been working on, whether it be a vessel or something like that. A lot of them are mechanically inclined," Surtees says. Yet some veterans who may have impressive and transferrable skills haven't yet connected with civilian jobs. Take Army veteran Mathew Armstrong, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. "If you put 'I led 300 missions in a combat zone,' it's obviously going to sound great on a resume, but it's not going to transfer over to corporate America very well," Armstrong says. Armstrong says he learned organizational skills and how to manage a team – and all while under duress. "I did do a lot of operations and everything like that with moving pieces around. We had our cannons on like six different locations, so we had to set up air flights for them and helicopters and stuff like that. A lot of that stuff is super transferrable over to a civilian world, it's just super hard to get it down on paper where people actually understand it," Armstrong says. "It's just a matter of being able to articulate their skill sets," says Antonio Guajardo, campus director for Springfield College in Milwaukee. He helps veterans fine-tune their resumes upon graduation. "A lot of times a lot of the vets don't write those skill sets down, and when you look at the resume, this is your talking points, basically," Guajardo says. Guajardo says he's a veteran so he can cut through military jargon, and list vets' work experiences in terms civilian employers will understand. Chuck Olsen says he appreciates when veterans seeking work are prepared. He's with Boucher Automotive Group, and says it's eager to hire veterans. But Olsen adds, in order to get their foot in the door they need to be able to make their case. "Employers like me look for resumes that are one-page long, that show good knowledge management, not everything you did, but what can apply that would be attractive to a corporation," Olsen says. Olsen believes the sky's the limit for vets willing to work their way up in the company. He speaks from experience. The corporate sales manager is a 21-year Army veteran.

Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Supervalu had been looking to separate the more profitable division, which generates about a quarter of the company's sales, from its slower-growing grocery wholesale and food retail businesses as bigger rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc increase their focus on groceries. Supervalu stock gained about 8 percent in Monday morning trading. Supervalu said it will enter into a five-year agreement to provide Save-A-Lot with some services and support functions as part of the deal. Save-A-Lot has a network of about 1,370 company-owned and licensed stores across 37 states in the United States, the Caribbean and Central America. Onex made the best offer in an auction for Save-A-Lot, Reuters reported in September. Supervalu decided to explore an outright sale of the discount grocery chain after receiving interest from several private equity firms, Reuters reported in December. Supervalu said on Monday it expects to use the sale proceeds to prepay at least $750 million of its outstanding term loan. The deal is expected to close by Jan. 31, the companies said. Barclays Capital Inc and Greenhill & Co LLC were financial advisers to Supervalu, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal adviser. Citigroup was sole advisor to Onex and led the financing.

In a video circulating Sunday and Monday on Facebook, an onlooker captured a Glenwood Springs police officer and Garfield County deputy detaining a 35-year-old man who Wilson said was involved in a “long and rambling multi-victim incident.” The man was arrested on felony charges of second-degree assault on a police officer, biased motived crimes and false imprisonment, among other crimes. The deputy in this case sustained at least one hard punch to the face, and he ended up with 20-some stitches on his brow, said Wilson. The incident began at the Glenwood Springs Wal-Mart, where Joel Lohmeyer was reportedly exhibiting extremely odd and violent behavior, screaming threats and pushing people, Wilson said. At one point, Lohmeyer went into the nearby Subway and grabbed someone by the throat. Separately, he accosted a Latino man, calling him a Mexican and a Muslim, then punched him in the neck. Glenwood Springs police and a Garfield County deputy responded. Lohmeyer’s first reaction to seeing the uniformed men was to tell them that he was going to go down fighting and that they needed more officers, said Wilson. He said something to the effect of “take one step toward me and I’m going to mess you up,” the chief said. At this point he took his shirt off, purportedly to go to blows, and the officer decided to deploy his Taser. But the 35-year-old was able to pull out the barbs and a fight ensued. Lohmeyer landed a couple of solid punches. After hitting him with a Taser a second time, the officer and deputy were able to take Lohmeyer to the ground and handcuff him. “I think it’s not a bad thing for people to see this and understand that there are nasty people out there,” said Wilson. And this wasn’t the only incident over the last few days that local authorities were assaulted or found themselves threatened with extreme violence. Officers arrested an intoxicated 27-year-old woman near the same location Friday after she was yelling racially charged comments at Latinos in a restaurant. “She was a real treat to deal with as well,” Wilson said, noting that in the process of being arrested, she kicked and stomped on three Glenwood officers. And earlier last week, a 39-year-old man was arrested after a traffic stop on Interstate 70. The man was sweating profusely and clearly jacked up on something, said the chief. The officer saw a large straight-blade knife in the console next to the man. When the officer asked him to step out of the vehicle, the man started screaming that the officer was going to have to kill him to get him out of the vehicle. The man indicated that he would use the knife to force the officer to kill him before going to prison, according to an affidavit. To leverage him away from the knife, the officer grabbed his arm that was hanging out of the window. At one point the man was reaching for the knife, according to a police report. After backup arrived they finally got him out of the vehicle and into custody with only abrasions from taking him to the ground. “There were points in that contact where there very likely could have been deadly force deployed,” said Wilson. Officers getting banged up from these kinds of arrests is not uncommon. But in the incident caught on video, the suspect does seem a bit more committed and aggressive than police usually see, Wilson said. “This guy squared off right from the beginning.” “Use of force is always such a gut check. When confronted with someone, there’s such a fine line in being able to rapidly figure out what you’re dealing with, assessing your surroundings and that person’s ability to physically injure you. It’s a lot more subjective than people think it is or should be.” “I think they did a great job with it, considering how violent that guy was. He full-on punched a deputy in the face. They showed, in my opinion, extreme restraint.” There is a common denominator in these cases of suspects who are likely on drugs and becoming violent in the community, said Wilson. The man pulled over on I-70 was suspected of being high on methamphetamine, cocaine or both. In the vehicle officers found 7.2 grams of methamphetamine, 5.9 grams of cocaine, 15 Percocet, a scale and a glass pipe, according to a police report. Lohmeyer exhibited behavior consistent with being on methamphetamine, and the woman who kicked several officers at least appeared to be intoxicated, said Wilson.

While bids for Golfsmith, owned by OMERS Private Equity Inc, the buyout arm of one of Canada's largest pension funds, were due earlier on Monday, Dick's was given an extension until Tuesday morning to submit its offer, the people said. The bankruptcy auction will the test the value of Golfsmith, which suffered because of competition from discount retailers Wal Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc , as well as golf's waning popularity among younger customers. Interest in golf has dropped in line with the fading career of star golfer Tiger Woods, who once attracted many young fans to the sport. Privately-held Worldwide Golf Shops was preparing to submit a bid for Golfsmith on Monday, in partnership with liquidators from Great American Group LLC, one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the bids were not public. Golfsmith filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Canada last month. Spokespeople for Dick's, Golfsmith, Worldwide Golf and Great American's parent company, investment bank B. Riley Financial Inc , did not immediately return requests for comment. A winner will be selected after an auction scheduled for Wednesday. The goal is to close a sale, which a U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve, before the start of the holiday shopping season. Golfsmith may also reorganize its debt and emerge from bankruptcy with the support of its existing lenders. As part of its bid, Worldwide Golf would keep open a number of Golfsmith's existing U.S. stores, the person said. While Golfsmith operated 109 U.S. stores at the time of its bankruptcy filing last month, and has been closing stores since then, Worldwide Golf has 85 stores operating under names including Roger Dunn Golf Shops and Golfers' Warehouse in 19 states. Dick's operates its own specialty golf shops, Golf Galaxy, and it's unclear what Dick's plans are for Golfsmith. Earlier this year, Dick's won the auction for the intellectual property of bankrupt competitor Sports Authority Inc with a bid of $15 million. Golfsmith last month announced a deal to sell its Canadian shops, operating under the name Golf Town, to a group led by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd .and CI Investments Inc.(This version of the story has been refiled to correct spelling of word 'golf' in third paragraph) (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell) Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Top 11 Earnings for the Week Ahead 247wallst.com Alabama is unanimous No. 1 as Ohio State moves to No. 2 in AP poll Dr. Saturday President-Elect Trump Picks Reince Priebus as His Chief of Staff ABC News Videos Donald Trump on 60 Minutes: The 10 Most Surprising Revelations TVLine.com Miami Marlins Jose Fernandez dies in boating accident Yahoo News Photo Staff Norv Turner had a good reason for leaving the Vikings so abruptly SB Nation 4-Year-Old Granted Wish to Be Drafted Onto College Baseball Team ABC News Videos Trump firm on agenda but says Americans have nothing to fear AFP Top Trump Ally Warns of 'Rebellion' Over Possible Chief of Staff Pick Good Morning America Russell Simmons Sends Sternly-Worded Prayer to 'Old Friend' Donald Trump Complex Flamingos from above Yahoo News Photo Staff Conor McGregor's Big Announcement? ‘I Want UFC Ownership Now' MMA Weekly Index: Amazon Prohibited From Providing Refunds with Gift Cards Instead of Cash or Credit ABC News Videos ‘Surprise!’ Pink Announces She’s Pregnant With Baby No. 2 People Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton sings ‘Hallelujah’ in emotional ‘SNL’ open Yahoo News Mike Evans kneels during anthem to protest Trump: 'Something's not right' Shutdown Corner Rep.

Eight days later, feds say he entered a First Convenience Bank inside a Kroger on Telephone Road and handed over a note saying he had a gun.   Police caught up with him Thursday and his bail was set at $10,000 on all charges.  Jonathan Black, 22, is facing a trio of robbery charges after he allegedly went into the J.P. Morgan Chase on West Greens on Thursday and handed over a note saying he had a gun and wasn't afraid to use it.  On Friday and Saturday he presented similar notes when he allegedly robbed a J.P Morgan Chase on Old Spanish Trail and a Bank of America on Texas State Highway 249.  He was arrested Friday and bail was set at $100,000 on all charges.  "The investigations are being conducted by the FBI Violent Crime Task Force with assistance from the Houston Police Department and Harris County Sheriff's Office," the FBI release said.    Latest News Video Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW 60 Servings of MuscleTech Hydroxycut Elite for $20 + $6 s&h Bodybuilding.comPosted 9 hr 16 min ago SHOP NOW Duck Brand Shrink Film Indoor Window Kit for $7 + pickup at...

The bride was wearing a $53 dress bought at a local mall, the groom the same suit in which he'd been seen in TV commercials when he ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress. He only owned one other suit. The bride wanted a small, private ceremony and got it. The groom favored a big reception for his many friends, but there was no room for it in the house or its tiny yard. Ann Henry, a law professor at the University of Arkansas and a Democratic Party activist, volunteered her two-acre property for it. "Could I have ever imagined I'd be hosting a wedding for a U.S. president, a senator, a governor and a secretary of state, and perhaps another president — and they were the same two people?" Henry says now. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The street on which Bill Clinton bought the $22,000 house in 1975 to persuade Hillary Rodham finally to marry him is now named after him, and so is an avenue in Little Rock. The airport in the state capital bears both spouses' names. A glittering Clinton Center, which houses the presidential library, is teeming with visitors. And yet Arkansas will be voting overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, not for Hillary Rodham Clinton, on Nov. 8. As an outsider, this struck me as profoundly strange. It would be unthinkable for, say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel to lose her long-time constituency in West Pomerania. I set out to find out why. The Clintons still have close friends in Arkansas, so I started with them. Skip Rutherford, dean of the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock, responded in part by ticking off Clinton projects that were still going strong: Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, the neonatal-intensive-care unit at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, a project to help poor parents with preschool youngsters and the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, and more. That these initiatives are still alive and expanding is a testament to Hillary Clinton's doggedness and ability to build working structures rather than Potemkin villages, he said. And yet these achievements haven't endeared her to most Arkansans. "If you go to a Walmart and ask ordinary Arkansans, they won't name a single one of these," says Rex Nelson, senior vice president at Simmons Bank in Little Rock who worked for many years as policy and communications director for former Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican presidential contender in 2012 and 2016. I tried asking random people I met in Arkansas about Hillary Clinton's legacy; indeed, they drew a blank. Only her educational reform efforts sounded vaguely familiar to some. Clinton's achievements in Arkansas are, admittedly, 25 to 30 years old, which means almost half the state's voting-age population isn't old enough to remember what she did when she lived here. That might not have been a problem had the local Democratic Party been around to remind them. It wasn't. Until the mid-1990s, Arkansas was thoroughly Democratic. Now, it's largely Republican, for all the well-documented demographic, economic and social reasons. Interestingly, Arkansas was the last of the southern states to turn red, which made me wonder why Hillary Clinton didn't have more support. Democrats and Republicans alike told me this was largely personality-based: Democratic politicians such as former Sen. David Pryor and Bill Clinton held the fort as their party's defenses crumbled elsewhere. "Democratic politicians in this state developed a technique that worked for them," says Bradley Gitz, William J. Clinton Professor of International Politics at Lyon College in Batesville. "They voted as the increasingly liberal party expected in Washington, then they came back here and packaged themselves as moderates or conservatives." That was a tough balancing act to pull off, requiring politicians uncommonly talented on a "retail" level. As Nelson told me, "It's a small state, and our politics are personality dominated." Bill Clinton's genius at personalized politics is still a force in Arkansas. "He's just about the only Democrat who would stand a chance" if he ran today, says Gitz. This fall, Hillary Clinton hasn't campaigned in the state that was her home for 18 years — on the one hand, a pragmatic decision, on the other, a reflection of a troubled relationship. Unlike her husband, who, Rutherford says, comes home almost every month, Hillary has rarely appeared, and there are reasons for that. Rutherford argues that Hillary Clinton's expected weakness has nothing to do with her legacy or her personality. "She cannot carry Arkansas any more than Ronald Reagan could carry California today," he says. "American politics have changed." It's probably more complicated than that, though. "Bill was one of us, born and raised," says Nelson. "But Arkansas never really embraced Hillary." In Hillary's progressivism, Gitz says, Arkansans saw contempt. Throughout her time in the state, she failed to overcome this perception because she lacked her husband's political gifts. "Bill is perhaps a nine-plus on a 10-point scale as a retail politician," Nelson says. "She's a two or a three." Hillary wasn't standoffish, her friends say. She traveled throughout the state's 65 counties to do her homework for the education reform — but where her husband talked, she mostly listened. "She's not a chit-chatter," Henry says. Her failure to connect was — and perhaps remains — a far bigger problem than any of the Clinton scandals. "Bill was at the center of these scandals and he remained well-liked," Nelson points out. Hillary was not so lucky. » Next page...

Amazon in its four-day sale offered mobile handsets such as Apple iPhone 6s 64GB at a discounted price of Rs 46,000, which it claimed was significantly lower than the market price of Rs 54,000.  Similarly a Moto X Force was being sold at Rs 25,000, down from the market price of Rs 35,000.  Flipkart and Amazon, kicked off their second festive sale for October. Pictured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Wearables and mobile accessories were also on offer at discounts ranging from 20% to 40%.  Electronics such as TVs and cameras were also available at a 30% discounts while as much 60% was off on kids clothing.  Flipkart which has launched a three-day sale from October 17 to 19 was offering 60% off clothing and 50 to 70% discounts on shoes.  The online shopping portals are giving huge discounts on iphone, watches, backpacks, sky-bags and sunglasses  The discount on goods such as watches, backpacks, sky-bags and sunglasses was even higher at 50 to 80%.  The two companies along with Gurgaon-based Snapdeal have been slugging it out for a greater share of the Indian e-commerce pie.  The earlier sale, a fortnight ago, had seen frenzied buying by consumers on all e-commerce platforms following which a spat had broken between home grown Flipkart and the Indian arm of US giant Amazon with each claiming to have notched up bigger sales. The debate was triggered by Redseer Consulting saying that the festive sale had generated $ 1.2 billion for e-commerce companies, but Flipkart may have outperformed Amazon to consolidate its top position.  Flipkart is reported to be in talks with US-based retail giant Walmart, among others, to raise fresh funds of up to $1 billion “After the slowdown in the first six months, the festival sale was to be a green patch. This has been a bumper sale and Flipkart’s execution has been much stronger and it is evident,” Anil Kumar, founder and chief executive of RedSeer Consulting had said.  However, Jeff Bezos-led Amazon had dismissed the RedSeer claim as “directionally off and false”.  Both Flipkart and Snapdeal have seen a markdown in their values and it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise fresh funding as investors are keen that they generate profits.  Both companies are keen to increase sales in order to drive up valuations ad present a rosy growth-oriented picture.  Flipkart is reported to be in talks with US-based retail giant Walmart, among others, to raise fresh funds of up to $1 billion.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Inside Amazon's secret DRONE lab: Internet shopping giant is...

Share this article Share Since he took over CEO in January, Binny Bansal has gone back to Flipkart’s original premise of superior customer service, while cutting costs, consolidating sellers and improving logistics to reach buyers more quickly.  A Morgan Stanley managed mutual fund has slashed the valuation of Flipkart by 15.5 per cent to USD 9.39 billion.  The mark down in May came close on the heels of similar scaling down in the valuation of the leading e-commerce major by a number of investors like Fidelity Investments and T Rowe Price.  Morgan Stanley is a minority but significant investor in Flipkart.  This was the second devaluation in three months bringing down the value of the e-commerce major by 38% from its peak in June 2015 at USD 15.2 billion.  Amazon, which has committed $5 billion for the Indian market, is reported to have been growing at over 100 per cent a month in a market that has slowed in the past six months.   Read more: India News - Latest Headlines, Pictures and Videos | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search     DON'T MISS Cruel...

The two discussed climate change as well as the upcoming election. WASHINGTON (TNS) — The cooks at Chipotle are making more. Construction workers have more jobs repairing bridges and roads all over the country. Immigrants here illegally walk down the street without fear of deportation. Poor women get abortions paid for by the taxpayers. Gays and transgender people have more rights and opportunities. At the same time, there are fewer jobs like those at Chipotle. Some big businesses such as energy giant Exxon Mobil are paying billions more in taxe More tax revenue, cheaper college, bigger government s. And the wealthy are paying more in taxes, often a lot more. Welcome to President Hillary Clinton’s America. She wouldn’t get everything she wants, of course. But if she did, this is how her 2016 promises would pan out for people in four years — based on independent analyses of her policies in areas including taxes, wages, trade, health care, immigration and abortion rights. Here’s a snapshot of the nation after another four years with Clinton at the helm. Paychecks Construction sites are humming across the country, with new workers in bulldozers, cranes and other heavy equipment repairing long-neglected highways and bridges, modernizing airports and refurbishing dams and levees. They started after Clinton in her first 100 days won approval of a $275 billion overhaul of America’s infrastructure, the centerpiece of her jobs plan. Those at the bottom are making a little more money. The cook grilling chicken at Chipotle, the cashier scanning groceries at Wal-Mart, even the EMT responding to 911 calls all are making at least $12 per hour, up from $7.25 per hour when Clinton took office. There are, however, fewer of those jobs. With or without those minimum wage jobs, students looking for a leg up now attend community college for free. And those with family incomes up to $125,000 will be able to attend public colleges and universities for free in 2021. For those still carrying college loans, interest rates are lower after Clinton allowed borrowers with outstanding debt to refinance their loans at current rates, provided help to delinquent borrowers and established a three-month suspension on all federal student loan payments to help borrowers get their affairs in order Taxes The wealthy are paying more. Those in the top 1 percent — making more than $730,000 — pay an additional $78,000 in taxes. The 116,000 U.S. households making $1 million a year each now pay an average of $176,000 more in federal income taxes. That’s the result of Clinton’s push for a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for them, according to a 2015 estimate by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint program of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Families making $5 million or more also are paying a surcharge of 4 percent. according to an analysis of her plans by the Tax Policy Center. Death is no escape for the wealthy. The estate tax is higher, and it applies to more estates. A typical American family, though, still owes about the same in federal taxes that it did in 2016. That’s about $1,750 for an average family of four with a yearly income of $60,000, according to Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “The average tax change for the lowest- and middle-income households — we’re talking about households making less than $140,000 — would barely change,” said Howard Gleckman, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow who edits TaxVox, its fiscal policy blog. The fossil fuels industry took a hit, too. Giants such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Occidental as well as others lost $4.7 billion-a-year’s worth of tax breaks that they had longed enjoyed. Health care Consumers and small businesses now have a public option — a federal health care plan — as one of their choices among the private insurance plans available through the Affordable Care Act marketplace and other avenues. Additionally, a migrant agricultural worker in California’s Central Valley and others here without legal documentation — a groundskeeper in Florida or domestic worker in North Carolina — can get medical insurance through the health care law. Consumers no longer face big increases in prescription drugs that are covered by Medicare; Clinton capped prices. Abortion Women still can get abortions without restrictions and Planned Parenthood clinics remain open. More than that, poor women for the first time now can get abortions paid for by Medicaid. Clinton had pledged to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which had prohibited the use of taxpayer money for abortions since 1976. Immigration Immigrants in the U.S. illegally no longer fear deportation after she greatly reduced the numbers being sent back home. Surpassing her predecessor, Clinton stopped the deportation of parents of Dreamers — children brought into the country illegally — and parents of Americans and lawful residents. She also stopped deportations of immigrants with histories of service to their communities or who had experienced extreme labor violations, children and teenagers, and those who’d recently arrived in this country. Instead, she spent money on detaining and deporting violent offenders. A massive rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws is now providing a pathway to legal status or citizenship for millions who came to the U.S. illegally. Security at the southern border is bolstered and a backlog in those wanting visas eliminated. “Hillary Clinton will set a much needed tone of acceptance and pride,” said Angela Kelley, a, expert on immigration and senior vice president at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. Sexual orientation and identity Gay, lesbian and transgender Americans have greater rights and opportunities after Clinton pushed several bills through Congress. Clinton signed the Equality Act amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include banning discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, marriage, disability and more. “I think you would see more and more religious liberties curtailed,” said Gary Bauer, the president of American Values, a nonprofit group opposed to abortion rights. “I think you would see more and more intrusions on religious institutions.” Gay teenagers are more welcome at homeless shelters. Police officers are trained to be more sensitive in their interactions with LGBT people. Counselors are forbidden from using so-called conversion therapies. For the first time, Americans are being asked to answer questions on sexual orientation and gender identity on census forms. Transgender Americans are more easily able to change their gender on identification documents. Virtually no child is being born with HIV, the risk of becoming infected is far lower and those who do become infected receive the needed treatment to prevent them from developing AIDS.

I bet if we're just under the line you would would be one of the first to sign up. What a turkey. Report Add Reply lostinparadize Oct 24, 2016 7:27pm Tower it's called taking advantage of every legal and I stress the word legal allowance given under current law. What's wrong with that ? No different than people who have great wealth in assets getting subsidized health care insurance because the ACA based eligibility on "income" not overall wealth. That was a smart move wasn't it? So,you quit one job for four years readjusting your lifestyle a bit to get under the threshold to take advantage of everything available under the current laws and regs. Sounds like a smart move to me. Because the big government folks in DC don't think these things through and put qualifiers on theses "freebies" is no reason to not take advantage. Report Add Reply Climatehoax Oct 23, 2016 8:59pm I'm glad she will force universities to lower professors pay to make college cheaper. But I suspect this is a lie from Hillary, as usual, I think she will actually make someone other than the beneficiary of the education pay for it. Typical lying and misleading from the gold standard bearer of lying. Report Add Reply screen name Oct 23, 2016 8:05pm "Cheaper college" is a complete lie. Taxpayers will be funding the cost of college. And the $125K maximum family income for "free" college will cause intended consequences. My wife and I are just over the limit. One of us would quit work or work part time to get tuition paid for our child to get under the limit. The govt. has to pay our child's college tuition for 4 years (which would be a great deal), and it loses the tax income from both of us working. When she graduates, both of us would work again. Report Add Reply Hey19 Oct 23, 2016 9:20pm Good points, screen name... Free college for 18-22 year-olds, or whomever gets it, isn't free. They'll just wind up paying for everybody else's "free" education when they enter the workforce and start paying taxes... Report Add Reply oldhomey Oct 23, 2016 10:19pm Sounds like how Trump would handle it. But of course there is a silver lining in the dark cloud you describe, screen name. Somebody else would get hired full time because you or your wife dropped out of your job. The job you or your wife leaves probably won't be open at the time of your child's college graduation, either. Perhaps you or your wife could then take advantage of free college for some job retraining to find full-time employment, again. Or you and your wife might sit down from the get-go and project the loss of income from dropping out of your career and discover that in the long haul you would be losing more money than you would by paying some of the college costs of your child. Report Add Reply Hey19 Oct 24, 2016 3:10pm Really, oldhomey? Sounds like how Trump would handle it? Decrease the amount of money a couple is earning; take a contributing member out of the workforce, so they can get free stuff (that the rest of us are paying for, by the way); and make them dependent upon the government? Sounds pretty liberal to me...

Clinton Vaults to a Double-Digit Lead, Boosted by Broad Disapproval of Trump (POLL) Likely voters by a vast 69-24 percent disapprove of Trump’s response to questions about his treatment of women. Fifty-nine percent of likely voters, moreover, reject Trump’s suggestion that the election is rigged in Clinton’s favor, and more, 65 percent, disapprove of his refusal to say whether he’d accept a Clinton victory as legitimate.

Local businesses, community groups and Town volunteers will hand out the treats, provide games with prizes, assist with cookie decorating and serve refreshments. The Town has partnered with the Knoxville Ronald McDonald House each year of the event since 2000 in order to collect essential items that the House needs to continue day-to-day operations. The Ronald McDonald House provides a “home away from home” for families with critically ill children being served by area hospitals and depends on community donations to operate. Families are provided all services for a nominal fee or for free of charge if they are unable to pay. “What a wonderful opportunity to enjoy some family fun and to help those in need at the same time,” said Sue Beverly, Director of the Knoxville Ronald McDonald House. “All the donations that are collected during Freaky Friday for our Ronald McDonald House are so deeply appreciated and put to good use by the grateful residents of our ‘House that Love Built.'” While Freaky Friday Fright Nite is a free event, participants are asked to donate one or more of the following items for the House: household items including hand sanitizer, wet Swiffer mop pads, pump hand soap, paper plates, 8 oz. coffee cups, disposable bowls, paper towels, plastic forks and spoons, fabric softener, CFL light bulbs, Lysol spray, air freshener, trash bags (kitchen size, lawn & leaf size and 4 gallon for waste baskets); food items including breakfast bars, granola bars, brown sugar, powdered sugar, ketchup, mustard, mayo, bacon bits, BBQ sauce, individual packs of crackers and jars of gravy; office items including copy paper and postage stamps; and gift cards to Pilot, Home Depot, Walmart, Food City and Lowe’s.

Halloween Safety Tips Avoid trick-or-treating alone. Walk in groups or with a trusted adult. Follow your children around, whether they like it or not. When the children knock on the door to get a treat, stand behind them on the porch. That way the kids are free to enjoy themselves, and the person opening the door can clearly see an adult is caring for these children. Fasten reflective tape to costumes and bags to help drivers see you. Purchase or make costumes that are light, bright and clearly visible to motorists. Hold a flashlight while trick-or-treating to help you see and others see you. Always WALK and don’t run from house to house. Look both ways before crossing the street. Use established crosswalks wherever possible. Never walk near lit jack o’lanterns, candles or luminaries. Be sure to wear flame-resistant costumes. Costumes should fit well and not drag on the ground to guard against trips and falls. Children should wear well-fitting, sturdy shoes. Oversized high heels are not a good idea. Examine all treats for choking hazards and tampering before eating them. Limit the amount of treats you eat. Tie hats and scarves securely to prevent them from slipping over children’s eyes and obstructing vision. If your child wears a mask, make sure it fits securely, provides adequate ventilation, and has eye holes large enough to allow full vision. Swords, knives and similar costume accessories should be made of soft, flexible material. Eat only factory-wrapped treats. Avoid eating homemade treats made by strangers. We recommend adults remain present and just as vigilant at sponsored Halloween events. Provide each child with a wristband with your name and cell phone number. Or, write this information on a piece of paper and place it in each child’s pocket. Remove obstacles from lawns, steps and porches when expecting trick-or-treaters.

Chipotle coming to Ashland's east side Courtney Day , Reporter 3:49 p.m. EDT October 17, 2016 Chipotle logo (Photo: Provided) 3716 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ASHLAND - A building plan has been approved for a Chipotle Mexican Grill location in Ashland, paving the way for a proposed new retail strip on the city's east side. The fast-food casual restaurant is to be constructed in a new retail strip at 1988 E. Main St. on the former Carter Lumber property near Walmart. According to the website of developer Meridian Realty Capital, Chipotle will be located in a new strip called Ashland Commons, which eventually could contain 39,240 square feet of retail space. The developer is planning to do the construction in phases, City Engineer Shane Kremser said. The plan and timeline for each phase of the project depend on how many lessees sign on, Kremser said, adding the first phase that contains the Chipotle restaurant is likely to begin soon. The Richland County Department of Building Regulations received an application for a 12,740-square-foot shell building for mixed-use tenants Sept. 14, and the plans were approved Oct. 13. The planned cost of that project is $1,688,000. A building plan application for interior alterations on a 5,624-square-foot portion of the shell building for a Chipotle Mexican Grill was received Sept. 19 and approved Oct. 11. The Chipotle plan calls for $300,000 worth of interior alterations, along with an exterior patio railing and a pole light. Both plans previously were approved by the city's building and zoning department.

But the pressures of climate change mean this won’t be true forever. Now, the provincial government is planning to step in and introduce new water-taking regulations that address our environmental reality. The province is set to propose a temporary ban on any new water bottling operations while it firms up stricter rules for companies like Nestlé that pump water from the ground. The company pays a measly $3.71 CAD per every million litres it removes. (At Walmart, a 24-pack of 500 ml Nestlé bottles sells for $3.47.) One reason for the proposed ban, as reported by the Canadian Press (CP), is both heartening from an environmental perspective, and utterly dystopian: the government has its eye on climate change, and the increased risk of drought it presents. Read More: Canada Isn't Ready for Future Climate Disasters, Watchdog Says According to the CP report, which cites sources familiar with the matter, the Ontario Liberals will make it mandatory to reduce the amount of water taken in drought-stricken areas, and will require scientific studies on the environmental effects of any new water-taking activities. These proposed measures are designed to fit within the government’s larger push to address and combat the risks posed by climate change, CP notes. “We are fully supportive and share the Ontario Government’s commitment to protecting water resources,” said Debbie Moore, President of Nestlé Waters Canada, in a statement. “Through investment in an industry-leading monitoring program over the last 15 years in Aberfoyle and Erin, we have been sharing information with the government and local community. We will continue to offer this science and transparent data to all stakeholders that share our commitment to water sustainability and conservation throughout this process.” Climate change, which is drying out some parts of the country while threatening to send others beneath the waves, is hitting Canada hard. The wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta that began in May caused mass evacuations and were declared under control two months later, in July. The incredible longevity of the fires, which consumed thousands of homes, was partly attributed to dry conditions brought about by warmer temperatures. Experts agree that Canada will see more climate catastrophes in the near future, including some communities being displaced due to rising sea levels. Droughts and dry conditions will likely be among its other effects. Perhaps mindful of this, there’s been a massive public outcry against Nestlé’s water-pumping efforts, and even calls for a boycott. Reducing water pumping from drought-stricken areas isn’t new for Nestlé, which voluntarily did so when an Ontario community called Wellington County faced drought conditions earlier this year. In the past, however, Nestlé has fought attempts to stop its water-taking under conditions of severe drought. But if droughts become more common, or more severe, then Nestlé and similar companies will, presumably, have to significantly claw back their operations in Ontario. On the one hand, that the Ontario government is pegging its push for stricter rules on water to climate change is an unsettling look into our near future—but on the other, it’s encouraging to see the government address this existential threat. According to CP, there are no plans to immediately change the $3.71 fee for pumping one million litres of water from the ground to sell in bottles.

People Aren’t Buying Groceries Online Because They Want To Squeeze Their Own Fruits And Vegetables Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share People Aren’t Buying Groceries Online Because They Want To Squeeze Their Own Fruits And Vegetables Image courtesy of Susanne October 17, 2016 1:59 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup veggie tales vegetables veggies fruit produce aisle produce department Do you trust someone else, even a full-time order-picker working for a grocery store or delivery company, to pick out your fruit and vegetables? Resistance to having someone pick out your fresh food is apparently the main thing keeping most consumers away from grocery shopping online, either for pickup or delivery. As Walmart and Amazon both build out drive-thru grocery pickup outlets, and Amazon expands its grocery delivery coverage areas and spreads the price out monthly, all of these services need to actually get customers. The Wall Street Journal reports that online orders of groceries aren’t even close to catching on nationwide: they comprise about 0.16% of all food and beverage sales, and only about 4% of shoppers in a Nielsen poll said that they had ordered any groceries online in the last year. They might be more popular in dense urban areas, but most Americans have cars. Consumers’ preference for picking out our own produce could be good news for grocery stores, since even people who do receive grocery deliveries go to traditional supermarkets to pick up fresh items. That’s part of why Amazon wants to get into the convenience store business. The problem, though, is that the produce section of a grocery store isn’t very profitable: it’s meant to draw people in and spend money in the more profitable parts of the store. Even Walmart is trying to invest in better quality produce that they can slap a “local” label on to draw shoppers in… and keep them browsing the rest of the store.

Eduardo DeJesus Cossio III, 32, was remanded to jail after he was placed on three years probation and ordered to pay investigative costs to a beer company and stores by San Diego Superior Court Judge Dan Link. “He was really trying to get free beer,” said his attorney, Daniel Greene. “He was down on his luck. He didn’t think it through.” “He wasn’t trying to harm individual citizens. He thought the beer would not be re-sold,” said Greene, who added that his client thought it would be returned to the manufacturer. Cossio, of Logan Heights, bought 13 packages of beer bottles at Walmart stores in Chula Vista, National City and Target stores in Eastlake and El Cajon in 2014 and 2015. He drank the beer, and then put soapy water, food coloring, and/or cleaning solutions in the bottles before gluing the caps back on. He got refunds and the products were placed back on the shelves. Other people bought them and took one or two sips before realizing they were tampered with. One man went to an emergency room to see if he was poisoned, but no one was actually injured, according to attorneys. One man told an official the beverage tasted like someone else’s “bad mouth water.” “Food tampering is very serious,” said Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth McClutchey, who asked for 365 days in jail. McClutchey said a beer manufacturer spent $59, 603 in investigative costs as it was initially believed to be possibly a broad product tampering case. She said Cossio went to great lengths to make it look like the returned bottles resembled beer. Target employees identified Cossio as he wore a distinctive set of earrings, beard and hair style in store security tapes. He filled out the refund records with his correct name, date of birth and driver’s license number. Link ordered him to stay 500 feet away from all Target and Walmart stores and to pay probation costs of $1,433. He was fined $1,484. Link suspended 215 days of jail time which Cossio may have to serve if he violates probation terms. Link specified that he must serve 30 days in jail, but can be screened for housing in a work furlough project for 120 days. If Cossio is allowed to go to his auto technician job during the day, he would be locked up at night and on weekends. Cossio apologized to all the victims. “I didn’t think it would lead to all this,” he said. His girlfriend and her mother attended the sentencing. Most liquor stores do not give refunds when someone tries to return alcohol products. The attorneys said Walmart and Target gave refunds because they were department stores and wanted to please customers. Charges involving 29 similar counts were dismissed after he pleaded guilty to three counts of adulteration of a food product. He could have received a maximum term of four years and four months in prison. He got credit for one day previously spent in jail before he posted $10,000 bond.

Popeye’s Louisiana Chicken restaurant opened today as a Japanese steakhouse moved closer to opening next month. The parking lot of the new Popeye’s at 3536 N. Vermilion St. in Danville was full shortly after 10 a.m. Monday in the same block where Applebee’s, 3569 N. Vermilion St., opened earlier this year. Rick Walimohammad of Springfield is the franchisee of the new Danville restaurant as well as the existing Popeye’s on Bloomington Road in Champaign, two Popeye’s in Springfield, two in Bloomington and two in Peoria. And another restaurant is nearing its opening in a location farther north, just off North Vermilion Street at the Danville Crossings retail area that includes Wal-Mart. The owners of Fujiyama Japanese Steakhouse are bringing in hibachi chefs, sushi chefs and other kitchen chefs from New York City to work at the north side restaurant, according to Lisa Weng, who’s opening the restaurant with her husband, Mike Qiu. She said their family members own and operate other Fujiyama Japanese Steakhouse restaurants in Carbondale, Marion and Effingham. Plans are to open the new Danville location in early November at 22 E. West Newell Road in a strip mall east of Wal-Mart that includes Anytime Fitness. Weng said they have been in the restaurant business for 22 years. “We are excited to have our restaurant in Danville,” she said. Fujiyama will serve steak, chicken, shrimp, lobster and other seafood as well as fresh, daily-prepared sushi. The restaurant will feature 10 Hibachi grills and 12 dining tables, a sushi bar and a full bar. There will be two different dining experiences offered at the steak house, according to Weng. Guests can enjoy the performance of a chef preparing fresh food in front of them on a grill with enough seating for up to 10 people. Or, customers who want a private dining experience can sit in the dining room next to the sushi bar.

News Opinion Commentary Commentary: Arkansas is pleased to forget Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is now the Democratic nominee for president. Here's a look at her time as first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for president. Leonid BershidskyBloomberg View Forty-one years ago, 14 people gathered in a small room on California Boulevard in Fayetteville, Ark., for the wedding of an aspiring local politician and his law school sweetheart from up north. The bride was wearing a $53 dress bought at a local mall, the groom the same suit in which he'd been seen in TV commercials when he ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress. He only owned one other suit. The bride wanted a small, private ceremony and got it. The groom favored a big reception for his many friends, but there was no room for it in the house or its tiny yard. Ann Henry, a law professor at the University of Arkansas and a Democratic Party activist, volunteered her two-acre property for it. "Could I have ever imagined I'd be hosting a wedding for a U.S. president, a senator, a governor and a secretary of state, and perhaps another president — and they were the same two people?" Henry says now. The street on which Bill Clinton bought the $22,000 house in 1975 to persuade Hillary Rodham finally to marry him is now named after him, and so is an avenue in Little Rock. The airport in the state capital bears both spouses' names. A glittering Clinton Center, which houses the presidential library, is teeming with visitors. And yet Arkansas will be voting overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, not for Hillary Rodham Clinton, on Nov. 8. The William J. Clinton Center building s Roberto Schmidt, AFP/Getty Image The William J. Clinton Center is located near the Arkansas River  in Little Rock, Ark. The William J. Clinton Center is located near the Arkansas River  in Little Rock, Ark. (Roberto Schmidt, AFP/Getty Image) As an outsider, this struck me as profoundly strange. It would be unthinkable for, say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel to lose her long-time constituency in West Pomerania. I set out to find out why. The Clintons still have close friends in Arkansas, so I started with them. Skip Rutherford, dean of the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock, responded in part by ticking off Clinton projects that were still going strong: Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, the neonatal-intensive-care unit at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, a project to help poor parents with preschool youngsters and the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, and more. That these initiatives are still alive and expanding is a testament to Hillary Clinton's doggedness and ability to build working structures rather than Potemkin villages, he said. And yet these achievements haven't endeared her to most Arkansans. Why the right is terrified of a Hillary Clinton victory Eric Zorn "I know her and she'd make a good president." — Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton, 2008. Trump was right. If elected, Clinton will make a good president. Focused. Serious. Even-tempered. Moderate. Tough. Upright. Incremental. Bipartisan. Remember, when she was the U.S. senator from New York from... "I know her and she'd make a good president." — Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton, 2008. Trump was right. If elected, Clinton will make a good president. Focused. Serious. Even-tempered. Moderate. Tough. Upright. Incremental. Bipartisan. Remember, when she was the U.S. senator from New York from... (Eric Zorn) "If you go to a Walmart and ask ordinary Arkansans, they won't name a single one of these," says Rex Nelson, senior vice president at Simmons Bank in Little Rock who worked for many years as policy and communications director for former Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican presidential contender in 2012 and 2016. I tried asking random people I met in Arkansas about Hillary Clinton's legacy; indeed, they drew a blank. Only her educational reform efforts sounded vaguely familiar to some. Clinton's achievements in Arkansas are, admittedly, 25 to 30 years old, which means almost half the state's voting-age population isn't old enough to remember what she did when she lived here. That might not have been a problem had the local Democratic Party been around to remind them. It wasn't. Until the mid-1990s, Arkansas was thoroughly Democratic. Now, it's largely Republican, for all the well-documented demographic, economic and social reasons. Interestingly, Arkansas was the last of the southern states to turn red, which made me wonder why Hillary Clinton didn't have more support. Democrats and Republicans alike told me this was largely personality-based: Democratic politicians such as former Sen. David Pryor and Bill Clinton held the fort as their party's defenses crumbled elsewhere.  "Democratic politicians in this state developed a technique that worked for them," says Bradley Gitz, William J. Clinton Professor of International Politics at Lyon College in Batesville. "They voted as the increasingly liberal party expected in Washington, then they came back here and packaged themselves as moderates or conservatives." That was a tough balancing act to pull off, requiring politicians uncommonly talented on a "retail" level. As Nelson told me, "It's a small state, and our politics are personality dominated." Bill Clinton's genius at personalized politics is still a force in Arkansas. "He's just about the only Democrat who would stand a chance" if he ran today, says Gitz.

Once upon a time, a boy from Arkansas spotted a girl from Illinois across a crowded classroom. And on Tuesday night in Philadelphia, on the night Hillary Rodham Clinton became their party's official nominee for president, Bill Clinton did his best to make one of the most-scrutinized marriages in... (Alyssa Rosenberg) This fall, Hillary Clinton hasn't campaigned in the state that was her home for 18 years — on the one hand, a pragmatic decision, on the other, a reflection of a troubled relationship. Unlike her husband, who, Rutherford says, comes home almost every month, Hillary has rarely appeared, and there are reasons for that. Rutherford argues that Hillary Clinton's expected weakness has nothing to do with her legacy or her personality. "She cannot carry Arkansas any more than Ronald Reagan could carry California today," he says. "American politics have changed." It's probably more complicated than that, though. "Bill was one of us, born and raised," says Nelson. "But Arkansas never really embraced Hillary." In Hillary's progressivism, Gitz says, Arkansans saw contempt. Throughout her time in the state, she failed to overcome this perception because she lacked her husband's political gifts. "Bill is perhaps a nine-plus on a 10-point scale as a retail politician," Nelson says. "She's a two or a three." Hillary wasn't standoffish, her friends say. She traveled throughout the state's 65 counties to do her homework for the education reform — but where her husband talked, she mostly listened. "She's not a chit-chatter," Henry says. Her failure to connect was — and perhaps remains — a far bigger problem than any of the Clinton scandals. "Bill was at the center of these scandals and he remained well-liked," Nelson points out. Hillary was not so lucky. Earlier this month, a conservative talk radio station, "96.5 FM The Answer," organized a public showing of the second presidential debate in a Little Rock movie theater. I was there; the audience hissed and booed when Hillary started to speak and clapped when Donald Trump attacked her. It's the 'lock her up' threat that should have Americans terrified Charles Krauthammer The second presidential debate — bloody, muddy and raucous — was just enough to save Donald Trump's campaign from extinction, but not enough to restore his chances of winning, barring an act of God (a medical calamity) or of Vladimir Putin (a cosmically incriminating WikiLeak). That Trump crashed... The second presidential debate — bloody, muddy and raucous — was just enough to save Donald Trump's campaign from extinction, but not enough to restore his chances of winning, barring an act of God (a medical calamity) or of Vladimir Putin (a cosmically incriminating WikiLeak). That Trump crashed... (Charles Krauthammer) It was interesting to me that the Republicans who have taken over the running of Arkansas from Clinton Democrats are not conservative firebrands. Members of the state Republican elite, such as popular Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton are waiting out the Trump tempest, trying to make as few enemies as possible, taking no extreme positions. No revolution is going to toss out these cautious politicians. Political waves come and go, but Arkansas remains essentially the same, a relatively poor, predominantly white state with a cozy political tradition — a place where centrists with personality can go a long way. Hillary Clinton may be wise to steer clear of it now — it's a hostile state with only six electoral votes — but in that wisdom, there's a long-term admission of defeat in a game her husband could play better than anybody else. The house where the Clintons were married is now a museum. A TV in one of the rooms plays an endless loop of Clinton's old ads from his unsuccessful first run for Congress. One of them features a country song with lyrics about "a new man" named Bill Clinton who is "a lot like you and a lot like me." "If you're paying too much for beans and greens, forgotten what pork and beefsteak means, there's a fellow here you ought to be listening to," the singer drawls. The museum's director, Angie Albright, half-consciously sings along with the chorus when I ask her to play it for me. Could Hillary do an ad like this? "Never," Albright replies without hesitation. "It's not her at all." Bloomberg View Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 13:38 EST, 17 October 2016 | Updated: 15:16 EST, 17 October 2016 e-mail 49 shares 11 View comments It's been a little over two years since Tracy Morgan was involved in a deadly car accident in Delaware and on Friday, the comedian returned back to the state and put on an inspiring stand-up set.  Morgan, 47, hit the stage to a sold out audience at Dover Downs - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in a fatal traffic accident.  On June 7, 2014 the luxury Sprinter van that Morgan was riding in after the show with other comedians and his assistant was rear-ended by a Walmart tractor-trailer on the New Jersey Turnpike. His friend and fellow comedian James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair died in the accident. Welcome back: Tracy Morgan (above) hit the stage to a sold out audience at Dover Downs - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in a fatal traffic accident in 2014 Prior to the show starting, Morgan shared a photo (left) to Instagram, where he is seen kneeling and bowing his head over the empty chair dedicated to James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair (right) who died in the 2014 accident Prior to the show starting, the Saturday Night Live cast member shared a photo to Instagram, where he is seen kneeling, clasping his hands and bowing his head over the empty chair with a big golden bow dedicated to McNair.  The caption reads, 'Back @ DoverDowns. Miss you Jimmy Mack. Tonight will be magical.' While on stage, he said: 'We lost a brother, but he's here with us right now.' He then pointed to the empty chair, placed in the front row of the venue, Delaware Online reported.  Morgan hugged it out on stage with the other passengers in the vehicle from the night of the accident, including his assistant, the driver, comedians Harris Stanton and Ardie Fuqua.  The audience gave a standing ovation, as the group took center stage, which is the last stage McNair ever performed on. Morgan, who suffered a broken leg, several broken ribs, and a brain injury in the devastating accident, spoke about how he had to learn how to talk and walk again following the medically induced coma doctors placed him in. Morgan (center) welcomed fellow comedians, Ardie Fuqua (left) and Harris Stanton (right), on stage with him Friday night. Fuqua and Stanton were involved in the fatal accident with Morgan in 2014 While speaking about his two and a half years of rehabilitation and recovery, Morgan said that he was inspired by his daughter, Maven.  He said that he watched his little girl, who is now 3 years old, take her first steps and that encouraged him to do the same.  The New York native joked how they would run inside of his home together with dirty diapers.  Morgan kicked off his comeback tour eight months ago, and on Friday night's show, he was 'sharp, outrageous, sensitive, angry, inspired and, of course, hilarious,' according to Delaware Online.  During the show, a few hecklers tried to distract Morgan, who immediately shut them down.   'I'll come down there myself. I'm from Brooklyn. You're gonna look bad when a n***a wearing a jacket like this whoops your ass!' Morgan shouted at them. 'A WalMart truck couldn't do that and you aren't going to do that.'  The 30 Rock veteran settled a lawsuit against Walmart in May 2015 over the fatal accident.   The 30 Rock veteran settled a lawsuit against Walmart in May 2015 over the fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike (accident scene pictured) Share or comment on this article e-mail 49 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

The retailers' critics say employees should be at home with their families instead of working. This year, many retailers and shopping malls are joining those critics and pushing back against the so-called holiday creep by staying closed on Thanksgiving. Macy's says its trying to staff its stores with employees who volunteer to work on the holiday. "Doing so means that our employees are able to make their own decisions about how they contribute to our most important and busiest weekend of the year," Macy's spokeswoman Holly Thomas said. "We have also heard from many associates who appreciate the opportunity to work on Thanksgiving, so they can have time off on Black Friday." Anyone who works on the Thanksgiving shift will be compensated with overtime pay, Thomas said.

Did you approve his inference that the “staggering, down ’n’ outs do not dominate downtown anymore” or “for once there are far more NORMAL people” downtown? “The night has been taken back.” WHAT? Out of sight, out of mind? We can’t see the homeless, so we’re rid of them? What a load of prejudiced, holier than thou crap! But, by God, come Christmas, Hicks will head the campaign for Walmart cards for the teenagers of … who? Children of “down ’n’ outers”? Oh they may have a home, but barely. And The Edmonton Sun will plead for donations for the food bank. Who does this food go to? Yes, more “down ’n’ outers”. Then the Sun will do a big two-page spread with photos of the Hope Mission free Christmas dinner several hundred take art in … who are these people? Oh right! The homeless people; some addicts; some staggering; some intoxicated; some panhandlers. Maureen Daigneau (You raise a great point, Maureen. The intent of his column was to talk about the positivity of more street activity downtown. It wasn’t the intent of the him, or the paper, to offend.) OBJECTIONABLE FUNDING In Sunday’s Letters to the editor, George Thatcher said that “Private schools should not be receiving taxpayers’ money through provincial school grants.” Go through that statement and the rest of his letter, replacing schools with hospitals and one can see again how public taxpayers’ funding is supporting the private “conscientious” objections of one religious faction. “There should be a clear separation of church and state.” Les Thompson (This fight is far from over.) FEAR FACTOR Trudeau whining about carbon-tax critics using ‘scare tactics’ is the ultimate hypocrisy. What the hell other then ‘scare tactics’ are used by his mindless global warming/climate change mentors! The carbon tax is economic self-mutilation not based on sound science. It is just a way to compensate for poor financial management and will not win any tangible results for Canada other than making us all poorer which is the goal of Trudeau’s useless United Nations! Art Schatz (It’s all hot air.) BAD INFLUENCE As this is not so much about the pros and cons of Mr. Trump or Ms. Clinton, but rather a sad commentary about the state of the mainstream media, who believe, and perhaps they can, that they can decide who wins the next U.S. election. Ben Nielsen (Only the voters can and will decide who gets the White House.)

Beauty Inc., the cosmetics company that went public on Sept. 22, has a business process that analysts at Cowen & Company describe as a “‘fast fashion’ execution,” one of many reasons to have a positive outlook on the company’s future. “E.L.F.’s low price points (average unit retail at Walmart/Target is about $2 to $3) combined with millennial, multicultural, and beauty enthusiast appeal should drive a combination of distribution and comp growth,” analysts wrote in a note published Monday. Cowen initiated E.L.F. ELF, +4.17%   at outperform on Monday with a $32 price target. It’s one of a number of initiations, and analysts are bullish about the newly public company. See also: 5 things to know about E.L.F. Beauty Cowen says E.L.F. can “deliver product to market in as little as 20 weeks, versus traditional cosmetics companies where it takes 24 months.” That is one of five factors for its upbeat note, including low market share with a high threshold for growth, a focus on product innovation that creates demand, and a younger customer base (46% are between the ages of 18 and 34) who are highly engaged. Analysts at Stifel also highlight the company’s growth potential, with expanding store distribution at both existing and new retailers just one reason to be optimistic. Among the retailers selling E.L.F. products are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.22%  , Target Corp. TGT, +1.15%   and CVS Health Corp. CVS, -2.83%  , along with its own stores and online platform. “The company has significant white space in the U.S. market and longer-term potential internationally, in our view, particularly given its value proposition for national retailers, which make up over 80% of revenues,” analysts wrote in a Monday note. “Although we have no knowledge of any M&A negotiations or discussions, we believe E.L.F. is an attractive acquisition target given favorable category trends and domestic and international white space, providing down-side protection to E.L.F. shares in the near-to-medium term,” the note also said. Analysts believe Coty Inc. COTY, +0.59%   would be the most logical buyer due to its focus on sales growth and scale after acquiring a number of Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.75%   fragrance licenses. See also: Coty buys hair straightener maker Ghd J.P. Morgan said that it’s optimistic about the multi-year outlook for E.L.F. not only for the reasons outlined by Cowen and Stifel, but also because the company’s website “lowers marketing spend and enables an asset-light model with fast go-to-market innovation.” Greater use of social media is also facilitating a rise in the use of makeup. “The ‘selfie’ generation wants to look good, is less loyal to prestige brands and is highly influenced by bloggers, and online reviews,” the note said. “We view the company as a clear disruptor in an attractive industry.” See also: ‘The Amazon effect’ and 3 other things to watch for this holiday shopping season Shares of the company are up about 60% in Monday trading from the $17 public offering price. J.P. Morgan analysts say the spike in share price, plus a third quarter that will likely be difficult, are reasons to “wait for a better entry point.” J.P. Morgan rates E.L.F. shares neutral with a $28 price target. The beauty company was also started at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey at buy with a $32 price target. E.L.F. stock is down 3.6% for the month to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.14%   is down 1.8% for the same period.

Four candidates are vying for two council seats. Ed Grimes and Kim Nixon are the incumbents, and Kenneth Hetge and Maryann Hester are the challengers. Tehachapi News sent each candidate the same questions to be answered. The following are their responses, with the incumbents' answers first followed by the challengers' answers. Responses were lightly edited for clarity. What are your previous elected offices held, and present and past groups or organizations you have been a part of? Ed Grimes I have served on the City Council since 2003 until present, and have been mayor a total of four years. Tehachapi Unified School District Board of Trustees. Served from 1981-2001. Board of Directors Tehachapi Recreation & Park District from 2001-2003. Tehachapi Little League Board for 20 years, president of League for 10 years. Coached Tehachapi Youth Football for four years. Coached Tehachapi High School track, and current track coach at Jacobsen Middle School. Currently serving on the Kern County Solid Waste Committee, chairman of the East Kern Air Pollution Control District committee, and state president of the Association of California Cities Allied with Public Safety. Member and past chairman of the League of Cities Public Safety Policy Committee. Executive Member of the Greater Tehachapi Economic Council. Taught sociology at Bakersfield College for 15 years. Kim Nixon After serving 14 months as an appointed Tehachapi City Council member, was elected to the position in 2012. Served as a member of the Tehachapi Event Center committee and General Plan Update committee. Edwards Air Force Base Honorary Commander, the city representative to LAFCO, the Friends of the Airport group founder, a six-year chairman of Tehachapi Night Out, 10-year member of the Tehachapi Collaborative, 14-year member of the Tehachapi Planning Commission, six-year volunteer with Little League, 18-year soccer coach with a three-year term as an AYSO board member, Cub Scout, Boy Scout and Girl Scout leader. Also have volunteered and contributed to many community fundraising events. Kenneth Hetge No elected governmental offices previously held — I am not a politician. Most everyone, including myself, have been part of some organization during their lifetime. However, the citizens in our community and country, in general, are tired of their tax dollars being spent by politicians who make their decisions based on input and influence from "groups or organizations." Decisions made by our elected officials MUST stand on their own merit and not be influenced by membership in any "group or organization" or other outside special interest force. Maryann Hester Elected lieutenant for the Tehachapi Police Department Volunteers for nine years. Elected as coordinator of Military Youth & Children's hero awards for the American Legion Auxiliary, and volunteer for 10 years. Elected coordinator of the Sheriff's Advisory Committee and Adopt a Highway Program, volunteer four years. Served as a volunteer for the Tehachapi Unified School District (three years), Open Door Youth Program, (five years), Tomo Kani Historical Park (three years), Crisis Pregnancy Center (four years), Adobe SOS Dog Rescue (four years), Church of Bakersfield (nine years), along with other groups. What experience and background would you bring to the council? Ed Grimes College graduate with a degree in criminal justice and worked in management positions for last 25 years of career. Excellent leadership training. Excellent judgment and decision making in critical situations. Long-time experience in budget issues. A passion to serve and work with people. Kim Nixon I bring 30 years of community involvement and investment in our children, our schools, our new hospital and our future. I am committed to making Tehachapi the best possible community it can be — to live, work and raise a family. My husband and I have owned a Tehachapi business for nearly four decades and thus, I understand the challenges of small business. I will continue to work hard to help businesses succeed by listening to concerns and developing solutions to these challenges. As the executive director of a local nonprofit agency, I also bring a keen awareness of the issues facing nonprofit organizations including donor expansion and volunteer development. From decades in the private and nonprofit sector, I believe that my experience uniquely qualifies me to serve the residents of our beautiful city. Kenneth Hetge As a city of Tehachapi small business owner, I have faced significant challenges. Those very challenges force you to learn and manage issues and situations essential to success. My dedication and commitment to my business will translate to my dedication and commitment to my fellow citizens. I willingly accept the responsibility associated with being elected to serve the people and will do so to the very best of my ability. Maryann Hester Good communication skills, proven leadership sills, skilled counseling abilities and avid problem solver. As a citizen of our beautiful town for 50 years, I have always taken an active role in volunteer work and local politics. Now after 20-plus years of attending city, county and state meetings, and the education gained from each, I feel that I am more than qualified to become a member our our council. As the Tehachapi 2012 Citizen of the year, I was recognized for all of the qualities of a volunteer and for the time and attention given to each organization I served. Not once did I ever do any volunteer work for self-gain. All volunteer work was done with love, respect and concern for each organization and the people involved. I have witnessed the good, the bad and the indifferent in all phases of Tehachapi. It would be hard to find a citizen who knows more about Tehachapi than I do. Therefore, I am eager to be given the opportunity to serve as the next chosen City Council member. Why are you running for City Council and what do you hope to accomplish? Ed Grimes To help maintain the direction the city is going and to make sure the budget is compatible with that direction. To continue working toward the best water solution we can have and making sure our water is safe to drink. To continue a program of replacement and repair of an aging infrastructure through grants. To continue to help the city grow at a responsible rate. Kim Nixon I am running for a seat on the council to continue the positive momentum of our city. Serving the residents and businesses of Tehachapi has been an honor, a privilege and a responsibility to the greater good. To hear the concerns of my neighbors and develop solutions to their plight has been extremely gratifying. I am proud of the new, state-of-the-art police station and 911 communication system. I was honored to be a part of the Veteran’s Memorial dedication and the opening of the Visitor’s Center. I am thrilled with our commitment to building safe corridors to schools and parks. I am excited about the new hospital and the upcoming expanded retail venues — all of which will enable our residents to stay closer to home. I hope to continue to develop our city as both a great place to live and a wonderful place to visit. I will be mindful of the concerns of our residents and will work to ensure that my neighbors feel safe in their homes and on our streets; that they have clean water and fresh air; safe streets and reliability utility systems. I hope to strengthen our relationships with residents throughout the Greater Tehachapi Valley, through increased networking and better communication. I will seek to elevate our transparency and grow your trust in the governance of your city. I believe, together, we can identify community needs and implement good, sound community solutions. Kenneth Hetge Having attended City Council meetings for years, I have experienced the best and worst of our local government. Our community is not perfect and it should never be represented as such. When business owners or citizens come to our elected officials with concerns or problems, there should be solid answers provided or a commitment to 'follow-up.' This is currently missing. Remember, the City Council represents the people and their business. When this essential process stops working, change must occur. Maryann Hester My goal is to be a voice for all citizens; they are our employees and not City Hall. There is a need for a more open door policy between our citizens and the council. Because of too many closed council meetings, citizens are restricted in feedback. Too many agenda items are not addressed openly, which denies citizens democratic representation. What are the three most important issues facing the city and how would you prioritize them? Ed Grimes The three most important issues the city has are: 1. Responsible growth compatible with budget constraints. 2. Having enough water to service the needs of the people. 3. Infrastructure program to repair and replace when needed, and also continue to have a balanced budget. Everything I stated is contingent on the budget being solvent. Therefore the No. 1 priority is a solid budget. Everything else is interchangeable. Kim Nixon Aging infrastructure is a costly and critical community concern. With water and sewer lines built decades ago and city streets hosting potholes, city staff has identified and prioritized those needing replacement and necessary maintenance. It is vital to support and implement these important infrastructure repair and maintenance programs — each and every year. This ongoing priority will ensure that our city will be viable and strong for generations to come. Safe and walkable transportation corridors helps ensure the safety of our children and families as they walk through the city on their way to schools, shopping, churches and restaurants. A “Walkable Community” supports good health, clean air and safe streets, community engagement and pride. Build stronger area alliances with Tehachapi Valley communities. As a City Council member, my immediate responsibility is to the residents of our city. It is vital that I listen and respond to their questions and concerns. That said, I understand clearly that the decisions of the city impact residents through the area. As the area’s namesake and commerce hub, it is important to strengthen our interactions with all of the outlying communities, increase our transparency and communicate our choices … as they impact our neighbors. Kenneth Hetge In order, jobs. Tehachapi must provide an environment that promotes livable wage jobs which is integral to any sustainable community. Essential infrastructure/services. Our city must provide good streets and alleys, reasonably priced water and sewer, and law enforcement for our protection and stability. Preservation of our small town heritage. Tehachapi is unique and has its own identity. Our council must work hard to protect this while allowing objective and responsible growth. Maryann Hester Water, the drought effect, the cost of transporting from other sources, distribution of water to a growing community and the cost of each. Growth problems of our exploding population including adequate housing, water, garbage management, finding and keeping businesses and personnel, which include our new medical facility. Attention and transparency in all areas of city government. This is an area that is not open for discussion in print. As I campaign, information is shared with me that does not appear openly to taxpayers. Expenditures, intimidating supervision, weak communication skills, oversight of funding, organizational weaknesses, and many other topics are just a few of citizens' concerns. What's your stance on Walmart? Ed Grimes I am in favor of Walmart and have worked hard for them to come to our city. It will create more than 300 jobs and will also bring in other businesses. Kim Nixon I believe the city has done their due diligence throughout the five-year Walmart approval process. I believe we have listened to the residents of the greater Tehachapi area and have infused concerns and solutions into the conversation. I believe that Walmart has stepped up to the table as they have endeavored to remedy each and every concern. As a new business to the area, Walmart will provide more than 300 jobs, help citizens save money by providing more competitive pricing on household necessities, and save wear and tear on vehicles as more people choose to shop locally. The store will increase sales tax revenue to the city — enabling the city to invest back into the community. The development will provide additional parking to the Antelope Run walking and biking trail system. The project will fund one additional full-time police officer and will pay for turn lanes and traffic lights to support good traffic flow. We have set requirements for delivery times, shopping cart containment and light restrictions. All of which have been agreed upon by the Walmart corporation. I believe that, as people stay local to shop at Walmart, they will spend dollars at local restaurants, boutiques and specialty stores. More money will stay locally instead of being siphoned to Bakersfield or Lancaster-Palmdale. Kenneth Hetge Walmart will change our community forever. At this point, the courts have spoken and they feel the city's CEQA document issues have been satisfied. Maryann Hester The people have spoken! The democratic process of government should be recognized and honored. The voters for Walmart outnumber the naysayers. What goals should the city set for the next 10 years? Ed Grimes Continue to have a balanced budget. Monitor responsible growth. Replace and repair infrastructure as needed. Work tirelessly on conserving and finding ways to conserve water. Continue to partner with other agencies to help reduce cost of government. Kim Nixon The next 10 years are critical to our future. My goals will be to continue working under a balanced budget with a commitment to smart investment and reserve fund allocation. Develop a plan for an efficient tertiary waste water treatment system to enable the city to recycle waste water for use on public lands. Establish a self-sustaining, balanced airport enterprise fund and recruit new businesses to our airport corridor. Work with the Kern Council of Governments on a Tehachapi expansion of the Metrolink. This effort would give our residents a cost-effective, expedient transportation option to the Los Angeles area. Continue promotion of the unique and special place that is Tehachapi — to increase tourism dollars for our businesses and quality residents to our communities. Kenneth Hetge First and foremost, re-engage the citizens in our community. A healthy and uninhibited dialogue between the people and their local government ensures full transparency. Second, the City of Tehachapi must acknowledge the decisions they make will influence and impact every other person living in the Tehachapi Valley. This fact alone must drive greater unbiased interaction between the different outlying areas and the city. Third, Tehachapi is a wonderful place to live and to visit and the efforts of every elected official must ensure this is both protected and promoted. Maryann Hester The answers to question four also applies here as well. Regardless of a few organized groups who are against growth, the city will grow, and with proper oversight, it will continue to be one of the most outstanding small towns in America. I want to be a part of the decision making that makes this possible. jbnelson Follow jbnelson Close Get email notifications on jbnelson daily! Your notification has been saved.

(Photo: David Mulder/flickr/cc)   In these dismal days of climate change, imperial decline, endless war, and in my city, a hapless football team, I seem to be experiencing a strange and unaccustomed emotion: hope. How can that be? Maybe it’s because, like my poor San Francisco 49ers who have been “rebuilding” for the last two decades, I’m fortunate enough to be able to play the long game. But what exactly is making me feel hopeful at the moment? For one thing, we seem to have finally reached Peak Trump, and the reason why is important. Calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers didn’t do it. Promising to bring back waterboarding and commit assorted other war crimes didn’t do it. Flirting with the white supremacist crowd and their little friend Pepe the Frog didn't do it. But an 11-year-old video tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy” seems to have been the drop of water that finally cracked the dam and sent even stalwart Republican leaders fleeing a flood of public revulsion. In the midst of the most frightening and depressing presidential election of my life, the reactions to this latest glimpse into the Mind of Trump have actually lifted my spirits. Not that many years ago, an exchange like the one between Donald Trump and Billy Bush would hardly have been news. Sexual harassment was an expected part of the lives of working women -- par for a Trump golf course. I remember, for instance, paging through my family’s New Yorker magazines and coming across a Whitney Darrow cartoon about a lesson at a secretarial school. A businessman is chasing a woman around a desk as the teacher explains, “Notice, class, how Angela circles, always keeping the desk between them...” There you have it: the devaluation of women’s work (secretarial skills reduced to techniques for evading the boss’s advances), the trivialization of sexual predation, and in Angela’s knowing smile, admiration for the woman who keeps her sense of humor while defending her virtue. What’s most surprising about the response to Trump’s hot-mic moment is the apparent national consensus that speaking -- or even thinking -- about sexual assault the way Trump did on this video is neither normal nor amusing. This shared assumption that women are not trophies for the taking marks an advance toward full personhood that we have achieved only in my lifetime. When you stop to think about it, it’s an extraordinary cultural shift. And once people figure out that women are, after all, human, it’s pretty hard to stuff that genie back into the bottle. Of course, there are still a lot of men who have a hard time with the woman-human being equation. Paul Ryan, for example, responded to the Trump video release by opining that “Women are to be championed and revered” -- a view that suggests we are either helpless creatures to be saved by a “champion” or other-than-human creatures belonging on some Victorian pedestal. Then There’s Hillary In her first debate with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton actually said the words “systemic racism.” Never in our history has a mainstream presidential candidate described our country’s racial institutions in that kind of language. Indeed, one of the biggest political problems the movement for racial justice has faced in the post-Civil Rights era has been how to account for the fact that, absent legal segregation, people of color, and especially African Americans, remain disproportionately represented among the poor, the unhoused, and the incarcerated. Institutional, or systemic, racism describes the mechanism at play. Here’s what Clinton said in that debate: “And it’s just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.” She’s right of course. And she deserves credit for saying it, but it’s the analysis of groups like RaceForward, the organizing skills of the young activists of Black Lives Matter, and the moral voice of older leaders like the Reverend William Barber II of the North Carolina NAACP who created the atmosphere in which she had to say it. We are, in other words, witnessing a sea change in how people in mainstream politics talk about racism. Of course, there’s been pushback against Clinton’s rhetoric, but the idea that actual institutional structures exist that deeply constrain the lives of African Americans has now been admitted to the grown-ups’ table. Black communities have long known that they, and especially their young men, are at risk of police violence. That’s why sooner or later so many black parents of every economic class have “the talk” with their children about how to try to stay safe (or at least safer). But in the two years since the murder of Trayvon Martin by a self-styled vigilante, Black Lives Matter has focused national attention for the first time on the repeated deaths of unarmed black men and women at the hands of those who are meant to protect and serve. Now, even the mainstream media no longer treat such deaths as isolated incidents unworthy of coverage. Instead, it is recognized that they form a systemic pattern, and even presidential candidates have to respond to that pattern. That is a victory and it was almost beyond imagination even a few years ago. Of course, the real victory will come when police stop shooting unarmed people, but at least now the country generally admits that it happens. Similarly, many of us on the left have long known that wages in this country began to stagnate in the mid-1970s. We’ve watched the minimum wage (once intended to be for a family’s “breadwinner”) shrink to a poverty stipend. We’ve seen income and wealth inequality swell to the greatest levels since the Gilded Age of the nineteenth century. But it took the Occupy movement to remind us that the 99% could reclaim political power. It took organizations like OUR Walmart and the Fight for $15, lifted by Bernie Sanders’s run for the Democratic nomination, to bring that discussion into the mainstream. For the first time in years, the words “working class” have slipped back into public discourse. CNN now runs stories with headlines like “Working class white men make less than they did in 1996.” A few years ago, as far as anyone could tell from the mainstream media, we lived in a country populated by a vast, undifferentiated “middle class,” and a few wealthy or impoverished outliers. Now, both the Trump and Clinton campaigns have found that they must address the pain of working people. We may not agree with their proposed solutions, but they have to talk about it. That, too, is a change and a victory of sorts. Wait! You Mean We Won Something?  For many years I’ve noticed that my corner of the political world, roughly the American left, has had a very hard time recognizing and claiming our victories. Maybe that’s because it’s cost us so much to understand all the ways in which the standard American narrative is a lie, to grasp how little the American Way -- whatever Superman may have believed -- has had to do with truth and justice. From birth, Americans normally swim in an ocean of heroic mythology about American exceptionalism, and for many of us it’s been difficult to make our way out of its riptides. So our knowledge has been hard-won. Figuring out that the United States is not the international defender of liberty we learned about in school wasn’t easy. It took work to realize and accept, for instance, that our country routinely supported dictators and torturers. We opposed U.S. efforts to prop up strongmen like Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and called out the hypocrisy when the U.S. government was shocked! shocked! to discover what they actually were. Having invested so much effort in recognizing the lies of the American exceptionalist narrative, we find it difficult to acknowledge when our government does something right. The Paris Agreement on climate, signed by 190 countries, comes into effect this November 4th. That’s because on October 5th, the world met two key criteria: ratification by at least 55 of the signatory countries, and ratification by countries responsible for producing 55% of the planet’s greenhouse gases. It’s fair to say that, without the Obama administration, this agreement to confront the extinction-level threat that climate change represents would not have come into being. Like any compromise, it’s by no means a perfect accord, but it’s the best chance we’ve seen in a long time that the Earth will remain the habitable and welcoming place for human beings (among many other species) that it’s been these last tens of thousands of years. This victory belongs to environmental activists around the world, and we should claim it! It’s almost as if, having worked so hard to understand the role and power of the United States on the world stage and of a ruling elite at home, we’ve imagined this country as a far greater powerhouse than it is.  It’s almost as if recognizing any cracks in the edifice of American power might endanger that hard-won worldview. It’s almost as if the possibility that we can sometimes push our country to do something right, that our side can sometimes win, seems to rattle us. Faced with that disorienting possibility, I suspect it’s sometimes easier to believe that, while we must always fight the good fight, our adversary is too strong for us ever to expect victories. On the domestic front many of us, both people of color and white Americans, have struggled to recognize our personal implicit racial biases. We’ve likewise taken the time and effort to reexamine what we were taught about U.S. history so that we could grasp the enduring and shape-shifting longevity of systemic racism. Knowing this history so well seems to make it harder for some of us to recognize and claim victories when they come. When, in front of 80 million Americans, Hillary Clinton says that “implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just [the] police,” that is a victory, and we should take it in and savor it. When President Obama responds to mass incarceration by commuting the sentences of federal drug offenders, that is a victory, however modest. It took half a decade for the ideas in Michelle Alexander’s groundbreaking book The New Jim Crow to penetrate to a mass audience. Now, the country has finally begun to recognize what prison activists have been saying for years: there is something very wrong when the “leader of the free world” has the largest prison population on the planet. An outrage that, a decade ago, was invisible to just about everyone except the affected communities and a small number of activists is now known to all. Our prisons are a national and international scandal and the spread of that knowledge -- and the urge to do something about it -- is also a victory, one worth celebrating, however provisionally. Who’s Most Likely to Be Hopeful? In the 1980s, I spent six months in Nicaragua’s war zones at a time when my government, the Reagan administration, was supporting the Contra armies against the Sandinista government. Together with many sectors of Nicaraguan society, the Sandinistas had thrown out the U.S.-supported dictator, Anastasio Somoza. Over and over I was struck by how living in the midst of war was like being stretched between two temporal realities. In the morning, a Nicaraguan in the town of Jalapa might help dig a communal refugio to shelter children from airplane attacks. In the afternoon, she might risk attack or kidnapping by the U.S.-backed Contras to plant trees that would take years to mature on mountains that had been clear-cut by American lumber companies during the Somoza dictatorship. You always had one eye on the present and the other on a better future. The Nicaraguans I knew seemed eternally ready for a party under the worst conditions imaginable. One day, in the city of Estelí, I remember running into an American friend who told me this story: she’d been feeling bummed recently because the Contras had attacked a little town near where she was living and killed seven children.  It seemed to her as if this miserable war would never end. The family with whom she was staying was going to a fiesta that night and asked her along. “I don’t feel like it,” she said. “I’m too depressed.” “You can afford to be depressed,” they told her, “because you’re going home soon. We are the ones who will still be stuck in the war, so we have to have hope for the future. We have to dance. Now, get dressed, we’re going to a party.” What group in the United States is most optimistic about the future? Surprisingly, according to a recent Gallup Healthways poll, it’s not the billionaires among us, but poor African Americans. A Brookings report on the poll suggests a number of reasons for this, and adds, “[T]he optimism of black Americans -- especially the poorest -- is a reason to be a little more hopeful. The second term of our first black President is nearing its end, but a renegade political candidate with open disdain for minority groups is enjoying rising support. At such a moment in history, it is noteworthy that it is black Americans who seem to be keeping faith with the American Dream.” Another poll, commissioned in 2015 by the Atlantic, found that “African Americans and Latinos are far more likely to be optimistic than their white counterparts, both about their personal station in life and the future of the country more broadly.” Such people are anything but stupid. They know that their communities are confronting terrible challenges, but they know, too, how important it is not to forget to dance. Why Doing Politics Is Like Surfing How do outrageous ideas -- for example, that women are human beings, or that the U.S. locks up way too many people, or even that gay people should be able to get married if they want to -- suddenly morph into everyday commonsense? It’s rarely an accident. It almost always involves dedicated people working away for years on an issue, often unnoticed, before it seems suddenly to surge into general awareness. Sometimes I think the politically engaged life is like surfing. You expend an enormous effort paddling past the breaking surf.  Then you sit on your board breathing hard, scanning the horizon for the wave. Sometimes you sit out there for a long, long time, but when that wave comes, you have to be ready to grab it -- and enjoy it. Even when the wave looks like a sinking Donald J.

(OTCQB: ARCK), the owner, operator and franchisor of the award-winning Dick's Wings & Grill® concept, announced the recent opening of its newest Dick's Wings & Grill restaurant in Atlantic Beach, Fla. and the relocation of its restaurant located in the Mandarin section of Jacksonville, Fla. The new Dick's Wings & Grill in Atlantic Beach is located in the Mayport area at 2434 Mayport Road, proximate to Naval Station Mayport and Hanna Park.  The restaurant is a free-standing facility with approximately 3,200 square feet of space, featuring an outdoor patio area and interior bar.  The new location seats approximately 125 guests and employs 30 team members from the local area.  The relocated Mandarin restaurant is located at 10550 Old St. Augustine Road, near Interstate 295. The restaurant is an end cap in a shopping center, which contains a Wal-Mart, and is surrounded by both residential and commercial developments. It is approximately 4,000 square feet in size and features an interior bar and game room area.  The new location seats approximately 165 guests and employs 40 team members from the local area. Both restaurants feature Dick's Wings® extensive menu, including its signature Dick's Wings chicken wings, chicken tenders and hog wings, and its Dick's Blingz® boneless chicken wings, which offer 365 mouth-watering flavors. The kitchen serves dine-in customers while also offering carry-out and catering services.  Hours of operation are from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday through Thursday, and 11 a.m. to 12 a.m., Friday and Saturday. "We continue to branch out into new territories within the Southeast and capitalize on our strong brand name recognition in North Florida," stated Richard W. Akam, Chief Executive Officer of ARC Group, Inc.  "Mayport is a logical choice as it brings us back to our roots with its proximity to Naval Station Mayport.  It also expands our brand in our hometown of Jacksonville without infringing upon our other area locations.  The relocation of our Mandarin restaurant represents the repositioning of an already successful Dick's Wings and Grill into a more visible and modern facility." "Landlords have seen the revitalization of our brand and are aggressively seeking our restaurants to help enhance their plazas and centers," added Akam.  "These newest restaurants are prime examples of this and represent a continuation of the efficient restaurant conversion strategy that we successfully implemented a couple of years ago.  Our conversion model is less expensive and much faster to complete, offering restaurant operators with existing sites an opportunity to convert to a Dick's Wings and Grill in as little as 60 days."

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

The public broadcaster, which in recent months has taken several aggressive steps to broaden the distribution of its educational kids’ programming, said it would launch its first branded tablet for TV’s youngest viewers. The “Playtime Pad,” produced by consumer-electronics firm Ematic, is expected to debut November 6 at Best Buy, on Walmart’s e-commerce portal and on PBS’ own shopping site.  The device will come preloaded with more than 25 games and 120 video clips and music videos. and kids will be able to gain access to more than 100 hours of video via the PBS Kids Video App. The company’s PBS Kids Scratch Jr. app, which uses favorite characters to help tech kids coding concepts, will also be included, along with an app that helps parents monitor kids’ progress. Related At PBS, Chasing Kids Who Watch ‘Odd Squad,’ ‘Daniel Tiger’ Isn’t Child’s Play Debut of the product comes as many kids’ TV players are working furiously to reach a generation of viewers who do not access popular programming in linear fashion. Time Warner’s Cartoon Network and Viacom’s Nickelodeon have both unveiled new initiatives aimed at children more accustomed to on-demand viewing. In June, Walt Disney launched an app it calls Disney LOL, which makes available short-form video content to kids related to the company’s many popular characters. NBCUniversal’s Sprout experimented in 2014 with a mobile device it called the “Sprout Cubby.” PBS has in recent months unveiled a large subscription-video-on-demand agreement with Amazon as well as plans to launch a new “multi-cast” kids-programming network that can be accessed via over-the-top connections or digital-cable outlets maintained by local PBS stations. Related How Kids’ TV Networks Are Fighting Off Frightening Declines “PBS Kids is continuously looking for new ways to engage children with media that sparks their curiosity and fosters a love of learning, supporting our mission to help all kids reach their potential,” said Lesli Rotenberg, senior vice president and general manager, of PBS’ children’s media operations, in a prepared statement. “We know that families lead busy, on-the-go lives, so we are excited to offer our high-quality, innovative content on an affordable tablet that helps kids learn and explore with their favorite PBS Kids characters, whenever and wherever.” The new tablet will also contain a front-and-back camera and a coloring app. Parental controls allow parents to customize the device, set screen time limits and manage what kids can access. Net proceeds from sale of the device will support PBS Kids’ efforts.       Filed Under: Kids Tv Lesli Rotenberg PBS Kids Want to read more articles like this one?

How can that be? Maybe it’s because, like my poor San Francisco 49ers who have been “rebuilding” for the last two decades, I’m fortunate enough to be able to play the long game. But what exactly is making me feel hopeful at the moment? For one thing, we seem to have finally reached Peak Trump, and the reason why is important. Calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers didn’t do it. Promising to bring back waterboarding and commit assorted other war crimes didn’t do it. Flirting with the white supremacist crowd and their little friend Pepe the Frog didn’t do it. But an 11-year-old video tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy” seems to have been the drop of water that finally cracked the dam and sent even stalwart Republican leaders fleeing a flood of public revulsion. In the midst of the most frightening and depressing presidential election of my life, the reactions to this latest glimpse into the Mind of Trump have actually lifted my spirits. Not that many years ago, an exchange like the one between Donald Trump and Billy Bush would hardly have been news. Sexual harassment was an expected part of the lives of working women — par for a Trump golf course. I remember, for instance, paging through my family’s New Yorker magazines and coming across a Whitney Darrow cartoon about a lesson at a secretarial school. A businessman is chasing a woman around a desk as the teacher explains, “Notice, class, how Angela circles, always keeping the desk between them...” There you have it: the devaluation of women’s work (secretarial skills reduced to techniques for evading the boss’s advances), the trivialization of sexual predation, and in Angela’s knowing smile, admiration for the woman who keeps her sense of humor while defending her virtue. What’s most surprising about the response to Trump’s hot-mic moment is the apparent national consensus that speaking — or even thinking — about sexual assault the way Trump did on this video is neither normal nor amusing. This shared assumption that women are not trophies for the taking marks an advance toward full personhood that we have achieved only in my lifetime. When you stop to think about it, it’s an extraordinary cultural shift. And once people figure out that women are, after all, human, it’s pretty hard to stuff that genie back into the bottle. Of course, there are still a lot of men who have a hard time with the woman-human being equation. Paul Ryan, for example, responded to the Trump video release by opining that “Women are to be championed and revered” — a view that suggests we are either helpless creatures to be saved by a “champion” or other-than-human creatures belonging on some Victorian pedestal. Then there’s Hillary In her first debate with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton actually said the words “systemic racism.” Never in our history has a mainstream presidential candidate described our country’s racial institutions in that kind of language. Indeed, one of the biggest political problems the movement for racial justice has faced in the post-Civil Rights era has been how to account for the fact that, absent legal segregation, people of color, and especially African Americans, remain disproportionately represented among the poor, the unhoused, and the incarcerated. Institutional, or systemic, racism describes the mechanism at play. Here’s what Clinton said in that debate: “And it’s just a fact that if you’re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we’ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.” She’s right of course. And she deserves credit for saying it, but it’s the analysis of groups like RaceForward, the organizing skills of the young activists of Black Lives Matter, and the moral voice of older leaders like the Reverend William Barber II of the North Carolina NAACP who created the atmosphere in which she had to say it. We are, in other words, witnessing a sea change in how people in mainstream politics talk about racism. Of course, there’s been pushback against Clinton’s rhetoric, but the idea that actual institutional structures exist that deeply constrain the lives of African Americans has now been admitted to the grown-ups’ table. Black communities have long known that they, and especially their young men, are at risk of police violence. That’s why sooner or later so many black parents of every economic class have “the talk” with their children about how to try to stay safe (or at least safer). But in the two years since the murder of Trayvon Martin by a self-styled vigilante, Black Lives Matter has focused national attention for the first time on the repeated deaths of unarmed black men and women at the hands of those who are meant to protect and serve. Now, even the mainstream media no longer treat such deaths as isolated incidents unworthy of coverage. Instead, it is recognized that they form a systemic pattern, and even presidential candidates have to respond to that pattern. That is a victory and it was almost beyond imagination even a few years ago. Of course, the real victory will come when police stop shooting unarmed people, but at least now the country generally admits that it happens. Similarly, many of us on the left have long known that wages in this country began to stagnate in the mid-1970s. We’ve watched the minimum wage (once intended to be for a family’s “breadwinner”) shrink to a poverty stipend. We’ve seen income and wealth inequality swell to the greatest levels since the Gilded Age of the nineteenth century. But it took the Occupy movement to remind us that the 99% could reclaim political power. It took organizations like OUR Walmart and the Fight for $15, lifted by Bernie Sanders’s run for the Democratic nomination, to bring that discussion into the mainstream. For the first time in years, the words “working class” have slipped back into public discourse. CNN now runs stories with headlines like “Working class white men make less than they did in 1996.” A few years ago, as far as anyone could tell from the mainstream media, we lived in a country populated by a vast, undifferentiated “middle class,” and a few wealthy or impoverished outliers. Now, both the Trump and Clinton campaigns have found that they must address the pain of working people. We may not agree with their proposed solutions, but they have to talk about it. That, too, is a change and a victory of sorts. Wait! You mean we won something? For many years I’ve noticed that my corner of the political world, roughly the American left, has had a very hard time recognizing and claiming our victories. Maybe that’s because it’s cost us so much to understand all the ways in which the standard American narrative is a lie, to grasp how little the American Way — whatever Superman may have believed — has had to do with truth and justice. From birth, Americans normally swim in an ocean of heroic mythology about American exceptionalism, and for many of us it’s been difficult to make our way out of its riptides. So our knowledge has been hard-won. Figuring out that the United States is not the international defender of liberty we learned about in school wasn’t easy. It took work to realize and accept, for instance, that our country routinely supported dictators and torturers. We opposed U.S. efforts to prop up strongmen like Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and called out the hypocrisy when the U.S. government was shocked! shocked! to discover what they actually were. Having invested so much effort in recognizing the lies of the American exceptionalist narrative, we find it difficult to acknowledge when our government does something right. The Paris Agreement on climate, signed by 190 countries, comes into effect this November 4th. That’s because on October 5th, the world met two key criteria: ratification by at least 55 of the signatory countries, and ratification by countries responsible for producing 55% of the planet’s greenhouse gases. It’s fair to say that, without the Obama administration, this agreement to confront the extinction-level threat that climate change represents would not have come into being. Like any compromise, it’s by no means a perfect accord, but it’s the best chance we’ve seen in a long time that the Earth will remain the habitable and welcoming place for human beings (among many other species) that it’s been these last tens of thousands of years. This victory belongs to environmental activists around the world, and we should claim it! It’s almost as if, having worked so hard to understand the role and power of the United States on the world stage and of a ruling elite at home, we’ve imagined this country as a far greater powerhouse than it is. It’s almost as if recognizing any cracks in the edifice of American power might endanger that hard-won worldview. It’s almost as if the possibility that we can sometimes push our country to do something right, that our side can sometimes win, seems to rattle us. Faced with that disorienting possibility, I suspect it’s sometimes easier to believe that, while we must always fight the good fight, our adversary is too strong for us ever to expect victories. On the domestic front many of us, both people of color and white Americans, have struggled to recognize our personal implicit racial biases. We’ve likewise taken the time and effort to reexamine what we were taught about U.S. history so that we could grasp the enduring and shape-shifting longevity of systemic racism. Knowing this history so well seems to make it harder for some of us to recognize and claim victories when they come. When, in front of 80 million Americans, Hillary Clinton says that “implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just [the] police,” that is a victory, and we should take it in and savor it. When President Obama responds to mass incarceration by commuting the sentences of federal drug offenders, that is a victory, however modest. It took half a decade for the ideas in Michelle Alexander’s groundbreaking book The New Jim Crow to penetrate to a mass audience. Now, the country has finally begun to recognize what prison activists have been saying for years: there is something very wrong when the “leader of the free world” has the largest prison population on the planet. An outrage that, a decade ago, was invisible to just about everyone except the affected communities and a small number of activists is now known to all. Our prisons are a national and international scandal and the spread of that knowledge — and the urge to do something about it — is also a victory, one worth celebrating, however provisionally. Who’s most likely to be hopeful? In the 1980s, I spent six months in Nicaragua’s war zones at a time when my government, the Reagan administration, was supporting the Contra armies against the Sandinista government. Together with many sectors of Nicaraguan society, the Sandinistas had thrown out the U.S.-supported dictator, Anastasio Somoza. Over and over I was struck by how living in the midst of war was like being stretched between two temporal realities. In the morning, a Nicaraguan in the town of Jalapa might help dig a communal refugio to shelter children from airplane attacks. In the afternoon, she might risk attack or kidnapping by the U.S.-backed Contras to plant trees that would take years to mature on mountains that had been clear-cut by American lumber companies during the Somoza dictatorship. You always had one eye on the present and the other on a better future. The Nicaraguans I knew seemed eternally ready for a party under the worst conditions imaginable. One day, in the city of Estelí, I remember running into an American friend who told me this story: she’d been feeling bummed recently because the Contras had attacked a little town near where she was living and killed seven children. It seemed to her as if this miserable war would never end. The family with whom she was staying was going to a fiesta that night and asked her along. “I don’t feel like it,” she said. “I’m too depressed.” “You can afford to be depressed,” they told her, “because you’re going home soon. We are the ones who will still be stuck in the war, so we have to have hope for the future. We have to dance. Now, get dressed, we’re going to a party.” What group in the United States is most optimistic about the future? Surprisingly, according to a recent Gallup Healthways poll, it’s not the billionaires among us, but poor African Americans. A Brookings report on the poll suggests a number of reasons for this, and adds, “[T]he optimism of black Americans — especially the poorest — is a reason to be a little more hopeful. The second term of our first black President is nearing its end, but a renegade political candidate with open disdain for minority groups is enjoying rising support. At such a moment in history, it is noteworthy that it is black Americans who seem to be keeping faith with the American Dream.” Another poll, commissioned in 2015 by the Atlantic, found that “African Americans and Latinos are far more likely to be optimistic than their white counterparts, both about their personal station in life and the future of the country more broadly.” Such people are anything but stupid. They know that their communities are confronting terrible challenges, but they know, too, how important it is not to forget to dance. Why doing politics is like surfing How do outrageous ideas — for example, that women are human beings, or that the U.S. locks up way too many people, or even that gay people should be able to get married if they want to — suddenly morph into everyday commonsense? It’s rarely an accident. It almost always involves dedicated people working away for years on an issue, often unnoticed, before it seems suddenly to surge into general awareness. Sometimes I think the politically engaged life is like surfing. You expend an enormous effort paddling past the breaking surf. Then you sit on your board breathing hard, scanning the horizon for the wave. Sometimes you sit out there for a long, long time, but when that wave comes, you have to be ready to grab it — and enjoy it. Even when the wave looks like a sinking Donald J. Trump.

(WFM) Stock Whole Foods' stock has been battered for a reason. Don't buy the post-earnings uptick. By Jayson Derrick, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 16, 2016, 11:01 am EST     View All   Recent Posts: Drone Investors: Forget GoPro Inc (GPRO), Buy Ambarella Inc (AMBA) Whole Foods Market, Inc. Can’t Keep up With the Competition! (WFM) Fitbit Inc (FIT) Is a “Piece of Junk”? Wrong! View All Posts Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) stock has been nearly halved in the past 52 weeks, including a 12% loss so far in the new year. Its more recent troubles have weighed on the long-term worth of Whole Foods stock, putting shares up just 10% over the past five years. With Whole Foods stock sitting near multiyear lows — even after a post-earnings bump — investors are right to see the fork in the road — is now a good time to actually buy WFM on a massive dip, or is there further decline on the horizon? Here are three reasons why investors should pass on buying Whole Foods stock right now. Whole Foods’ First-Mover Advantage Is Gone Whole Foods is a natural and organic grocer whose first-mover advantage — which propelled it for more than two decades — has essentially been eroded. The company’s history dates back to 1980 when the concept of organic and natural food was in its infancy. And while Whole Foods once was a very niche player that dominated the space, WFM now faces competition from traditional grocers that sell similar organic and natural products — at lower prices. A report by Business Insider compared a basket of 31 items at a Whole Foods store in Virginia to an identical basket at a nearby Kroger (KR) store. The publication concluded that the basket was roughly $60 more expensive at Whole Foods when compared to Kroger. 7 Falling Knives You Should Avoid Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has ambitious plans for the organic and natural space. For instance, Walmart made a 2014 acquisition of Wild Oats and immediately announced it would sell more than 100 Wild Oats organic products at more than 4,000 stores in the U.S. at cheaper prices that Whole Foods could not match. Wild Oats, like WFM, has also been a pioneer in the organic space as its history dates back to 1987. Including Wild Oats, Whole Foods’ portfolio of organic products stands at more than 1,600. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) didn’t just jump into the organic and natural category — as of last year, Costco was the top seller of organic food in the U.S. in 2015. And worse: It’s not just that companies like Walmart and Costco are doing it at great scale. The perception that WFM even offers better organic fare is fading. Analysts at BMO Capital Markets conducted a study with a demographic sample that is representative of Whole Foods’ client base. The analysts found that only 24% of respondents believe Whole Foods’ organic products are definitely better than those found at other conventional grocers. WFM CEO: Results Are “Highly Dependent” On Comps Contained within Whole Foods’ Q2 earnings report in May 2015 was management guidance for full-year fiscal 2015 revenue growth of 9%, driven by low- to mid-single-digit same-store sales. Comps rose 3.6% in the second quarter, followed by a 2.2% rise in the third quarter and a 0.2% decline in the fourth quarter. WFM also missed its 9% sales growth objective for the full fiscal year 2015 by 1 percentage point on 2.5% full-year comps. During Whole Foods’ Q4 earnings report on Nov. 4, 2015, co-CEO and Director John Mackey said, “Our results are highly dependent on comps, which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape.” Mackey also added during Whole Foods earnings conference call that the lower end of management’s sales outlook of just 3% to 5% sales growth in fiscal 2016 “reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better.” Whole Foods stock is stuck in a catch 22: Management can turn incrementally promotional in pricing at the expense of gross margin pressure or maintain higher margins at the expense of comps.

Supervalu said Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 that it is selling its Save-A-Lot supermarket chain for $1.37 billion to Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp. The deal is expected to close before the end of January. (AP Photo/Amy Sancetta, File) Updated at 4:30 p.m. Supervalu Inc. will sell its Earth City-based Save-A-Lot business to Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp. for $1.37 billion rather than spinning off the discount grocery chain as previously planned, the companies said on Monday. Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu had been looking to separate the more profitable division, which generates about a quarter of the company's sales, from its slower-growing grocery wholesale and food retail businesses as bigger rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. increase their focus on groceries. Founded as a single store in Cahokia in 1977, Save-A-Lot has 1,370 stores mostly in the South and eastern U.S. In the St. Louis area, Save-A-Lot has 800 employees, including at its headquarters, distribution operations and 19 company-owned stores. The deal is part of a broader shake-up in the U.S. grocery industry, with major players consolidating and scores of supermarkets changing hands. Royal Ahold NV agreed last year to acquire Delhaize Group, combining the Stop & Shop and Food Lion chains. And Kroger Co., the largest U.S. grocery chain, has been gobbling up smaller competitors. Albertsons Co., meanwhile, postponed plans in October 2015 for an initial public offering, saying the market was too volatile.  Supervalu decided to explore an outright sale of the discount grocery chain after receiving interest from several private equity firms, Reuters reported in November. "Save-A-Lot is differentiated among its competitors in a growing segment of the industry," Matt Ross, Onex managing director, said in a statement Monday. "We're excited to partner with the management team at Save-A-Lot, along with its licensed store owners, to support its growth for years to come." David Livingston, a supermarket analyst in suburban Milwaukee, thinks Supervalu got a good price for Save-A-Lot, considering the competitive marketplace for discount grocers. "Save-A-Lots are the same size as Aldi but with half the sales," he said. "Now that Lidl (another discount supermarket) is coming from Germany, it will be another big competitor.” Analyst Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research Group in New York thought Save-A-Lot could fetch as much as $1.8 billion, but sales in the last four quarters declined between 1.4 percent to 3.4 percent. “We are not entirely surprised that the sale proceeds were lower than expected,” he said in a research note.

Supervalu, one of the nation's biggest food wholesalers and retailers, owns several traditional grocery chains, including Kirkwood-based Shop 'n Save. Its other brands include Cub Foods, Hornbacher's, Farm Fresh and Shoppers. Supervalu said it plans to use $750 million of the sale’s proceeds to prepay a term loan. The remaining amount will be used to further reduce debt and improve capital structure, according to the company’s statement. Supervalu has suffered recently from deflationary food prices, lower traffic and a loss of customers. The sale allows the company to improve profit margins as its higher-margin wholesale business will become a greater portion of its overall financial mix. The sale also includes a professional services agreement in which Supervalu will provide Save-A-Lot with support for day-to-day operations such as cloud services, merchandising technology, payroll, finance, and other services. The deal is expected to close by Jan. 31, the companies said. Reuters, Bloomberg, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis and the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

(Nathan Denette/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Onex buying U.S. discount grocer Save-A-Lot for $1.37-billion Add to ... PHIL SERAFINO, CRAIG GIAMMONA AND SCOTT DEVEAU Bloomberg News Published Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 7:11AM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 3:44PM EDT Comments AA Supervalu Inc. agreed to sell its Save-A-Lot grocery business to Onex Corp. for $1.37-billion (U.S.) in cash, offloading the discount chain at a time of heavy price competition in the United States. As part of the deal, Supervalu will provide services such as payroll and merchandising technology to Save-A-Lot for five years, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement Monday. The transaction, slated to be completed by Jan. 31, will bring about 1,370 stores to Onex, Canada’s largest buyout firm. The deal is part of a broader shake-up in the U.S. grocery market, with major players consolidating and scores of supermarkets changing hands. The industry has become more cutthroat over the past year, with a bout of food deflation putting pressure on grocery chains. The sale of the discount stores will leave Supervalu to focus on its food distribution business, which supplies products to hundreds of stores across the U.S. The Save-A-Lot sale “provides us with a stronger balance sheet that will allow us to further build on our core strengths and growth opportunities,” Supervalu CEO Mark Gross said in the statement. Onex, meanwhile, is seeking ways to deploy its mounting stockpile of cash, which has been dragging on its performance. The Toronto-based firm has about $23-billion in assets under management, and has said the volatility in the equity and credit markets over the past year has made for a challenging investment environment. “Save-A-Lot provides its customers with measurable savings and is differentiated among its competitors in a growing segment of the industry,” said Matt Ross, Onex’s managing director. “We are excited to partner with the management team at Save-A-Lot, along with its licensed store owners, to enhance the company’s operations and support its growth for years to come.” Shares of Supervalu jumped as much as 9.6 per cent to $5.49 in New York following the announcement. They had been down 26 per cent this year through the end of last week. Onex was up as much as 1.6 per cent in Toronto on Monday. St. Louis, Mo.-based Save-A-Lot operates hard-discount grocery stores – no-frills locations that focus on low prices. U.S. grocery competition has been heating up, particularly among discounters, as Wal-Mart reduces prices to boost store traffic and fend off a push from Germany’s Aldi. Dollar General Corp. has also made groceries a priority. By shedding Save-A-Lot, which is coping with lower beef and dairy prices, Supervalu will be “less exposed to macro deflationary headwinds,” according to William Kirk, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities Inc. There’s also been a wave of consolidation among grocery chains. Last year, Royal Ahold NV moved to acquire Delhaize Group, combining the Stop & Shop and Food Lion chains. And Kroger Co., the largest U.S. grocery chain, has been gobbling up smaller competitors. Albertsons Cos., meanwhile, postponed plans in October 2015 for an initial public offering, saying the market was too volatile. Supervalu plans to use the proceeds to prepay at least $750-million against its term-loan balance, to further reduce debt and improve its capital structure, as well as to fund growth initiatives, it said.

Supervalu stock gained about 8 percent in Monday morning trading.
