In a new scam, thieves are draining money from the cards once shoppers load them up. Pearl City teen Michael Tam is one of many local victims. He got a $75 Walmart gift card for Christmas and wanted to buy a Nerf gun for some fun. "I was happy that I got what I wanted for Christmas," Tam said. But when he tried to make the purchase at Walmart, there was a big surprise. "I swiped the card and it said the card balance was zero," he said. A search of the gift card's history showed his relative bought it in Torrance, Calif., but the balance was drained five days later in a different California city. "What we believe is happening is that people within the store, either an employee of the store or an actual thief, steals the cards," said Gregory Dunn, president and CEO of Hawaii's Better Business Bureau. Dunn said consumers shouldn't buy gift cards from store racks because they're open to thieves. "They'll steal the card, take them home, be very careful about opening the card up, remove the pin number scratch, record the card and the pin number and then re-affix a scratch off cover over the pin," he said. The Better Business Bureau says once the scammers have the card number and pin, they wait for it to be activated. As soon as the amount is shown, they can steal the money in an instant. "Criminals are finding new ways to use new technology to cheat you out of your hard earned money," Dunn said. Walmart's gift card policy says that lost or stolen cards will not be replaced and the company is not liable for lost or stolen cards by third parties. For consumers, the financial loss hurts. But there's also an emotional sting and that rings true for Tam. He's bummed he got ripped off by a Christmas Grinch. Here are some tips to avoid gift card scams: Don't buy gift cards from store racks. Buy gift cards online. Use your credit card when purchasing gift cards so if there's a problem, you can make a claim with your credit card company. Copyright 2017 HawaiiNewsNow. All rights reserved.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By JILLIAN WARD, The World Published: January 22, 2017, 9:12 PM A   A COOS BAY, Ore. — It’s time to close the gender gap. One of the largest gaps is in one of the most high-demand and well-paid careers: computer science. Girls Who Code is a club dedicated to evening out the playing field and now it is coming to Coos Bay. “Currently women pose only 18 percent of the computer science field,” said Cayce Hill, youth liaison for Southwestern Oregon Workforce Investment Board, and also a senior at Marshfield High School. “By 2020 there will be 1.4 million job openings and women will only fill 3 percent of that demand. That’s worse than it was in the 1980s, and that gap is growing larger.” SOWIB picked up the program to bring it here after program manager Kyle Stevens saw a presentation. It was something he knew needed to be local, reported The World. “The closest Girls Who Code club to us was in Newport,” Stevens said. “That’s just too far away, and we have youth here who would definitely benefit from it.” The target number for attendees is 20, and so far almost 15 have signed up. To raise money for the club to get started, Hill initially wrote grants, which has brought in $5,000 from the Jordan Cove Energy Project and $750 from Walmart. “We have several thousands of dollars in grants currently pending,” he added. “Being involved in this feels good because it’s difficult to get educational programs here. Some say there’s not a large enough population to sustain it, but we think we should be giving opportunities to our youth to make sure everyone has an equal shot.” The Girls Who Code club has identified a high interest in computer science coding in girls between 6th and 8th grades, but that the interest drops when they reach high school. “We want to educate them at that early age so they can stay interested and close the gender gap,” Hill said. “Being a boy and involved in this project has been interesting, but I think it’s important for there to be diversity in every aspect of life. We get stronger from diversity.” The first meeting was Jan. 17 in Coos Bay. Leading the weekly classes, which will last until June, is Samantha Buckley, the public health emergency preparedness coordinator for Coos Health and Wellness. Buckley got involved in the project because of the club’s emphasis on sisterhood and education. “It’s important for girls to stick together and support each other,” she said. “Also, every week there is a thing featuring women in the tech world. Women in general in power positions don’t get a lot of attentions unless they are beautiful, so examples of what young girls don’t typically see is great.” It doesn’t cost to attend the weekly meetings, and for students who can’t afford to buy a laptop, then one will be provided. “No one who wants to be involved will be kept from participating in any way,” Hill said. Another benefit for girls who attend the club, or anyone who identifies as a girl, can put it on their resume and use their coding skills to break into the industry. “Girls Who Code also focuses on facing challenges and being brave,” Buckley said. “It encourages women to think about how to solve something if the answer isn’t immediately available, which is just another cool aspect to this whole thing.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar January 22, 2017 ‘Dina’: Film Review | Sundance 2017 A report by David Rooney for the Hollywood Reporter. Documentary team Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles train their empathetic gaze on a couple, both on the autism spectrum, as they approach marriage and navigate one another’s foibles. A verité documentary that mirrors the minor-key humor, the rough-hewn texture, the gentle conflicts and awkward grace of many quirky indie narrative features, Dina cozies up unobtrusively to its complex, strong-willed protagonist as she takes charge of her impending wedding and lays out her expectations for a relationship with no shortage of challenges. After capturing Puerto Rico’s trans community in Mala Mala, nonfiction filmmakers Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles here take a sensitive snapshot of two ordinary people on the autism spectrum who are determined to carve out a meaningful future together. The film takes its title from Dina Buno, a 48-year-old family friend of Sickles, who lost her first husband to cancer and survived a violent knife attack by an unhinged subsequent boyfriend, referred to with an affectless absence of drama as “the psycho.” That grim experience has done nothing to inhibit Dina’s desire for close connection. So when an unexpected romance develops with Scott Levin, a Walmart staffer she met at an outer Philadelphia social group for neurologically diverse adults, wedding bells are all but inevitable. However, while the love is mutual, there are plenty of obstacles to their union. Fiercely independent Dina has lived alone for more than 20 years, sustained by a level of self-esteem many of us might envy. Her primary go-to sources for life lessons include Sex and the City, Keeping Up With the Kardashians and I Am Cait. Scott has always lived with his supportive parents, and his closest relationship appears to be with his phone. When he moves into Dina’s apartment to test their compatibility before marriage, their differences become apparent. Scott is good at declaring his affections but less skilled at showing them, and while Dina makes it abundantly clear that she considers sex a vital part of the package, that prospect appears to terrify Scott. Even including a partner when he’s dancing seems beyond his reach. Still, Dina is nothing if not determined, and her stream of patient explanations interspersed with vocal campaigning for her spousal rights makes her a delightful protagonist that we can’t help rooting for. One of the film’s most touching scenes is a bus trip Dina and Scott take together to the New Jersey shore. Scott is already somewhat freaked by the journey, then soothed by his first sight of the ocean. But he’s reluctant to go near it until Dina coaxes him to wade in the lapping waves. He’s a romantic, given to crooning songs like “Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” but when Dina presents him on the boardwalk with a copy of The Joy of Sex as a gift, the message clearly nudges him outside his comfort zone. What makes this candid, unpatronizing movie so engaging is that the sexual conflict is never set up as a deal-breaker, rather as an issue the couple has to work through in their own, mostly roundabout way. Santini and Sickles — aided by cinematographer Adam Uhl, obviously doing everything possible to give the subjects their space — observe the preparations for the butterfly-themed engagement party; Dina’s raunchy bachelorette night, with a hunky “cop” stripper; Scott’s more subdued stag party at a bowling alley; their formalwear fittings; the ceremony and reception; and their honeymoon at a Poconos resort, complete with a hilariously kitschy giant cocktail-glass spa in the newlyweds’ suite. Throughout, they interact with friends and family, not so much seeking advice as talking through their needs and anxieties. The warmth and guidance of Scott’s parents plays in sharp contrast to Dina’s tetchy exchanges with her mother, in which the two of them appear to talk at cross-purposes without really hearing one another. There are also sweet scenes with their mutual friends from the group, Monica Ferrero and Frank Costanzo, whose successful marriage gives Dina and Scott a model to emulate. The filmmakers avoid extraneous commentary, letting their unselfconscious subjects’ humanity speak for itself. The only real evidence of directorial hands at work is the choice to play the 911 call from Dina’s boyfriend/attacker many years earlier, with her own oddly calm, almost apologetic voice heard in the background. That jolt of violent history is a smart way to remind us of what Dina has overcome and make us even more invested in seeing her build a solid marriage with Scott. And while we don’t witness his miraculous transformation into a sex machine, a spontaneous display of tactile bedroom affection at the end of the movie suggests that a gateway toward harmony has begun to open.

Kyle Connolly WBTV i WBTV LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Law enforcement in Concord said a crash on Miami Church Road just before 2 p.m. Sunday was the result of a police chase that started in Locust. A Locust Police official said the chase started when two suspects stole from a Wal-Mart. Two people – a man and a woman – were arrested after the crash. Neighbors say the car went airborne after going off the side of the road. “It probably came 10 feet in the air,” said Roger Smith, who lives in the home near where the car crashed. One police officer was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The car with the suspects inside was the only vehicle involved in the crash. Smith said one of the suspects was found near his home. “Guy got out and run behind my trailer,” Smith said. “They surrounded him, got the dogs out here, and about an hour later, they found him in front of my trailer here, and they apprehended him.” Tony Cox, another neighbor who lives near the scene of the crash, said he has never seen so many police cars in this community. “Usually cars just keep going by every day. You don’t get a whole stop out here with cops and a Dukes of Hazzard across the ditch over there through a telephone pole,” Cox said.

Here are a few predictions: Charcoal According to Bon Appetit, the nostalgic act of grilling over a bed of glowing coals is making a comeback in a big way. In addition to helping you cook up the perfect filet mignon, charcoal has alleged detoxifying properties and acts as a remedy for food poisoning, resulting in charcoal-infused products from lemonade to charcoal-infused hand soap.

In April, Whole Foods partnered with Imperfect Produce to test the sales of “funky” fruits and veggies in a handful of stores in Northern California in an effort to reduce food waste. Other retailers such as Walmart have also jumped on the “ugly” wagon. On Jan. 17, Hy-Vee partnered with Robinson Fresh – one of the largest produce companies in the world – to sell “ugly” produce. In a Hy-Vee press release, the company’s Vice President of Produce and Health Markets, John Griesenbrock states, “the beauty of this program is that the produce tastes the same and is of the same high quality, it just looks different.” Decorating ugly gords with imperfect produce at Dia de Los Muertos Fruitvale #uglyproduce #imperfectproduce #imperfectperfection #whoyoucallingugly #happyhalloween A photo posted by Emma Dilemma (@chefdilemma) on Oct 30, 2016 at 4:07pm PDT Poke Poke, pronounced “po-kay,” is a Hawaiian specialty that has made its way to the mainland. Poke is essentially cubed, fresh raw seafood (usually octopus or tuna) mixed with soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil, served over rice. “You will start to see more around the poke trend,” Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, told CNBC, explaining that the trend will shortly move from fine dining establishments to niche restaurants, to menus across the country. According to the National Restaurant Association, poke was named a “hot trend for 2017” after surveying more than 1,300 professional chefs. “Menu trends today are beginning to shift from ingredient-based items to concept-based ideas, mirroring how consumers tend to adapt their activities to their overall lifestyle philosophies, such as environmental sustainability and nutrition,” Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research for the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

BCBG Max Azria, with its 570 brick-and-mortar boutiques, is the latest American retail firm to fall prey to digital competition. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the fashion label, one of three under the BCBG Max Azria Group umbrella, which also includes Herve Leger and BCBGeneration, is closing several stores and shifting its focus to e-commerce, wholesaling through other retailers and licensing. Said Seth Lubove, a spokesman for BCBG at Sitrick & Co., "Like so many other great brands, BCBG has been negatively impacted by the growth in online sales and shifts in customer shopping patterns and, as a result, has too large a physical retail footprint." The company founded by Max Azria in 1989 (which stands for the French phrase "bon chic, bon genre") peaked in the mid-2000s, finding favor on the red carpets with tween darlings Lauren Conrad, Camilla Belle and Miley Cyrus, the latter of whom collaborated with Azria on a short-lived Walmart collection in 2009. One of the most powerful figures to emerge from the L.A. fashion scene in the last 25 years, Azria, an immigrant from Tunisia, was early to the idea of democratizing fashion, selling gowns in the $500 range and showing them on the runway in New York to lend a high-fashion patina. He built an international empire that once boasted $1 billion in retail sales. He is married to Lubov Azria, chief creative officer of the BCBG Max Azria Group. The West Coast couple made headlines in 2015 for selling their Beverly Hills estate for $85 million. BCBG Max Azria has struggled over the past few years, hampered by overly aggressive brand extensions and retail expansion plans, and increased competition from fast fashion giants Zara and H&M. Last year, 123 employees were laid off from its Vernon, Calif.-based offices. The company has hired Alix Partners LP to restructure its debt load, although, according to Bloomberg's sources, the company isn't in risk of bankruptcy. Just last week, fellow L.A.-based retailer American Apparel announced the closure of all 110 of its retail stores. Other mall fixtures, including Macy's and Sears, also announced store closures scheduled for early 2017, and all of The Limited stores closed this month.

The full reasons— after a recent Ontario Review Board hearing — for denying Johnson’s request to go shopping reveal the shopping trips he sought weren’t “a major concern,” for him and he was more interested in having access to the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care grounds with his family. What also is clear in the reasons — the follow-up report to the decision made in December to deny Johnson, known as the “Balcony Strangler,” any changes to the conditions of his detention — is that Johnson “likes to be in control” and there is no known treatment for his complex set of mental illnesses. Johnson, 69, was found insane after killing seven women and assaulting 10 women in the 1970s. His victims lived in London and Guelph. The former Ford worker would scale apartment balconies, enter apartments, strangle his victims, then clean up their apartments before leaving. He has been at the Waypoint facility in Penetanguishine ever since. The December hearing was held to consider whether Johnson should be able to go into Penetanguishine and Midland on escorted trips to shop for computer equipment at Walmart. The hospital and the Crown opposed the request. Bill Veldboom, brother of Johnson’s last victim, Donna Veldboom, was at the hearing with 16 others. He said Johnson’s argument for extended privilege was weak “and he did not do a good job making a case.” Veldboom said he believes it was another example of Johnson trying to secure special privileges that others will want, similar to the walks outside the secure area that he’s already earned. “I believe this feeds his ego and builds his image and status among his peers,” Veldboom said in an email. “I believe it is about his need to be the ‘alpha male’ in the facility. Even in the hearing, one could observe his interest in controlling the dialogue.” The board was told there wasn’t enough hospital staff to go into the community with a patient for anything other that medical, legal or compassionate purposes. There were fears the hospital “would be flooded with requests from other patients.” Johnson, it was agreed, has been stable and well-behaved during his escorted walks outside the hospital’s perimeter. While other patients have three staff escorts, Johnson always has four. He was a member of the “outside gang” before 2005 that did work outside the secure perimeter of the hospital. The report reviewed Johnson’s diagnoses that include a wide array of sexual deviance such as sadism, voyeurism and fetishism and narcissistic personality disorder. Johnson’s doctor testified that “none of the psychiatrists or professional people who have dealt with Mr. Johnson have been able to find an explanation as to why Mr. Johnson acted as he did.” Johnson agreed during his testimony he did have visits with his family in the visitor’s complex on the grounds and that he had a computer in his room. All he said he wanted, even though it “wasn’t a major concern,” was to have shopping trips once or twice a year. The board decided the trips weren’t necessary, ordered no change to his status, and accepted Johnson is “a very high-risk individual.” jsims@postmedia.com Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » New Homes Rembrandt Homes Travel & Lodging Elgin Travel and Cruises Travelplus Automotive Auto Spa Self Serve Car Wash & Dog Wash Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Companies eager to avoid becoming the target of the next attack by President-elect Donald Trump are preemptively — or retroactively — announcing U.S. job creation plans. "When automakers such as Toyota announced their new strategies in response to the so-called Trump risk, the industry was nervous and asked 'Who's next?'" Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. told Bloomberg after Hyundai-Kia announced it would invest $3.1 billion in the U.S. over the next five years. Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed How much credit does Donald Trump deserve for job creation since election? 2:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/857217091942" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> The risk is that Trump will include your name in a negative tweet, spawning a PR crisis and a temporary stock price ding. He's gone after automakers like Toyota for making cars in Mexico, Lockheed for cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet program, and drug companies for high prices and anti-competitive behavior. Trump has used Twitter to threaten U.S. companies who manufacture in foreign countries with import tariffs. In December, Trump blindsided aircraft manufacturer Lockheed-Martin over the cost of its fighter jet program contracted by the U.S. Air Force. After campaigning on pledges to make U.S. companies bring jobs back, Trump has announced he's been successful at doing so before he's even president. So on Tuesday as business returned following the Martin Luther King federal holiday, a bevy of companies announced they would be adding jobs after the inauguration on Friday. Put down automaker GM for 1,500. Add 10,000 from Wal-Mart. "Thousands" for Hyundai. And Bayer said it would keep 9,000 jobs and add 3,000. That is, if the government gives it the regulatory approval to merge with Monsanto. Amazon didn't mention Trump in its press release announcing 100,000 U.S. jobs, mostly in fulfillment warehouses, but CEO Jeff Bezos attended a meeting of the tech titans at Trump Tower with the president-elect just before Christmas. Related: Trump Summons Tech Titans to Trump Tower "Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet," Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research told the Guardian. "Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with." They join a small but growing list of companies with recent job creation or preservation announcements tied either explicitly or implicitly to the PEOTUS, including Amazon, Carrier, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, and Sprint. Not So Fast But peel back a layer and the promises come with some caveats. A company's plan to increase capital expenditures, which include jobs and facility improvements, are typically years in the making. Some of these "announcements" are old news in a new hat. GM said its plan was approved before the election, but told Bloomberg it was "accelerated" under pressure from Trump, for example. Related: GM's Newly Announced $1B Investment Plans Likely Date Back to 2014 Wal-Mart's job creation plans are in line with its normal annual increase, and come after it has closed 269 under-performing stores and cut thousands of jobs. The combined Bayer-Monsanto U.S. R&D spending pledge is roughly what the two companies are already spending, CNBC reported. And Sprint's jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by its parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. "This is the normal course of business," independent auto industry consultant Maryann Keller told Bloomberg of the moves by GM and other automakers. "All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway." President-elect Donald J. Trump responded to NBC News' coverage of this story in a series of tweets Wednesday to reassert credit for the job announcements. PEOTUS Trump tweets in response to NBC News' coverage of this story.

The ruling elites, terrified by the mobilization of the left in the 1960s, or by what [political scientist] Samuel P. Huntington called America's "excess of democracy," built counter-institutions to delegitimize and marginalize critics of corporate capitalism and imperialism. They bought the allegiances of the two main political parties. They imposed ... obedience to the neoliberal ideology within academia and the press. This campaign, laid out by Lewis Powell in his 1971 memorandum titled "Attack on American Free Enterprise System," was the blueprint for the creeping corporate coup d'e'tat that 45 years later is complete. The destruction of democratic institutions, places where the citizen has agency and a voice, is far graver than the ascendancy to the White House of the demagogue Donald Trump. The coup destroyed our two-party system. It destroyed labor unions. It destroyed public education. It destroyed the judiciary. It destroyed the press. It destroyed academia. It destroyed consumer and environmental protection. It destroyed our industrial base. It destroyed communities and cities. And it destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans no longer able to find work that provides a living wage, cursed to live in chronic poverty or locked in cages in our monstrous system of mass incarceration. This coup also destroyed the credibility of liberal democracy. Self-identified liberals such as the Clintons and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power. The revolt we see rippling across the country is a revolt not only against a corporate system that has betrayed workers, but also, for many, liberal democracy itself. This is very dangerous. It will allow the radical right under a Trump administration to cement into place an Americanized fascism. "Ignorance allied with power," James Baldwin wrote, "is the most ferocious enemy justice can have." - Advertisement - It turns out, 45 years later, that those who truly hate us for our freedoms are not the array of dehumanized enemies cooked up by the war machine -- the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians or even the Taliban, al-Qaida and ISIS. They are the financiers, bankers, politicians, public intellectuals and pundits, lawyers, journalists and business people cultivated in the elite universities and business schools who sold us the utopian dream of neoliberalism. We are entering the twilight phase of capitalism. Wealth is no longer created by producing or manufacturing. It is created by manipulating the prices of stocks and commodities and imposing a crippling debt peonage on the public. Our casino capitalism has merged with the gambling industry. The entire system is parasitic. It is designed to prey on the desperate -- young men and women burdened by student loans, underpaid workers burdened by credit card debt and mortgages, towns and cities forced to borrow to maintain municipal services. Casino magnates such as Sheldon Adelson and hedge fund managers such as Robert Mercer add nothing of value to society. They do not generate money but instead redistribute it upwards to the 1 percent. They use lobbyists and campaign contributions to build monopolies -- this is how the drug company Mylan raised the price of an "EpiPen," used to treat allergy reactions, from $57 in 2007 to about $500 -- and to rewrite laws and regulations. They have given themselves the legal power to carry out a tax boycott, loot the U.S. Treasury, close factories and send the jobs overseas, gut social service programs and impose austerity. They have, at the same time, militarized our police, built the most sophisticated security and surveillance apparatus in human history and used judicial fiat to strip us of our civil liberties. They are ready should we rise up in defiance. These mandarins are, if we speak in the language of God and country, traitors. They are parasites. Financial speculation in 17th-century England was a crime. Speculators were hanged. The heads of most of [today's] banks and hedge funds and the executives of large corporations, such as Walmart and Gap, that run sweatshop death traps for impoverished workers overseas deserve prison far more than most of the poor students of color I teach within the prison system, people who never had a fair trial or a chance in life. When a tiny cabal seizes power -- monarchist, communist, fascist or corporate--it creates a mafia economy and a mafia state. Donald Trump is not an anomaly. He is the grotesque visage of a collapsed democracy. Trump and his coterie of billionaires, generals, half-wits, Christian fascists, criminals, racists and deviants play the role of the Snopes clan in some of William Faulkner's novels. The Snopeses filled the power vacuum of the decayed South and ruthlessly seized control from the degenerated, former slave-holding aristocratic elites. Flem Snopes and his extended family -- which includes a killer, a pedophile, a bigamist, an arsonist, a mentally disabled man who copulates with a cow, and a relative who sells tickets to witness the bestiality -- are fictional representations of the scum now elevated to the highest level of the federal government. They embody the moral rot unleashed by unfettered capitalism. - Advertisement - "The usual reference to 'amorality,' while accurate, is not sufficiently distinctive and by itself does not allow us to place them, as they should be placed, in a historical moment," the critic Irving Howe wrote of the Snopeses. "Perhaps the most important thing to be said is that they are what comes afterwards: the creatures that emerge from the devastation, with the slime still upon their lips." "Let a world collapse, in the South or Russia, and there appear figures of coarse ambition driving their way up from beneath the social bottom, men to whom moral claims are not so much absurd as incomprehensible, sons of bushwhackers or muzhiks drifting in from nowhere and taking over through the sheer outrageousness of their monolithic force," Howe wrote. "They become presidents of local banks and chairmen of party regional committees, and later, a trifle slicked up, they muscle their way into Congress or the Politburo. Scavengers without inhibition, they need not believe in the crumbling official code of their society; they need only learn to mimic its sounds." What comes next, history has shown, will not be pleasant. A corrupt and inept ruling elite, backed by the organs of state security and law enforcement, will unleash a naked kleptocracy. Workers will become serfs. The most benign dissent will be criminalized. The ravaging of the ecosystem propels us towards extinction. Hate talk will call for attacks against Muslims, undocumented workers, African-Americans, feminists, intellectuals, artists and dissidents, all of whom will be scapegoated for the country's stagnation. Magical thinking will dominate our airwaves and be taught in our public schools. Art and culture will be degraded to nationalist kitsch. All the cultural and intellectual disciplines that allow us to view the world from the perspective of the other, that foster empathy, understanding and compassion, will be replaced by a grotesque and cruel hyper-masculinity and hyper-militarism. Those in power will validate racism, bigotry, misogyny and homophobia. Our only hope now is an unwavering noncooperation with the systems of corporate control. We must rebuild ... democratic institutions from the ground up. We must not be seduced into trusting the power elites, including the Democratic Party, whose seven leading candidates to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee demonstrated the other night at George Washington University that they have no interest in defying corporate power or backing democratic populism. We must also acknowledge our own failures on the left, our elitism, arrogance and refusal to root our politics locally in our communities. Rosa Luxemburg understood that unless we first address the most pressing economic and physical needs of the destitute we will never gain credibility or build a resistance movement. Revolt, she said, is achieved only by building genuine relationships, including with people who do not think like us. Revolt surges up from below, exemplified by the water protectors at Standing Rock.

Before you " p r o t e s t " you need a plan and need to be organized. For example, the recent women's protest was for naught. Trump's first tweet ... from the gut ... was basically stating you lost, get over it. His second tweet was most likely urged on him not to alienate the public on his first couple of days in office. You see, he's only " r e s p o n s I b l e " to those who voted for him .. he doesn't owe the rest of the country a thing ... you didn't vote for him so you don't matter ... if you want to challenge him, fine - see you in 4 years. Of the 200 million plus eligible voters, Trump only has to satisfy 62 million and no more. Belly-ache all you want, just make sure you can afford to pay the doctor because ObamaCare is no more. But if you care, then start by building a new Democratic Party and avoid the mistakes of the one Miss Hillary and the super delegates destroyed. What's more, make sure you secure firm foundations ... they're what you'll protest over instead of some whimsical idea of a wrong that should be righted.

If you see a mother beating her child, you do not organize and make a plan. You jump between them and yell Stop! Organizing and planning come both before and after the response to criminality. Hedges is preaching; let him express his outrage, detail he crimes, and call us to action. My plan is simple: challenge every lie, expose every attempt to scapegoat, but at 75, I can still march and show my revolt in a way that cannot be ignored. Trump, during a time when all Presidents have been happy, is miserable and angry because he knows he does not have the support of most Americans and that they will not be silent. We have already had this effect, to rob him of the elation that follows true victory. We remind him that he stole the election, that he is not popular, that he is mistrusted. The danger is that those who rule without the tailwind of popular support must use force, threats, and lies to try to compell obedience. We saw this with Hitler and Mussolini and Bush II, all of whom did not win their elections but took power....all led to disaster. I urge you join us and learn the love and deep connection that comes with struggle. Not only can you help create positive values (when we oppose injustice, we affirm justice; when we opposed hatred, we affirm love) but you will be transformed into a fully human being, not a sideline heckler complaining about "whimsical" ideas. There is nothing whimsical about revolution. Do you think in the ten totalitarian nations which were transformed by peaceful protests in 1989 that they all had a detailed plan before they gathered? They had many ideas, many plans...but first came the primal act of revolt, the convergence of people seeking to defeat hatred with love, oppression with freedom. I often disagree with Hedges, but he is right to say that only revolt can stop the fascist Trump agenda: do what you can, march, right, challenge lies....but join us in a transformative experience not only for yourself but for the entire world which stands aghast at how such a reckless fraud now has his fingers on the levers of war and oppression. Join us and bring your plans!

A few quotes from Dr. King might be helpful to put what happened Sunday and the critics in perspective: " History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people." " He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it. *** We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest." The protests in DC and worldwide were well organized and uniformly peaceful. Trump heard us clear and loud and has had to resort to "alternative facts (ie lies)" to address the evidence that he governs without consent (ie rules unjustly,to use the words of the Declaration of Independence.). No one is against organizing but first there must be the organic response of revolt to organize. Just as you say we will be made fools of, J. Edgar Hoover said Dr. King was a great liar. My view is that those who cannot provide current evidence (that Trump will count on "disorganized protesting to prove he's in control" seal their argument with predictions which can neither be refuted or proved. Trump is in control of the state apparatus but not of public opinion. The more he lies about us, the more his approval falls. That is why some polls now show is approval at 32%. Bluster and lies will not win him more support but expose him to more revolt. That is my prediction, based on the evidence of history, where unpopular leaders use wars, threats, and lies....and end up losing all support, often after terrible disasters. I predict Trump's lies and threats will only show he is not in control of public opinion...and, tragically, a standard way to deal with that is to start a war to rally support. It often works, in the short fun: Bush II who started with about 55% support, saw it rise into the 90's, and then fall into the 20's. Mussolini was hung in the streets of Rome. Hitler goes down as the most evil man in history. All rallied support, having lost elections by waging war...and destroying their countries and ending up hated. Trump starts out hated......by about 2/3 of the public. I predict: epic failure. My evidence: history. Those without the tailwind of public support can rule only with violence, intimidation, and lies...and in the end, that leads to disaster. That is the lesson of history. Did you protest Sunday? Or are you throwing criticism from the sidelines? The only way to understand organic revolt is to be part of it. We welcome organizing, educating, etc but not from the outside. Join us and help us organize. Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 9:58:25 PM     (0+)   Lee Beacham (Member since May 30, 2015), 225 comments    Trump is the Revolt. Fascism is his enemy and he replaced and beat the two biggest examples of what you rail against. The utopia you seek is the mirage created by political progressives that want everything you have so they can redistribute "fairly". Wish for a world that you control. That would be what you own. Share and trade for your benefit. Live a life that allows others to do the same. Help others instead of expecting a government to do it for you. Charity is best close to home.

E.g., I vowed I'd never make another prediction if Reagan didn't start a nuclear war (I have broken that vow, but more cautiously than I used to make predictions, and I also realize "the difficulty of predicting the future"). ;-) Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 8:22:24 PM     (0+)   dale ruff (Member since Sep 14, 2014), 10 fans, 63 articles, 3587 comments, 1 diaries Reply to Daniel Geery:    I totally understand, Daniel. I was right about civil rights, Vietnam and Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya being wars based on lies, etc. I wish I had been wrong. Recently I made an error in stating that both parties had voted for the 1913 Federal REserve Act, when in fact this was true in the House but not the Senate. I was called on it and admitted my mistake. The party that then denounced me failed to admit he was wrong about the House vote. And so it goes. When wrong, I admit my mistake. I do that as a matter of honor and my desire to be right. Sadly, those who jump on us when we admit a mistake are too cowardly to apply the same standard to themselves. Reagan was actually very good on nukes but he did start 6 secret and illegal wars, killing millions. I predict that the verbal bullies who are attacking the protesters will never admit they were wrong. It takes courage to admit you were wrong. In 99% of the cases when I refute lies with evidence, the liars turn to personal insults and never correct themselves. That is why we will win: we are both right (almost all the time) and have the courage to admit mistakes. I wear the personal attacks as a sign I have touched a nerve and as a badge of honor. In a time of lies (or "alternative facts," as Trump's propagandist called Trump's lies), those who speak the truth are attacked and demonized. I wish I were wrong about Trump being a fraud and a fascist...........I wish I were wrong about most of the disasters I have been foreseen. Sadly, I have a record of being right, from the lies that promoted the Vietnam War to predicting Trump's electoral victory. How I wish I were wrong....

Yesterday, Trump's Goebbles, KellyAnne Conway, told Chuck Todd (who has finally located his balls) that the lies Todd said Trump had stated about crowd size could be countered with "alternate facts." Todd, for once in his life, did not roll over but answered.... " Chuck Todd pressed Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway about why the White House on Saturday had sent Spicer to the briefing podium for the first time to claim that "this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period." "You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts," she said. Todd responded: "Alternative facts aren't facts, they are falsehoods." Conway then tried to pivot to policy points. But later in the interview, Todd pressed Conway again on why the White House sent Spicer out to make false claims about crowd size, asking: "What was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?" "Your job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president, responded Conway." Now we have the alt-right (ie racists) advising the President and alt-facts as Orwellian doublespeak for lies. What next? Alt-truth? (post truth, truthiness, bullshit?). Here is the newspeak of the alt-Presidency: When the media calls out Trump's lies, it is fake news. When Trump wants to replace the facts, he has his propaganda minister trot out alternative facts. ""Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale hath had its effect: like a man, who hath thought of a good repartee when the discourse is changed, or the company parted; or like a physician, who hath found out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead." " Jonathan Swift That is why we must protest, revolt, challenge every single lie..to nip the "alternative truth" in the bud.

In a society where an exploitative class that controls the mainstream narrative uses deception and co-optation to subvert and control what would be otherwise spontaneous social processes it becomes so problematic for the sincere progressive to be able to determine friend from foe that it becomes, without further specialized efforts, practically impossible. Part of what makes it possible to control people is to confuse people enough to just go along with what appears to have the momentum, and the established con artists and their minions are experts at obfuscation designed precisely to this end. They can't stop people from reaching natural conclusions to naturally applied logic and reason but they can cultivate a tribal emotionalism and group think that is extremely hostile to independent dissent and call that progress. In other words, any revolution in a society that has not developed the cultural means of creating a genuine community of sincere people open to social progress and studied self-examination is at least as likely to start out participating in revolts staged and managed by those supposedly being revolted against as they are to be engaged in genuine revolt. Revolt is needed but even more than that we need to find ways to organize as communities with explicitly shared ends where both the self-identified right and left can begin to negotiate on what to join together to bring about or avoid. The simple reality is that victims have more in common with each other than with those victimizing them, but they need to get beyond the emotional reactions of the trauma of being victimized just to realize it.

Millions protesting is not a bandwagon (a negative way to view it) but a celebration of our rights, our passion for justice, and our solidarity. I found no manipulation only organic unity and love. I found no "unwholesome element." I find these suspicions negative, a downer. The organic protests themselves WERE the vigilance you correctly call for. We are here; we are here now in huge numbers, and we have our eyes on the Trump bandwagon. I want you to be positive and passionate about our democratic rallies. I find you language suspicious. accusatory, and deflating. Now is the time to rise up, not push down. Why did you not join us. Every negative word I have hard is from someone who wasn't there.

There will be plenty to criticize once his policies become evident without having to resort to an extended personal attack regardless of how much he may have it coming. Attacking Trump the person and not also the policies of the Democratic establishment that made him possible is counterproductive and will be used by the establishment for it's own purposes.

I do not even know if we will survive as a species." And (said he in 2012): "I do not know if we were lied to about 9/11." There is a lot Hedges does not know, and yes, Baldwin was right to say that "Ignorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have." What about ignorance of the obvious on the part of people like Hedges who should know better and are also powerful voices of "the people"? Hedges' appeal is 16 years too late, is aimed at the wrong target, and for these reasons will go nowhere. Trump was elected. It was not a "coup." What we did have, and still have, is a fascist war conspiracy by the Establishment and corporate media directed against him and Russia, and that is what Hedges should be concerned about.

False flags are the modus operandi of the shadow government. I am pretty sure that the historical precedent for these sorts of deceptions span millenia. Some can accept historical accounts of deep state operations remote in time, or in remote theatres, but can not fathom that to covert operatives, the theatre is irrelevant, and people are expendable regardless of where they are. Ruthless mercenaries or ideologues have few qualms about killing foreigners, brutally, in large numbers. They have no compunction when it comes causing large numbers of their own to to be sent off to kill or be killed in foreign lands. Why in the world would they hesitate to do the same on their own soil? Counter objections such as "someone would have talked", "they could not keep a secret", "they would not be so bold", "the government is incompetent" have been well rebutted by others as rather lame debating points.With 9/11, the forensic evidence for atypical explosive demolition of two towers, and classic explosive demolition of a third - not hit by an airplane - is extraordinary strong. Chris Hedges is one of many progressive writers who ignore this aspect of the political world. It means that their analysis is woefully incomplete, inaccurate. I won't speculate as to motivation to ignore or denigrate those who do think is vitally important to address these things. With respect to Trump, I am still of the opinion that he is a cipher in many respects. Those who are certain that they understand the man, his motivations, and even his deep state connections are possessed of a certainty of opinion which I feel to be wholly unjustified. Everyone reads the entrails a bit differently it would seem, even on the socially progressive side of values and belief.

Trump is hardly a cipher: he wants to deport 11 million immigrants, is 1000% alilgned with the CIA, wants a nuclear arms race, has appointed 6 Wall St. billionaires to his staff, and has racists like Bannon and Sessions in close. His lies are as big as Hitler's. The people of New York, who know him best, know he is a criminal, a fraud, a pretender. In Manhatten and the Bronx, he got less than 10% of the vote. Personnel is policy: Trump has signaled his desire for an authoritarian state, war on Iran (military ally of Russia and China), deportation of our most unprotected population, cutting environmental regulations 75%, spending more on the military, and putting ultranationalism (the essence of fascism) outfront. He is no cipher; he is the face of American fascism, celebrated by the KKK and the American Nazi party, and now defending his lies as "alternative facts." My views are based on evidence, his own words, his choices of staff, and his history as a fraud and crook. Most Americans (60-70%/ agree with my assessment. Those who want to give him a chance are overlooking his Big Lies, his history of racism and deception, and the fact that he asked Russia to intervene to give him the victory. It is not a victory (even he knows that) but a huge tragedy for all of us. it is not entrails but history and evidence we are reading when we, the vast majoritiy of Americans, say NO to the fake that is Donald Trump.

The polls all show a 60-70% disapproval of Trump and the election results, where he lost by 3 million and is now lying about 4 or 5 million votes by "illegals" and his long history of fraud and corruption back up my assertions. Your denial is threadbare. Most Americans reject Trump, which to me demonstrates their wisdom and maturity. The entrails are not necessary as we have heard the voice of the People and we have a history of Trump's career as one of making money oiff other people's losses, his use of slave labor, and his paying to play, by his own admission.

That is why he is being universally opposed. Trump is one man who might be dealt with, through negotiation or popular actions. That was never possible with the existing structure because the "Two Parties" served the same master. The Existing Elitist Power Structure is more than happy to promote or even provoke violent popular actions against Mr. Trump's Presidency; in the certain knowledge that at some point violence and destruction will force Trump to respond with violence.

By Paul Douglas January 22, 2017 — 10:33pm Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint 4th of 5th Longest January Thaw on Record for MSP "March-uary"? I seriously overslept. I went to bed in mid-January - woke up in late March, complete with pond-size puddles and a few dreary piles of dirty snow. March-like mud and mush in my sloppy yard. Most years we enjoy a January Thaw, but this one has been super-sized. We may go 11 days in a row with highs above freezing; the 4th longest stretch since 1872, according to Dr. Mark Seeley. To say it's been an odd winter would be an understatement: we flip-flop between subzero outbreaks and freakish, midwinter rains. Where's the snow? The next system tracks from Denver to Milwaukee, brushing us with a few inches of slushy snow late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Freeways may stay wet and slushy, but a little ice may return later in the week as temperatures finally drop into the 20s. No bitter blasts brewing until (maybe) the second week of February. Our weather is a 2 on the Whine-O-Meter. Killer tornadoes hit the south over the weekend; a parade of massive storms pummeling California with flooding and mudslides. We have precious little to complain about. It looks like Seattle outside my window. Yes, January has mellowed - but don't let your guard down just yet. Super-Sized January Thaw. Here's more perspective on this current of temperatures above 32F, courtesy of Dr. Mark Seeley and Minnesota WeatherTalk: "...The proverbial "January Thaw" (two or more consecutive days with daily high temperatures greater than freezing) for the Twin Cities has historically about an 80 percent probability of occurrence (about a 91 percent probability since 1980 with a pronounced urban heat island effect). This January it is happening to us with an exclamation mark! We may have up to 10 consecutive days with daily high temperatures above freezing if the forecast through January 26th verifies. In this context it would be the 5th longest such streak in the Twin Cities climate records surpassed only by 18 days in January 1944, 15 days in January 1942, 13 days in January 1919, and 11 days in January 1880 and 1909. (thanks to NOAA's Michelle Margraf and DNR-SCO's Pete Boulay for pointing this out). Over 50 Minnesota climate stations have already reported daytime highs in the 40s F this week, including 48°F at both Grand Rapids and Forest Lake on the 18th..." Rainy Nor'easter - More Storms for California. The 84-hour 12 KM NAM shows the southeast drying out, after a weekend of severe storms and large, April-like tornadoes. A powerful storm pushes up the east coast with a cold rain for major cities from Washington D.C. to New York and Boston; ice and heavy wet snow well inland. Meanwhile California sees more rain (not as heavy or violent as Sunday's storm) and a storm tracking from near Denver to Milwaukee will push a few inches of wet, slushy snow across the Midwest and Upper Mississippi Valley Tuesday into Wednesday. Loop: Tropicaltidbits.com. 84-Hour Snowfall Potential. It's a model, not reality, but looking at NOAA's NAM guidance from the 00z run you get a pretty good idea who may see plowable amounts of snow into Thursday morning: Poconos into much of interior New England - South Dakota into central and southern Minnesota and Wisconsin and the heavy snow continues to pile up across the Rockies. What a winter for skiers out west, about as good as it gets. Twin Cities Snowfall: Potentially Plowable. Models print out 2-4" of snow from late Tuesday into Wednesday afternoon; most freeways will stay wet and slushy with temperatures at or just above 32F, but a few inches may accumulate on side streets and driveways by Wednesday morning. Screen shot: Aeris Weather Pulse app. Above Average Into Early February. The 15-Day numbers from the ECMWF (European) show temperatures in the Twin Cities consistently above average into the first week of February. Source: WeatherBell. Brief Cold Correction Middle of Next Week? NOAA models, specifically the GFS model ensembles, show single digit wake-up temperatures a week from Wednesday, followed by a fairly speedy recovery. With a higher sun angle in February it gets increasingly difficult for (sustained) subzero days and nights. Not impossible, but the negative numbers usually don't last as long as they do in January. Graphic: Aeris Enterprise. Premature to Retire the Parkas. Long-range GFS guidance pulls another subzero lobe of air across the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes after February 6; maybe a few days of minor pain before a milder Pacific flow resumes.  February? Flip a Coin. NOAA's long-range CFSv2 (Climate Forecast System) continues to flip-flop between warm and cold solutions, so confidence levels are exceedingly low, but the latest model runs hint at a warm/east and cold/west solution. 10-15F warmer than average for the Mid Atlantic next month? I have my doubts - we'll see. February temperature anomalies: WeatherBell. Putting High Risk Severe Outbreaks Into Perspective. An average of 51 to 62 tornadoes? I learned something at ustornadoes.com; Ian Livingston takes a look at the average number of tornadoes during high-risk severe days since 2000, as defined by NOAA SPC: "Looking at the averages from these events, the numbers are fairly stark. Since any small sample that includes April 27, 2011 is going to be skewed more than normal, I’ll share the figures with and without it included (these are 15 and 14 event averages respectively): With 4/27/2011: Average high risk has 62 tornadoes, 16 of which are strong (EF2+), and two are violent (EF4-5). Four killer tornadoes occur on average, causing 31 deaths. The deadliest averages 10 killed. The longest track tornado averages 58.0 miles. Without 4/27/2011: Average high risk has 51 tornadoes, 13 of which are strong, and one is violent. Two killer tornadoes occur on average, causing 11 deaths. The deadliest averages six killed. The longest track tornado averages 52.7 miles..." More April than January. The forecast of a major tornado outbreak for the southeast on Sunday verified. There was plenty of advance warning from NOAA, trusted sources on social media and both local and national media. Here's an excerpt of a corporate briefing we sent to our clients yesterday morning: AerisWeather Briefing: Issued Sunday, January 22nd, 2017: A significant tornado outbreak, with multiple strong, long-tracked tornadoes is likely across northern Florida and southern Georgia today. A HIGH RISK of severe weather is in place for parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida due to this threat. The cities at highest threat include Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). However, the threat for tornadoes, hail and wind extend from southern Alabama into the Carolinas and across the entire Florida panhandle into the evening hours. Significant Severe Weather Event. For only the 19th time since 2010, and the first time since June of 2014, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a HIGH RISK of severe weather for today. The threat exists across portions of extreme southeast Alabama, southern Georgia and northern Florida. This is out mainly for the threat of numerous tornadoes as we head through the day today, some of which could be strong and long-tracked. The area where the highest risk of severe weather is expected today includes Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). However, significant severe weather, including tornadoes, wind and hail are possible throughout the Florida panhandle and into the Carolinas into the evening hours as well. Tornado Threat. It is not often that there is a 30% probability of tornadoes in a 25 mile radius of a point in the tornado threat map. This is indicative of an environment ripe for multiple tornadoes as we head through the day today, even with tornado warnings in place this morning across parts of the region. The black hatched marks indicate the greatest potential of strong (EF-2 strength or higher), long-tracked tornadoes as we go through the day today and even into the evening that could cause significant damage across the region. Tornado Potential. Our Tornado Potential Index continues to show a heightened risk of tornadoes starting this morning across parts of the Gulf Coast, moving into southern Georgia and northern Florida into the afternoon. This threat continues into the Carolinas and across parts of the Florida peninsula into the evening. This shows that conditions will be more than favorable for rotating, tornado-producing storms. Map credit: AerisWeather. Timing The Storms. Besides ongoing strong to severe weather this morning across parts of Georgia, another round of storms has started up this morning across portions of Alabama and the panhandle of Florida. These storms will move across the severe weather threatened areas as we head through the day today. These storms will have the potential for strong, long-tracked tornadoes as well as damaging winds and hail. The threat for tornadoes will continue into the evening hours across the Carolinas, with the threat of overnight tornadoes. At the same time this evening/overnight, a line of storms will be moving across the Florida Peninsula, capable of damaging winds and a few tornadoes. Timeline: AerisWeather. The other big weather story: More heavy rains pushing into California: Flooding California Rains. The flood threat continues across California as we head through the day today and into the early week, as round three of precipitation hits the west coast. Another 1-4" of rain for areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego will result in urban flooding and potentially significant stream and river flooding over the next couple days. Flash Flood Watches. Due to the heavy rain threat on top of already saturated soil, numerous flash flood watches are in effect into the early week across portions of the Southwest. Map: AerisWeather. Summary. Significant severe weather - especially strong, long-tracked tornadoes - is expected today across portions of the Southeast, including Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville (FL) as well as Savannah and Albany (GA). This is where an uncommon HIGH RISK of severe weather is in place. Stay alert for potentially life-threatening conditions throughout the day today, and be ready to take action. Out west, heavy rain continues across California today, and another 1-4"+ of rain will continue to lead to flood issues into the early week. D.J. Kayser, Meteorologist, AerisWeather Even Alaskans Are Complaining About the Cold. Here's an excerpt from USA TODAY: "...It's just miserable," Erickson added. "I hate everybody who lives in a warm place." Fairbanks dropped to 50 below zero for the first time in five years Wednesday, Anchorage climatologist Brian Brettschnider said, triggering spooky ice fog across the city. Ice fog occurs when tiny ice particles are suspended in the air when temperatures fall lower than about 22 degrees below zero. It was so cold that schoolkids in Fairbanks this week were forced indoors for recess, he said. When the temperature is colder than 20 degrees below zero in Fairbanks, outdoor recess is canceled, according to the local school district..." Oymyakon: Coldest Inhabited Town On Earth? I think Oymyakdon is Russian for "Oh my God..." Atlas Obscura has a post that will make you feel a little better about the winter you're experiencing; here's an excerpt: "...With a day that varies from 3 hours in the winter to 21 hours in the summer and permanently frozen ground due to the extreme subarctic climate, the roughly 500 residents of Oymyakon are mostly unable to grow crops, therefore their diet basically consists of reindeer and horse meat. While spoiled kids to the south get out of school for snow days, the children of Oymyakon are stuck in class unless the temperature falls below –52C. If you were to go outside naked on an average day, it would take approximately one minute for you to freeze to death. Besides the obvious issues of remoteness, the cold itself forces this village to be a simple place with few conveniences. Cars are hard to start with frozen axle grease and fuel tanks, unused pipes can freeze within 5 hours, batteries lose life at an alarming speed. Pen ink freezes, anything less than fur fails at keeping the chill off, and electronics are all but useless..." GOES 16: True Color Makes a Comeback. Seeing Earth as it really appears? Sounds like a good idea to me - very much looking forward to the new data coming from GOES-R, now known as GOES 16. Here's an excerpt from SSEC at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: "...A familiar yet often overlooked channel, visible light, has made its comeback as part of GOES-16’s Earth-focused instrument, the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). Visible light comprises the range of wavelengths that can be seen with the naked eye. A true color image of Earth, which uses that visible light, depicts features like blue oceans, white clouds, and green vegetation, similar to a film camera. “It’s great to see true color come back into the mix,” says Tim Schmit, NOAA satellite research scientist working with researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS). “Not only does it help round out the toolkit available on the ABI, but the true color images have long had an impact on how we see our Earth and its weather,” adds Schmit..."

Reuters has the story: "Airbus Group plans to test a prototype for a self-piloted flying car as a way of avoiding gridlock on city roads by the end of the year, the aerospace group's chief executive said on Monday. Airbus last year formed a division called Urban Air Mobility that is exploring concepts such as a vehicle to transport individuals or a helicopter-style vehicle that can carry multiple riders. The aim would be for people to book the vehicle using an app, similar to car-sharing schemes.  "One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground," Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the DLD digital tech conference in Munich, adding he hoped the Airbus could fly a demonstration vehicle for single-person transport by the end of the year..."

Turns out the Internet has been anything but a unifying force, for our nation or those engaged in explaining the news of the day, and yet we all seem to live in our curated, "safe" information bubbles every day. Here's an excerpt of a thoughtful piece at Medium: "...Companies from Medium to The Washington Post to Mashable to Buzzfeed all eventually run into the same unthinkable truth: The methods used to fund modern journalism simultaneously undermine trust in the news outlets. Editors, writers, and executives at today’s news outlets are all in a no-win situation where they are forced to contribute to the causes of their own demise to survive. In any other business, companies would try, fail, and another would take its place. This is good and needed. But for news, the failures are happening at a glacial pace and bad actors are profiting as the trustworthiness of our news outlets are breaking down in slow motion. The result is the worst kind of feedback loop, where well-meaning people try to “fix” the news. But instead, those methods erode trust in all news outlets leading to a total breakdown in discourse..." Journalism That Stands Apart. Here's a Report of the 2020 Group at The New York Times. The Highest Places in America. Just in case you were wondering Atlas Obscura has details: "...Each of the 50 states, as well as D.C., has its own such geographic marker, sought out by a particular niche of explorers known as highpointers, which Atlas Obscura writer Thomas Harper described in his account of this elevated subculture.  Scaling each of the state high points means spanning the whole spectrum of the country’s diverse landscape. These markers can be found in deserts and dense forests, from the remote wilderness to urban areas and everything in between. Here are 51 places to get high in the United States..." + 1.5 F.

Just in case you missed Justin Gillis's report at the New York Times: "...In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. “A single warm year is something of a curiosity,” said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s really the trend, and the fact that we’re punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that we’re undergoing big changes...” Photo credit: "Ice in the Arctic Ocean’s Chukchi Sea region. “What’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive; this year was ridiculously off the chart,” said Gavin A.

Here's an excerpt from a story at Forbes: "...After the election in November, a bipartisan group of defense experts and former military leaders urged the President-Elect, through the Trump Transition Team, to consider climate change as a grave threat to our national security. In 2014, the Military Advisory Board came out with a report, called National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change, that discusses what the military sees as the threats of climate change and the actions to be taken to mitigate them: “The potential security ramifications of global climate change should be serving as catalysts for cooperation and change. Instead, climate change impacts are already accelerating instability in vulnerable areas of the world and are serving as catalysts for conflict...” Photo credit: "A U.S. Navy Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea. The U.S. military is worried that climate change is a significant threat multiplier for future conflicts. And the Navy may bear the brunt of these effects. Unfortunately, the new Administration is purging this type of thinking from all branches of government, including our military."

We cool off a little behind this (alleged) storm, but temperatures climb into the 30s over the weekend and remain milder than average into at least the first few days of February. It's already the longest January stretch above 32F since 1944 and this midwinter pause isn't quite done with us just yet.

I get it now - water actually freezes into fancy little ice crystals that stick together, gravity pulls them to the ground at an average speed of 3 mph. And traffic grinds to a halt on I-35. It's just snow folks, not billowing clouds of radioactivity. Couple inches of slush for most of us - but enough to lead the news and spark waves of indignant muttering about the weather. Southern Minnesota will see the heaviest snows, enough to shovel and plow and remind locals that they live in a far southern suburb of Winnipeg. Blogs January 22 Super-sized January thaw continues - few slushy inches Tuesday night Yes, it looks more like Seattle (or London) than a typical Minnesota January day outside my window, but who am I to complain?

We may see a few inches of slush late Tuesday and temperatures cool off slightly later in the week, but no Siberian Smacks are shaping up. Not yet.

(Patrick Semansky / AP) This is a transcript of a talk Chris Hedges gave at the Inaugurate the Resistance rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. The ruling elites, terrified by the mobilization of the left in the 1960s, or by what [political scientist] Samuel P. Huntington called America’s “excess of democracy,” built counter-institutions to delegitimize and marginalize critics of corporate capitalism and imperialism. They bought the allegiances of the two main political parties. They imposed … obedience to the neoliberal ideology within academia and the press. This campaign, laid out by Lewis Powell in his 1971 memorandum titled “Attack on American Free Enterprise System,” was the blueprint for the creeping corporate coup d’état that 45 years later is complete. The destruction of democratic institutions, places where the citizen has agency and a voice, is far graver than the ascendancy to the White House of the demagogue Donald Trump. The coup destroyed our two-party system. It destroyed labor unions. It destroyed public education. It destroyed the judiciary. It destroyed the press. It destroyed academia. It destroyed consumer and environmental protection. It destroyed our industrial base. It destroyed communities and cities. And it destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans no longer able to find work that provides a living wage, cursed to live in chronic poverty or locked in cages in our monstrous system of mass incarceration. This coup also destroyed the credibility of liberal democracy. Self-identified liberals such as the Clintons and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power. The revolt we see rippling across the country is a revolt not only against a corporate system that has betrayed workers, but also, for many, liberal democracy itself. This is very dangerous. It will allow the radical right under a Trump administration to cement into place an Americanized fascism. “Ignorance allied with power,” James Baldwin wrote, “is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.” It turns out, 45 years later, that those who truly hate us for our freedoms are not the array of dehumanized enemies cooked up by the war machine—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians or even the Taliban, al-Qaida and ISIS. They are the financiers, bankers, politicians, public intellectuals and pundits, lawyers, journalists and businesspeople cultivated in the elite universities and business schools who sold us the utopian dream of neoliberalism. We are entering the twilight phase of capitalism. Wealth is no longer created by producing or manufacturing. It is created by manipulating the prices of stocks and commodities and imposing a crippling debt peonage on the public. Our casino capitalism has merged with the gambling industry. The entire system is parasitic. It is designed to prey on the desperate—young men and women burdened by student loans, underpaid workers burdened by credit card debt and mortgages, towns and cities forced to borrow to maintain municipal services. Casino magnates such as Sheldon Adelson and hedge fund managers such as Robert Mercer add nothing of value to society. They do not generate money but instead redistribute it upwards to the 1 percent. They use lobbyists and campaign contributions to built monopolies—this is how the drug company Mylan raised the price of an “EpiPen,” used to treat allergy reactions, from $57 in 2007 to about $500—and to rewrite laws and regulations. They have given themselves the legal power to carry out a tax boycott, loot the U.S. Treasury, close factories and send the jobs overseas, gut social service programs and impose austerity. They have, at the same time, militarized our police, built the most sophisticated security and surveillance apparatus in human history and used judicial fiat to strip us of our civil liberties. They are ready should we rise up in defiance. These mandarins are, if we speak in the language of God and country, traitors. They are parasites. Financial speculation in 17th-century England was a crime. Speculators were hanged. The heads of most of [today’s] banks and hedge funds and the executives of large corporations, such as Walmart and Gap, that run sweatshop death traps for impoverished workers overseas deserve prison far more than most of the poor students of color I teach within the prison system, people who never had a fair trial or a chance in life. When a tiny cabal seizes power—monarchist, communist, fascist or corporate—it creates a mafia economy and a mafia state. Donald Trump is not an anomaly. He is the grotesque visage of a collapsed democracy. Trump and his coterie of billionaires, generals, half-wits, Christian fascists, criminals, racists and deviants play the role of the Snopes clan in some of William Faulkner’s novels. The Snopeses filled the power vacuum of the decayed South and ruthlessly seized control from the degenerated, former slave-holding aristocratic elites. Flem Snopes and his extended family—which includes a killer, a pedophile, a bigamist, an arsonist, a mentally disabled man who copulates with a cow, and a relative who sells tickets to witness the bestiality—are fictional representations of the scum now elevated to the highest level of the federal government. They embody the moral rot unleashed by unfettered capitalism. “The usual reference to ‘amorality,’ while accurate, is not sufficiently distinctive and by itself does not allow us to place them, as they should be placed, in a historical moment,” the critic Irving Howe wrote of the Snopeses. “Perhaps the most important thing to be said is that they are what comes afterwards: the creatures that emerge from the devastation, with the slime still upon their lips.” “Let a world collapse, in the South or Russia, and there appear figures of coarse ambition driving their way up from beneath the social bottom, men to whom moral claims are not so much absurd as incomprehensible, sons of bushwhackers or muzhiks drifting in from nowhere and taking over through the sheer outrageousness of their monolithic force,” Howe wrote. “They become presidents of local banks and chairmen of party regional committees, and later, a trifle slicked up, they muscle their way into Congress or the Politburo. Scavengers without inhibition, they need not believe in the crumbling official code of their society; they need only learn to mimic its sounds.” Advertisement Square, Site wide 1   2   NEXT PAGE >>> Keep up with Chris Hedges’ latest columns, interviews, tour dates and more at www.truthdig.com/chris_hedges.

I was sad. Bartolo Carone was super at his job. Several times during the year, I have had to put a vacation hold on my paper and he always got the start and stop dates correct. Always! (As a side note, I cannot say the same thing for the post office. Not even close.) I always sent Carone a little extra at Christmas. I hope it was enough. I truly appreciate him and his work ethic. I wish him well. And I hope someone just as conscientious has picked up the route. Thank you, Bartolo Carone. Debra Beckham, Plano 2 To Dallas police officers -- When our son and family recently arrived at Love Field, the passenger pickup was a madhouse, our daughter-in-law was ill, and with two little ones we were a little too eager to get home. We had left two bags on the curb. We called, no bags found. I drove back to Love Field at midnight, no bags found, nothing reported. I left a business card with one of the Dallas Police Department officers. After 1 a.m. he texted me -- the bags had been found. He also left several messages (I was asleep). The next morning I followed up, and the officer on duty made a call, found the bags and called me back. He waited patiently for us until we arrived and, after identification, we received the bags. Our family expresses the deepest gratitude for the great work of the Dallas Police Department at Love Field. Thom Aldredge, Dallas/Lochwood 3 To kind strangers -- Our house burned down recently. My family and dogs are alive and fine, but we've never been through this before and have been in a kind of hazy shock. The next day I was in line at Wal-Mart with a cartload of gloves, rubber boots and other necessities. Wearing clothing and slippers from heroically generous and loving friends and neighbors, I found myself at the front of a long line of other customers, with a cart of merchandise costing about $350. I had not grabbed enough cash for my purchases and, still somewhat in shock, I absent-mindedly expressed my apologies to those in line behind me, saying our house had burned down. The beautiful woman next in line to me, Pat, I believe is her name, and her sister, Carla, took no time in saying, "I got this. Go. Your family is waiting for you." You so kindly refused to give me your full name or number. So, other than telling as many people as I can this heartwarming story, I'm hoping you will see this letter. I hope your kindness and generosity will bring genuine smiles to others. The best way, I bet, for us to repay your great kindness is to do this for others, which we certainly will. Thank you infinitely. Elizabeth C. Young, North Dallas Three Cheers is a collection of upbeat letters that inspire readers to think and act positively.

Done Editing Tags 304 Comments Share this article 136 136 136 President Obama at his final press conference, January 18, 2017 Donald Trump’s unexpected Electoral College win has focused attention on the white working-class voters that, it is claimed, the elitist Democratic Party no longer appears to represent. Of course, the Democratic Party has never stopped representing them. We have just never used fear and anger to convince the voters of that representation. Being Democrats, we will continue our navel gazing and internal strife as we slowly come to terms with the November election results. But we should remember that the Democratic candidate did win the popular vote by a substantial margin and that we continue to represent the white working class, as well as the rest of the American people. In addition to being accused of elitism, a new meme making the rounds lately claims we lost the election because we think that we are morally and intellectually superior—although it is never made quite clear who we think we are morally and intellectually superior to. If it is the members of the Republican Party who are proposed to run the government under Donald Trump? Then yes, we clearly are superior. Nominated for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos is totally unaware of the difference between proficiency and growth in standardized testing, as pointed out by Sen. Al Franken. Although not nominated for the position, Franken demonstrably knew more about the issues the secretary would face. And while everyone is aware that she believes guns are needed in schools to protect against possible grizzly bear attacks, some may have missed her initial refusal to admit that the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act trumps state laws. The current secretary of education since March 2016 is John King. He has spent his adult lifetime involved in education, including service as the commissioner of education for the state of New York prior to joining the federal Department of Education in 2011. Betsy DeVos has no experience in public education, nor have any of her children ever been exposed to it. Rick Perry, former governor of Texas, has been proposed as secretary of the Department of Energy. That’s a department he claimed he wanted to eliminate during in his 2012 presidential bid—if he could ever remember its name. According to the New York Times report on his nomination: If approved by the Senate, he will take over from a secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, who was chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics department and directed the linear accelerator at M.I.T.’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Before Mr. Moniz, the job belonged to Steven Chu, a physicist who won a Nobel Prize. For Mr. Moniz, the future of nuclear science has been a lifelong obsession; he spent his early years working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Mr. Perry studied animal husbandry and led cheers at Texas A&M University. Mr. Moniz had such deep experience with nuclear weapons that in 2015, President Obama made him a co-negotiator, along with Secretary of State John Kerry, of the Iran nuclear deal. Donald Trump wants Tom Price to run the Department of Health and Human Services. His apparent qualifications include the ability to shape legislation to benefit the stockholders (including himself) of corporations in the medical field. Unlike Perry or DeVos, he at least has a tangential connection to the field in which he is tagged to advise the president. Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York has asked the SEC to investigate. The request to investigate Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, comes after The Wall Street Journal reported last month that he made trades worth more than $300,000 in stocks of biomedical, pharmaceutical and health insurers while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, sponsoring and advocating legislation that potentially could affect those companies’ stock. In addition to suspected insider trading, he is unalterably opposed to contraception, according to Amanda Marcotte. This despite the fact that wide access to contraception has been credited with the largest drop in abortions since Roe v. Wade. Price has been quite open about his hostility to contraception. As a member of Congress, he has voted to terminate Title X, a program that subsidizes contraception for low-income women. He voted against a law barring employers from firing women for using contraception. He hates Planned Parenthood and he really hates the federal regulation, under the Affordable Care Act, that requires insurance plans to cover contraception without a copay. To justify his opposition to insurance coverage for contraception, Price sneeringly told ThinkProgress in 2012, “Bring me one woman who has been left behind” by plans that don’t cover contraception adequately. Not that the Affordable Care Act is expected to survive the Republican government that was elected in November. Current Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell has extensive experience in managing large complex organizations, most recently as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Before her most recent federal service, Burwell served as head of the Walmart Foundation, supervising the distribution of $1 billion to help end hunger and empower women around the world. Before joining the Foundation in 2012, she was President of the Global Development Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, where she spent 10 years working on some of the world’s most pressing challenges, from vaccinations to children’s health to agricultural development. She also served as the Foundation’s first Chief Operating Officer. Price, meanwhile, was a physician and a member of Congress. I watched President Obama’s press conference last week with a great deal of regret, remembering how proud I was during his first one. There was not a single question to which he did not respond in complete sentences and organized paragraphs. His answers were clear and, while often complex, totally spontaneous. Donald Trump, terrified of the press, is considering removing them from the White House and intends to continue communicating with the American people via social media. x .@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 As for being morally superior, I will proudly stand with men and women like the Rev. William Barber of North Carolina, who began the Moral Monday movement to fight back against the Republican agenda of voter suppression in North Carolina. Meanwhile, the Republicans offer us Franklin Graham, a purveyor of hate and intolerance under the flag of Christ. Their version of morality calls for the wealthy to increase their wealth while millions of children in America go to bed hungry for food and for education. Their morality dictates corporate tax subsidies instead of decent housing, education, and medical care for all Americans. It sees women only as incubators and homemakers. It is a morality that invests in weapons systems rather than roads, bridges, airports, and schools. And it is this morality, this supposed Christian morality, that they want made mandatory. Perhaps the reason that so many of us appear to think that we are morally and intellectually superior is that we are. 304 Comments Share this article 136 136 136 304 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Close share panel Image copyright IBM Image caption Joseph Woodland explaining his prototype scanner in 1952 In 1948, N Joseph Woodland - a graduate student at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia - was pondering a challenge from a local retailer: how to speed up the tedious process of checking out in his stores by automating transactions. A smart young man, Woodland - known as Joseph - had worked on the Manhattan Project during the War, and had designed a better system for playing elevator music. But he was stumped. Then, sitting on Miami Beach while visiting his parents, his fingertips idly combing through the sand, a thought struck him. Just like Morse code used dots and dashes to convey a message, he could use thin lines and thick lines to encode information. A zebra-striped bull's-eye could describe a product and its price in a code that a machine could read. The idea was workable, but with the technology of the time it was costly. But as computers advanced and lasers were invented, it became more realistic.

The striped-scan system was independently rediscovered and refined several times over the years. In the 1950s, an engineer, David Collins, put thin and thick lines on railway cars so they could be read automatically by a trackside scanner. In the early 1970s, IBM engineer George Laurer figured out that a rectangle would be more compact than Woodland's bull's-eye. He developed a system that used lasers and computers that were so quick they could process labelled beanbags hurled over the scanner. Retailers v producers Joseph Woodland's seaside doodles had become a technological reality. Meanwhile American's grocers were also pondering the benefits of a pan-industry product code. In September 1969, members of the administrative systems committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of America met their opposite numbers from the National Association of Food Chains. Could the retailers and the producers agree? Image copyright Alamy Image caption Wrigley's chewing gum would be the first product sold via a barcode in 1974 The GMA wanted an 11-digit code, which would encompass various labelling schemes they were already using. The NAFC wanted a shorter, seven-digit code, which could be read by simpler and cheaper checkout systems. The meeting broke up in frustration. Years of careful diplomacy - and innumerable committees, subcommittees and ad hoc committees were required before, finally, the US grocery industry agreed upon a standard for the universal product code, or UPC. It all came to fruition in June 1974 at the checkout counter of Marsh's Supermarket in the town of Troy, Ohio, when a 31-year-old checkout assistant named Sharon Buchan scanned a 10-pack of 50 sticks of Wrigley's juicy fruit chewing gum across a laser scanner, automatically registering the price of $0.67 (£0.55). Shifting power The gum was sold. The barcode had been born. We tend to think of the barcode as a simple piece of cost-cutting technology: it helps supermarkets do their business more efficiently, and so it helps us to enjoy lower prices. But the barcode does more than that. It changes the balance of power in the grocery industry. That is why all those committee meetings were necessary, and it is why the food retailing industry was able to reach agreement only when the technical geeks on the committees were replaced by their bosses' bosses, the chief executives. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barcode technology required a significant investment for smaller retailers Part of the difficulty was getting everyone to move forward on a system that did not really work without a critical mass of adopters. It was expensive to install scanners. It was expensive to redesign packaging with barcodes - bear in mind the Miller Brewing Company was still printing labels for its bottles on a 1908 printing press. The retailers did not want to install scanners until the manufacturers had put barcodes on their products. The manufacturers did not want to put barcodes on their products until the retailers had installed enough scanners. But it also became apparent over time that the barcode was changing the tilt of the playing field in favour of a certain kind of retailer. For a small, family-run convenience store, the barcode scanner was an expensive solution to problems they did not really have. But big supermarkets could spread the cost of the scanners across many more sales. They valued shorter lines at the checkout. They needed to keep track of inventory. More from Tim Harford The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete With a manual checkout, a shop assistant might charge a customer for a product, then slip the cash into a pocket without registering the sale. With a barcode and scanner system, such behaviour would become conspicuous. And in the 1970s, a time of high inflation in America, barcodes let supermarkets change the price of products by sticking a new price tag on the shelf rather than on each item. The benefits of scale It is hardly surprising that as the barcode spread in the 1970s and 1980s, large retailers also expanded. The scanner data underpinned customer databases and loyalty cards. By tracking and automating inventory, it made just-in-time deliveries more attractive, and lowered the cost of having a wide variety of products. Shops in general - and supermarkets in particular - started to generalise, selling flowers, clothes, and electronic products. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was able to exploit the possibilities barcodes offered Running a huge, diversified, logistically complex operation was all so much easier in the world of the barcode. Perhaps the ultimate expression of that fact came in 1988 when the discount department store Wal-Mart decided to start selling food. It is now the largest grocery chain in America - and by far the largest general retailer on the planet, about as large as its five closest rivals combined. Wal-Mart was an early adopter of the barcode and has continued to invest in cutting-edge computer-driven logistics and inventory management. The company is now a major gateway between Chinese manufacturers and American consumers. Its embrace of technology helped it grow to a vast scale, meaning it can send buyers to China and commission cheap products in bulk. From a Chinese manufacturer's perspective, you can justify setting up an entire production line for just one customer - as long as that customer is Wal-Mart. Image copyright Ian G Dagnall / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption The cost of adopting barcodes initially put off some manufacturers such as Miller Geeks rightly celebrate the moment of inspiration as Joseph Woodland languidly pulled his fingers through the sands of Miami Beach - or the perspiration of George Laurer as he perfected the barcode as we know it. But it is not just a way to do business more efficiently. It also changes what kind of business can be efficient. The barcode is now such a symbol of the forces of impersonal global capitalism that it has spawned its own ironic protest. Since the 1980s, people have been registering their opposition to "The Man" by getting themselves tattooed with a barcode. That countercultural fashion statement recognises something important. Yes, those distinctive black and white stripes are a neat little piece of engineering. But that neat little piece of engineering has changed how the world economy fits together.

Slideshow Taking it to the hoop, wheelchair-style Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Unsmiling and laser-focused, she dribbled, passed, and spun around to block the wheelchairs of her Bennett Blazers opponents with game-face intensity that hid the pure joy she feels whenever she and her Katie's Komets teammates play. "I started when I was eight and I was not really feeling it," Kolander, who lives in Collegeville, said afterward. "I was scared, afraid of jamming my fingers. But my mom wouldn't let me quit. My dad wouldn't let me quit. Nobody would let me quit. So I got over the fear. And as I played, I got much more aggressive." Hosted by Katie's Komets, the 19th Annual Katie Kirlin Junior Wheelchair Basketball Tournament ended Sunday for four teams in the Prep Division (ages 13 and under) and five teams in the Varsity Division (14 through high school graduation). The teams are coed and hailed from Virginia, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Katie's Komets finished fourth; the tournament winner was the Brooklyn/New Jersey Nets. The Katie Kirlin Fund was established by Joe and Roseann Kirlin, of South Philadelphia, to keep alive the memory of their daughter, Katie, who loved wheelchair sports and died of cancer in 1989 at the age of 12. The charity makes donations for Katie's Komets sports wheelchairs (approximately $2,000 to $2,500, each) and for tournament travel to New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Kentucky. Joe Kirlin said he wishes more kids with disabilities would discover the sport. "I've heard there's something like 2,500 kids with disabilities in the area who could be playing wheelchair basketball," he said. "We have 35 kids in [the two divisions of] Katie's Komets. Where's the other 2,400? I'd like to get the word out that there's money here for this and that a lot of our kids go to college." Komets assistant coach Shawn Devault, of Easton, played for eight years with the team, went on to earn a bachelor's degree in adaptive recreation at, and play for, the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where the wheelchair basketball team won national championships in 2012 and 2013. "When you're a kid with a disability, you grow up in circumstances where you're the kid who sticks out, you're the kid that's different," Devault said. "It's not like you go to a community center or a Walmart and see a person who looks like you. So wheelchair basketball is a chance to be with people who experience what you experience." Komets head coach Keith Newerla, of Valley Forge, a lifelong wheelchair user, said, "Some of our kids are mainstreamed, so they may be the only kid with a disability in school. Here, they have a chance to become friends with people who are in a similar situation and understand what you're going through." Newerla said he's seen Katie's Komets players become more independent as they spend more time around their peers. "Rather than ask their mom to help with something, they may ask a teammate or do it themselves. If a kid wants to meet up with his friends, and his dad's not moving fast enough, he may put his own shoes on so he can go be with the rest of the kids. It's about more than basketball. We spend time in practice on how to take care of your chair." Aaron Cox, 17, from South Philadelphia, said playing for Katie's Komets was all about the chemistry with his teammates and living his lifelong basketball dream, fueled by years of watching NBA games. His dad, Paul Cox, said Aaron "understands the game technically. He's got a coaching mind. He can tell who played on what NBA team in what year, and what his statistics were. I can't remember which day the trash goes out." Cox laughed, then grew serious. "This is his thing," Cox said, watching his basketball-loving son. "This is what he lives for." geringd@phillynews.com 267-443-3540 @DanGeringer More Coverage After a bullet to the spine and viral video, he became Upper Body Boy Jan 19 - 3:16 PM Published: January 22, 2017 — 7:15 PM EST | Updated: January 23, 2017 — 1:07 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

The robbery took place at a Kay Jewelers outlet in the Rolling Oaks Mall in San Antonio, Police Chief William McManus said in a video posted on the city's Facebook page. Two bystanders tried to intervene, one of whom was shot and killed by one of the robbers. The other bystander, who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm, shot and wounded the other suspect, who was later hospitalized, McManus said. The first robber ran through the mall, firing his gun as he fled, shooting six people. San Antonio police said he was caught after crashing a stolen vehicle that contained two guns, and was charged with capital murder and two counts of aggravated assault. "It's absolutely senseless. This is the second time that a Good Samaritan was killed trying to intervene in a crime," McManus said. On the day after Thanksgiving, a person who tried to stop a woman from being assaulted was shot to death outside a San Antonio Walmart that was packed with holiday shoppers. The six shoppers shot on Sunday were hospitalized in undetermined condition, the police chief said. Their identities were not disclosed. The robber who was shot was in critical condition but expected to survive. Authorities said he would also be charged with capital murder and aggravated assault. The mall, located in the northwestern part of the city, was locked down while police hunted for the second suspect.
