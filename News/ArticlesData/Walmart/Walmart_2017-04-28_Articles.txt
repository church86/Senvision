Skip to content comics games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Some Surprising Exclusives For Funko: Cars 3 Pops Posted by Jeremy Konrad April 28, 2017 Comment Funko news pours out of everywhere all the time, and today it is about their line of Pops to support the upcoming Pixar film Cars 3. What is news about these: there will be a Meijer exclusive version of Lightning McQueen released, this one in Gray. Meijer is a Walmart-esque store chain in the Midwest US, although they are expanding a bit. The closest one to me is over two-hours away, so I will go ahead and say this will be the hardest of the Pops to get your hands on. Other exclusives include a chrome version of Lightning at Target, and Walmart will receive Pops of Luigi and Guido. Walmart exclusives always tend to be hard to get as well, since Walmart is extremely lax (yeah, that’s how we can put that) getting things on the shelves on time. Lightning and new character Cruz Ramirez will be available everywhere. I don’t get the love for the Cars series of films, but I will admit that these sculpts are pretty fantastic. And I love the chrome look to the Target exclusive, that makes total sense to do in a series like this. Cars 3 hits theaters in June, on June 16 to be exact. These Pops however should be hitting shelves any day now, as they are due to be in stores in May. I will be watching with a very close eye on how the Meijer store exclusive does. Yet another place to have to hunt down Funko Pops. I am sure collectors are thrilled.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic Stock Countdown: Target, Walmart And GameStop Posted: Apr 28 2017, 1:43pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The last three days of the Nintendo NES Classic Edition arrived. Here is where the Nintendo NES Classic Edition is in stock. Updated. The Nintendo Store in New York already stopped selling the NES Classic. This means the end of the $59.99 NES Classic Edition is near. Nintendo said when the company announced to discontinue the NES Classic that the last shipments arrive at retailer through April. April ends this weekend. There are three days left to find a NES Classic in stock for regular $59.99.  Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock People who still seek a NES Classic can be still hopeful to find a NES Classic in a store. New NES Classic inventory has been spotted this morning at Target and Walmart stores across the Nation. iStockNow tracks over 230 Target stores and 134 Walmart stores that have the NES Classic in stock. The number of stores has increased compared to yesterday. Shoppers need to cross check the iStockNow alerts with BrickSeek (Walmart), BrickSeek (Target) to increase the likelihood that the information is correct. Checking a flagged store on walmart.com would make sense too, but for some reason Walmart's inventory search does not show the NES inventory. The demand for the NES Classic is extremely high, topping that for the Nintendo Switch. The competition to line up first at a store and get hands on the few NES Classic in stock is fierce. The influx of new NES Classic inventory has even pushed down the reseller prices well under $300. Legit offers can be found on amazon.com for around $270. Prices have been already above $300 right after the controversial announcement of discontinuing the NES Classic. The NES Classic Edition has not been on sale online since weeks. Only Amazon Prime Now offered the NES Classic regularly, but that is coming also to a halt. Yesterday only New York had a very brief availability. Some people reported on social media that they found a NES Classic in stock at GameStop. We recommend to also visit GameStop locations to check if the store has received new NES Classic inventory. The NES Classic has surfaced at Amazon stores in Europe briefly on Friday. The NES Classic appeared on Amazon France and Amazon Italy. NES hunters should keep their eyes peeled at all options including import opportunities from retailers in Europe or Asia. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. The last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Nintendo has sold 1.5 million NES Classic Edition. Nintendo ha not announced NES Classic sales numbers in the company's April 27 earnings call. Read the latest Nintendo NES Classic updates. This story may contain affiliate links.

It is Skip who saw a need in the office furniture market for a source of good quality products at an affordable price. Unable to find the source, he decided to become it! And by doing so, this family business entered a new chapter becoming Regency, Inc. – your complete source for office furniture. The Regency family has grown again with the creation of the Niche line.

Don’t worry, this will make sense eventually. The U.S. has high corporate taxes compared with other developed countries. That means companies that make most of their money inside the U.S. pay more in taxes than companies that do a lot of business overseas. Retailers, utilities, health insurance companies have relatively high tax bills for those reasons, while technology companies, pharmaceuticals makers and energy companies can make a lot more money in other countries. On paper, the top federal corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent. Companies generally don’t pay that much, but they can have dramatically different tax bills depending on where they make their money. RETAILERS Take Macy’s, Wal-Mart and Nike, all retailers. Macy’s, a department store operator, makes all of its revenue in the U.S., according to FactSet, while Wal-Mart gets about a quarter of its revenue outside the U.S. and Nike makes almost 60 percent of its sales in countries other than the U.S. That’s one important reason Macy’s pays higher taxes. FactSet says that over the last five years, Macy’s average effective tax rate, or the percentage of its net income that it pays in state and federal taxes, has been more than 35 percent. Wal-Mart’s tax rate was 31.5 percent and Nike’s tax bill was around 23 percent. TECH AND DRUG COMPANIES Alphabet, Google’s parent company, had an effective tax rate of 19 percent over that five-year period and IBM’s rate was 18 percent. Both companies get most of their revenue outside the U.S. Prescription drug distributor AmerisourceBergen is also entirely U.S.-based, and it had a tax rate that topped 50 percent over that period, but Gilead Sciences, a biotech drug manufacturer that gets a lot of revenue from other countries, paid less than half that much. TAXING BY TERRITORY JPMorgan calculates that most corporations pay a rate closer to 20 percent because of a wide variety of tax credits, tax reduction strategies, and those lower taxes on earnings from outside the U.S. The Trump administration is proposing cutting the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and it wants a “territorial” system where only profits made in the U.S. are taxed. Because of the higher tax rates in the U.S., companies are motivated to say as much of their income is made outside the country as possible. If their products are made in another country, or assembled there, or will shipped there, or if they have a licensing deal with a non-U.S. company, the company may say that income comes from outside the U.S. so it can pay a lower tax rate. BRINGING IT HOME Companies that earn money overseas don’t want to pay the U.S. rates on top of the foreign taxes they’ve already paid. As a result, money they earn overseas often stays parked in banks and businesses outside the country. Major companies like Apple have billions of dollars sitting outside the country, and the ability to bring that money back to the U.S. without worrying about a big tax bill might be far more significant than a tax cut. “The tax cut is very important for principally domestic companies, but for these multinationals it’s not nearly as important as the repatriation opportunity,” said Bob Willens, a CPA who teaches a course on corporate tax policy as Columbia Business School. If those companies pay a one-time tax on all of those earnings and then don’t have to pay U.S. taxes on the money they make overseas in the future, they could invest in their businesses by buying more equipment, return money to investors by buying more stock and paying bigger dividends, or acquiring other companies. All of those moves could boost stock prices.     Tags: companies, percent, taxes, money, outside, their, Other stories from today: Pentagon joins intensifying probe of former Trump aide Michael Flynn Court: Employers can pay women less based on past salaries Spacecraft flies between Saturn and rings in historic first     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Which do you prefer?

Jack Nicholson, 1997. By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were poised to notch a fresh record on Friday, after another blockbuster earnings report, but one analyst firm has popped above the bullish parapet with a downgrade and a warning. Cutting its rating on Amazon shares to sector weight from overweight, Edward Yruma and the team at Pacific Crest said for Amazon AMZN, +0.72% this may be “as good as it gets (for now).” The investment bank has consistently kept its rating at overweight for more than two years — 84% of analysts rate Amazon a buy, with just 16% rating it a hold, according to FactSet Research. The Pacific Crest analysts laid out concerns that the online retailer’s rivals may be gaining on it and suggested it may be time for investors to take profit on the share climb. “Amazon’s [first-quarter] results were impressive. However, the stock is approaching our $961 target, and stepped-up competition may dampen near-term upside,” said Yruma and the team, in a note published Thursday. Check out: MarketWatch’s live-blog recap of Amazon results Shares were up 3.8% in premarket trading on Friday at $952.90, after Amazon reported net income of $724 million, earnings per share of $1.48 and revenue of $35.7 billion. On average, analysts were expecting earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $35.3 billion. Amazon shares have never traded for more than $923.72 in a regular session. Wal-Mart in the wings Picking over the results, Yruma and the team noted that Amazon’s North American operating margin fell 62 basis points on an annual basis, marking the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, growth rates for first-party vendors (identified as “1P”) who sell wholesale to Amazon point to moderating sales growth, they said. The last two quarters of growth dropped below the growth rate for third-party (or “3P”) independent sellers. “Moderating 1P and 3P trends could be a headwind for revenue and profitability growth. We believe that Wal-Mart’s WMT, -0.34% aggressive stance in e-commerce makes it a much more formidable competitor,” said the analysts. Earlier in April, Wal-Mart began offering discounts on some online orders when customers opt for in-store pickup instead of home delivery, seen as a sign the second-largest online retailer, and the largest retailer in the offline world, is working to compete more aggressively with Amazon. The Pacific Crest analysts also noted that the online retailer’s Amazon Web Services unit, which sells remote computing capacity to businesses, is facing headwinds. “Despite our view that [the AWS unit] can maintain a multiyear lead, cloud competition should intensify through 2017,” they said. Read: Amazon is worth so much because AWS is tech’s true unicorn Microsoft’s MSFT, +0.28% cloud growth picked up to a 52% rate on a year-over-year basis, fueled by 93% annual growth for its Azure unit, the analysts noted. They added that AWS’s growth slowed to 43% on a year-on-year basis, down from a 47% rate in the fourth quarter. Read: Microsoft’s big cloud gains are a bright spot And then, of course, it may be now a question of how greedy investors want to be. Pacific Crest said it is backing off a bit in its own bullishness because shares are now at the target of $961. “Growth or multiple upside are more difficult to justify in the short term,” they said. Do I hear $1,000? The cautious view from Pacific Crest analysts appeared to run against the grain of largely upbeat reactions to Amazon’s latest results that trickled out Friday. Doug Anmuth and the team at J.P. Morgan lifted their price target on the retailer to $1,110 a share from $945, sticking to their overweight rating. Amazon has “more major growth opportunities to invest into than any company we cover,” said Anmuth. “Think fulfillment centers, data centers, video content [and] marketing, India, Echo/Alexa, Prime benefits [and] expansion, plus many others we’re not including here.” Still, even Anmuth was surprised by the 4% jump late Thursday in Amazon’s shares, given they had climbed 22% already in 2017. But this is a company, he said, where you really can’t argue with its track record and opportunities in the pipeline. Moving their own price target above the $1,000 mark, analysts led by Mark S.F. Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets said fundamentals remain very much intact for Amazon as it continues to make aggressive investments. Maintaining an outperform rating, they lifted their price target to $1,100 from $900. Amazon’s two key end markets — retail and cloud computing — are still only around 10% penetrated, while the analysts believe competitive moats around Amazon are deepening, and that the company’s execution seems incapable of stumbling. Amazon “remains arguably the single best play off three of the biggest tech trends today,” said Mahaney, spelling those out as the cloud, artificial intelligence and voice-activated Internet. As for the valuation of a company whose stock has doubled over the last 12 months, Mahaney said Amazon has now seen 19 straight quarters of 20% retail revenue growth, meaning it’s never been more consistent. “And AWS offers a combination of 40% revenue growth, close to 50% EBITDA margins, and a $14 billion plus revenue run-rate that is practically impossible to match in public markets,” he said. In total, at least 15 analysts increased their price targets on the stock. That lifted the average target on the stock to $1,048.16, compared with $956.88 the day prior to the earnings report, according to a FactSet survey of more than 35 analysts. As Amazon shares have advanced 22% in 2017, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19% has gained 6.7%.

Alexandra Rodriguez sued Wal-Mart after a metal rack display fell on her while she was shopping in the store in 2010. An engineer testifying on her behalf said the rack weighed up to 157 pounds. Rodriguez claimed she suffered an arm injury and has experienced ongoing pain from the incident. Wal-Mart disputed that the rack was to blame for her arm pain and argued at trial that the symptoms she described were the result of other injuries or "underlying physical and psychological conditions." The jury unanimously found that Rodriguez failed to meet her burden of proving that Wal-Mart was at fault. In her appeal, Rodriguez argued that the trial judge should not have allowed extensive testimony from a defense medical expert who suggested that she had magnified her symptoms from the accident. That doctor was not a mental health expert and his testimony unfairly impugned her credibility, depriving her of a fair trial, she claimed. Rodriguez has described the incident with varying details over the years, according to the appellate ruling. While she initially said she did not hit the end cap shelf with her cart as she turned a corner, she later testified in a deposition that she "nipped" the shelf with the cart. Police sergeant who alleged harassment receives $50K settlement At trial, she could not recall stating that she had hit the rack with her cart. She was also unclear about what portion of her body was hit by the falling display, which contained clothing. Rodriguez was accompanied by two others when she visited the store, but neither of them testified. No Wal-Mart employees witnessed the incident. Rodriguez reported pain in her right arm and was taken to an emergency room. An MRI revealed a right upper ulnar neuropathy, which she attributed to the accident. She had a spinal cord stimulator implanted in 2013 to relieve what she termed persisting pain in her arm, as well as swelling in her hands and other lingering symptoms, according to the appellate ruling. An orthopedic surgeon, neurologist and family physician with expertise in "complex regional pain syndrome" testified on her behalf. That last doctor stated that, despite treatment, the condition was likely permanent. The defense expert who spoke about symptom magnification was a neurologist who examined Rodriguez and concluded that her responses were consistent with "somatization," which he defined as "a process where individuals describe experiencing symptoms of various types that are not accompanied by objective findings and interpretations." The doctor stated that he believed Rodriguez was magnifying her symptoms. The trial judge overruled the plaintiff's objections to this testimony. Appellate judges found, however, that this testimony unfairly biased the jury. While the doctor could testify about what he observed in an examination, he  cannot offer opinions about the credibility of another witness, the appellate panel reasoned. "... We conclude that the expert's opinions on symptom magnification were improperly admitted and that plaintiff was sufficiently prejudiced by that ruling to be entitled to a new jury trial on all issues," they wrote.

Don't worry, this will make sense eventually. The U.S. has high corporate taxes compared with other developed countries. That means companies that make most of their money inside the U.S. pay more in taxes than companies that do a lot of business overseas. Play Video CBS This Morning Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Trump's tax plan President Trump says his tax plan is going to put people back to work, but some important details were missing from the one-page blueprint that c... Retailers, utilities, health insurance companies have relatively high tax bills for those reasons, while technology companies, pharmaceuticals makers and energy companies can make a lot more money in other countries. On paper, the top federal corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent. Companies generally don't pay that much, but they can have dramatically different tax bills depending on where they make their money. RETAILERS Take Macy's, Wal-Mart and Nike, all retailers. Macy's, a department store operator, makes all of its revenue in the U.S., according to FactSet, while Wal-Mart gets about a quarter of its revenue outside the U.S. and Nike makes almost 60 percent of its sales in countries other than the U.S. That's one important reason Macy's pays higher taxes. FactSet says that over the last five years, Macy's average effective tax rate, or the percentage of its net income that it pays in state and federal taxes, has been more than 35 percent. Wal-Mart's tax rate was 31.5 percent and Nike's tax bill was around 23 percent. TECH AND DRUG COMPANIES Alphabet, Google's parent company, had an effective tax rate of 19 percent over that five-year period and the rate for IBM was 18 percent. Both companies get most of their revenue outside the U.S. Play Video CBSN How will Trump's tax plan affect the average American? What are the implications for the average American of President Trump's tax proposal? Chicago Booth School of Business Economics Professor and fo... Prescription drug distributor AmerisourceBergen is also entirely U.S.-based, and it had a tax rate that topped 50 percent over that period, but Gilead Sciences, a biotech drug manufacturer that gets a lot of revenue from other countries, paid less than half that much. TAXING BY TERRITORY JPMorgan calculates that most corporations pay a rate closer to 20 percent because of a wide variety of tax credits, tax reduction strategies, and those lower taxes on earnings from outside the U.S. The Trump administration is proposing cutting the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and it wants a "territorial" system where only profits made in the U.S. are taxed. Because of the higher tax rates in the U.S., companies are motivated to say as much of their income is made outside the country as possible. If their products are made in another country, or assembled there, or will shipped there, or if they have a licensing deal with a non-U.S. company, the company may say that income comes from outside the U.S. so it can pay a lower tax rate. Play Video CBSN Reagan economic adviser Arthur Laffer breaks down Trump's tax plan President Trump is promoting his tax proposal as the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Former Reagan economic adviser D... BRINGING IT HOME Companies that earn money overseas don't want to pay the U.S. rates on top of the foreign taxes they've already paid. As a result, money they earn overseas often stays parked in banks and businesses outside the country. Major companies like Apple have billions of dollars sitting outside the country, and the ability to bring that money back to the U.S. without worrying about a big tax bill might be far more significant than a tax cut. "The tax cut is very important for principally domestic companies, but for these multinationals it's not nearly as important as the repatriation opportunity," said Bob Willens, a CPA who teaches a course on corporate tax policy as Columbia Business School. If those companies pay a one-time tax on all of those earnings and then don't have to pay U.S. taxes on the money they make overseas in the future, they could invest in their businesses by buying more equipment, return money to investors by buying more stock and paying bigger dividends, or acquiring other companies. All of those moves could boost stock prices. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Jack Nicholson, 1997. By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were poised to notch a fresh record on Friday, after another blockbuster earnings report, but one analyst firm has popped above the bullish parapet with a downgrade and a warning. Cutting its rating on Amazon shares to sector weight from overweight, Edward Yruma and the team at Pacific Crest said for Amazon AMZN, +0.72% this may be “as good as it gets (for now).” The investment bank has consistently kept its rating at overweight for more than two years — 84% of analysts rate Amazon a buy, with just 16% rating it a hold, according to FactSet Research. The Pacific Crest analysts laid out concerns that the online retailer’s rivals may be gaining on it and suggested it may be time for investors to take profit on the share climb. “Amazon’s [first-quarter] results were impressive. However, the stock is approaching our $961 target, and stepped-up competition may dampen near-term upside,” said Yruma and the team, in a note published Thursday. Check out: MarketWatch’s live-blog recap of Amazon results Shares were up 3.8% in premarket trading on Friday at $952.90, after Amazon reported net income of $724 million, earnings per share of $1.48 and revenue of $35.7 billion. On average, analysts were expecting earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $35.3 billion. Amazon shares have never traded for more than $923.72 in a regular session. Wal-Mart in the wings Picking over the results, Yruma and the team noted that Amazon’s North American operating margin fell 62 basis points on an annual basis, marking the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, growth rates for first-party vendors (identified as “1P”) who sell wholesale to Amazon point to moderating sales growth, they said. The last two quarters of growth dropped below the growth rate for third-party (or “3P”) independent sellers. “Moderating 1P and 3P trends could be a headwind for revenue and profitability growth. We believe that Wal-Mart’s WMT, -0.34% aggressive stance in e-commerce makes it a much more formidable competitor,” said the analysts.

Jack Nicholson, 1997. By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were poised to notch a fresh record on Friday, after another blockbuster earnings report, but one analyst firm has popped above the bullish parapet with a downgrade and a warning. Cutting its rating on Amazon shares to sector weight from overweight, Edward Yruma and the team at Pacific Crest said for Amazon AMZN, +0.72% this may be “as good as it gets (for now).” The investment bank has consistently kept its rating at overweight for more than two years — 84% of analysts rate Amazon a buy, with just 16% rating it a hold, according to FactSet Research. The Pacific Crest analysts laid out concerns that the online retailer’s rivals may be gaining on it and suggested it may be time for investors to take profit on the share climb. “Amazon’s [first-quarter] results were impressive. However, the stock is approaching our $961 target, and stepped-up competition may dampen near-term upside,” said Yruma and the team, in a note published Thursday. Check out: MarketWatch’s live-blog recap of Amazon results Shares were up 3.8% in premarket trading on Friday at $952.90, after Amazon reported net income of $724 million, earnings per share of $1.48 and revenue of $35.7 billion. On average, analysts were expecting earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $35.3 billion. Amazon shares have never traded for more than $923.72 in a regular session. Wal-Mart in the wings Picking over the results, Yruma and the team noted that Amazon’s North American operating margin fell 62 basis points on an annual basis, marking the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, growth rates for first-party vendors (identified as “1P”) who sell wholesale to Amazon point to moderating sales growth, they said. The last two quarters of growth dropped below the growth rate for third-party (or “3P”) independent sellers. “Moderating 1P and 3P trends could be a headwind for revenue and profitability growth. We believe that Wal-Mart’s WMT, -0.34% aggressive stance in e-commerce makes it a much more formidable competitor,” said the analysts. Earlier in April, Wal-Mart began offering discounts on some online orders when customers opt for in-store pickup instead of home delivery, seen as a sign the second-largest online retailer, and the largest retailer in the offline world, is working to compete more aggressively with Amazon. The Pacific Crest analysts also noted that the online retailer’s Amazon Web Services unit, which sells remote computing capacity to businesses, is facing headwinds. “Despite our view that [the AWS unit] can maintain a multiyear lead, cloud competition should intensify through 2017,” they said. Read: Amazon is worth so much because AWS is tech’s true unicorn Microsoft’s MSFT, +0.28% cloud growth picked up to a 52% rate on a year-over-year basis, fueled by 93% annual growth for its Azure unit, the analysts noted. They added that AWS’s growth slowed to 43% on a year-on-year basis, down from a 47% rate in the fourth quarter. Read: Microsoft’s big cloud gains are a bright spot And then, of course, it may be now a question of how greedy investors want to be. Pacific Crest said it is backing off a bit in its own bullishness because shares are now at the target of $961. “Growth or multiple upside are more difficult to justify in the short term,” they said. Do I hear $1,000? The cautious view from Pacific Crest analysts appeared to run against the grain of largely upbeat reactions to Amazon’s latest results that trickled out Friday. Doug Anmuth and the team at J.P. Morgan lifted their price target on the retailer to $1,110 a share from $945, sticking to their overweight rating. Amazon has “more major growth opportunities to invest into than any company we cover,” said Anmuth. “Think fulfillment centers, data centers, video content [and] marketing, India, Echo/Alexa, Prime benefits [and] expansion, plus many others we’re not including here.” Still, even Anmuth was surprised by the 4% jump late Thursday in Amazon’s shares, given they had climbed 22% already in 2017. But this is a company, he said, where you really can’t argue with its track record and opportunities in the pipeline. Moving their own price target above the $1,000 mark, analysts led by Mark S.F. Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets said fundamentals remain very much intact for Amazon as it continues to make aggressive investments. Maintaining an outperform rating, they lifted their price target to $1,100 from $900. Amazon’s two key end markets — retail and cloud computing — are still only around 10% penetrated, while the analysts believe competitive moats around Amazon are deepening, and that the company’s execution seems incapable of stumbling. Amazon “remains arguably the single best play off three of the biggest tech trends today,” said Mahaney, spelling those out as the cloud, artificial intelligence and voice-activated Internet. As for the valuation of a company whose stock has doubled over the last 12 months, Mahaney said Amazon has now seen 19 straight quarters of 20% retail revenue growth, meaning it’s never been more consistent. “And AWS offers a combination of 40% revenue growth, close to 50% EBITDA margins, and a $14 billion plus revenue run-rate that is practically impossible to match in public markets,” he said. In total, at least 15 analysts increased their price targets on the stock. That lifted the average target on the stock to $1,048.16, compared with $956.88 the day prior to the earnings report, according to a FactSet survey of more than 35 analysts. As Amazon shares have advanced 22% in 2017, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19% has gained 6.7%.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Good News for Twitter, Chipotle, and iRobot Investors On this episode of Market Foolery , host Chris Hill is joined by Motley Fool analysts David Kretzmann and Aaron Bush to discuss some of the many companies releasing earnings reports this week. Between Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) , Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) , and iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) , the trio of companies all gave shareholders reasons to smile. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of April 3, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This video was recorded on April 26, 2017. Chris Hill: It’s Wednesday, April 26th. Welcome to Market Foolery ! I’m Chris Hill, joining me in studio today from Rule Breakers and Supernova , David Kretzmann and Aaron Bush. Happy Wednesday, gents! David Kretzmann: Hey, Chris! Aaron Bush: Happy Wednesday. Hill: This is one of those days when we have three companies we’re going to talk about today. We could easily talk about ten other companies. That’s how many companies are reporting today. But, we have to choose, because we’re not doing an hour long show. Kretzmann: We could. I don’t know if anyone would listen. [laughs] Hill: Two things would happen if we did an hour long show. Long-time listeners, to your point, would just cut out, they would just be like, I’m done. Once they hit the 35 minute mark, they’d pull the plug. The other thing is, Kristine Harjes is coming in in a little bit to host Industry Focus , and we don’t want to incur the wrath of Kristine Harjes and the Industry Focus crew. Bush: She’ll boot us out. Hill: So, let’s start with signs of life — I can’t believe I’m saying this — signs of life from Twitter. Shares are up 11% this morning after a first quarter report that included, Aaron, a rise in monthly active users. The revenue fell, for those of you who actually pay attention to money. The revenue fell, but that seems to matter less than the fact that monthly active users are on the rise. Bush: Yeah, I think the 10% pop in the stock today is a little misplaced, in my opinion. I don’t really think it was that great of a quarter, to be honest with you, Chris. I think you could say it was a mixed bag. Revenue was down, margins and cash flow were up, users were up. But ultimately, I do think, when you piece it all together, the news is more bad than it is good. Hill: Wow, really? Bush: I think so. On one hand, it’s clear that Twitter is slowly making changes. They’re slow, they’re ungodly slow when it comes to handling user issues like abuse and improving the actual timeline. But they are improving their cost, free cash flow is growing, the user base is growing, daily active users was up 14% year over year, which is actually pretty great. And I do think that’s because of some of these efforts they put in place from the product perspective. That said, revenue, you can’t just ignore that. That’s huge. It’s down 8% over the last year, and this is the 11th quarter in a row of a deceleration. The first quarter that it’s down. That’s pretty bad. I think the moral of the story here is pretty simple. Twitter’s ads are currently not competitive with Facebook and Google, not even close. And it’s a huge undertaking for them to become competitive. So, you can celebrate all these other wins, but at the end of the day, this is the business. Turning the ship around is still a multi-year process, and the slower they move, the higher the odds of them getting whacked. Hill: So, the people who are on Twitter itself, but also reporting in the media, etc, who are saying, among other things that CEO Jack Dorsey has bought himself some time, this was a good quarter, let’s quiet down the drumbeat of, he needs to choose between being CEO of Twitter and being the CEO of Square . You’re saying „No”. Bush: I think this is beyond him. This is beyond what any one person can change at this point. I do think a lot of the changes that he has put into place have been positive, but revenue, you can’t overlook that. Kretzmann: Yeah, Aaron mentioned the competition from Google and Facebook. As far as digital sales go, those are definitely the big giants in the room. But then, as Twitter is doubling down on its live video strategy, they’re starting to compete more with Snap , which has a very engaged user base. The growth there has slowed a little bit, it’ll be interesting to see what Snap’s metrics look like, and how those compare to Twitter, as far as ad engagement and user growth. But, yeah, it’s not a good combination when you have users going up, but ad revenue going down. And Twitter said they expect that disconnect to continue for the rest of the year. This probably won’t be the last quarter that revenue goes down. In the meantime, their pace of stock-based compensation has receded a little bit, but their diluted share count increased over 1% just from the last quarter. So, in the process, as revenue has completely decelerated and now is declining, their share count has climbed up. So I went back and looked, if Twitter wanted to bring its share count back to the same level it was in 2014, a few months after it went public, they would have to spend $1.9 billion just to get back to that break even level with the share count. What that shows is, the bar that they have to cross at some point to reward shareholders is perpetually getting higher as they continue to dilute shareholders. So, that’s not a good trend to have when your revenue is dropping. Hill: And share-based compensation, that’s one of those things that, if you’re the average investor, it’s understandable if your eyes gloss over, and it’s easy to dismiss it and focus on the more headline-oriented things like revenue and monthly active users. But when we talk about some of these tech companies potentially putting themselves up for sale, you need to recognize that share based compensation is a huge factor in that, the fact that they’re going out and hiring people and convincing them to stay on board and not jump ship, a lot of that has to do with, „Look, we’re going to give you more shares.” Go back and look at LinkedIn being acquired by Microsoft . As much as anything, it was the share-based compensation within LinkedIn that made the leaders of that company go, „We have to figure something out quick.” Kretzmann: Yeah, because that’s one of the main currencies they have for paying their employees. And competition between employers in Silicon Valley is not going to disappear. I think that’s a dangerous thing for Twitter shareholders and something to watch. At first glance, on the balance sheet, it does look pretty strong. We have net cash of $2.2 billion, as Aaron mentioned, you have free cash flow, which is going up, but stock based compensation is still a huge component for that positive cash flow production. So, the balance sheet, to me, is not as strong as it looks on the surface, because $1.9 billion just to break even with your share count two years ago, that takes up most of their net cash today. The investments that they’ve been making up to this point are not paying off. At some point, that trend has to reverse for shareholders to be rewarded. Bush: One other thing that David and I were talking about earlier today is how slow they move, and what that really means when you look long term. I think it’s easy to look at these incremental changes and think about where things should go. But the pace that they move, these larger tech companies like Facebook and Google, they could do it at the snap of a finger, what these guys take six months to do. Hill: I was going to ask you about that. It’s, in some ways, an unfair question because unless you’re spying on headquarters at Twitter, there’s no way for you to have the information to answer this question, but I’m going to ask it anyway. Why do you think that is? I’ve seen you write about this, I’ve seen other people touch on it. The popular image that we have of Silicon Valley is, among other things, it’s a fast culture, it’s a nimble culture. The way things move at Twitter, they might as well be the U.S. Department of whatever. When you think of bureaucracy, you think of Washington D.C. When you think of fast and nimble and cutting-edge, you think of Silicon Valley. Twitter’s lack of speed is really astonishing. Bush: I do think I know one big reason behind it. I think a lot of it stems from the very early days of the company. They never had to struggle to reach product/market fit. So, never in their journey to figure out how to improve what they’re doing, they never had an issue. They just threw something out there and it worked. So then, they just kept on capitalizing on what worked, but never really changed the product itself. Now that they’re up competing against these companies that have been changing their platform at pretty innovative speeds for years now, they’re finding that gap so much larger that it’s just, in comparison, it takes so much more time to get out of. Kretzmann: Yeah, it seems like Twitter just doesn’t have near the focus on the actual product. What is their platform, fundamentally, compared to Snap or Facebook, where you have leaders that are so product-driven, and it drives everything they do. From there, you find the business model that fits. But with Twitter, it seems like they’re very scattered trying to figure out the direction of the company and what their actual product is. Hill: All right, let’s move on to Chipotle. First quarter profits came in higher than expected. Same store sales were up 18%. I realize that is off of, go back a year in time, off a terrible quarter a year ago. Still, it’s nice to see that it’s up 18%. Stock up a little bit, not amazing, although it has risen about 30% in the last six months. So, I don’t know, maybe we shouldn’t expect too much of a pop off of this. Kretzmann: Yeah, I think the key for investors is, the metrics are moving in the right direction. I think you can safely say the turnaround has begun. As long as they can keep moving at this pace, I think good things are ahead for shareholders. But, it will still take time. It’ll probably be at least a year and a half, I think, before we get back to those pre-crisis levels, as far as metrics go. But, yeah, same-store sales up about 18%, their restaurant level operating margins are trending up. This quarter was almost at 18%, but that’s still quite a bit lower than the 28% restaurant level operating margin we saw right before the crisis hit in 2015. All those metrics like restaurant sales, sales as a whole across the company, margins, they’re moving in the right direction, it’s a definitive turnaround from where the company has been going for the past year and a half but still some work to do to get back to those pre-crisis levels. Bush: Yeah, when I was reading through the call, and what they’ve been doing to move back to the levels that they were, I think I was pretty impressed with what they were doing. If you look, for example, at the online sales, that increased 54% over the past year. I know that’s something in the past we’ve talked about. Chipotle is not very good at that compared to others. So, it seems like they’re moving in the right direction. Still have room to improve. They’re revamping their restaurant tour program, which also was a pain point. Hill: Is this the management program? Bush: Yes, this was their management program. Chipotle has always promoted internally. But, if you grow too fast and promote too quickly, that can lead to problems, especially if you incentivize poorly. So, they’ve been doing a lot of work around figuring out what metrics are best to incentivize their managers and field team leaders. It looks like that is improving. Just, how they’re interacting with consumers and turnover of their leaders. That’s good. They also just closed, this quarter, 15 ShopHouse locations. So, they’re moving past that — Kretzmann: Still sad about that, though. Bush: Yeah, it’s unfortunate for those of us, in the past, who were optimistic at some point. But it’s good that they are diverting those resources, now, to higher-impact endeavors. Hill: I’m a Chipotle shareholder. I’m glad they decided to pull the plug on ShopHouse, because I got tired of wondering when they were going to roll it out. The first couple of years, what you heard was a lot of, „They’re taking their time, they’re not going to rush it.” But at some point, you move so slowly that it’s natural to ask the question, „What is wrong with this concept?” Either it’s ready to be rolled out or it’s not. The fact that they said, „We’re packing it in on that, we’re going to focus on the main brand locations and go from there,” I’m glad. Kretzmann: Yeah, and on top of everything else Chipotle was dealing with for the past year, I think trying to work out issues at ShopHouse, it was just becoming a distraction. To me, that really was the theme of this quarter, it was very clear that Chipotle is refocusing. And I think part of that is boosted by Steve Ells taking over the sole leadership role as CEO. Monty Moran, who was co-CEO for a while, retired late last year. So I think you’re seeing that focus from Steve Ells. And in the call, he mentioned revamping that restaurant tour program, as Aaron mentioned. But the focus of that is a „relentless focus on customer experience.” So, sort of a Jeff Bezos-esque comment there, really trying to figure out what the priority is there for their management program. And they mentioned that they now have the lowest turnover with general managers in more than eight years. Hill: That’s great. Kretzmann: Yeah. A lot of things moving in the right direction. I think you’re seeing, internally, a refocus on prioritizing the guest experience. As they get traffic into the stores, their throughput should really be able to increase with digital orders, because they’re starting to launch kitchens in the back of the restaurants specifically for digital. That should theoretically take people out of that front line, more people can go through that front line. The restaurant, in other words, will be able to pump out more burritos, more orders. If they can get that traffic back to pre-crisis levels and hopefully beyond that, these stores could be much more profitable than they were a few years ago, and they were incredibly profitable then. Hill: Yeah. And that is, in some ways, the promise of this investment, if you’re a shareholder or a potential shareholder. Because the headlines have been so bad, and rightly so, for the last couple years. But you go back to 2013 and 2014, and they were putting up these type of same-store sales numbers, not off of a low base, off of a pretty high base. So, when they would come in with double-digit comp increases, that’s just breathtaking. So, the idea that they’re looking at what Panera has been doing and saying, „How can we do that? How can we up the people walking in and picking up their food and walking out? If we can get our throughput even higher, that’s great.” Bush: I think the biggest news out of all of this is they’re going to start testing two new desserts. Hill: [laughs] Is that the big news? What are the desserts they’re testing? Bush: They only announced one of them. It’s called buñuelos. It’s these fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon, and sugar. So, super healthy. Kretzmann: Fits right with their healthy ingredients theme. Hill: I hear that honey is supposed to be healthy, I’ve heard that from time to time. Kretzmann: Cinnamon, I think. Hill: Cinnamon is a spice. Kretzmann: Sugar … Bush: Just ignore that it’s fried. Hill: You know, it’s dessert, it’s not supposed to be healthy if it’s dessert. iRobot shares hitting an all-time high today after first quarter profit more than doubled expectations. Aaron, this is not a beat by a penny type situation, they crushed it. They also raised their guidance for the whole fiscal year. Holy cow. Bush: Roombas are taking over the world. That’s all you can really say. Yeah, they crushed expectations. I think what we’re seeing right now is they’re witnessing an inflection in demand of their Roombas, which is very impressive. Believe it or not, the Roomba last year was the most sold vacuum cleaner in the U.S., in terms of dollars spent. Yeah, wow. To me, that almost feels like the rise of the Roomba occurred somewhat stealthily. Looking at the product compared to past iterations, you really do see the improvements that have been coming through. They work better, they have more connected features, which will play a role more so as the connected homes inevitably start popping up more and more. The Roomba itself, obviously, is killing it. But, beyond the Roomba, there are other products and moves the company has made that also excites investors. The Braava, for one, that’s iRobot’s hardwood cleaner, right now, that’s still a tiny fragment of revenue, but it’s selling well. It also has these wipe consumables that consumers need to buy, so it adds a form of recurring revenue for the company, too, which is always good to see. iRobot just bought back its Asian distributors, which gives it more control in how it sells in that continent. That’s actually a pretty huge deal. I think later this year, we should expect Japan’s growth to accelerate. We’ll see them significantly ramp up business in China. That should be a huge deal. The Braava in particular could sell particularly well because hardwood floors are more of a norm over there. So, really giving that second product they have a huge boost. Then, lastly, the innovation machine that they have just keeps on running. They’re just as much as software company at this point as a vacuum cleaning robot company. So, new robots that perform new tasks, like lawn mowing, whatever else they have in store, should be expected. As time rolls on, these robots are going to do their jobs better and better. I think investors should expect more beats going forward. This is impressive. Hill: I was on their website and saw they also have a robot pool cleaner. I don’t have a pool, but I thought, I would 100% buy one. There are some people who actually enjoy mowing their lawn. I’m not one of them, but there are some people who are like, „It’s relaxing, I’m outside in nature,” that kind of thing. I can’t imagine anyone owning a pool and saying, „Oh, I’m looking forward to a day of Zen and relaxation of cleaning my pool.” No. Buy that thing, set it loose on the bottom of your pool, and you’re done. Kretzmann: I think our digital age has made people lazy enough that iRobot is hitting the inflection point, finally, where people just want to automate everything they can. Hill: Is 100% of their business just consumer? Do they have any sort of business-to-business relationship where they’re going to a hotel chain or something like that and selling them en masse? Kretzmann: I think now that they’re entirely a consumer goods, consumer-facing company. Last year they divested a defense or security division. I think they’re primarily selling to the U.S. military at that point. I think that makes sense, because the consumer market is sizable. In the U.S. alone, robot vacuum cleaners are about 20% of the total vacuum market. Just that robot vacuum cleaner portion, which is growing, is about $6 billion or so. So, there’s a sizable market there. And iRobot really is the dominant brand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. So, I think doubling down and really focusing on that consumer market makes sense for them. Since they divested that security division last year, the stock has done really well. I don’t follow this closely enough I know if those two are completely related, or one caused the other. But to me, it makes sense for them to focus on that consumer market, because I think that’s where the majority of the growth is. Hill: Aaron, the stock is up about 15% today. We love it when a stock hits an all time high. But I have to ask, how expensive is this stock? When you look at it, do you think, „OK, this is great for shareholders, but right now, today, this is kind of a pricey stock?” Bush: It is a pretty pricey stock. I think it’s definitely earned it. Just seeing, today, the stock go up 15%, I think if this company continues to execute the way it has, and if this inflection point is real, then I don’t think it is as pricey as it may seem to a lot of investors. Kretzmann: Yeah, it’s still just a $2 billion company. I could see that bumping up, especially if they could maintain that brand leadership position, which they seem to have carved out pretty nicely.

The Word From the Trenches – April 28, 2017 → Cop Who Broke Elderly Vet’s Ribs, Caught on Video AGAIN, Attacking Innocent Grandpa Posted on April 28, 2017 by # 1 NWO Hatr Free Thought Project – by Jack Burns Buda, TX — For the second time in less than a year, a police officer with the Buda Police Department is being sued for excessive force and violating the civil rights of two elderly citizens. The Free Thought Project brought you the story of 73-year-old veteran Juan Martinez, who was thrown to the ground in a Buda, TX by Officer Demerriel Young in the local Walmart for questioning his authority apparently. This time, he’s being sued for excessive use of force against a senior citizen, in his own home.   Leonard Miguel Garcia, of Buda, was at his home when police arrived to remove his grandchildren from his home, an action which is likely to make anyone become anxious. Police officers DeMerriel Young and Kellie Metz were present and were invited into the home. Young begins to address the situation by advising the children were being removed, apparently taken from the custody of their mother, Mr. Garcia’s step-granddaughter. A family friend, asked the question if the children could be placed into her custody since she said the courts had already approved such an arrangement. Young implied it may be a possibility in the future but for the night the children would be remanded into the care of CPS. It was at that point in the meeting with police Mr. Garcia got up from his couch and removed his overcoat, apparently no longer needing it since the meeting moved from outdoors to indoors. Young demanded Garcia return to his couch, to which he responded, “This is my house!” From Young’s body camera footage it’s not so easily noticed that Garcia was complying with Young’s demands, but from Metz’ body camera angle, it can clearly be seen Garcia was walking back to the couch when Young applied a forearm, driving Garcia into his couch and injuring the man. They also nearly injured one of Garcia’s grandchildren in the process. At this point, Metz joined Young in subduing a man who was, arguably, not resisting arrest and was being fully compliant. The pair began to yell the all too often used, worn out expression, “stop resisting” to somehow imply the elderly gentleman was foolish enough to do so in light of the overwhelming police force and presence in his home. While being manhandled, Garcia began to demand the officers leave if they didn’t have a warrant to be in his home. Metz had been threatening to taser Garcia throughout what appears to be a one-sided physical altercation, with police doing all the physical harm. Apparently, Mr. Garcia’s squirming under the weight of two police officers was enough justification in her mind to go through with tasing Garcia. She deployed the taser, provoking the man to scream loudly as he was under intense pain. Now both officers, the police department, and the city are being sued for violating his Fourth Amendment rights. In an exclusive interview with Garcia’s attorney, Robert Ranco, The Free Thought Project was able to discover there’s much more to the story. We asked Ranco about his client’s state of mind. He said, “What we can glean…[was] he was agitated…but that is a difficult situation that’s a far cry from being somebody about to do something violent against the police officer.” Ranco maintains that while his client was agitated with the presence of police in his home, he wasn’t “ripping his tank top off” ready to fight. He simply stated, “If they’re going to demand entry into a home, they do (need to have a search warrant).” Ranco’s case against the officers is a federal civil rights case and he says, “The part that makes this more interesting it’s that this is the second federal lawsuit I’ve filed against him (officer Demario Young and the City of Buda police department). That fact, alone, ought to raise some red flags,” he suggested. Indeed it is the second time Ranco has sued Young. As we stated earlier, the first incident involved Juan Martinez being thrown to the ground by Young, an action which broke four of his ribs. Ranco elaborated on the first lawsuit. He responded to a call at the Walmart. We’re talking about a disabled man who just stepped out of his scooter. He too was agitated because it was a stressful situation. Officer young said get out of the office or I’ll put you out. Officer Young put his hands on mr. Martinez and slammed him to the ground breaking five ribs…All I know is this is the second civil rights/excessive use of force 4th amendment violation case that’s come across my desk in the last seven months involving the same officer and the same police department. When asked if the police department reprimanded or disciplined Young in either case, Ranco responded, “To the best of my knowledge, no one involved in either incident has been disciplined or reprimanded in any way.” As The Free Thought Project has reported continually, police officers all across the U.S. use excessive force on American citizens. Without video evidence, it’s almost always impossible to prove. Fortunately, there’s body camera footage from this case to help prove the prosecution’s contention a man’s civil rights were violated. “I think the common thread is, in a nutshell, excessive use of force. Neither man was suspected of breaking any law or crime. They were both present and displayed some level of non-compliance…but you can’t jump from there to…(physical takedowns and excessive force),” Ranco said. The lawyer stated there are three conditions which must be met before use of force can be used. The suspect either has to have committed a crime, been posing a threat or were attempting to flee. Ranco contends his client did not do any of those three things. “If somebody is not a threat to somebody, you can’t use that level of force…putting hands on someone without first trying to de-escalate is just wrong,” he said. Ranco defended his client’s demands for the law to be followed. He said the simple request his client made seemed legitimate. “Show me a warrant or get out of my house seems like a reasonable demand of any police officer,” he contended. The lawyer has some harsh criticisms for the officers’ claims his client was resisting arrest. “I think it’s falsifying a public record and charges should be brought against an officer who says ‘stop resisting’ when they’re obviously not resisting,” he charged. He then added, “Mr. Garcia was in fact on his way back to the couch when officer Young puts his forearm into the back of Mr. Garcia forcing him down to the couch.” Addressing the similarities in the cases involving both of his clients, Martinez and Garcia, Ranco said, “There were no crimes that they themselves were suspected of having committed. There was no reason to think they were a threat to anybody. They were not fleeing the scene. “What the officer should have done in each situation was to say, ‘I understand you’re upset, lets’ talk about it.’ When there are alternatives to using force police officers have to use those options before they go down the road of using force.” We discussed the unspoken rule that some officers seem to live by — all individuals must comply with police officer demands — 100 percent of the time. Ranco seems to understand, saying, “What we see too often and what it brings to mind is the caricature of Eric Cartman of Southpark Respect my authority’. It’s hilarious when you’re not on the other end of that. This is the mindset that actual police officers have on the street and utilize and that’s terrifying. It’s funny in a cartoon but not in the real world.” He added that he feels incredibly frustrated when the police simply won’t accept responsibility for their actions. The outspoken lawyer recently made headlines for offering to give up his six-figure fee for representing his client. All the authorities would have to do is simply apologize to his client. They couldn’t. So, he doesn’t’ let up. “How hard is it just to admit you make mistakes. How do you get better if you don’t admit what you did yesterday was wrong.” Well, Mr. Ranco, that would be a sign of weakness to police officers to admit they made a mistake. We see it in the case of Melissa Calusinski and others. They would rather send an innocent person to prison than admit they might have it all wrong.

Police in Tennessee say investigators believe bounty hunters shot two men in a wild incident last weekend that began in a Wal-Mart parking lot, fatally wounding one of them, but that neither was the person they were trying to serve with a warrant. Clarksville Police will ask a grand jury in Montgomery County on Monday to bring charges from the shooting, police spokesman Jim Knoll said. Police are also asking questions about who is regulating bounty hunters. Authorities released few details about Sunday's shooting before the case heads to the grand jury. The man who died has been identified as 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three children from Clarksville. His family says Johnson was an innocent man gunned down in a case of mistaken identity. "Absolutely, they were out of control," Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, said of the bounty hunters. "The objective of a bounty hunter is to identify a suspect and serve them with a warrant and bring them to jail, but that's not what happened." Knoll said the bounty hunters confronted four men in a Nissan sedan parked at a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Clarksville just after midnight Sunday. Shots were fired and bounty hunters then chased the men for nearly seven miles, he added. The police spokesman wouldn't say how many bounty hunters were involved, when the shots were fired and what exactly transpired in the parking lot. It's not clear why the bounty hunters confronted the men in the vehicle. Not one of them, Knoll said, had an outstanding warrant. Jenkins said the men in the car with his nephew Jalen Johnson had no idea who the people in the cars were, adding they drove into the Wal-Mart parking lot and blocked in their car. "They just thought they were some gang or something," Jenkins said. One of the bounty hunters smashed out a window in the car, the uncle said. The vehicle, where Johnson was a passenger in the back seat, took off because the men were afraid, he said. The uncle said the bounty hunters started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire while they were chasing the Nissan with Johnson and his three friends in it. "They were shooting and ramming the car and everything," Jenkins said. Clarksville Police would not say whether there was a high-speed chase involving gunfire and a vehicle being rammed. But authorities said they are very troubled by what happened and the risk to the men in the vehicle and to the public. "Any time you start firing off bullets and chasing people you're putting the public in danger, no matter who it is," Knoll said. Clarksville is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Nashville near the Tennessee line with Kentucky.

But some visionary companies have been quietly putting drones to work in the warehouse—with impressive results. By Ben Ames Comment Warehouses are noisy places, with conveyors, cranes, and forklifts shuttling items, cases, and pallets in and out of storage. But the next time you hear a persistent buzz in a busy DC, look up—the sound may not be coming from the material handling equipment, but from a flying drone. Drones used in logistics usually make the headlines only when they involve deliveries to consumers. Recent examples include Amazon Prime Air's delivery of a bottle of sunscreen to an Amazon-hosted conference in Palm Springs, Calif., and the dropoff of an Amazon Fire streaming device and bag of popcorn to a residence in the British countryside. UPS Inc. also made the news when it whisked an asthma inhaler to an island in Boston Harbor, as did Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, when it (literally) dropped off burritos from a Chipotle restaurant to hungry students at Virginia Tech's Blacksburg campus. Despite those high-profile successes, parcel delivery drones face many hurdles before they can transition from trials to widespread use. Limits on battery life and payload weight still restrict the distance they can travel and the size of the packages they can carry. Strict government regulations and public safety concerns have made many companies wary of investing in broader drone programs until the picture clears up. In the meantime, some see a very different future for drones in logistics—one where the flying bots are used for collecting data instead of delivering parcels. Attach a small camera to a drone and it can send wireless video back to users, allowing them to count inventory, patrol boundaries, or locate trucks. Without the burden of a payload, the lightweight drones can hover for hours over small areas like truck yards or inside giant warehouses, proponents say. And by avoiding flights that cross public roads and buildings, drones can dodge many of the toughest safety restrictions that now inhibit their use (such as rules requiring them to stay in sight of a human pilot and to avoid private property). VIEW FROM ON HIGH Transportation and logistics giant UPS Inc. has already run trials that involve flying drones inside its DCs. The airborne vehicles can perform inventory counts in cavernous warehouses faster than a worker could on foot, and they can verify the quantity or identity of goods on high shelves without the safety risks that come with sending an employee up on an elevated platform, a UPS spokesman said. Retail powerhouse Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has also been experimenting with indoor drones. It recently applied for a U.S. patent on a system that would leverage both their data collection and delivery capabilities by using drones to locate and drop off merchandise within its giant retail stores, a company spokesman confirmed. Intended to cut the amount of time customers spend waiting for their goods, Wal-Mart's patent application describes a process in which a store employee would dispatch an airborne drone to fetch an item located within that store and bring it to a waiting customer. To avoid having drones flying over the heads of nervous shoppers, the system would configure the flight path so they fly over shelves, not aisles. Other logistics-related opportunities include using drone cameras to scan buildings for safety and security purposes, inspect lots and yards, track the location of trucks as they approach the dock, and locate trucks in a staging area when it's their turn to load, said Bruce Bleikamp, a sales manager for Cimcorp, a manufacturer and integrator of automated robotic solutions. "Sometimes drivers get tired of waiting and they just leave," he said. "Say you told the guy to go park in slot #67 at the end of the row, but then when you go back to get him, he's not there. Now you could dispatch a drone to fly over the area and locate him, so you could have somebody go knock on his window and tell him to get back here." Alternatively, a DC manager could dispatch a drone equipped with a camera to hover over a fourth- or fifth-level rack in a high-bay warehouse and perform a quick inventory count, eliminating the need to send a lift truck to the location, pull the pallet down to ground level, and have someone conduct a manual inspection, Bleikamp said. Although not yet in widespread use, these applications demonstrate the potential of drones to save precious time in logistics operations. The technology still has a ways to go, Bleikamp said, but adoption rates could soar as vendors address limitations such as the inability of drone-mounted cameras to see inventory stacked in multiple rows, like goods in a push-back or flow-through rack. CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF? As for the market outlook for drones in logistics-related applications, Bob Etris, for one, is decidedly bullish. Etris, who is a partner and director at Evans Inc., a Falls Church, Va.-based consulting firm, said this niche market is growing fast and has a great deal of potential. That's partly because regulations are looser on private property—such as a warehouse—than in public airspace, he said. Right now, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules still apply, particularly if a warehouse is close to an airport or other "controlled airspace" that is tightly managed for aviation safety. But even those rules are expected to change within the next 18 to 36 months, as federal regulators begin easing restrictions on drone use for applications such as search and rescue operations or locating fugitives. Once those changes take effect, the market for drones in business applications could really take off, Etris said. FAA figures indicate that drone use is already picking up steam. Drone demand is still driven by hobbyists flying small models of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)—the government term for flying drones—with the market predicted to grow from about 1.1 million vehicles in 2016 to more than 3.5 million units by 2021, according to the agency's "Aerospace Forecast - Fiscal Years 2017 to 2037." But commercial drones—the type that would be used for logistics applications—are closing the gap. The commercial, non-hobbyist UAS fleet is forecast to grow from 42,000 at the end of 2016 to a conservative target of 442,000 aircraft by 2021 or a high-end target of 1.6 million aircraft. That broad range of target estimates reflects uncertainty about the regulatory environment, the FAA says. The higher estimate would only apply if lawmakers decide to ease restrictions such as the rules that allow operation only within daytime hours and within the operator's line of sight. Loosen those regulations, Etris says, and the market could explode. "The barriers to entry are far [lower] than most people think," he said. "It's not terribly difficult to set one of these up." Industry figures support those growth predictions. A recent survey conducted by the trade group MHI across 1,100 manufacturing and supply leaders showed that the use of autonomous vehicles and drones (which were grouped together for survey purposes) would nearly quadruple over the next five years—going from just 8 percent of respondents today to 31 percent. The study, titled "The 2017 MHI Annual Industry Report—Next-Generation Supply Chains: Digital, On-Demand, and Always-On," also found that more than half of the respondents (54 percent) believed driverless cars and drones had the potential to transform supply chains and create competitive advantage. Vendors also see clear skies ahead for the wider adoption of drones in logistics. Drone providers such as Pinc Solutions, Verizon's Skyward division, and Intelligent Flying Machines Inc. (IFM) have seen a steady increase in the number of warehouses that are looking to experiment with drones. IFM, for example, says it can perform automated inventory counts for an entire warehouse within 20 minutes, ensuring accuracy by connecting the system to the facility's warehouse management software. Between rising market demand, loosening government regulations, and a growing ecosystem of vendors, the case for deploying drones in the warehouse is building quickly. Experts like Evans' Etris advise any company that operates DCs to keep an eye on trade shows and industry publications to keep up with changes in drone technology and regulation. If the forecasts are right, advances in those areas could unleash flocks of flying drones into a warehouse near you soon. #Automatic Data Capture #Logistics About the Author Ben Ames Senior Editor Ben Ames has spent 20 years as a journalist since starting out as a daily newspaper reporter in Pennsylvania in 1995.

The investor Mr. Byrne started investing around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. “I really had no idea what I was doing and got burned a few times,” he remembers. “But I loved the process and kept at it.” How he invests Mr. Byrne is intrigued with investing in underappreciated companies, particularly those that have good growth prospects. When expectations are low, “you often get some nice gains on even minor good news,” he declares. One of his largest positions is Shopify, a provider of cloud-based commerce platforms for small and medium-sized businesses. It is Mr. Byrne’s most successful investment to date and he plans on holding it for years to come. “Obviously, e-commerce and online shopping is a huge secular trend and I was looking for a way to get exposure to that but felt Amazon had already had a huge run,” Mr. Byrne says. “I was looking for something different.” He found it in Shopify. Its revenue increased 90 per cent in 2016 and Mr. Byrne sees strong growth continuing in years ahead as more merchants sign up to use its platform and as recent partnerships with Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and others bear fruit (the collaborations let Shopify clients sell products on their websites). Mr. Byrne likes how Shopify’s stock “keeps surging even without a lot of the media coverage that high-flying tech stocks like this would usually garner.” He expects a fresh wave of interest in the company when it “catches the eyes of people like the hosts on CNBC.” Best move “My best investment move of all time was investing in Shopify when it was in the high $20s and sticking with it through a few early declines,” Mr. Byrne reports. The price is now above $70 (on the U.S. stock market). Worst move “Investing in a ‘hot’ new company in China that later was exposed as a fraud and went to zero.” Advice “I would tell other investors, especially younger ones, to jump in and just get started,” he advises. “Get started early while time is on your side and you have many years of compounding gains ahead of you.” Want to be in Me and My Money?

(Peter Balonon-Rosen/Indiana Public Broadcasting) Alex Rodriguez dials an unfamiliar number on his cell phone. “Yes?,” a voice on the other end answers. On speakerphone, the phone booms inside Rodriguez’s parked silver Ford Escape. “This is Alex,” Rodriguez says. “I’m on the way to your home so that I can complete the enrollment for the kids.” An estimated 3 million migrant workers travel the nation each year, following work. Depending on the season, Indiana farms employ between 2,000 and 20,000. And like anyone in the nation under 22, migrant workers and children are entitled by law to an education. And that’s where Rodriguez comes in. He serves Indiana’s southwest region as one of Indiana’s six migrant education recruiters. His mission is simple: Find, recruit and enroll migrant children and workers for public school services. Despite The Odds, Indiana Teaches Migrant Children And WorkersAnyone under 22 qualifies for the Indiana’s migrant education program if they or their family has moved for seasonal field or farmwork, regardless of citizenship.Download Today he sets out from a Wal-Mart parking lot in Vincennes. It’s the closest thing he has to an office. He often parks here and finds prospective students. After all, he says, everyone comes to Wal-Mart. “Just a minute ago, there was a bus full of migrant workers from Mexico,” Rodriguez says with a laugh, as he pulls away. “I didn’t know they were here.” The Indiana Department of Education runs a program specifically aimed at educating migrant workers and children. It operates across the state. Anyone under 22 qualifies for the public service if they or their family has moved for seasonal field or farmwork. Regardless of citizenship. “If it’s a youth 18 or older, maybe by themselves or a group of them, I usually think about English classes and some vocational programs that we have,” Rodriguez says. “If it’s a family I think about the program for the kids.” To actually enroll children means tracking people down. Julie Delosantos listens as Alex Rodriguez asks questions to fill out paperwork for the Indiana Migrant Education program. (Peter Balonon-Rosen/Indiana Public Broadcasting) Inside the house Julie Delosantos rents, Rodriguez organizes his paperwork. For three years, the Delosantos family has moved from Texas to Indiana, following work. “Do I need to fill out something for the baby?” Delosantos asks. Delosantos has three children. Bella, her 1-year-old, is in Indiana for the first time. “First move?” Rodriguez asks. “For her,” Delosantos replies. Rodriguez is here to sign up Bella for preschool and offer help to enroll the older children in local schools. He verifies the family’s information, moving fluidly between English and Spanish. “When you moved to work with the watermelons did you have specific [work] in mind?” Rodriguez asks. He jots down the family’s responses with a blue pen and gets Delosantos’ signature. “I have some books for you,” Rodriguez says. “It’s important for the parents to be reading to the kids so they can start getting to know what the books are.” He hands over three books – items hard for migrant workers to travel with. And then it’s back on the road. Alex Rodriguez, left, holds an informal meeting in a Wal-Mart parking lot with Debbie Gries, education coordinator for the Indiana Migrant Regional Center. (Peter Balonon-Rosen/Indiana Public Broadcasting) It’s not just workers’ children Rodriguez enrolls in school – it’s workers themselves, too. That means heading to the workers’ camps near local farms in Oaktown, Indiana. The current political climate, however, makes things tricky. “I might have cases that workers coming directly from Mexico not wanting to talk to me because they were instructed not to talk to any government people,” Rodriguez says. Rodriguez wins trust, though. On any given day he brings food and clothes to workers and families. He helps people get medical attention. “This is not part of my job,” Rodriguez says. “But it’s part of the services that can be provided to the migrant families.” And it pays off. Sitting next to the worker camp for Melon Acres farm in Oaktown, an RV gleams in the early evening sun. It’s owned by the Indiana Department of Education and now serves as a mobile classroom for the migrant education program. As Rodriguez steps inside, he’s immediately welcomed with a surge of greetings. “Hola!” students say. “Hola, profe!” Pablo Cervantes Diaz. (Peter Balonon-Rosen/Indiana Public Broadcasting) Young men, clad in dusty coats and weathered hats, gather in the classroom after a long day in the fields. They hunch over assessments to determine which class they will be in. The first thing many want to learn? The English names of the crops they pick. Pablo Cervantes Diaz is one such students. He came to the U.S. from Mexico on a temporary work visa. Just like his father did. And then, here on this farm, he saw his father again – for the first time in 15 years. Diaz says he’s grateful for this school program, one of six migrant programs in Indiana. He hopes it will lead to better opportunities for him and his future family. Topics Comments Michael Starks He should talk to public libraries about bookmobiles and summer reading programs.

If you are, you may have already received a call from your insurer offering you home visit or assessment. By now, you have heard from many sources, including SMP, how important it is not to give your personal information out over the phone and to be leery of any unsolicited home visits. This still stands true; however, be aware that legitimate calls from you Medicare Advantage plan may be coming your way. It will be up to you as to whether you accept their offer of a visit. Regardless of whether you’re comfortable accepting a home visit from your plan, it’s wise to stick to the script of never giving out personal information over the phone. If you are unsure of whether something is a scam, call your local SMP at 1-800-551-3191. Fraud Alert We received a report from a beneficiary in Spokane who received a call purportedly from Social Security. The “Social Security” representative was very persistent, and asked her for “that old number that you got when you were a kid.” Never give your information out over the phone. For calls like this it is best to have a script ready that states, “I’m sorry, I don’t give out information like that over the phone.” Even if you feel it’s legitimate, let the person know you’re going to hang up and call them back so you can confirm they are who they say they are. What you don’t need to tell them is that instead of calling them back at the number they give you, look up or have someone else look up the official government number. The blue pages in the phone book or a quick Google search will give you an official government phone number to call back. You would report the incident and give them the phone number you were given. If this is a scam, which it would be because Social Security and Medicare would never call you for your personal information, you should report it to the SSA Fraud Hotline at 1-800-269-0271. —— Senior Medicare Patrol is a program coordinated by Missoula Aging Services and partnered with local Area Agencies on Aging.

At Blueprint Robotics in Baltimore, she works in a factory that builds houses like cars, on an assembly line, using robots that fire thousands of nails into studs each day and never miss. Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they’ll be pieced together. “I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,” said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May. For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies such as Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labor shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International Inc., the world’s biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties. To meet growing demand, high-tech plants are opening, and older factories that were shuttered after the last decade’s real estate crash — many in areas such as rural Pennsylvania, where labor costs are cheap — are being revived. Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens. “This has to be the wave of the future — I don’t know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,” said John Burns, an Irvine, California-based homebuilding consultant. “What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.” Most Popular 1 Photos: College night riles up NIOSA 2017 2 Battle of Flowers parade takes over downtown San Antonio for... 3 Houston Rockets fans launch salty Twitter trash talk ahead of... U.S. homebuilders say the labor crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it’s pushing costs up as much as 5.2 percent on average over 12 months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Donald Trump’s proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, one heavily dependent on immigrant labor. Confidence among U.S. homebuilders cooled in April after jumping a month earlier to the highest level since mid-2005, according to data released Monday by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com. Today’s plants are capable of producing bigger buildings with more elaborate designs. The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the U.S. to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions. “Some builders won’t even advertise they work with modular companies like us,” said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft Corp.’s Pennsylvania construction facility. “You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.” Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs. The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, California, with 97 rooms — all built at a Guerdon Enterprises plant in Boise, Idaho. Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pennsylvania. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, next month. “What we like is how well modular is built,” Khalifa said. “These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.” Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tennessee, said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes’ commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50 percent since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said. Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion’s modular division. Workers make about $15 to $20 an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with $50 to $100 an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York’s Hudson Valley, and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said. Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can’t be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet. Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said. “The house is 60 percent complete when it arrives, and that means 60 percent of the headaches of building are gone,” Megna said. For less expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There’s also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry’s oldest relative. “Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like ‘This is nice for a trailer,’” said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. “Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.” There doesn’t seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is “booming at moment,” with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50 percent from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom. “Coming out of the recession, the labor pool is just lacking,” Cooper said. “Kids are not going to construction trade school any more — they’re all playing on their computers.” That isn’t necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, CEO of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He’s even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company’s German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley. “Robots cut the hole,” he said. “But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.” Instead of displacing workers — a usual side effect of automation — Blueprint’s machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn’t otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling center with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee — no hard hat needed — uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do. Yarborough said she’s not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free, six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults. “I’m more interested in the engineering side,” she said, adding that she’d like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. “I want to end up upstairs.” Interactive Data Median Home Sale Prices in San Antonio Metro, TX | FindTheHome Inside Real Estate Robots may help build your next home — and fill the labor gap A haunted house for sale in Mineral Wells comes with nine ghosts 6 Signs you’re addicted to home improvement projects Houston firm buys land next to Alamodome Single-family homes just listed for sale in San Antonio San Antonio home sales keep rising, but at slower pace in March Texas looking for a builder to redevelop G.J.

You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more!

There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop.

Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it.

It began with an assignment to unpack what it meant now that there is a new U.S. Secretary of Agriculture taking office, and turned into a little more. As I listened to Sonny Purdue tick off that what was important to him in an address after he took office this week, it became clear very early on this was not necessarily a man after Donald Trump’s rhetorical heart: International trade? He’s all for it. So in an attempt to get a little more perspective I called Denver-based colleague Burt Rutherford, a journalist covering beef suppliers for publications under our common corporate parent. That turned into an enlightening conversation for both of us. After getting his take on Perdue – in short, agriculture is strongly behind the appointment and is hopeful that the president’s seeming hostility to trade is just a lot of bluster because they feel Perdue is genuine in his support – our talk turned to the beef industry supply itself, which for the past year has been at the heart of stubborn retail deflation that’s done a number on supermarkets. Rutherford told me the price decreases in beef likely have less to do with a strong U.S. dollar pressuring exports than it does with an industry overcorrection from what he termed historic shortages of supply that drove higher prices and profits for everyone earlier this decade. Basically, there are more cows going to market today than there were a few years ago, and as Rutherford explained, “in a commodity market it’s just not reasonable to expect you’ll be profitable every year.” Good ranchers, like good retailers, have learned to invest the profits from the good years into their businesses to ride out the tougher ones, and the price of burger meat in your stores – and if you’re good, how much more you’re selling today – is evidence of that. The production cycle, by the way, tends to adjust gradually, he added. The good news is there’s evidence of such today in increasing numbers of heifers being held back to breeding herds rather than going to market. You can take in Burt’s version of our talk here. A peek into the distant future The company is called “code eight,” and you’ll just have to wait and see what it does.  That’s the word from Wal-Mart Stores’ new retail tech incubator, which this week announced it was establishing its first portfolio company to be headed by Jenny Fleiss, a co-founder of the groundbreaking Rent the Runway business. Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore earlier this year announced the formation of the incubator – called “Store No. 8” after a Walmart location in Arkansas where founder Sam Walton was known to experiment. Spokesman Ravi Jariwala explained to me that Store No. 8 and its portfolio companies are concerned with nascent technologies and capabilities that won’t be ready for five or seven years at least. That’s important, though, because it allows the bulk of the organization to maintain distraction-free focus on what it does every day.  “One of the things Walmart does really well is execute at scale every day, and in order to do that at our size, it takes a lot of focus,” Jariwala explained. “It is therefore difficult to maintain focus on that everyday execution and at the same time have dedicated focus and attention on all the innovations that are not yet right for today. What are the things coming over the horizon?” As for code eight, Jariwala would only share that it will focus on “highly personalized, one-to-one shopping experiences.” We’ll check back on this one, personally, in 2022. Whole Foods may remain single, too Reaction to Whole Foods Markets’ fate in the aftermath of the Jana Partners investment continues to pour in faster than I can include it in stories. To the extent a consensus point of view is developing, I’d say very little has changed with regard to an understanding of the company’s challenges; where things are all over the place is in imagining the ways in which Whole Foods could address them, with some observers arguing for the potential of hooking up with a parent (Kroger, Albertsons and Amazon have been mentioned recently but does anyone remember chasing down the Publix rumors a couple years ago?). Others, like Jay Jacobowitz, a natural industry consultant with Retail Insights, argued eloquently this week that Whole Foods would be best off working out its troubles alone.  “The goal of 1,200 stores, always puffery, has been set aside, and new store development now has necessarily slowed. With as long as it took Whole Foods’s management to acknowledge and act on this reality, you can see why Jana entered the picture,” Jacobowitz told me this week. “But I don’t see a Kroger, say, being able to fix Whole Foods’ strategic problem: how to retain its premium market position while taking costs out of the system. You can streamline, centralize, reduce labor in store, but not without threatening Whole Foods’ fundamental point of differentiation: an uplifting, inspiring, flattering, informative and delicious shopping experience. “But, if I’m Whole Foods’ management, I have to try,” Jacobowitz added.  TAGS: Retail & Financial 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

BRANDON Related News/Archive Amazon launches one-hour restaurant delivery service in Tampa 6 Months Ago HSBC laying off 357 employees in Brandon 3 Weeks Ago Starbucks rolls out 'unity' cup ahead of Election Day 6 Months Ago There was only one reason why Edelseiln Vargas would travel to his neighborhood Walmart Supercenter after 10 p.m. on a Wednesday. His 7-month-old son was out of diapers and Walmart is always open, he said. But the days of 24-hour shopping at the Brandon store on Causeway Boulevard ended last month, days before Vargas moved back to Heather Lakes after a four-year stay in Puerto Rico. When a sign at the entrance let Vargas know that his purchases must now be made between 6 a.m. and midnight, he ditched the typical packs of 29 Huggies for a cardboard box stuffed with 172. "This store is way different than before. It's getting really crowded and the lines inside are crazy long," Vargas said as he hauled his bags to his truck in the packed parking lot. "I work the late night shift, and 12-hour shifts, so now I'll have to really think ahead about stocking up." The Causeway Boulevard store isn't the only Walmart to stop staying open all night. The day the Brandon store switched to new hours, March 11, so did the Port Richey store on U.S. 19. The retail giant began rolling back operating hours in 2015, when 64 former 24-hour stores nationwide switched to the 6 a.m. to midnight schedule. Company officials declined to release the number of stores that have made the switch since 2015, but headlines suggest the chain's 3,500 supercenters are the most affected. Stores in Alabama, Illinois and Missouri are among those switched in the last three months. The move was motivated by a study of customer shopping patterns, analyzing which hours and locations saw the most traffic, said Ragan Dickens, Walmart's national media relations director. Now, employees at stores like the Brandon supercenter will spend the hours between midnight and 6 a.m. restocking shelves, cleaning aisles and making other enhancements to "improve customers' experience," Dickens said. "We're not doing away with 24-hour stores completely," he said. "It's strictly a location by location situation." The new schedule comes in the wake of company-wide efforts to freshen its image. Walmart raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016, has added high-quality organic produce to grocery sections and has begun testing a new barcode-scanning technology. The reduction of overnight hours should also help the company combat the retail thefts that have plagued stores in recent years. A Tampa Bay Times report last May found local law enforcement responded to nearly 16,800 calls in one year to Walmarts in Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco and Hernando counties, or about two calls an hour, every hour, every day. In 2014, the year analyzed for the report, the Causeway Boulevard store had the highest volume of calls in the Brandon area: 543. Earlier this year, the staff at the store began blocking off some departments at night, fashioning a barricade with shopping carts and mesh fencing around the cosmetics and jewelry aisles. Any customer wanting to purchase something from those shelves had to be escorted into the section by an employee. The barricades disappeared once the store began closing at midnight. But freshening produce may be easier than freshening an image that sometimes includes patrol cars, homeless people camped out in the parking lot and loitering teens blasting music. The Causeway Boulevard location is an easy drive for Richard and Irene Macri, but they say they prefer driving to other Walmart stores or a nearby Target for nighttime shopping. "I just don't feel safe coming here late at night," she said. HCSO records show a decline in law enforcement involvement. Spokeswoman Cristal Nunez said deputies responded to 681 calls at the store in 2015, 432 calls in 2016 and 131 from January 1 to April 24. Calls in recent weeks include complaints of shoplifting, car theft, drug paraphernalia, counterfeiting, credit card fraud and felony criminal mischief. "No retailer is immune to the challenge of crime," Dickens said of retail theft. "We recognize the importance of this issue at the highest levels of the company, and we are investing in people and technology to support our stores." In August 2016, the company began a restorative justice program in more than 1,500 stores, offering "first-time, low-risk" shoplifters the chance to attend educational courses in lieu of prosecution. Nationwide, Walmart has seen a 35 percent decrease in the number of calls made to law enforcement agencies, Dickens said. Since Jan. 1, stores in the Tampa Bay market have seen a 60 percent reduction in calls, he said. Employees are also receiving additional training in "asset protection" and the company has hired 9,000 additional "customer hosts" to stand at supercenter entrances to check receipts and deter crime, Dickens said. "We'll continue our outreach to law enforcement across the country," he said, "as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customers' and associates' expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience."

(WFLA) – It’s video you have to see to believe, a man at the self-checkout counter of a Winter Haven Walmart.  When he realized the machine was giving back extra cash –  he got his entourage involved. In less than thirty minutes, eight people, including children, walked away with almost $1,100. Now, Winter Haven Police are looking for those involved. It all started with a simple purchase. A man with a large tattoo covering his right shoulder, bought and paid for his items. But, when he realized the machine gave him a twenty instead of a five, he walks out of the camera’s view and apparently alerts his friend, who then walks up to the same self-checkout stand and does the exact same thing. “Immediately, you see them start to come in one by one. Grabbing one item, whether it’s a cold drink or a candy bar or pack of gum,” said Jamie Brown, the Public Information Officer for the Winter Haven Police Department. Detectives believe as many as eight accomplices were involved. “They put in enough money in order to force the machine to give them a five dollar change-out. However, that five dollar change ended up being twenty dollars,” said Brown Seeing the kids in action makes parents like Veronika Hodges cringe. “That’s terrible. To get young children involved in that? You can’t do that.” Parent, Solimar Ortiz says they’re setting a bad example for the kids involved. “If it happened to me… I worked retail and sales, I would give it back.” As for charges, besides theft, the adults are also possibly facing charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The store finally saw the error and realized the $20 bills were put in the slot where the $5 bills should go. Footage from the parking lot shows the culprits arrived in two separate vehicles, a black four-door car and a silver or gray four-door vehicle. There are two young boys with the group, one appears to be 5 years old, the other is around 10. There was also a teenage girl between the age of 13 and 15.

The scale of entities such as Google, Facebook, Walmart, and GE have made them appear almost stateless as they operate on a global playground. But these stateless superpowers are also primarily American companies facing new pressures that will impact their global strategies. First, US president Donald Trump’s intimidation of American business to near-shore production, coupled with border adjustment taxes and other protectionist measures, will likely invite retaliatory measures from other countries, most prominently China. This could raise costs and erode profits for multinationals across the board, especially those invested in complex global supply chains. Second, governments are stepping in to regulate global platform firms such as Uber and Airbnb who have either flouted or exploited the lack of relevant regulation thus far, with local industry groups and lobbies rebelling to curtail their unlicensed and non-taxed profit making. Even incumbent information behemoths such Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook are taking flack from all directions: Trump is pushing them to repatriate an estimated $1.5 trillion held offshore, Europe is litigating against their monopolies, privacy policies and cost-free republishing of news, and China strengthening its firewalls and local data storage requirements. Moving forward, the fate of these stateless superpowers will be be much more complex than the road taken to their current scale. Contrary to the prevailing view that America’s global firms will cave to White House pressure, the opportunities presented by global markets—even fragmented ones—will push them to “go local” everywhere, anchoring themselves in each market to comply with domestic requirements. They will reorganize to become, in effect, holding companies or federations of internationally distributed firms. Uber is an unfolding case study of perpetual local adaptation. In China, Uber entered a sale-cum-merger with Didi Chuxing to stem its losses and raise capital for global investment, while in other countries, it responds differently to national requirements around driver registration and data-sharing. Data nationalism is having a significant impact and tech companies will have to bend to the strong-arming of foreign governments on matters such as source code (which IBM has provided to China), or hosting more data onshore. As Amazon and Microsoft compete for the cloud market worldwide, their degree of compliance with foreign data regulations may determine victory in each battleground. America, quite frankly, is a late comer to the new industrial policy landscape in which emerging markets have become increasingly sophisticated players. Trump’s trade and regulatory proposals invite a multi-directional reciprocity, a heightened tug-of-war over global value chains. As manufacturing is near-shored back to America, the large export markets on which these companies depend for revenue and profits—and on which their share price at home depends—will continue to use non-tariff barriers to ensure that what is sold in their markets is increasingly made on their home turf as well. Indeed, inspired by China’s decades-long success as the world’s factory floor, the #MakeInIndia campaign has forced America’s largest defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin into joint ventures in order to gain lucrative contracts. It has also raised the bar for Apple to be granted permission to open flagship stores in the country. Meanwhile, China’s Xiaomi and India’s MicroMax are gaining ground across Asia. Make no mistake of Asia’s intentions: Soon Western companies will seek to be part of Chinese and Indian supply chains rather than the reverse. This is what chip makers such as Qualcomm are already focused on. There are other repercussions of an increasingly fragmented regulatory landscape that are driving companies to re-root themselves abroad, in search of greener pastures, as it were. After the US Congress failed to renew the Export-Import Bank charter in 2015, GE shifted several hundred turbine manufacturing jobs to France while gaining regulatory approval to buy Alstom’s power division. GE’s focus now varies across continents, with different geographies emphasizing manufacturing, energy and software systems. Emerging financial centers such as Singapore and more recently Dubai are increasingly aggressive in courting financial services and tech companies to establish joint ventures in their favorable jurisdictions. Firms may also be motivated by more progressive or experimental regulatory frameworks. Domino’s Pizza, for example, has started testing aerial pizza delivery via drones in New Zealand, in partnership with drone operator Flirtey. These two US companies have their eyes fixed on seven non-US markets with more favorable drone regulations. Amazon has similarly chosen the UK to test delivery drones. Emerging markets are also finding ways to crack down on multinational transfer pricing as vociferously as the US Congress and regulators seek to crack down on inversions. From India to Indonesia, governments have ramped up audits, raised capital gains taxes, and demand country-by-country reporting on profits and tax payments in order to strengthen local presence. In almost all cases, companies comply to retain access to fast-growing markets. In effect, host governments want foreign investors to act like private equity firms that capitalize local companies and operate through joint ventures or special purpose vehicles whereby cash is held onshore for longer. Indeed, in the long run, the fragmentation of regulation likely implies the morphing of global companies themselves into new governance and operating structures. One possible model is to have the company organized as affiliated networks of independently operating, locally registered, privately held partnership structures to avoid anti-foreign backlash. We are entering an important phase where the choices of regulators will determine the geography of business and innovation more than the presence of technology and talent. The policy choices we make over the next few years will change not just the structure of future global businesses but also the competitiveness of entire nations. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

Last week, at least eight people who appeared to know each other allegedly took advantage of an employee's error to take more than $1,100 in $20 bills from the store. At around 12:34 a.m. Saturday, the group went to check out at the Walmart in Winter Haven. Police said a bald man with a large tattoo on his right shoulder scanned and paid cash for two items, but soon found himself better off when the machine spit out a $20 bill instead of the $5 and change he was owed back. While most people might have alerted a store employee, police said the man told his friends or family members, including three children, about his discovery. You can probably guess what happened next. According to investigators, the group spent more than 20 minutes bilking Walmart out of their $20 bills from the machine, ringing up one small item each in order to receive change that should have included a $5 bill. Now police want to find the adults and children seen taking cash from the self-checkout. Police said the children appeared to be a girl between 13 to 15 years old, and two boys between 10 and 12 years old. A store audit found an employee accidentally placed the $20 bills in the $5 bill slot.

Wal-Mart said new fees for Walmart2Walmart, a store-to-store money-transfer service introduced three years ago, could now save customers between 20 percent and 90 percent on cash transfers compared with Western Union. The retailer said customers already have saved nearly $500 million in fees through the use of the service the past three years. Bluebird2Walmart, a new service from Wal-Mart and American Express, will be available for customers beginning next month. The program will allow account holders of Bluebird -- a checking and debit alternative -- to digitally send money for cash pickup at Wal-Mart locations. Account holders can access the new service by visiting Bluebird.com or by using the Bluebird app. The cost of the service is consistent with the new Walmart2Walmart prices, according to the retailer. -- Robbie Neiswanger Ouachita Electric's solar use ranked 4th Ouachita Electric Cooperative Corp. ranks fourth among utilities nationally with the highest annual watts-per-customer use of solar energy, according to the Smart Electric Power Alliance. Ouachita Electric, based in Camden, had 1,282 megawatts of solar energy per customer connected to the electric grid last year. The cooperative said it provides electric service to about 9,400 meters in Ouachita, Calhoun, Dallas, Bradley, and Nevada counties in south Arkansas. Leading the list was the City of Palo Alto Utilities in Palo Alto, Calif., with 2,753 megawatts per customer of solar energy added to the grid. More than 410 utilities nationwide were included in the survey. Ouachita Electric announced in 2015 the construction of a 12-megawatt solar field on a 100-acre site in the Highland Industrial Park in East Camden. The solar field began operations in early 2016. -- David Smith Nasdaq hits a high but state index slips The Arkansas Index, a price-weighted index that tracks the largest public companies based in the state, dipped 0.83 to 349.34 Thursday.

That's how many companies are reporting today. But, we have to choose, because we're not doing an hour long show. Kretzmann: We could. I don't know if anyone would listen. [laughs]  Hill: Two things would happen if we did an hour long show. Long-time listeners, to your point, would just cut out, they would just be like, I'm done. Once they hit the 35 minute mark, they'd pull the plug. The other thing is, Kristine Harjes is coming in in a little bit to host Industry Focus, and we don't want to incur the wrath of Kristine Harjes and the Industry Focus crew. Bush: She'll boot us out. Hill: So, let's start with signs of life -- I can't believe I'm saying this -- signs of life from Twitter. Shares are up 11% this morning after a first quarter report that included, Aaron, a rise in monthly active users. The revenue fell, for those of you who actually pay attention to money. The revenue fell, but that seems to matter less than the fact that monthly active users are on the rise. Bush: Yeah, I think the 10% pop in the stock today is a little misplaced, in my opinion. I don't really think it was that great of a quarter, to be honest with you, Chris. I think you could say it was a mixed bag. Revenue was down, margins and cash flow were up, users were up. But ultimately, I do think, when you piece it all together, the news is more bad than it is good. Hill: Wow, really? Bush: I think so. On one hand, it's clear that Twitter is slowly making changes. They're slow, they're ungodly slow when it comes to handling user issues like abuse and improving the actual timeline. But they are improving their cost, free cash flow is growing, the user base is growing, daily active users was up 14% year over year, which is actually pretty great. And I do think that's because of some of these efforts they put in place from the product perspective. That said, revenue, you can't just ignore that. That's huge. It's down 8% over the last year, and this is the 11th quarter in a row of a deceleration. The first quarter that it's down. That's pretty bad. I think the moral of the story here is pretty simple. Twitter's ads are currently not competitive with Facebook and Google, not even close. And it's a huge undertaking for them to become competitive. So, you can celebrate all these other wins, but at the end of the day, this is the business. Turning the ship around is still a multi-year process, and the slower they move, the higher the odds of them getting whacked. Hill: So, the people who are on Twitter itself, but also reporting in the media, etc, who are saying, among other things that CEO Jack Dorsey has bought himself some time, this was a good quarter, let's quiet down the drumbeat of, he needs to choose between being CEO of Twitter and being the CEO of Square. You're saying "No". Bush: I think this is beyond him. This is beyond what any one person can change at this point. I do think a lot of the changes that he has put into place have been positive, but revenue, you can't overlook that. Kretzmann: Yeah, Aaron mentioned the competition from Google and Facebook. As far as digital sales go, those are definitely the big giants in the room. But then, as Twitter is doubling down on its live video strategy, they're starting to compete more with Snap, which has a very engaged user base. The growth there has slowed a little bit, it'll be interesting to see what Snap's metrics look like, and how those compare to Twitter, as far as ad engagement and user growth. But, yeah, it's not a good combination when you have users going up, but ad revenue going down. And Twitter said they expect that disconnect to continue for the rest of the year. This probably won't be the last quarter that revenue goes down. In the meantime, their pace of stock-based compensation has receded a little bit, but their diluted share count increased over 1% just from the last quarter. So, in the process, as revenue has completely decelerated and now is declining, their share count has climbed up. So I went back and looked, if Twitter wanted to bring its share count back to the same level it was in 2014, a few months after it went public, they would have to spend $1.9 billion just to get back to that break even level with the share count. What that shows is, the bar that they have to cross at some point to reward shareholders is perpetually getting higher as they continue to dilute shareholders. So, that's not a good trend to have when your revenue is dropping. Hill: And share-based compensation, that's one of those things that, if you're the average investor, it's understandable if your eyes gloss over, and it's easy to dismiss it and focus on the more headline-oriented things like revenue and monthly active users. But when we talk about some of these tech companies potentially putting themselves up for sale, you need to recognize that share based compensation is a huge factor in that, the fact that they're going out and hiring people and convincing them to stay on board and not jump ship, a lot of that has to do with, "Look, we're going to give you more shares." Go back and look at LinkedIn being acquired by Microsoft. As much as anything, it was the share-based compensation within LinkedIn that made the leaders of that company go, "We have to figure something out quick." Kretzmann: Yeah, because that's one of the main currencies they have for paying their employees. And competition between employers in Silicon Valley is not going to disappear. I think that's a dangerous thing for Twitter shareholders and something to watch. At first glance, on the balance sheet, it does look pretty strong. We have net cash of $2.2 billion, as Aaron mentioned, you have free cash flow, which is going up, but stock based compensation is still a huge component for that positive cash flow production. So, the balance sheet, to me, is not as strong as it looks on the surface, because $1.9 billion just to break even with your share count two years ago, that takes up most of their net cash today. The investments that they've been making up to this point are not paying off. At some point, that trend has to reverse for shareholders to be rewarded. Bush: One other thing that David and I were talking about earlier today is how slow they move, and what that really means when you look long term. I think it's easy to look at these incremental changes and think about where things should go. But the pace that they move, these larger tech companies like Facebook and Google, they could do it at the snap of a finger, what these guys take six months to do. Hill: I was going to ask you about that. It's, in some ways, an unfair question because unless you're spying on headquarters at Twitter, there's no way for you to have the information to answer this question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Why do you think that is? I've seen you write about this, I've seen other people touch on it. The popular image that we have of Silicon Valley is, among other things, it's a fast culture, it's a nimble culture. The way things move at Twitter, they might as well be the U.S. Department of whatever. When you think of bureaucracy, you think of Washington D.C. When you think of fast and nimble and cutting-edge, you think of Silicon Valley. Twitter's lack of speed is really astonishing. Bush: I do think I know one big reason behind it. I think a lot of it stems from the very early days of the company. They never had to struggle to reach product/market fit. So, never in their journey to figure out how to improve what they're doing, they never had an issue. They just threw something out there and it worked. So then, they just kept on capitalizing on what worked, but never really changed the product itself. Now that they're up competing against these companies that have been changing their platform at pretty innovative speeds for years now, they're finding that gap so much larger that it's just, in comparison, it takes so much more time to get out of. Kretzmann: Yeah, it seems like Twitter just doesn't have near the focus on the actual product. What is their platform, fundamentally, compared to Snap or Facebook, where you have leaders that are so product-driven, and it drives everything they do. From there, you find the business model that fits. But with Twitter, it seems like they're very scattered trying to figure out the direction of the company and what their actual product is. Hill: All right, let's move on to Chipotle. First quarter profits came in higher than expected. Same store sales were up 18%. I realize that is off of, go back a year in time, off a terrible quarter a year ago. Still, it's nice to see that it's up 18%. Stock up a little bit, not amazing, although it has risen about 30% in the last six months. So, I don't know, maybe we shouldn't expect too much of a pop off of this. Kretzmann: Yeah, I think the key for investors is, the metrics are moving in the right direction. I think you can safely say the turnaround has begun. As long as they can keep moving at this pace, I think good things are ahead for shareholders. But, it will still take time. It'll probably be at least a year and a half, I think, before we get back to those pre-crisis levels, as far as metrics go. But, yeah, same-store sales up about 18%, their restaurant level operating margins are trending up. This quarter was almost at 18%, but that's still quite a bit lower than the 28% restaurant level operating margin we saw right before the crisis hit in 2015. All those metrics like restaurant sales, sales as a whole across the company, margins, they're moving in the right direction, it's a definitive turnaround from where the company has been going for the past year and a half but still some work to do to get back to those pre-crisis levels. Bush: Yeah, when I was reading through the call, and what they've been doing to move back to the levels that they were, I think I was pretty impressed with what they were doing. If you look, for example, at the online sales, that increased 54% over the past year. I know that's something in the past we've talked about. Chipotle is not very good at that compared to others. So, it seems like they're moving in the right direction. Still have room to improve. They're revamping their restaurant tour program, which also was a pain point. Hill: Is this the management program? Bush: Yes, this was their management program. Chipotle has always promoted internally. But, if you grow too fast and promote too quickly, that can lead to problems, especially if you incentivize poorly. So, they've been doing a lot of work around figuring out what metrics are best to incentivize their managers and field team leaders. It looks like that is improving. Just, how they're interacting with consumers and turnover of their leaders. That's good. They also just closed, this quarter, 15 ShopHouse locations. So, they're moving past that -- Kretzmann: Still sad about that, though. Bush: Yeah, it's unfortunate for those of us, in the past, who were optimistic at some point. But it's good that they are diverting those resources, now, to higher-impact endeavors. Hill: I'm a Chipotle shareholder. I'm glad they decided to pull the plug on ShopHouse, because I got tired of wondering when they were going to roll it out. The first couple of years, what you heard was a lot of, "They're taking their time, they're not going to rush it." But at some point, you move so slowly that it's natural to ask the question, "What is wrong with this concept?" Either it's ready to be rolled out or it's not. The fact that they said, "We're packing it in on that, we're going to focus on the main brand locations and go from there," I'm glad. Kretzmann: Yeah, and on top of everything else Chipotle was dealing with for the past year, I think trying to work out issues at ShopHouse, it was just becoming a distraction. To me, that really was the theme of this quarter, it was very clear that Chipotle is refocusing. And I think part of that is boosted by Steve Ells taking over the sole leadership role as CEO. Monty Moran, who was co-CEO for a while, retired late last year. So I think you're seeing that focus from Steve Ells. And in the call, he mentioned revamping that restaurant tour program, as Aaron mentioned. But the focus of that is a "relentless focus on customer experience." So, sort of a Jeff Bezos-esque comment there, really trying to figure out what the priority is there for their management program. And they mentioned that they now have the lowest turnover with general managers in more than eight years. Hill: That's great. Kretzmann: Yeah. A lot of things moving in the right direction. I think you're seeing, internally, a refocus on prioritizing the guest experience. As they get traffic into the stores, their throughput should really be able to increase with digital orders, because they're starting to launch kitchens in the back of the restaurants specifically for digital. That should theoretically take people out of that front line, more people can go through that front line. The restaurant, in other words, will be able to pump out more burritos, more orders. If they can get that traffic back to pre-crisis levels and hopefully beyond that, these stores could be much more profitable than they were a few years ago, and they were incredibly profitable then. Hill: Yeah. And that is, in some ways, the promise of this investment, if you're a shareholder or a potential shareholder. Because the headlines have been so bad, and rightly so, for the last couple years. But you go back to 2013 and 2014, and they were putting up these type of same-store sales numbers, not off of a low base, off of a pretty high base. So, when they would come in with double-digit comp increases, that's just breathtaking. So, the idea that they're looking at what Panera has been doing and saying, "How can we do that? How can we up the people walking in and picking up their food and walking out? If we can get our throughput even higher, that's great." Bush: I think the biggest news out of all of this is they're going to start testing two new desserts. Hill: [laughs] Is that the big news? What are the desserts they're testing? Bush: They only announced one of them. It's called buñuelos. It's these fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon, and sugar. So, super healthy.  Kretzmann: Fits right with their healthy ingredients theme. Hill: I hear that honey is supposed to be healthy, I've heard that from time to time. Kretzmann: Cinnamon, I think. Hill: Cinnamon is a spice. Kretzmann: Sugar ... Bush: Just ignore that it's fried. Hill: You know, it's dessert, it's not supposed to be healthy if it's dessert.  iRobot shares hitting an all-time high today after first quarter profit more than doubled expectations. Aaron, this is not a beat by a penny type situation, they crushed it. They also raised their guidance for the whole fiscal year. Holy cow. Bush: Roombas are taking over the world. That's all you can really say. Yeah, they crushed expectations. I think what we're seeing right now is they're witnessing an inflection in demand of their Roombas, which is very impressive. Believe it or not, the Roomba last year was the most sold vacuum cleaner in the U.S., in terms of dollars spent. Yeah, wow. To me, that almost feels like the rise of the Roomba occurred somewhat stealthily. Looking at the product compared to past iterations, you really do see the improvements that have been coming through. They work better, they have more connected features, which will play a role more so as the connected homes inevitably start popping up more and more. The Roomba itself, obviously, is killing it. But, beyond the Roomba, there are other products and moves the company has made that also excites investors. The Braava, for one, that's iRobot's hardwood cleaner, right now, that's still a tiny fragment of revenue, but it's selling well. It also has these wipe consumables that consumers need to buy, so it adds a form of recurring revenue for the company, too, which is always good to see. iRobot just bought back its Asian distributors, which gives it more control in how it sells in that continent. That's actually a pretty huge deal. I think later this year, we should expect Japan's growth to accelerate. We'll see them significantly ramp up business in China. That should be a huge deal. The Braava in particular could sell particularly well because hardwood floors are more of a norm over there. So, really giving that second product they have a huge boost. Then, lastly, the innovation machine that they have just keeps on running. They're just as much as software company at this point as a vacuum cleaning robot company. So, new robots that perform new tasks, like lawn mowing, whatever else they have in store, should be expected. As time rolls on, these robots are going to do their jobs better and better. I think investors should expect more beats going forward. This is impressive. Hill: I was on their website and saw they also have a robot pool cleaner. I don't have a pool, but I thought, I would 100% buy one. There are some people who actually enjoy mowing their lawn. I'm not one of them, but there are some people who are like, "It's relaxing, I'm outside in nature," that kind of thing. I can't imagine anyone owning a pool and saying, "Oh, I'm looking forward to a day of Zen and relaxation of cleaning my pool." No. Buy that thing, set it loose on the bottom of your pool, and you're done. Kretzmann: I think our digital age has made people lazy enough that iRobot is hitting the inflection point, finally, where people just want to automate everything they can. Hill: Is 100% of their business just consumer? Do they have any sort of business-to-business relationship where they're going to a hotel chain or something like that and selling them en masse? Kretzmann: I think now that they're entirely a consumer goods, consumer-facing company. Last year they divested a defense or security division. I think they're primarily selling to the U.S. military at that point. I think that makes sense, because the consumer market is sizable. In the U.S. alone, robot vacuum cleaners are about 20% of the total vacuum market. Just that robot vacuum cleaner portion, which is growing, is about $6 billion or so. So, there's a sizable market there. And iRobot really is the dominant brand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. So, I think doubling down and really focusing on that consumer market makes sense for them. Since they divested that security division last year, the stock has done really well. I don't follow this closely enough I know if those two are completely related, or one caused the other. But to me, it makes sense for them to focus on that consumer market, because I think that's where the majority of the growth is. Hill: Aaron, the stock is up about 15% today. We love it when a stock hits an all time high. But I have to ask, how expensive is this stock? When you look at it, do you think, "OK, this is great for shareholders, but right now, today, this is kind of a pricey stock?" Bush: It is a pretty pricey stock. I think it's definitely earned it. Just seeing, today, the stock go up 15%, I think if this company continues to execute the way it has, and if this inflection point is real, then I don't think it is as pricey as it may seem to a lot of investors. Kretzmann: Yeah, it's still just a $2 billion company. I could see that bumping up, especially if they could maintain that brand leadership position, which they seem to have carved out pretty nicely. Hill: Before we get out of here, I should mention that Rule Breakers, the service started by David Gardner that both David and Aaron work on, the new issue of Rule Breakers comes out today with two new stock recommendations from David Gardner and the team.

It was just after midnight back on Saturday morning when the eight shoppers walked into the Winter Haven store.  Surveillance footage provided by police shows a man scanning two items at the self-checkout cash register, paying cash, and walking off. He walks back, though, as another member of the group checks out.  That’s when, police say, they compare notes and realize that the register is dispensing $20 bills instead of $5 bills. “Finding this obvious windfall, honest people would immediately alert the sales associate to the error -- but not this group,” offered Winter Haven Police Department spokesman Jamie Brown.  “They all start lining up to pay for one small item each in order to receive change that should include $5 -- knowing they would instead receive a $20 bill.” Footage from the cameras shows the group taking turns grabbing items like candy and gum, then grabbing extra change from the erstwhile ATM for more than 20 minutes. In total, the group retrieved $1,100 in error.  Now, police are asking for help identifying the shoppers. According to police, footage from the parking lot shows that the group came in two separate vehicles -- a newer model black four-door car and a silver or gray four-door car.  Investigators ask anyone with information to call Heartland Crime Stoppers at 1-800-226-TIPS (8477). The store, meanwhile, eventually discovered the issue and determined that $20 bills had been erroneously loaded in the slot where the $5 bills should go.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent TCU advances to NIT title game after defeating UCF UCF beats Illinois 68-58, bound for New York UCF Beats Illinois State In NIT Second Round UCF holds off Colorado's late rally, wins 79-74 Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

More On: toys Target recalls over 500,000 egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday Your favorite '90s toy is making a comeback There's nothing royal about this cheapo 'Princess Charlotte' gear Toddler defends her choice of doll to confused Target cashier It’s the surprise hottest toy of the spring, and it isn’t a high-tech gadget. So-called fidget spinners, low-tech, low-price stress-relieving toys, are a huge fad sweeping the country, and stores can’t keep them in stock, manufacturers and retailers told The Post on Thursday. The demand for these devices is coming from children, college students and adults who are looking to the toys to help them release nervous energy or stop fidgeting. College students specifically are gobbling them up ahead of finals, hoping they will help them focus. The toys, which come in plastic, brass, steel or copper, retail mostly for $5 to $7. “I see a lot of students using them in the library and in classes during finals,” said one Fairfield University student. With Walmart, Toys ’R’ Us and other chains having a hard time keeping the products in stock, some retailers are demanding manufacturers airfreight shipments to their warehouse rather than stick them on a ship from China. It costs five times as much to fly them in compared with standard sea shipping, but planes drastically cut transit time. At Midtown Manhattan-based Almar Sales Co., the sales team sold an astounding 20 million fidget toys to Walmart, Toys ’R’ Us, Party City and others in April, executive vice president Allen Ashkenazie told The Post. “At this rate, it would be our largest-selling toy in our 50-plus-year history,” said Ashkenazie. Because Almar agreed to airfreight the spinners, the stores have them on their shelves now. “The retailers are willing to pay a premium to have the spinners airfreighted.” SEE ALSO Your favorite '90s toy is making a comeback 0:0 An iconic ’90s playground favorite is set for a comeback.... Some manufacturers are marketing the products as a study aid that can be helpful for people who suffer from ADHD. Hand spinners popped up last year but made a huge splash in March as social media posts went viral. “We saw an increase in sales for Rubik’s Cubes, yo-yos and other toys that keep little hands occupied — items that we’ve carried for decades,” Toys ’R’ Us spokeswoman Meghan Sowa said in an email statement to The Post. “That’s when our expert buyers did some research and saw the buzz building for spinners and fidget cubes,” she said. “We took immediate action and started airfreighting product to shelves.” If retailers have not yet placed an order, they may be too late. Some manufacturers in China are selling directly to US consumers via Amazon, which was the first retailer to sell hand spinners here, according to Josh Loerzel, an executive with Portland, Ore.-based Zing, a second fidget spinner maker. While the US each year seems to stumble upon a crazy toy fad — milk caps, Beanie Babies and Pokémon, to name three — fidget spinners may be among the most lucrative for toy makers. But Ashkenazie at Almar knows it won’t last forever. “I can literally walk into the office on a Monday morning in a few weeks from now and it can be yesterday’s news,” he said. “As if it never existed.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under kids ,  shopping ,  toys ,  trends Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Apple reportedly in talks to launch a money-transfer servi...

Owens Published: Apr 28, 2017 1:58 p.m. ET Share Cloud-computing division provides profit, strong revenue growth rates and a dominant market position Dourleak/Shutterstock Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud-computing division is the brightest star of its earnings report yet again. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Amazon.com Inc. is thought of by most consumers as the Wal-Mart of the web, a dominant retailer with convenience and pricing advantages that will be hard to beat. But that business is not the sole reason Amazon AMZN, +0.72%  was headed for fresh record highs and a market capitalization of more than $450 billion after Thursday’s earnings report. In fact, the e-commerce business may not even be the main reason why Amazon is worth so much right now, just as it definitely is not the main reason for Amazon’s recent journey into solid profitability. Amazon Web Services, which sells remote computing power to businesses, was again the star of Amazon’s earnings report, despite being a major concern for investors heading into the report thanks to a decelerating growth rate and rumors that a price war with cloud rivals would shrink profits. However, on the same day that two of those rivals also released earnings, Amazon showed why AWS is the most valuable startup in tech. The company reported quarterly AWS revenue of $3.66 billion, slightly topping estimates and reflecting 42.6% growth, and operating income of $890 million. That net profit margin of more than 24% was actually higher than the year-ago quarter, wiping away more fears. Amazon’s total operating income for the quarter was $1.01 billion. While it doesn’t take a math wizard to see that Amazon would not be anywhere near as profitable without AWS, here is the figure: AWS accounted for about 89% of Amazon’s total operating income for the quarter, with the rest attributable to e-commerce. Cloud computing is a young business, and AWS appears to easily be the leader in the category. Synergy Research reports that Amazon has about 40% of the market, while Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.28%  , Alphabet Inc.’s Google GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63%  and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.02%  combine to hold just 23%. While Microsoft and Alphabet both reported earnings Thursday along with Amazon, neither break out their cloud-computing performance independently, as Microsoft bundles its Azure offering with server sales and other enterprise services, and Google groups Google Cloud Platform’s performance with a host of other non-advertising revenue sources. Talk to anyone who invests in young companies, and they will tell you that this type of performance is incredible. To hold a dominant position in a growing industry with strong profitability and high revenue growth rates is nearly impossible — young companies tend to toss away at least one of those, almost always profitability. Take, for instance, Uber Technologies Inc., the most highly valued of Silicon Valley’s unicorn crop. Recent financials obtained by Bloomberg News showed that Uber roughly doubled its revenue in 2016 while holding a dominant position in the young ride-hailing-app sector. But the company, which is valued at nearly $70 billion on the private market, lost at least $2.8 billion, and likely much more. So, while Uber was reportedly losing billions on $6.5 billion in revenue in 2016, AWS reported operating income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion. That should tell you that, if Uber is worth anywhere near the $70 billion price tag investors have placed on it, then AWS would be worth substantially more as a stand-alone startup. When Amazon stock hits new records Friday, internet commenters and television pundits will rant about the high price-to-earnings ratio and unsustainable valuation. But when you add a company that could be considered the most valuable technology startup in a world full of valuable tech startups, to a web retailer with the scale and reach of Amazon, it shouldn’t be that hard to figure out why this company is worth so much. Amazon shares have gained 24% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19%  has gained 6.5%.

Mann 1 day 8 hours ago Local BACA members at a community outreach event at the Highway 157 Wal-Mart HOLLY POND - When children are the victims of abuse, even the arrest or removal of the abuser may not make everything right.  They often continue to live in fear of the abuser’s return.  In too many cases, that fear is well-founded; abusers often disregard restraining orders to intimidate their victims into silence and, in some cases, even attempt to continue the abuse.  That’s where the bikers from Holly Pond step in, literally. The east Cullman County town is home to Alabama’s only chapter of Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA), a child advocacy organization that comes at the task from a decidedly different direction.  Its members are, obviously, bikers: patches and vests, noisy chrome-trimmed Harleys, the works.  When they walk into the room, they get everyone’s attention in a no-nonsense, purposefully intimidating way.  And they take pride in making abusers think twice about messing with kids. BACA, according to its mission statement, “exists with the intent to create a safer environment for abused children.  We exist as a body of bikers to empower children to not feel afraid of the world in which they live . . . We desire to send a clear message to all involved with the abused child that this child is part of our organization, and that we are prepared to lend our physical and emotional support to them by affiliation and our physical presence.  We stand at the ready to shield these children from further abuse.” The Hurricane Creek Chapter has been around for eight years, but has been on a recent push to introduce itself and get the word out about its work. They’ve been attending local community festivals and town council meetings around the county.  The Tribune caught up with the bikers at an outreach day at the Highway 157 Wal-Mart in Cullman and spoke with chapter President Keith “Blind Dog” Williams. “Our job is to empower children to not be afraid,” said Williams.  “We go to court with them, to all their court proceedings, if we’re invited in.  It’s just to empower them and show them that they’re just as strong as anybody, as long as they’ve got somebody to stand up with them.” Bikers invited into court?  Yes!  BACA is not a vigilante group. Williams explained, “I’ve had women call and say, ‘Will y’all take my husband out and . . .’  No, we don’t do that.  We do everything the legal way.  Everybody has to be NCIC (criminal background check) cleared through the FBI.  We have strict training for at least a year, and a minimum of 15 months riding before they become a patched member.” While the stereotypical biker image serves them well, BACA does not advocate the use of force. Williams said, “We don’t believe in violence, because the children have seen enough violence.  But we will be an obstacle between the perpetrator and that child.  We’ll do whatever it takes to keep them away from the child.” Despite their intimidating appearance, BACA members have a good relationship with law enforcement agencies and court officials.  The national organization’s founder, John Paul Lilly, is a licensed clinical social worker and registered play therapist.  He says his own experience with abused kids showed that victims who feel safe and protected are more likely to testify against their abusers and go through the legal process. BACA members meet with client children and take them through an “adoption” ceremony.  Once “in the family,” members can provide security at the children’s homes, visit them at school and accompany them to court.  While most members are not trained therapists or counselors, BACA maintains a therapy fund for kids who need that kind of help. BACA is active in 49 states and 13 countries, but Hurricane Creek is currently the only chapter in Alabama.  That keeps these folks busy. “At this time, we have nine active cases,” Williams shared.  “Right now, we’re the only chartered chapter in Alabama.  We have one that’s fixing to charter in Wedowee, and we have a chapter just across the border in Florida that helps us out in south Alabama.  Other than that, we practically cover the whole state.” The Hurricane Creek chapter currently has 14 active members with another 18 in training.  “I love children,” said Williams.  “I’ve always loved working with children.  We have members who’ve been through abuse when they were growing up.  There’s several different reasons people join.  Everybody volunteers their time to do this.  Nobody in this organization ever gets paid.  It’s all voluntary, just a bunch of big-hearted bikers.” BACA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  For more information on the national organization, visit www.bacaworld.org.  Contact the Hurricane Creek chapter at 256-636-2453 or email [email protected] .   Copyright 2017 Humble Roots, LLC.

April 20th 2017 9 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Business/ Amazon really is coming to Australia. And Aussie companies should be very afraid. Jason Murphynews.com.au@jasemurphy Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend ANALYSIS NOW Amazon is coming to Australia, really, truly and officially, there is one thing to know about it. It is massive. Amazon’s revenue dwarfs that of Australia’s biggest retailers – it is more than twice the size of Woolworths, which owns Woolworths supermarkets, Big W, and, and also more than twice the size of Wesfarmers, which owns Coles and Bunnings. In fact Amazon makes more revenue than both of them - and a handful of other Aussie retailers to boot. Amazon is not purely a retailer. It provides TV streaming services and cloud services and logistics too. Neither is it the world’s biggest retailer, it is true. Walmart is. Costco and Aldi – which are present in Australia - were both bigger than Amazon when they showed up in Australia a few years ago. Costco and Aldi are smaller than Amazon now. And that is the most amazing thing about Amazon. It is growing incredibly fast. The implications of a large retailer coming to Australia are substantial. The implications of a fast-growing retailer coming to Australia are big. When the retailer in question is both so large and fast-growing, the shockwave could be massive. And that shockwave could hit during 2018. There has been a lot of rumour about Amazon coming to Australia, but with an official press release during the week and 158 jobs now advertised on their website, the time for rumour is over. The big question now is: Will Amazon thrive here? IS AUSTRALIA TOO EXPENSIVE? Some local retailers have suggested Amazon would find their business model didn’t work well here. Australia’s distances are much higher than most countries Amazon operates in and our population is far lower than America. Furthermore, wages are much higher than in the USA and our working conditions better. In the US, Amazon is well-known for using low paid workers in its warehouses. They do not enjoy the same workers rights that Australians enjoy. One famous story tells of an Amazon warehouse with ambulances parked out the front on hot days. Workers would regularly collapse from heatstroke, but sufficient airconditioning was not in the budget. Would Amazon really be able to do the work of warehousing and logistics successfully here with our tougher laws? Their imminent arrival suggests Amazon thinks it can. And it may have a way to get the work done without worrying about wages. While discussing Amazon’s recent financial performance, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky dropped a massive hint that Amazon is replacing workers with robots as fast as he can. He was asked a question about why the company was spending so much on warehouses (which it calls “fulfilment centres”), and his response indicated they are now far more than just sheds with shelves. “The fulfilment centres … with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses and then generally have much better operating efficiencies,” That suggests Amazon is spending more upfront to install robots, and getting big savings from doing so. If a highly automated model of operations is what Amazon plans to roll out in Australia then far fewer jobs will be on offer than if they had used humans to do that work. AUSTRALIA MIGHT HAVE BEEN “LUCKY” TO GET AMAZON Amazon is famous for many things. But one of them is how low its profits have been. Despite billions in revenue, profits are regularly barely above zero. Instead of returning money to shareholders, Amazon uses that money to expand. It puts growth ahead of profit, with the apparent intention of one day being among the world’s largest companies. To achieve that, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos is pouring a lot of money and attention on India. If India keeps up its rate of growth, within ten years it can cease to be a poor country. Amazon’s strategy of getting in now makes sense. Being the favourite online shopping option of an increasingly wealthy country of over 1.5 billion people is probably the fastest way for Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos to become the world’s first trillionaire. Spending money in Australia, meanwhile, is not such an obvious move. Most other countries where Amazon operates – USA, UK, Mexico, Japan, are several times larger than Australia. The only country Amazon serves with a lower population than Australia is the Netherlands. And that country is small in terms of land area, meaning not many warehouses. So, Australia is an odd choice for Amazon. Even if its online retail model comes to dominate our retailers and enliven our lives, we will not provide hundreds of millions of customers. The fact that Amazon has chosen to come here could suggest that while it pursues very difficult projects like making money in India, it also needs to hit some softer targets to provide profit as well. The arrival of Amazon might be very good news for Australian customers. Only time will tell if it is very bad news for Australian workers and retailers. Jason Murphy is an economist.

[MATT MCKEAN/TIMESDAILY] Buy Now MATT MCKEAN Traffic moves down Lauderdale County road 46 and turns onto Cox Creek Parkway. Motorists use county road 46 as a cut through from Middle Road to Cox Creek and has become quite congested as a result. [MATT MCKEAN/TIMESDAILY] FLORENCE -- Gresham Road is a not-so-secret route around Florence's often congested, stop-and-go traffic on Cox Creek Parkway. The two-lane road in Lauderdale County carries thousands of cars a day from Cox Creek Parkway to the back entrance of Target, Dicks Sporting Goods and the other stores in the Cox Creek Parkway Shopping Center. Other cars travel further down the narrow road to Seville Street to get to Kohl's Department Store, Home Depot, the Walmart SuperCenter and the dozen or so other stores and restaurants that sit just a block off of Cox Creek Parkway. It is easier to navigate Gresham Road -- also Lauderdale 46 -- than deal with the five lanes of traffic and series of red lights on Cox Creek Parkway. It is not a new predicament. It is also not getting better. "It's been an issue that's ongoing for as long as I've been on the council," said City Councilman Andy Betterton, who also is a member of the planning commission. "I've had any number of conversations with residents and citizens in the area on how to do this," Betterton said. "And from traveling this road myself, it is simply not an easy solution." Large-scale residential development in the area has increased traffic on the road. The Florence Planning Commission granted preliminary subdivision approval and recommended rezoning 12 acres of property on Gresham Road for a new 110-unit apartment complex. The planned complex is to be located next door to Seville Place Apartments, and almost directly across Gresham Road from Hunter's Ridge subdivision. Florence City Planner Melissa Bailey said, based on building permits issued, the current phase of Hunters Ridge is about 50 percent complete. She said 27 building permits have been issued for the subdivision that has 56 platted lots. The concerns for Gresham Road don't end at the intersection of Seville Street. Gresham Road intersects with Middle Road, which connects to Florence Boulevard, creating a route to that highway that bypasses the busiest section of Cox Creek Parkway. "There is a lot of other pressure that is being created for this road that is not necessarily native or natural to this road that has to do with the entrance on the other side," planning commission member Britt Blanton said. "This is one of these situations where the city is organically growing, and we have to be on top of this." Residents asked the planning commission, before the board voted on the rezoning and subdivision approval, to be mindful of traffic and try to find a solution to congestion and flow on the road. Planning Commissioner Bud Pride said the city will have to take the lead. "The work that needs to be done on Gresham Road needs to have been done yesterday," Pride said. "If it is ever going to get done, the city of Florence is going to have to take the lead. If the city does not take the lead to get the improvements that are necessary on that road, we will be talking about this five years, 10 years from now." The rub is that Florence, right now, has little influence over what goes on with the road. The majority of it is a county-maintained road, which means any widening project would have to be done under the purview of Lauderdale County leadership. Lauderdale County Engineer Eric Hill said there are no road improvement plans for Gresham Road.  Lauderdale County did add asphalt on the road edges to create a road shoulder in some parts. "As for Florence, as they continue to annex and grow, their ability to do anything on that road depends on how the city grows and what they annex," Hill said. He said the property on both sides of the road would have to be inside Florence city limits for a city-funded widening project. Some property on the south side of the road is in the city limits. Farther east, the property is in St. Florian, and the north side of the road is primarily in Lauderdale County. Betterton said when it comes to cooperation between Lauderdale County and the city, the issue is funding. So much of the traffic that is using the road as a short cut is doing so to get to shopping and restaurants that pay sales tax to Florence, so the traffic is benefiting Florence more than the county. "I had a conversation with two county commissioners within the last month, and they say, 'You find the money and we will work together,'" Betterton said. jennifer.edwards@TimesDaily.com or 256-740-5754.

Politics Entertainment World U.S. Tech Arts + Culture Drink + Food Style Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast THANKS A GIGATON The Hero of the People’s Climate March: Wal-Mart? While the U.S. government fiddles as the planet burns, the nation’s retail giant is stepping up. Jay Michaelson 04.29.17 4:03 AM ET This week, an estimated 100,000 people will take part in the People’s Climate March, a national effort to somehow, someway persuade the U.S. government to take action on the most pressing environmental crisis of our time. But after the march, they should head to Wal-Mart. Why? Because contrary to popular perception, the retail behemoth—the largest employer in 19 states, with $482 billion in annual revenue—is leading the way on corporate climate action. Last week, it announced a commitment to eliminate a gigaton—that’s 1 billion tons—of greenhouse-gas emissions from its supply chain. Yup, Wal-Mart. “There’s good news here,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, managing director of the EDF+Business program at the Environmental Defense Fund, in an interview with The Daily Beast. Wal-Mart’s proposed cut is more than the annual greenhouse-gas emissions of Germany, Sturcken noted. Corporate environmentalism is not new, and the EDF in particular has a long history of working with companies to lessen their environmental footprint. Famously or infamously, depending on your point of view, it partnered with McDonald’s in 1990 to eliminate its wasteful “clamshell” packaging and replace it with environmentally friendly alternatives. Of course, to some, the EDF’s work with McDonald’s and Wal-Mart is a form of “greenwashing,” which is when companies merely rearrange the deck chairs on their environmental Titanic, and then get a PR boost. Indeed, when EDF announced its Golden Arches work 27 years ago, the then-head of Greenpeace said that if the fast-food giant really wanted to help the environment, it would shut its doors. On the other hand, corporations like Wal-Mart are leading where the U.S. government fears to tread. With the Republican Party in the pocket of the fossil-fuel industry, the federal government is wedded to a head-in-the-ground denial of the universal consensus of climate scientists that the world is getting hotter and that human activities’ emissions of greenhouse gases are the reason why. Thus, while there is some progress on the state and local level, national action, and by extension the international action that requires U.S. participation, is headed in the wrong direction. Of course, multinationals like Wal-Mart also have to comply with other countries’ environmental regulations, but in general, Sturcken said, “Companies aren’t waiting for government action. Companies are driven by data, by science. Truth matters. And the only conclusion you can come to, if your company is looking toward the horizon and you want your business to grow… is to be pro-active on these issues.” Because Wal-Mart is so large, the effects are staggering. According to Sturcken, the retail giant has more than 100,000 global suppliers, and more than 230 million people shop at Wal-Mart every week. “We’ve been working with Wal-Mart for 10 years because of their power to create change,” she said. In 2010, for example, Wal-Mart agreed to cut 20 million metric tons of annual emissions in the products it sells, Sturcken says, by taking thousands of small actions like “selling low-flow shower heads, changing date labeling on food products to be use-by instead of sell-by, selling more efficient light bulbs, and asking food suppliers to optimize fertilizer use.” The goal was exceeded in 2015. That kind of change is possible because of Wal-Mart’s outsize influence on its suppliers. No one business could have such a large impact, but a business that influences thousands of others can. “Companies are saying that the challenges and opportunities go beyond their four walls to consumers they touch and products they sell,” Sturcken said.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason The publicity benefit of such steps is obvious, which is why oil companies run pro-environment ads in newspapers and on cable news while fighting climate-change regulations in Washington. But Sturcken said the real business value lies elsewhere. “There is immense business value creation in sustainability,” said Sturcken. “That goes back to our partnership with FedEx in the late 1990s to create next-generation trucks: The company saw that it was smart business to get ahead of these issues and be a leader.” According to Sturcken, this is true even of relatively conservative companies. For example, Smithfield, the pork producer, committed to reduce its GHG emissions 25 percent by 2025. Land O’Lakes has created a business unit focused on sustainability. “These are conservative companies but they’re reality-based and smart,” said Sturcken. “If they’re thinking ahead, they’re thinking of opportunities and seeing customers demand good corporate citizenship.” OK, but really—Wal-Mart? Aren’t they the ones wrecking local retail economies, treating workers poorly, and hiding money in tax havens? Sturcken was insistent. “I would say that Wal-Mart is the leading retail company on sustainability. And the reason why I say that is the scale… They’ve made significant strides. “In terms of volume, they’re the leading organic retailer,” Sturcken said. (Costco claims the same thing.) “The place you see the real impact, is that sustainability is baked into everyday products that consumers who are middle-class can afford… I really do believe they’re not getting enough credit for the change they’re creating here.” As for its own emissions, “Wal-Mart has a GHG-reduction target for their own operations of 18 percent by 2025. They’re working on factory energy efficiency with Chinese factories… They’re far from sustainable, but let’s praise leadership and not knock down companies because they’re not perfect yet.” Sturcken emphasized that “EDF does not take money from any of our corporate partners… It’s risky for us to partner with a company and risky for them to partner with us, and it’s better for us to maintain independence and credibility by not taking money.” I asked Sturcken if she had any advice for the people marching this weekend. Her response was surprising. “Making your individual voice heard does make a difference,” she said. “Not just signing a petition but picking up the phone and placing a call to the CEO of a company that needs to step up will make a huge difference. If everyone from the Climate March did something like that, it would be extremely powerful. Those kinds of things get through the noise to resonate with companies’ boards and executives.” Of course, such actions will still not be enough. “The planetary imperative is that we need change faster and at scale,” Sturcken said. “You still need policy change. Voluntary corporate action is leading the way right now in this time when the government is going backward, but it’s not enough. We absolutely need policy to deal with issues that are global like climate change. There’s no other way.” READ THIS LIST 1 Wal-Mart: Climate Hero?

(NASDAQ:AMZN) was starting to hit its stride and expand its product range, directly eating into the big-box tech retailer’s business and hampering BBY stock. Source: Austin Kirk via Flickr Best Buy was becoming more of an unwitting showroom for the e-commerce giant: Try it at Best Buy, then purchase it on Amazon.com. There were pricing issues, service issues and BBY stores weren’t really keeping up with the fast-changing times. It’s hard enough to compete in the low-margin electronics business on a good day, but when you’re competing against other electronics stores like hhgregg, Inc. (OTCMKTS:HGGGQ) and big box discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) as well, you’ve got a very tough row to hoe. By 2012, BBY realized it had to do something fast, and it had to be big. This wasn’t the time to fiddle around the edges, it was time to rebuild or die. With new CEO and Chairman Hubert Joly at the helm, BBY launched its Renew Blue campaign in its 1,600 North American stores. The five-point plan is still in place and has not only saved BBY from the fate of HHGGQ, but has put it on a growth path. The initial plan was: Reinvigorate the customer experience. Attract and grow ‘transformational leaders’ and energize employees to deliver extraordinary results. Work with vendors to innovate and drive value. Increase the company’s return on invested capital by growing revenue and efficiency. Making the world a better place through recycling effort and providing teenagers with access to technology. For 2017, Renew Blue’s goals are: Build on Best Buy’s industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. Drive cost reductions and efficiencies. Advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. Looking at its recent numbers, the plan is working. Online sales have grown by double digits in the past two years; employee engagement and retention are increasing every year. What’s more, with the demise of competition like HHGGQ and other department stores, there’s less competition for BBY’s best potential customers. BBY is trading near its 52-week high, up 57% in that time, and it still delivers a 2.6% dividend. It’s a shareholder-friendly company that has some very good days ahead.

Pickens (Photo: Portsmouth police) PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — A man was arrested Thursday for allegedly assaulting an officer while being taken into custody. Around 8:12 p.m., an officer working part-time at the Wal-Mart at 1098 Frederick Boulevard noticed a man who matched the description of a suspect connected to a series of business burglaries. As the officer spoke with the suspect, another officer arrived on the scene. They told the suspect he was under arrest. As the officers tried to take the suspect into custody, the suspect began to struggle and fell to the ground on top of one of the officers. The suspect then hit the officer several times in the face. Two people then came by and helped the officers arrest the suspect. The officer who was assaulted had minor injuries. Police wanted to thank the two good Samaritans who helped them. They are asking the citizens to reach out to the police department’s public information officer at 757-718-9031. The suspect was identified by police as 32-year-old Clinton T. Pickens, of Portsmouth. Pickens has been charged with possession with the intent to distribute imitation narcotics, assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Police say more charges are pending against him in connection to the burglaries investigators believe he committed. Pickens is currently in the custody of the Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office.

And now that the film's marketing campaign seems to be well underway ahead of its June release date, fans are getting their first look at some of the toys and memorabilia for the film. And of course, as many popular franchises do, Cars 3 is getting the Funko treatment. The popular action figure company has unveiled their line of Pop! vinyl figures for Cars 3. While this may seem like an unconventional choice - considering the fact that Funko Pops are best known for big heads and small bodies - this is actually the second Cars-related line from Funko, with the first debuting in 2015. The Cars 3 line will include two 'common' Pop! figures; of the franchise's protagonist, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), as well as new character Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonso).  The line will also feature figures of the tire shop-owning duo Luigi and Guido, both of which will be exclusive to Walmart stores. And finally, there will be two variants of Lightning McQueen - one 'chrome' exclusive from Target, and a grey version from Meijer grocery stores. If you're hoping to score this line of Pops before Cars 3's release date, they are set to hit store shelves in May. But judging by the number of exclusives in this line, get ready for a mini road trip to collect them all.

To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez (voice of Cristela Alonzo), with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn't through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing's biggest stage! The voice cast also features Armie Hammer as Jackson Storm, Larry The Cable Guy as Mater, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera, Cheech Marin as Ramone, Michael Wallis as Sheriff, and Paul Dooley Sarge.

(AP) - Clarksville police say investigators believe bounty hunters shot two men on Sunday in a reckless and dangerous incident that began in a Wal-Mart parking lot, fatally wounding one of them, and that neither was the person they were trying to serve with a warrant. Police spokesman Jim Knoll said the department is going to ask the Montgomery County grand jury on Monday to bring charges related to the incident. Department officials are giving few details about the incident before the case goes to the grand jury. But the family of a man who was killed says this is a case of mistaken identity, where out-of-control bounty hunters gunned down an innocent man in a very public way. The victim has been identified as 24-year-old Jalen Johnson. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Rick Polito | Apr 28, 2017 Nutrition Business Journal Editor-in-Chief Rick Polito and aronia berry farmer Andrew Pittz set off on a journey from Boulder, Colorado, to Anaheim, California, visiting farms and interviewing industry leaders and politicians along the way to explore the connection between American agriculture and the dietary supplement and functional food industries. This is part five of five. Read the rest here. We never saw the miniature horses Caroline Duell told us to watch for. We had driven by several red fence posts, and more than one steep driveway. We ignored the admonition in her texted directions that “when you think you’ve gone too far, you’re not there yet,” and called her anyway. She was right, we were not there yet. When we do get to the end of the muddy road in the hills just inland from Morro Bay, she is standing at the top of her steep driveway and smiling. We quickly get the impressions that she smiles a lot. She should. Duell lives at the end of a small valley, a geographical cul-de-sac folded into the hills and pulsing in green. The sun is out, but the drenching of a historic rainy season is evident in every puddle. I was once told by a photographer that in a good year, the coastal hills of California “define green.” And this has been a very good year. That isn’t the only reason Duell is smiling. She has created a life for herself and her family at the end of this muddy road, and she has invited others into it. Permaculture classes get taught at the farm. She hosts meditation retreats. A builder taught a course in tiny home construction. The fruits of Four Elements Farms go out to farmers markets in the Paso Robles area. She shows us the orchards, the composting toilet, the greenhouse and drying room made with lumber and windows recovered from construction projects and demolition. She describes her home and her farm as a kind of laboratory for “anything and everything that relates to sustainable living.” She is living the hippie paradise dream. That’s obvious from the smile she offered when we got out of the car. What is not obvious is the entrepreneurial dream she and her husband, Rich Ryan, have made real. It wasn’t until we walked the grounds with Duell that we learned the extent of that dream. She had told us she rents a commercial grade kitchen nearby to create a healing balm from the calendula she grows, and we’d envisioned a table at the local farmers market, ointments sold with the pears and mandarins harvested up the hill from the calendula patch. We were thinking small. Duell is the founder and force behind a $2.5 million brand growing at 40 percent year over year. We will see her booth at Expo West a few days later. We were standing in a hippie paradise and on the grounds of a B-Corporation enrolled in 1% for the Planet. That modest stucco home we walked by is also the headquarters for Duell’s efforts to promote Reef Friendly, a program educating consumers about the commercial sunscreens’ harmful effects on coral reefs. Duell settles into the story of how she made the dream come true. She talks about calling the every Whole Foods in northern California and delivering tubs of her All Good balm. She talks about the frustrations of dealing with distributors and the challenges and obstacles that might keep too many natural products entrepreneurs trapped in the dreamer stage. “The business side of it is really learning by doing it, constantly learning by doing as we go.” Right there, in that fold of hills, the green geological cul-de-sac, the why of our road trip comes into focus. Duell is what we were looking for. This is an organic farm, small, family-owned, creating a value-added product in a balm, and creating opportunity and economic development for the people who work the warehouse in a converted newspaper building, and the “Goop Day” team. “Every Tuesday we have a team of six women who go into the solar-powered community kitchen in Morro Bay and produce the healing salve we make with the calendula flowers,” Duell tells us. “So that’s the straight seed-to-shelf story.” Duell and her husband created a living example of best practices that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Four Elements Farm to touch coral reefs an ocean’s breadth away. This is an organic business that grew organically. Consumers can buy All Good Goop at Walmart, but the money is going back into everything Duell holds dear. There is no mansion at the end of the muddy road, past the red fence posts and the point when you think you’ve gone too far. There’s a farm. Of all the “this is what we’re looking for” moments from our trip, the morning at Duell’s farm is the one that best makes clear the statement we sketched across the map when we planned the trip—a farmer helping build the better world where more farmers could see more of their own products to market. It’s what we set out to find. It’s what people like Duell set out to build. Back on Highway 101, we call Jim Hightower, the columnist and former Texas agricultural commissioner. American farmers, he says need to be set free. “The ‘free’ in ‘free enterprise' is not an adjective. It’s a verb,” he tells us. The natural products industry can “free” up farmers to create enterprises like Duell has done, he says. In Texas, all that took at times was a nudge. “Give them a chance by helping plug them into the marketplace, they’ll take it and go from there. Government doesn’t have to own anything. It doesn’t have to run it. But it can be a catalyst for value-added products and diversified agriculture.” Much of the work Hightower did in Texas happened in the 1980s, but connections are easier to come by now than they were when farmers were isolated from the worlds of retail and commerce. A farmer can create a sales contract on a smartphone without climbing down from the tractor. New products can launch online and find their way to retail later. Crowdfunding can get a farmer and his value-added product a head start that was never going to come from selling eggs at a roadside table. We reach Annie Brown at the Rodale Institute who tells us that organic is just getting started. “I feel like there are so many avenues out. There are avenues that haven’t even been tapped, and more than ever, farmers are looking for ways to connect with the industry on different paths that haven’t been explored in the past.” A newly formed Organic Farmers Association is adding a collective heft to lobbying and marketing efforts, she explains.   “We’re just beginning.” We reach American Botanical Council founder Mark Blumenthal, who says the connection between American farmers and the supplement industry should and could be nurtured. The farmers we are meeting, he says, are “people who have their feet on the ground and their head in the stars.” ABC’s efforts to identify and combat adulteration could help farmers, American farmers, who are doing it right. “What we are doing has multiple benefits for multiple players up and down the value chain.” “There are,” he says, “plenty of options for farmers to get in the game.” But all the way down Highway 101, every phone conversation echoes back to what we saw on Duell’s farm: an idea, and a patch of ground to plant it in. It’s late afternoon when we encounter the first clots and snarls in the failed experiment that is southern California traffic. We are far from anything that looks like a farm, and closer with every stop-and-go inch to Anaheim and the frenetic immersion of Expo West. Our last stop will be a garden in Venice Beach, and we arrive in time for sunset, wine and Dylan on vinyl. Our host, the gardener, is Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association. . McGuffin has coaxed all manner of growth in a small lot at the cusp where the urban bulk becomes more beach town and less city with every block. Figs, flowers and a curated selection of herbs find root in McGuffin’s garden. He smiles and pulls and picks, enthusiastic to reveal the names, qualities and histories of every plant. He invites us to experience them by touch, smell, taste. In the Expo halls we will see elaborate installations built on marketing the promise of health. In this garden, we see the magic of the plant. “We forget,” he says. “That it all comes back to the plant.” McGuffin joins us for the last 40 miles to Anaheim. He brings two small piece of luggage, but his more important cargo is the bag of herbs and greens he has harvested from his unlikely garden. He is making a salad, he explains, for the APHA board of directors, and he has gathered 23 different ingredients he grew himself. He appears more excited about the salad he is making than whatever he expects to see at Expo West. McGuffin never loses sight of the essence as it comes from the soil. Our last miles, an intricate turn-and-merge navigation through the rush hour complexity of freeway and carpool lanes, includes a spirited conversation between McGuffin and Andrew. Across half a continent, we have chased the idea of supplement companies partnering with American farmers to shore up a sometimes shaky supply chain and root a share of the prosperity in rural communities. Andrew, a young farmer, is committed to seeing that idea realized. McGuffin, an industry veteran, has seen too many companies in the industry he helped build look past origin and quality to work on price and margin. It is not an argument, but the discussion is spirited. Andrew believes a confluence of forces that include growing consumer concerns about where their food comes from and new technology and tools to trace and tell that story is building momentum toward the paradigm transformation he wants to see. He speaks of that paradigm while McGuffin worries about the pressures of price and the lure of profit. McGuffin can name only a few companies that are holding the line. But by the time we see the exit for Anaheim, the young farmer is closer to convincing the trade association president that the hope they’d shared in the garden could be scaled up to match the spirit of the industry the veteran insider remembers from earlier years. We pull up to the Anaheim Hilton with more than 2,200 miles on the odometer. We step out of the car. McGuffin grabs his luggage and 23-ingredient salad, thanks us for the ride and slips into the it-hasn’t-even-started-yet spectacle of Expo West. It’s been a long trip. We should be exhausted. Instead we are energized, even invigorated. We weren’t sure what we were looking for when we left. And then we found it at every stop along the way.   This series was underwritten by: TAGS: General 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

(AP) – Clarksville police say investigators believe bounty hunters shot two men on Sunday in a reckless and dangerous incident that began in a Walmart parking lot, fatally wounding one of them, and that neither was the person they were trying to serve with a warrant. Jalen Johnson (Courtesy: The Johnson family) Police spokesman Jim Knoll said the department is going to ask the Montgomery County grand jury on Monday to bring charges related to the incident. RELATED: Family wants justice after bondsmen shoot, kill Clarksville father Department officials are giving few details about the incident before the case goes to the grand jury. But the family of a man who was killed says this is a case of mistaken identity, where out-of-control bounty hunters gunned down an innocent man in a very public way. The victim has been identified as 24-year-old Jalen Johnson.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 Stocks to Help You Build Retirement Wealth Here are two stocks that could produce fantastic returns in your portfolio over the long run. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Apr 28, 2017 at 4:26PM There are certain things you should look for in stocks you buy for your retirement portfolio. For example, steady and consistent profitability must be a priority, as should the ability to make it through tough economic times relatively unscathed. With that in mind, here are two excellent stocks you can use to build retirement wealth. The monthly dividend company Net-lease retail real estate investment trust Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is a stock that works great before and after retirement. With a fantastic track record that includes 16.9% annualized total returns since its 1994 IPO and average dividend growth of 4.7% per year, Realty Income can certainly help you build retirement wealth. Image source: Getty Images. As you can see from the chart below, Realty Income has generated roughly five times the total return of the S&P 500. And with consistent monthly dividend payments (561 in a row), Realty Income can provide a steady income stream after you retire. O Total Return Price data by YCharts. Realty Income's primary property type is freestanding net-lease retail. Think of retail companies that tend to operate as the only tenants in their building -- Walgreens, Dollar General, and Wal-Mart are some good examples that are among Realty Income's top tenants. No tenant represents more than 7% of the company's rental revenue, and the properties are spread out across 49 states and Puerto Rico, reducing location-specific risks. While many retailers are struggling, Realty Income's tenants aren't. Many are immune to e-commerce competition, and others are recession-resistant or even tend to do better in tough times. These tenants are also on long-term "net" leases, which means that they are responsible for property taxes, building maintenance, and insurance expenses. In a nutshell, Realty Income just needs to put a tenant in place and enjoy years of consistent, predictably growing income, which is then passed along to shareholders. And with occupancy of 98.3%, which has never dropped below 96%, the company has been quite successful in doing just that. You may have heard the phrase "slow and steady wins the race," and Realty Income is a great example of this concept in practice. An investment in Realty Income is not going to make you rich in a month or two, but over several decades, this business model can produce massive returns. Still the best big U.S. bank to invest in It may seem strange that I'm suggesting Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) as a stock you can use to build retirement wealth, especially considering that the bank is still dealing with the fallout from its infamous "fake accounts" scandal. However, that's exactly why I think now is a good time to get in. Since news of the scandal broke, Wells Fargo has underperformed the banking sector by a wide margin -- about half, actually. WFC Total Return Price data by YCharts. This is certainly understandable, as the bank's numbers have definitely suffered a bit because of the scandal. During the first quarter, Wells Fargo reported a year-over-year 23% drop in mortgage originations, and posted an uncharacteristically high 62.7% efficiency ratio, which CEO Tim Sloan called "not acceptable." While there is no telling how long the bank's numbers will suffer, I'm confident in saying that the post-scandal hit isn't likely to be permanent. For a long time now, Wells Fargo has consistently run a profitable and efficient banking operation, and has done it without taking unnecessary risks. This is why Wells Fargo emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis and why it's been able to grow so rapidly over the past few decades. And quite frankly, I don't see this well-defined long-term history of strong performance being permanently destroyed by the scandal. As you can see, Wells Fargo produces superior profitability to rivals, on a consistent basis. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. In addition, Wells Fargo pays a best-in-class 2.8% dividend yield, and I wouldn't be surprised if the payout rises considerably in the years to come. In short, this is a rock-solid bank (despite the scandal), and now could be a smart time to add it to your long-term portfolio. Matthew Frankel owns shares of Realty Income.

We didn’t have a Target or a Walmart, or restaurants like Olive Garden or Red Lobster (not that I’m complaining, although I’m not opposed to unlimited breadsticks once in a while). Because of this, it wasn’t until I moved to Dallas that I first stepped foot into an IKEA superstore. IKEA’s Frakta bag (left) is strikingly similar to Balenciaga’s new tote (right). Photo credit: Pinterest   Immediately, the maze-like store layout sucked me in and suddenly my trip to help a friend pick up a futon for his dorm room turned into my chance to buy all the things I never knew I was missing. Needless to say, I was converted to the Church of IKEA then and there. Apparently, I am not the only person enamored by the wonders that the megastore holds. French fashion house Balenciaga released a bag strikingly similar to its famous blue reusable tote. While the carry-alls were similar in style, they differed in price – Balenciaga’s version comes with a steep price tag of $2,145 while IKEA’s can be purchased for a mere 99 cents. Always one for a good laugh, IKEA’s creative team saw the opportunity to set the record straight on which of these bags was the original and whipped up a cheeky print ad that gave consumers a breakdown of how to spot the real cerulean staple tote. The print ad reads: How to identify an original IKEA Frakta bag. 1. Shake it. If it rustles, it’s the real deal. 2. Multifunctional. It can carry hockey gear, bricks, and even water. 3. Throw it in the dirt. A true Frakta is simply rinsed off with a garden hose when dirty. 4. Fold it. Are you able to fold it to the size of a small purse? If the answer is yes, congratulations. 5. Look inside. The original has an authentic IKEA tag. 6. Price tag. Only $0.99. In an era when fashion counterfeit and copyright are serious issues, IKEA’s advertising blast not only touches on the problem but also adds a touch of humor to it.   Print PDF #Balenciaga #IKEA Tweet Tell us what you think. <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8e16f20938&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536874147&cs=8e16f20938&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=4396099294&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536874148&cs=4396099294&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> SMU Look SMU CW Tweets from https://twitter.com/thedailycampus/lists/smu-campus-weekly Recent Posts Dallas Morning News Editor discusses media’s relationship with American people April 28, 2017 The Look, Season 3, Episode 9 April 28, 2017 WATCH: The Daily Update: Thursday, April 27, 2017 April 28, 2017 Press Pass: April 26, 2017 April 28, 2017 WATCH: The Daily Update, Wednesday, April 26, 2017 April 28, 2017 AP Wire The Latest: North Korea test-fires ballistic missile April 28, 2017 Writhing and gasping: AP reporters view problem executions April 28, 2017 Experts: Long road ahead for Trump offshore drilling order April 28, 2017 Trump's tweets aren't rocketing quite like they used to April 28, 2017 Trump tells NRA: 'You have a true friend' in White House April 28, 2017 Current Issue Access back issues through our Issuu.com archive. <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=a5863b166d&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536874149&cs=a5863b166d&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e0ebe31922&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538130021&cs=e0ebe31922&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Sign up for emailed updates Email Address* First Name Last Name * = required field powered by MailChimp! <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=65a0ff1213&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536874150&cs=65a0ff1213&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Load More...

Analyst downgrades stock after strong quarter by Nat Levy on April 28, 2017 at 9:02 amApril 28, 2017 at 9:02 am Comments  1 Share  1 Tweet Share  3 Reddit Email Tickets on sale for the GeekWire Awards! (GeekWire Photo/Kevin Lisota) Following yesterday’s positive earnings report, Amazon is well on its way toward hitting $1,000 a share, but one firm is unsure that the good times will keep on rolling. Pacific Crest Securities analyzed Amazon’s latest earnings in a report called “As Good As It Gets (For Now),” and found that increased competition in online retail and cloud computing could blunt Amazon’s momentum in both areas. Walmart, with its purchase of Jet.com and possibly Bonobos, is quickly becoming a formidable retail competitor. Amazon Web Services has supercharged Amazon’s bottom line in recent years, posting big numbers and helping the company turn large quarterly profits. While Pacific Crest sees Amazon retaining its cloud lead for the next several years, revenue growth and operating profits dropped slightly on a year-over-year basis compared to the previous quarter, a trend that could continue throughout the year, according to the report. And a lot of that has to do with competition. “The relative size and scope of AWS’ global footprint was a differentiating factor in 2015 and 2016,” according to the note. “However, heavy investments from Microsoft Azure last year and heavy investments planned by Google Cloud this year mean that AWS’ advantage in global footprint is beginning to narrow. Feedback from cloud industry leaders and partners suggest that Microsoft Azure, in particular, is starting to gain some momentum within large enterprises and government agencies that are considering decommissioning entire data centers and moving more aggressively to public cloud platforms.” As a result, Pacific Crest downgraded Amazon stock because it doesn’t see a lot of near term growth potential and the stock is sitting at a pretty high entry price for investors. Those in the past who have believed in Amazon have been richly rewarded. $10,000 invested in Amazon at its IPO in May 1997 is worth over $4.8 million today. $AMZN pic.twitter.com/JRXDXCIikO — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) April 28, 2017 The last few years have been particularly fruitful for investors. Amazon stock compared to Microsoft and Google over the last five years. (Screenshot Via Google Finance ) Pacific Crest laid out both a bull and bear scenario for Amazon’s stock in the near future. Under the more rosy analysis, Amazon stock could exceed $1,100 per share. That happens if the company’s big bet in India pays off and the online retail giant makes headway in China and other international markets. This scenario also assumes success coming from the company’s increased emphasis on grocery and apparel. Should this scenario come to fruition, Pacific Crest sees AWS contributing approximately 45 percent of Amazon’s stock value. Under the bearish path, which would see Amazon stock drop to $610, AWS starts to become less of a cash cow as competition catches up. In addition, Amazon wouldn’t see the kind of return it was hoping for from international investments under this scenario.

Gloria Taylor admitted to four counts of receiving stolen property and two counts of felony theft. The charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 60 years in prison and $60,000 in fines. In exchange for Taylor's guilty pleas, the state agreed to drop eight additional charges and recommend Taylor spend no more than three to 10 years behind bars, with any terms of imprisonment running concurrently. Taylor also agreed to pay restitution on the six counts to which she pleaded guilty. The totality of the allegations, including charges which were dismissed, claim Taylor spent $295,063.20 of company money without permission since 1999. Court documents say on Oct. 13, 2014, the owner and general manager of Rocky Mountain Brake Supply spoke with a Natrona County Sheriff's Sergeant and alleged Taylor, who had recently been fired, made personal purchases and donations using company money. Some of those purchases included Taylor buying two antique cars with a check written on a business account. After learning of those purchases, the general manager found several thousand dollars' worth of purchases made by Taylor without permission. Taylor had worked for the company for 30 years before being fired earlier that month. She worked as the secretary or treasurer for the business, and was responsible for paying bills, writing checks and tracking finances. That put her in a unique position to take advantage of the company, the affidavit says. A review of Taylor's bank accounts revealed few check and debit transactions over a two-year period, as well as a lack of everyday personal purchases. The investigation showed Taylor had opened a Walmart credit card on the company's behalf, but without permission. Over eight years, Taylor spent $130,927.62 at Walmart and paid the balances using checks from Rocky Mountain Brake Supply. Taylor served on the board of several wildlife foundations including the Wyoming Mule Deer Foundation and tried to "act like an important person" by spending and donating company money. Over seven years, she allegedly spent $17,830.11 with the foundation. The company had given her permission to make banquet table purchases with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, but Taylor's spending went far beyond banquets. She allegedly spent $25,728.36 of company money with the Wyoming Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, $24,927 with the National Wild Turkey Federation,$3,330 with the Wyoming Chapter of the Foundation of North American Wild Sheep, $5,450 with the Wyoming Wild Sheep Foundation and $2,350 with North Platte Walleyes Unlimited. Court documents say Taylor used company money to buy art in 2013 and 2014. She then would donate that art to various wildlife groups. In those two years, she spent $12,762.75 on artwork. Records from Sam's Club dating back to 2009 showed Taylor made personal purchases with money belonging to Rocky Mountain Brake Supply, to the tune of $41,268.46 over five years. Taylor also allegedly received cash for the company's scrap metal. Previously, Wyoming Steel and Recycling would empty the business's scrap metal bin once or twice a month and issue a check or cash to the business. In the year before she was fired, Taylor allegedly asked the payments be made in cash, and she picked them up on Saturdays without permission. Over five and a half months, those payments totaled $11,759.80. Court documents say Taylor also spent over $8,000 of company funds on tools for her own use. An investigator interviewed Taylor on Aug. 25, 2015. When confronted with the total amount of money she allegedly spent, Taylor reportedly seemed shocked. She admitted to a number of the purchases made without the owner's permission. Taylor reportedly said she made the purchases for personal benefit, but had not intended to hurt the company.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Fleet management and supply chain solutions provider Ryder System Inc. is reminding its 34,000 global employees to follow six road safety tips to reduce accidents and injuries. Ryder's "Drive Safety Home" project is timed to support the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, an annual international campaign observed each year on April 28 that promotes safe and healthy workplaces. The effort also supports Together for Safer Roads (TSR), a coalition of private sector members that promotes and raises awareness of safe driving practices. TSR was founded by AB InBev, AIG, and AT&T, and includes Ryder as well as Abertis, Ericsson, Facebook, GM, IBM, iHeartMedia, Octo Telematics, PepsiCo, Republic Services, UPS, and Walmart. Coalition members this week are working to improve road safety and reduce deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by encouraging employees to follow six basic practices: Don't text and drive. Buckle your seat belt. Respect speed limits. Don't drink and drive. Perform vehicle inspections. Be a responsible road user whether walking, cycling, or driving. "Today and every day we reinforce our longstanding commitment to safety by asking our people to make safety a personal responsibility, whether they are commuting to and from work, or driving professionally to support our customers' businesses," Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said in a release. #Logistics #Transportation #Trucking Resources Mentioned In This Article Ryder Together for Safer Roads Related Articles UPS, FedEx roll out pricing for ultra-short-haul delivery services Trade stakeholders welcome nomination of McAleenan as CBP head Hunt launches load-matching, e-commerce platform Feds begin long and (hopefully not) strange trip to regulate driverless trucks U.S.-Mexico trade relations to survive Trump's anti-trade rhetoric, Mexican official says More Videos » Transportation Videos Source to Shelf Transportation Management: Strategies and Tactics of Top Performers How Will the Trump Administration Impact Shippers Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

Procedures may vary from one location to another. Lucas County commissioners have called a news conference for today to explain where the county’s drop-off sites will be and how residents can participate.

The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration said pills can be brought in for disposal to the health department building at 635 N. Erie Street, Toledo. The service is free and anonymous, no questions asked, the department said. Ottawa County requests pills be removed from medication bottles and blister packs. Residents are asked to empty pills into a plastic bag before placing into any of the medication drop boxes.

Republicans’ latest effort to kill a Dodd-Frank provision that has cost banks billions of dollars is running into trouble. At issue is part of the 2010 law that limits how much money banks can collect from retailers when consumers use their debit cards. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling wants to get rid of the fee cap now that Republicans control Congress and the White House. But he’s facing resistance from other GOP lawmakers who either don’t agree with him or don’t want to pick sides in a high-stakes fight between corporate titans. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. have argued for years that it’s not the government’s role to set charges. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. counter that lower transaction fees lead to lower prices. The fight is coming to a head with the financial services panel set to vote on a Hensarling bill next week that would overhaul much of the Dodd-Frank Act. While Republicans are eager to start the process of rolling back post-crisis financial rules, some aren’t thrilled that Hensarling’s legislation would overturn the cap on card fees. ‘Most Contentious’ The issue is “probably the single most contentious portion of the bill,” Hensarling, a Texas Republican, told reporters on Thursday. “There is wholesale enthusiasm on our side of the aisle for pretty much every other aspect.” The so-called swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The limit on debit card fees, known as the Durbin amendment because Illinois Senator Dick Durbin inserted it in Dodd-Frank, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion in revenue, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. And while other aspects of Dodd-Frank often get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- card fees have probably drawn the most aggressive lobbying by lenders. Retailers also have spent millions to keep the fee cap intact. Stuck in the middle are politicians who would prefer cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. Now, it’s up to Hensarling to decide whether to remove the repeal of Durbin from his bill, cut a deal with Republicans who support the swipe-fee cap, or risk forcing lawmakers to vote on the issue. Individual Republicans might have to show where they stand if an amendment is offered when Hensarling’s committee votes on his legislation or when the entire House of Representatives takes it up later on. A Longshot It remains a longshot that the politically-divided Congress will approve any major financial services legislation, because most bills require 60 votes to pass the Senate. But if banks fail to get a repeal of the Durbin amendment through the House, it would mark a major setback. U.S. Representative Dennis Ross from Florida is among Republicans who support the debit-fee cap and want its repeal removed from Hensarling’s bill. “I’m not sure what the end game is for the chairman yet, we’re still working through it," Ross, who’s a member of the Financial Services panel, said in an interview. “I’m not alone in my concern. It may be that this Durbin amendment when it gets to the floor, maybe it will bog down the bill." Hensarling said he’s confident his plan to overhaul Dodd-Frank, known as the Financial Choice Act, will prevail regardless of how lawmakers resolve the debate over swipe fees. Warren Testimony House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said this week that he will seek a vote on the Choice Act “as quickly as possible” once it gets through Hensarling’s committee. Democrats have labeled Hensarling’s bill a gift to banks, and expressed their opposition at a Friday hearing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is one of Wall Street’s most relentless critics, testified, calling the GOP legislation a "589-page insult to working families" that would only make "big-time" lobbyists happy. Only two Republican lawmakers were present when the hearing started. This article was provided by Bloomberg News.

EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images Frank Behum visits the former Bethlehem steel factory in Bethlehem, Pa. By RicardoHausmann CAMBRIDGE (Project Syndicate) — What do Huntsville, Ala., Princeton Ind., Georgetown, Ky., Blue Springs, Miss., San Antonio, Buffalo, W.Va., and Greer, S.C., have in common? They are the locations where Toyota and BMW built their manufacturing plants in the United States. None is in the Rust Belt — industrial towns stretching from Michigan to eastern Pennsylvania — where much of the car industry and its suppliers were traditionally located. Evidently, the Rust Belt’s decline wasn’t the exclusive doing of China and Mexico. It was also caused by the auto industry’s geographic spread into other regions of the U.S., out of the clusters in which it had originally been concentrated. And this shift resulted not so much because General Motors GM, +0.29%  moved its plants, but because it lost market share to Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Of course, pointing this out doesn’t reduce the pain for those affected. But it does change the policy implications — and the lessons from the U.S. example are relevant worldwide. Two approaches have been pursued so far to help communities affected by this phenomenon. The first is embodied in the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which provides workers affected by international competition with financial support for retraining, job search, relocation, income maintenance and health insurance. The second approach is to provide trade protection to affected industries, as President Donald Trump has promised to do. Neither approach is likely to help the Rust Belt. Any economy’s success is very much affected by the performance of that sliver of activities that can sell their output to outsiders. And what is true for countries is also true for states, cities and towns, provided we redefine what we mean by selling to “outsiders.” These “export” activities have an outsize and amplified impact on the growth of the local economy as a whole. Every geographic area must buy products it doesn’t make and pay for them by selling to outsiders some of the output that it does make. But outsiders have the option of buying from others. So, these “export” activities face a level of competition that the local grocer, coffee shop or barber doesn’t. Moreover, the income brought into the community by the “exporters” creates a large multiplier effect. When a mine shuts down, the result is not just unemployed miners. The grocer, coffee shop and barber go out of business and everybody leaves, turning the place into a ghost town. Read: U.S. Steel suffers biggest stock collapse since going public 26 years ago The disruption can be caused not only by an industrial closure. Once upon a time, there were many relatively small department-store chains and other retailers with headquarters spread throughout the U.S. and outlets in a few towns. These headquarters brought income into their town by providing back-office services to their network of stores. But consolidation in the retail industry, driven in part by Wal-Mart WMT, -0.34%  and Amazon AMZN, +0.72% dealt a deathblow to many of these companies. The impact on the local communities where these retailers were headquartered was as devastating as a mine closure: the “export” activity ceased and towns shrank by a multiple of each “export job” lost. Video rentals, bookstore chains, pharmacies, home improvement stores, electronics and camera shops, catalog stores and more: all went the way of the horse and buggy. At the start of 2017, Wal-Mart had 5,332 stores in the U.S. It is headquartered in Bentonville, Ark., where it employs more than 18,000 workers. Clearly, trade protection doesn’t help if Detroit is competing with Blue Springs, Miss. Nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the bankruptcy of Blockbuster Video, Borders Books, CompUSA, Circuit City, Payless, or Virgin Megastores. In the meantime, employment at Amazon grew by 47% over the past year, to 341,000 people. But with Amazon employment concentrated in California, Texas, and Washington, the geography of those jobs is very different from that of those it is replacing. Read: Amazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did As with the geographic relocation of U.S. manufacturing jobs, TAA is not a solution for this kind of ailment. After all, whereas TAA targets individuals directly impacted by foreign competition, much of the competition faced by local economies is not coming from abroad, and many of the jobs being lost aren’t in the industries directly affected by outside competition, but in the surrounding economy. Facilitating individuals’ relocation does nothing for those left behind in shrinking towns. With industry after industry disrupted by technological change, much of this pain is hard to avoid. But interventions at the individual level must be complemented with assistance at the level of local economies. The goal should be clear: as a town’s “export” industries are disrupted, new “export” activities must take their place, lest the town shrink and become impoverished. This highlights the need for what U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has called a Modern Industrial Strategy, aimed at “delivering jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country” to “ensure [that] free trade and globalization work for all.” To achieve this, a new set of place-based policies will be needed. The point is not to prop up dying industries, but to increase the birthrate and reduce the infant-mortality rate of firms in industries that can take their place, especially those that can sell to “outsiders,” reconnecting each location with external and increasingly global markets. In their recent book “The Smartest Places on Earth,” Antoine van Agtmael and Fred Bakker document how this is already happening in parts of the Rust Belt, where many towns — such as Akron, Ohio, or Albany, N.Y. — have reinvented themselves. These places are not only recovering; we know from how they voted last November that they are also not buying into Trump’s wall-building agenda. Now read: The real reason for the trade deficit?

EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images Frank Behum visits the former Bethlehem steel factory in Bethlehem, Pa. By RicardoHausmann CAMBRIDGE (Project Syndicate) — What do Huntsville, Ala., Princeton Ind., Georgetown, Ky., Blue Springs, Miss., San Antonio, Buffalo, W.Va., and Greer, S.C., have in common? They are the locations where Toyota and BMW built their manufacturing plants in the United States. None is in the Rust Belt — industrial towns stretching from Michigan to eastern Pennsylvania — where much of the car industry and its suppliers were traditionally located. Evidently, the Rust Belt’s decline wasn’t the exclusive doing of China and Mexico. It was also caused by the auto industry’s geographic spread into other regions of the U.S., out of the clusters in which it had originally been concentrated. And this shift resulted not so much because General Motors GM, +0.29%  moved its plants, but because it lost market share to Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Of course, pointing this out doesn’t reduce the pain for those affected. But it does change the policy implications — and the lessons from the U.S. example are relevant worldwide. Two approaches have been pursued so far to help communities affected by this phenomenon. The first is embodied in the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which provides workers affected by international competition with financial support for retraining, job search, relocation, income maintenance and health insurance. The second approach is to provide trade protection to affected industries, as President Donald Trump has promised to do. Neither approach is likely to help the Rust Belt. Any economy’s success is very much affected by the performance of that sliver of activities that can sell their output to outsiders. And what is true for countries is also true for states, cities and towns, provided we redefine what we mean by selling to “outsiders.” These “export” activities have an outsize and amplified impact on the growth of the local economy as a whole.

Elizabeth Thomas lost a significant amount of weight while holed up in a Cecilville, California cabin with teacher Tad Cummins, 50, and has been left 'very, very fragile' by the ordeal, Thomas family attorney Jason Whatley says. Whatley told People that both Elizabeth and Cummins ate wildflowers at times to survive in the bare-walled shack where police found them in hiding on April 20. Cummins took out a $4,500 loan before fleeing with the girl, and purchased chocolate, cheese cubes, and KY Jelly at an Oklahoma Walmart on March 16, according to police.  Whatley blasted any assertion that Elizabeth willingly ran away with her teacher as 'amazingly absurd'. 'This is classic grooming and manipulation,' said Whatley. 'And I predict this case will be studied years in the future about how authority figures like Tad Cummins can mess up young children who believe their lies and are manipulated into doing things they would never do.'  Scroll down for videos  Thomas family attorney Jason Whatley, seen in a previous interview, says Elizabeth Thomas and her teacher Tad Cummins ate wildflowers to survive while on the run for 39 days Tad Cummins, 50, (left) disappeared with 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas (right) last month and was on the run for 39 days before police caught up with them in a California cabin The northern California cabin where they were found had no heat, water or electricity According to an inventory of items confiscated from the cabin by the FBI, there were four bedrolls, two vacuum filters, coconut oil, and socks. The FBI also confiscated beer cans and tissues Cummins was arrested last week in the California cabin, where he was hiding out with Elizabeth after the pair vanished from their hometown of Columbia, Tennessee, on March 13.  Their disappearance sparked a nationwide manhunt and Amber Alerts in several states before they were finally tracked down. Cummins 'treated her like a child at times,' said the lawyer Whatley. 'I think most people would agree that the combination of treating her like a child and an adult woman in the same relationship, like a light switched [and] turned it on and off, [is] damaging.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tennessee teacher, 50, who went on the run with 15-year-old...

Share this article Share 433 shares The teacher has not yet entered a plea to the charges he faces in the case. His lawyer on Monday released a statement saying he has 'no history of violence and no criminal history whatsoever'. The statement added that Cummins 'surrendered without incident and has been cooperative with investigators.' Whatley says that Elizabeth has been 'quiet' since being reunited with her family in Columbia, Tennessee. 'She’s had moments of being carefree and fun, but she’s very, very fragile and that’s something the family is watching very carefully,' he said.  The cabin in California was the final stop on a cross-country, 39-day life on the run for Cummins and Elizabeth, which also saw them staying in Motel 8s and a nudist commune. The pair disappeared from Columbia, Tennessee, on March 13. They traveled to Alabama the next day then on to Oklahoma where they were spotted on March 15 before dropping off the radar until April 20 when they were found in a cabin in northern California  Last sighting: The pair's last sighting before the arrest was at an Oklahoma Walmart on March 15 (pictured). They had dyed their hair to help evade capture DailyMail.com revealed that the pair had previously spent ten days hiding at a hippy commune near the cabin where Cummins was arrested, the Black Bear Ranch, where they posed as a married couple and were seen 'making out' like lovers by a camp fire While at the commune the pair frequently spending entire days in bed in this attic, even though the group expects at least four hours of work a day from everyone According to an inventory of items confiscated from the cabin by the FBI, there were four bedrolls, two vacuum filters, coconut oil, and socks. The FBI also confiscated beer cans and tissues. Police got a tip about Cummins' whereabouts the night before his arrest from the caretaker of the cabin, 29-year-old Griffin Barry. Barry, who is originally from Nashville, said he let the couple stay in the cabin in exchange for work and realized who the two were when a neighbor showed him a picture of Elizabeth's missing person poster.  That's when it all came together for Barry and he called to tip off police. Looking back, he said there was something suspicious about the couple. Barry is set to receive $10,000 reward for his role in Cummins' arrest. Barry says the two first came through the area two weeks ago, looking for the Black Bear Ranch Commune, and were going by the names John and Joanna.  The couple, claiming to be 38 and 24 years old, had run out of gas and Cummins told a sad story about how they lost all of their possessions in a house fire in Colorado and didn't have any money left. So Barry decided to be a Good Samaritan, and gave Cummins money, gas and directions to the commune.   'I put some gas in his car and gave him $40 dollars and said if it doesn’t work come back I’ll feed you, you know what I mean?' Barry, 29, told WKRN.  Police say Cummins (left) switched the license plates on his car several times and disabled its GPS system to avoid detection as he fled with Thomas (right) This cabin in California was the final stop on a cross-country, 39-day life on the run for Cummins and Elizabeth According to an inventory of items confiscated from the cabin by the FBI, there were four bedrolls, two vacuum filters, coconut oil, and socks Cummins and Elizabeth did in fact make it to the commune, where they spent 10 days sleeping on a filthy mattress in the attic of a communal building. But the members of the nudist colony sensed something was off with the two and decided against letting them into the group permanently. After getting kicked out of the commune, Cummins and Thomas returned to Cecilville on April 18, and Barry offered to let them sleep in one of his unfinished cabins in exchange for work. 'In my head I'm thinking he had a house fire and lost everything,' Barry said. 'I came out here on a prayer and people helped me out and got me on my feet and hopefully I can pass it on.' On Thursday, Cummins' wife claimed he had admitted he's slept with the teen and begged her forgiveness after he was caught. Jill Cummins, who filed for divorce from Tad Cummins after he ran off with Elizabeth Thomas five weeks ago, said her husband made the confession during a phone call from jail.  Jill Cummins told Inside Edition she had asked him straight out; 'did you sleep with her?' 'Yes I did,' he replied, according to his wife who said she hadn't wanted to hear any details of their relationship, but she had already known the truth. 'I just wanted to hear it from him to me.' Jill Cummins, the wife of Tad Cummins, who went on the run with his 15-year-old student claims he admitted he's slept with the teen and begged her forgiveness after he was caught Prosecutors in Sacramento claimed on Monday that Tad Cummins changed his license plates, paid in cash and even planned to take a boat from San Diego to Mexico, to keep one step ahead of the police.  Once across the border, he may have been planning to take her even further in to South America, they said. The documents, filed in federal court on Monday morning ahead of his first hearing claim he admitted to switching license plates on his car several times and disabling its GPS system to avoid being caught. He paid for essentials, including chocolate for the teenager, with cash and only took back roads to avoid roadside surveillance, they claim.  'The defendant had plans to attempt to escape across the United States border to Mexico. He then planned to seek passage to countries further south of Mexico. 'In furtherance of this plan, the defendant procured a small watercraft and conducted a test run to cross into Mexico across the water from San Diego.  'The defendant also considered the feasibility of a land crossing into Mexico,' they said.  Cummins appeared in court for his first hearing on Monday. According to the prosecutors, he planned to take Thomas to Mexico, and then on to countries further south Cummins spoke only briefly in court to confirm his identity, and agreed to be returned to Tennessee to face trial there, according to WAAY TV. Judge Kendall Newman agreed that Cummins should not be allowed any release terms after being told by the prosecution's claims that he had played a 'cat and mouse game' with officers who were hunting him. Assistant US attorney Jason Hitt added that Cummins had used 'his position of trust as a school teacher' to commit the alleged crime. That - and Cummins allegedly having two guns in the vehicle when he and the missing girl were found Thursday - make him a danger, he said. He also had at least seven pills of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis, they said.  'During his flight, the defendant engaged in a daring cat-and-mouse run from law enforcement in order to further his own prurient desires while engaging in a number of sophisticated maneuvers to avoid being caught,' prosecutors said in the documents. 'His actions in evasion were criminal.' THE PAIR'S FLIGHT FROM JUSTICE January 23: Tad Cummins is spotted kissing Elizabeth Thomas, his student at Culleoka High School, by another student.

News Business Style Beauty Shopping Careers Fashion Week Editors' Picks Events Join News Business Style Beauty Shopping Careers Fashion Week Editors' Picks Events Join Business The Problem with Fashion Brands that Call Themselves "Sustainable" Yeah, it's a problem. Avatar: Author: Andrea Cheng Publish date: Apr 28, 2017 Social count: 6 Yeah, it's a problem. 6 SHARES Welcome to Sustainability Week! While Fashionista covers sustainability news and eco-friendly brands all year round, we wanted to use this time around Earth Day and the anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse as a reminder to focus on the impact that the fashion industry has on people and the planet. It seems as though every week a press release lands in my inbox announcing the launch of an exciting(!) and revolutionary(!) sustainable fashion brand. And it's because these words — sustainability, eco-friendly, socially and environmentally conscious — are, at the moment, some of the buzziest in the industry — they give both emerging and established labels a newfound do-good, feel-good purpose that goes beyond simply selling clothes and raking in a profit. But really, what does it all mean? One emerging brand can claim itself as sustainable for harnessing the talent of artisans around the world to create handcrafted pieces in lieu of employing labor from a factory; another, for sourcing organic cotton or recycled materials, even as a fast-fashion giant. They’re different, yet they're both sustainable. Is one better than the other? And who determines that? First, it's important to understand what "sustainability" means under a fashion lens. Freya Williams, CEO of sustainability consultancy Futerra North America, says sustainability encompasses both environmental and social aspects, which means everything, from the making of the garment to the end of its life, has to be considered, including the materials used to make a garment (whether it's sustainably sourced or made from recycled content), the impact of said materials (how the cotton is grown, how much carbon is emitted, water usage), how workers are treated (human rights, fair wage), and finally, whether it can be recycled after or left in the landfill. "It's a huge challenge for the apparel industry because we're producing way more clothes than we really need," Williams says. "It's also very complex — we're talking about an industry that spans the globe, that employs millions of people, that is responsible, some people say, for being the second most toxic industry in the world." The biggest problem is the lack of standardization across the board. Nearly everyone I talked to compared the fashion with the food industry — or rather, how far behind fashion is as compared with food, which has a governing body, like the USDA, to certify whether a product is organic. "There is no third-party certification, which is the big issue," says Yael Aflalo, co-founder of cult-favorite eco brand Reformation. "It's a bad situation. There's nothing that creates standards for businesses to follow." That's not to say there hasn't been any progress. The Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an industry body that formed from a conversation between Patagonia and Walmart, has rounded up almost 50 brands as members to collaboratively work toward a solution. There's also B Corp, which determines whether a business is "good" — as in, a business that does its best to be socially and environmentally responsible — though it's not fashion specific. But there hasn't been one entity to come even close to setting measures or standardized guidelines. "There are brands that say they're eco and they're not, and it's irritating because you want people to walk the walk, but I also think it's a really good indicator, because it's the beginning of a shift," Aflalo continues. "When Reformation first started, no one was talking about sustainability, except maybe Patagonia. This is the beginning, and once we get certification as a whole, it's going to be a great thing." Williams says fashion lags behind food and beauty because there's less of a personal investment. "We've found that people are more motivated by a personal impact rather than environmental," she explains. "It's been easier to get consumers engaged with food because it's something that goes in your body; with beauty, it goes on your skin. Clothing is one step removed." Plus, it's incredibly confusing. If designers struggle with the complexities of sustainability, then how can we expect consumers to figure out which issues to care about? "It's like you need a PhD in sustainability to go shopping," Williams says. "The more difficult we make it for consumers, they’re more likely to tune out and not even bother — the industry has to take on the responsibility of what 'good' looks like." When I asked Genevieve Saylak and Corissa Santos, the design duo behind the new sustainable brand Where Mountains Meet, to determine whether it's environmentally better to source organic cotton overseas or non-organic cotton grown locally, they were left stumped. "I honestly don't know which one is better in the end," Santos says. "The best we can do is how we, as a small brand, can make a difference." Together, the two have established loose "in-house tellers" for Where Mountains Meet that they abide by, like being mindful about where they source materials, employing artisans, offering transparency to consumers, and setting goals to "do better" every season (as of now, not every piece from their collection is eco or artisan-made, but they hope that by spring 2018, at least one element from every garment will be). At Reformation, too, there's the RefScale, an internal measurement of how much water, waste and CO2 emissions the brand saves when producing a single piece (the brand was 50 percent more carbon efficient in 2016 than an average clothing company). Sustainability consultancy Eco-Age also has its own set of principles called Green Carpet Challenge, that it uses to verify product, or in Emma Watson's case, her entire "Beauty and the Beast" press tour wardrobe that was broken down via social media. Girlfriend Collective spins leggings from plastic water bottles. G-Star Raw did the same with Bionic Yarn for its denim. And Charlotte Turner, senior account manager at Eco-Age, says that there are exciting innovative fabrics in the works, like pineapple leather and a recycled polyester from Italy called Newlife. A couple more shout-outs: Filippa K works with a rental clothing model, and then there's Zady, a small brand that has pushed for transparency and spearheaded the slow fashion movement since its launch in 2013. Still. At the end of the day, for an industry that runs on consumers buying into trends season after season, it's a business that's inherently not sustainable. And that's compounded by the existence of fast-fashion retailers, like H&M. "The whole principle of H&M is anti-sustainability — it's all about volume, volume, volume," Saylak says. In its defense, Williams argues that at least H&M is making strides to practice sustainability to some extent. "You can't transform a massive global brand like H&M into a Zady overnight," Williams says. "I do think Zady has an important role in showing us a different approach to fashion and what that looks like. H&M's push to be circular and its ambitious sustainability strategy is interesting, and if they succeed, it can have a huge impact on a much larger scale." So, to answer the overarching question here — no, a fashion brand can never be truly sustainable. But what it can do is work toward making a positive impact and addressing issues. And on a consumer level, there's a way to make a difference, however small that may seem by first understanding where your clothes come from ("That was the nice thing about Emma Watson's Press Tour, because it raised awareness and it reached so many people," Turner says), and then by supporting brands that are at least trying to do good. "It's always better to buy something sustainable than something completely not," Williams says. "Buy secondhand, buy quality, keep your stuff for longer — there's a lot we can do to make our wardrobe more sustainable. It can feel overwhelming — daunting even — but everyone has a role in this and we should work together to get there." Want more Fashionista?

(Chun Kit To/Flickr) A student guide to a classic spring barbecue Sarah Urban — April 28, 2017 at 6:00 am The Eugene climate has been doing its best to fight through the rain and offer some cloudless days lately. Thankfully, those rare afternoons of clear weather are becoming more common. Eugenians are expected to see a spike in sunshine beginning on Friday and carrying on through next week. You know what that means — perfect weather to break out and break in your barbecue with a good old-fashioned cookout. But before you get too ambitious, let’s cover a few basic ground rules to save your guests from charred meat and a visit from the fire department.  Get a grill Are you missing the most important part of this event — an actual grill? Grills are available for cheap at stores like Walmart. You can find a functional charcoal or gas grill for less than $100, and you are set to start cooking. Preheat the grill I know the anticipation of showing off your dad-like grill skills might leave you impatient, but before you strap on your white New Balance shoes and retire your sunglasses to the top of your hat, make sure your barbecue has time to preheat. The flames might feel hot, but the grates take extra time to heat up. Meat placed on the grill too soon sticks and shreds when you try to pick it up and causes problems for temperature control. As spring weather becomes the norm, be prepared for any barbecue. (David McSpadden/Flickr) Beware the flames Similar to a child’s enchantment with fire, college students have another level of excitement when large flames start leaping out of the grill. But beware: it might look badass but big flames are almost guaranteed to make bad meat. You won’t appreciate the gross residue left on your food quite as much as you appreciate an enthusiastic fist bump from your fire-fascinated friends. Keep the flames to a minimum and move your meal to a cooler side of the barbecue to let the flare-up diminish. Direct vs. indirect heat If you use too much direct heat while grilling you will quite literally encounter a hot mess. The key to perfectly grilled food is temperature control. Failing to regulate the heat will leave your meat with a burnt outer layer and bleeding center. Create a two-tone fire by designating one side of the grill to be for direct heat, leaving the other side for the cooler temperature of indirect heat. With a gas barbecue this is as easy as lighting the burner on one side and leaving the other side with little to no heat. When using a charcoal grill, make sure to evenly distribute the coals on one side of the grill leaving the other half empty. Indirect heat can create an oven-like atmosphere and is perfect for large cuts of meat. Let the food sit for a bit Let the meat sit for approximately ten minutes before serving. I know your guests might be antsy to eat, but urge them to play another round of Cornhole and have some snacks while the meat rests. Cutting into your food too quickly will cause all the liquid to bleed out, which makes it dry and lack flavor. The delicious juices make for a much more tender and rich meal; resting allows time for those juices to be absorbed and distributed throughout the meat. Provide other entertainment and snacks Now that we have those tips and tricks out of the way, you are ready to take on the art of grilling. Invite your best buds and tell them to bring their lawn chairs; break out the snacks, drinks and music — it’s time for a classic backyard barbecue. Need ideas on what to make?

The confrontation occurred in Laurel County, near Corbin. Provided by the Laurel County sheriff's office Crime April 28, 2017 8:06 AM Video: Shoplifting suspect punches Walmart worker in Laurel By Morgan Eads and Bill Estep meads@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A suspected shoplifter repeatedly punched an employee of the Walmart in Corbin when the employee tried to stop him, according to the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office. Police arrested the attacker Friday afternoon with the help of tips generated by social media posts and media coverage of the attack. The incident happened about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday when the store’s loss-prevention team saw a man and a woman taking a flashlight, makeup and fingernail clippers, according to Laurel County Sheriff John Root. A male Walmart employee confronted the couple. As the employee was talking to the woman, the man punched the worker in the head several times from behind and took back the shoplifted items before running off with the woman, according to the sheriff’s office. The pair drove away in an older white Ford Escape, according to the sheriff’s office. The employee was taken to a hospital for treatment. Police caught up with the alleged attacker Friday at 12:55 p.m. at a residence seven miles west of London and arrested him after a short struggle, Root said in news release. Police charged Seth Harville, 26, of Corbin, with first-degree robbery and resisting arrest. Harville is the person who allegedly hit the Walmart employee. Police also charged Chelsea Kay Roark, 25, of Corbin, with first-degree robbery. Police also arrested two people with them. Kyle Holland, 28, of Laurel County was charged with hindering apprehension because he allegedly knew police wanted Harville but didn’t turn him in. Holland also was wanted on two outstanding charges of endangering the welfare of a minor. Misty Harville, 27, was picked up on a prior charge of failing to appear in court.

The announcement of Morrison’s appointment, as well as another appointment on the senior management team, came after the retailer announced its Debenhams Redesigned strategy, which aims to make its stores part of a “shopping experience” and promote the concept of “social shopping”. The strategy includes the reduction of stock, possible store closures, moving back-end staff into stores and attempting to bridge the gap between online and offline. Between 2009 and 2012, the retailer worked to build a strong focus on multi-channel retail and grow its social media presence, and had begun to see growth in the mobile and online space.   But retail has shifted from multi-channel to omni-channel, with customers expecting a more consistent, personalised experience across the entirety of a brand’s channels. This has also shifted the role of many physical stores to showrooms and experience centres rather than places for sales churn, but many retailers are not responding to this in the right way – choosing to close stores that are underperforming on sales rather than repurposing them as places customers can test or try products and be exposed to a brand. Read more about retail technology Examine how companies are starting to use big data analytics to deliver more personalised customer services. Retailer Sainsbury’s is targeting those with and without previous technical skills to become software development apprentices. Debenhams CEO Sergio Bucher claimed one of the focuses of this new strategy would be to build an “improved digital proposition” which the firm’s new senior management appointments would contribute to. “I’m thrilled to be returning to retail by joining Debenhams at such an exciting time,” said Morrison. “I look forward to being part of the team that will help Debenhams become the go-to destination for customers in this digital world.” In 2013, Morrison’s role as CIO at Direct Line saw her handling the migration of the firm’s IT systems away from former parent Royal Bank of Scotland’s technology platform, giving her previous experience in transformational IT projects handling legacy systems. Morrison replaces Peter Swann, who is stepping down from the role after four and a half years to join WHSmith as operating director. Morrison has also previously appeared in the Computer Weekly list of the top 50 women in UK IT, in sixth place in 2013 and 14th place in 2014.

Being on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean creates an unusual situation for those of us who live here full, or part time. I have been pondering this while living here since Jan. 1, 1989. You will never forget what I say to you on this day. I propose the following: We build four very large warehouses on the Big Island, one in the north, one in the east, one in the west and one in the south. These warehouses will be built up slope mauka to avoid large tsunamis and hurricane tides. They will be built very strong, and defensible, surrounded with chain link fence and perhaps razor wire on the top. They will house very large shelving units, similar to Costco, but movable. We will then stock them with enough basic food commodities to feed the area population where they are located for a period of two weeks minimum. Some foods become dated before others, and strict inventory will include the date of expiration of the reserve food units. Prior to the expiration date, the food will be moved to the back door, and distributed to the immediately hungry or needy, or sold for very little. This distribution can dovetail into the current food bank and food distribution efforts existing. No child on this productive island should go to bed hungry, period. I am not a doomsday person, but the threats can come from nature or mankind. We see it every day around the world. If the shipping containers stop coming to Hilo and Kawaihae, how long would we have before crisis and chaos emerge? How long before Costco, Kmart, Walmart, Longs and all grocery stores are stripped? I would estimate no more than 14 days, maybe less in a severe crisis. Can you say this is not true? Having a reserve of food available to feed people immediately would bring continued order for at least two weeks. We will call this phase 1. The alternate would be chaos and desperate people who act in violent and unlawful ways to obtain what they and their family need right now. When I am really hungry, I am a different person, irritable, distracted and focused on getting to some food. All people are the same, and multiply that by 100,000 and you have a force to be reckoned with. Having been a boy scout, which was a great experience thanks to some great uncles, the one thing I always remember and try to practice, is “be prepared.” Having four stocked and secure warehouses on this island will be excellent and recommended preparation for come what may. If it doesn’t come, food is being distributed on a fairly regular basis supplemental to other sources. Phase 2 would be how can we self-sustain in a prolonged world crisis? How much food can we produce with current land under cultivation? Versus current population? How much additional land can we press into production and on what timetable? Which crops will produce the most food for least amount of fertilizer and input of labor? How will we purchase and deal with current beef and cattle owners for their asset? How will we fish if current petroleum sources are disrupted? There has been much thought on this subject I read about. I think we should proceed to planned courses of action to implement Phase 2. There is a lot of work to be done and many unanswered questions, but when the collective will is set there is always a way. We are ohana, whether we like it or not, and the time might come when we will have to act that way to survive. Prepping together as ohana is preferable to individuals going it alone as we see across our mainland nation. Not having preparations if severe events strike is not an acceptable picture in my mind. In closing, let us prepare by considering the four warehouse project and how we will make it happen, ASAP. You will never forget what I have said to you on this day.

Hensarling Says Dodd-Frank Made Banks Even Bigger Republicans’ latest effort to kill a Dodd-Frank provision that has cost banks billions of dollars is running into trouble. At issue is part of the 2010 law that limits how much money banks can collect from retailers when consumers use their debit cards. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling wants to get rid of the fee cap now that Republicans control Congress and the White House. But he’s facing resistance from other GOP lawmakers who either don’t agree with him or don’t want to pick sides in a high-stakes fight between corporate titans. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. have argued for years that it’s not the government’s role to set charges. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. counter that lower transaction fees lead to lower prices. QuickTake Too Big to Fail The fight is coming to a head with the financial services panel set to vote on a Hensarling bill next week that would overhaul much of the Dodd-Frank Act. While Republicans are eager to start the process of rolling back post-crisis financial rules, some aren’t thrilled that Hensarling’s legislation would overturn the cap on card fees. ‘Most Contentious’ The issue is “probably the single most contentious portion of the bill,” Hensarling, a Texas Republican, told reporters on Thursday. “There is wholesale enthusiasm on our side of the aisle for pretty much every other aspect.” The so-called swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The limit on debit card fees, known as the Durbin amendment because Illinois Senator Dick Durbin inserted it in Dodd-Frank, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion in revenue, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. And while other aspects of Dodd-Frank often get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- card fees have probably drawn the most aggressive lobbying by lenders. Retailers also have spent millions to keep the fee cap intact. Stuck in the middle are politicians who would prefer cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Now, it’s up to Hensarling to decide whether to remove the repeal of Durbin from his bill, cut a deal with Republicans who support the swipe-fee cap, or risk forcing lawmakers to vote on the issue. Individual Republicans might have to show where they stand if an amendment is offered when Hensarling’s committee votes on his legislation or when the entire House of Representatives takes it up later on. A Longshot It remains a longshot that the politically-divided Congress will approve any major financial services legislation, because most bills require 60 votes to pass the Senate. But if banks fail to get a repeal of the Durbin amendment through the House, it would mark a major setback. U.S. Representative Dennis Ross from Florida is among Republicans who support the debit-fee cap and want its repeal removed from Hensarling’s bill. “I’m not sure what the end game is for the chairman yet, we’re still working through it," Ross, who’s a member of the Financial Services panel, said in an interview. “I’m not alone in my concern. It may be that this Durbin amendment when it gets to the floor, maybe it will bog down the bill." Hensarling said he’s confident his plan to overhaul Dodd-Frank, known as the Financial Choice Act, will prevail regardless of how lawmakers resolve the debate over swipe fees. Warren Testimony House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said this week that he will seek a vote on the Choice Act “as quickly as possible” once it gets through Hensarling’s committee. Democrats have labeled Hensarling’s bill a gift to banks, and expressed their opposition at a Friday hearing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is one of Wall Street’s most relentless critics, testified, calling the GOP legislation a "589-page insult to working families" that would only make "big-time" lobbyists happy. Only two Republican lawmakers were present when the hearing started. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo By Dominique Patton | BEIJING BEIJING A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation's main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. Soyoil sales account for about 36 percent of cooking oils used in Chinese kitchens, more than three times the next highest, and most of it is made from imported soybeans, which are nearly all genetically modified. The Chinese government says GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban consumers are replacing soyoil with sunflower, peanut or sesame, all free of biotech raw materials. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. "Everyone says soyoil has GMOs," said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. "Better not eat too much. Apparently they're not safe. It's like those hormones. I'm just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones." That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell 1 percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between 2 and 6 percent for alternatives. "Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil)," said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark's customers asked for GMO-free oil, he said. Now it's more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. PREMIUM PRODUCT The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to GMO oil, but that isn't translating into a boon for the nation's soybean crushers. China is the world's top soyoil consumer - it will use 16 million tonnes this year - but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China's 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labor costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country's top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet "escalating market demand". In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 15,000 hectares of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. That would be a very large plot; in the United States, the largest farms average around 1,052 hectares. Yang's team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. "If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan there," said Yang. Non-GMO oils - mainly rapeseed and sesame - already account for a fifth of the firm's sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. SHAKEN FAITH The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fueled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers' fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers' faith in Beijing's ability to guarantee the safety of the nation's food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. "Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don't buy it," said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. "We think peanut oil is a bit healthier."

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo By Dominique Patton | BEIJING BEIJING A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation's main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. Soyoil sales account for about 36 percent of cooking oils used in Chinese kitchens, more than three times the next highest, and most of it is made from imported soybeans, which are nearly all genetically modified. The Chinese government says GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban consumers are replacing soyoil with sunflower, peanut or sesame, all free of biotech raw materials. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. "Everyone says soyoil has GMOs," said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. "Better not eat too much. Apparently they're not safe. It's like those hormones. I'm just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones." That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell 1 percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between 2 and 6 percent for alternatives. "Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil)," said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark's customers asked for GMO-free oil, he said. Now it's more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. PREMIUM PRODUCT The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to GMO oil, but that isn't translating into a boon for the nation's soybean crushers. China is the world's top soyoil consumer - it will use 16 million tonnes this year - but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China's 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labor costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country's top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet "escalating market demand". In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 15,000 hectares of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. That would be a very large plot; in the United States, the largest farms average around 1,052 hectares. Yang's team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. "If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan there," said Yang. Non-GMO oils - mainly rapeseed and sesame - already account for a fifth of the firm's sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. SHAKEN FAITH The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fueled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers' fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers' faith in Beijing's ability to guarantee the safety of the nation's food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. "Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don't buy it," said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. "We think peanut oil is a bit healthier."

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Tech Giants Alphabet and Amazon Extend Earnings Boom ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Tech Giants Alphabet and Amazon Extend Earnings Boom By Rolfe Winkler and Laura Stevens Published April 27, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported booming quarterly sales and profits, showing that the tech giants continue to extend their dominance and shuck off concerns that might have dampened growth. Continue Reading Below Alphabet on Thursday said net profit in the latest period grew 29%, with no indications yet of an impact from a backlash that began late in the quarter from advertisers worried about their brands appearing near objectionable content online. Amazon, meanwhile, said first-quarter profit jumped 41%, marking its eighth straight quarter in the black, even as it continues to pour investment into expansion in new areas. Amazon's longest earnings streak since 2012 affirmed confidence among investors -- who had already driven its shares up 53% in the past year -- that Amazon has turned into a profit machine as well as a growth machine. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said success in its core operations is helping it expand in other areas. "The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams," she said. Strong results from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. provided further evidence that technology's juggernauts have nurtured businesses they helped found, such as cloud computing, e-commerce and online advertising, into full industries. Still, the industry is entering a time period of heavier investments as autonomous vehicles, drones and robots take off, which analysts warn could consume more capital resources. And the increasingly prominent position the tech giants occupy in society as well as in business exposes them to new kinds of risks, such as the broadcasting of violent episodes on Facebook Inc.'s live video tool. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A fuller picture of the tech industry's health will come next week when Apple Inc. and Facebook report quarterly results. Amazon and Alphabet's stocks hit new highs in after-hours trading. The boost to Alphabet's market cap was about $25 billion -- equivalent to the value of Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, the mobile messaging service that went public last month. "They're becoming bigger and bigger and their growth rates are unchanged, " said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, noting that Alphabet has increased revenue in its core segment by at least 20% every quarter for seven straight years and Amazon has done the same for over four years. Google credited its growth to the strength of its advertising business on mobile phones and on its YouTube video site. It seemed to avert a crisis when advertisers discovered in recent weeks that their brands appeared alongside offensive content on YouTube. Major companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulled their ad spending from Google except for targeted search ads. That boycott didn't dent Google's growth: Advertising revenue jumped 19% in the first quarter to $21.4 billion. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said the company had done "thousands and thousands of calls" with advertisers to address the issue, pointing to new "safeguards" to address their concerns. The impact of the protest could be felt more in the second quarter, if it picks up steam. In recent years, Google's growth engine has shifted from its traditional search advertising on desktop computers to mobile advertising, YouTube and automated ad-buying systems. The number of paid clicks on Google's ads soared 44% in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, benefiting from rising mobile-first internet usage. Google has come to dominate the online advertising market along with Facebook. The digital giants accounted for an estimated 77% of the U.S. online advertising market in 2016, up from 72% the year before, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, analyzing data published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Google and Facebook captured 99% of the online ad industry's revenue growth in 2016, estimated Mr. Wieser. On balance the rest of the industry was flat. The question plaguing Amazon was whether the online retail giant could sustain its growth despite substantial spending on everything from international expansion to video content. Amazon has long plowed most of its revenue back into product development and operations, including massive warehouses to speed products to customers. In recent periods Amazon has shown some spending discipline while it expands its operations overseas, bolsters its shipping infrastructure and broadens its library of movies and shows. Analysts expect the phase to last at least through mid-2018, in part due to Amazon's promise to hire 130,000 U.S. workers during that time frame. A big piece of that spending is coming in international markets like Mexico and India, where the company is building out its Prime offerings and competing against heavily entrenched incumbents. The international business has been stuck in the red in recent quarters. That remained the case in the first quarter, as the division reported an operating loss of $481 million. Sales increased 15.6% to $11.06 billion. Amazon's financial chief, Brian Olsavsky, said the company is boosting investments in a number of areas, including in video content, its Echo personal-assistant speakers and its Prime subscription program. Amazon is also investing heavily in warehouses due to strong growth for its business fulfilling orders for sellers on its site. "We're continuing to look for things that customers love, that can grow to be large, that we think will provide strong financial returns in the long run, and that also can last for decades," Mr. Olsavsky said. One of those areas is transportation. The retail giant has also started laying the groundwork for its own shipping business to add capacity for itself, with the grander ambition of one day hauling and delivering packages for itself, other retailers and consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. In the first quarter, Amazon said it is building its first air hub in Kentucky. It is also planning to add airfreight capacity for Chinese customers. The company is leasing up to 40 planes, with 18 planes currently in service, and has more than 4,000 dedicated truck trailer hitches as it aims to move more of its goods itself. And it has rolled out delivery in as little as an hour to more than 45 cities across eight countries. Shipping costs rose 34% in the first quarter to $4.38 billion, a lower rate compared with a year ago. "The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up and we think the cost is very good," Mr. Olsavsky said. Analysts flagged one concern for Amazon in the quarter: Growth in the company's all-important Amazon Web Services division continued to shrink. The decade-old cloud-services operation, which rents computing power to a variety of startups, government agencies and other corporations, has become a major factor in Amazon's recent streak of profitability. The division is facing tougher competition from Microsoft and Google, prompting concerns about whether the growth can continue on pace -- especially amid price wars. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business again posted torrid growth on Thursday as corporate customers adopt the service to handle larger pieces of their computing operations. Office 365, the online version of Microsoft's widely used productivity software, reported huge gains as well, as businesses increasingly subscribe to email, word-processing and spreadsheet applications that run in Microsoft's data centers. Intel posted an increase in first-quarter profit, helped by an uptick in PC demand. CEO Brian Krzanich said selling price strength across nearly every segment of the business in the quarter "demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." --Jay Greene and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

Fleet of autonomous hybrid trucks driving on highway. (Thinkstock) Advertisement Global consulting firm KPMG anticipates that as early as 2030, a new mobility services segment will emerge worth well over $1 trillion dollars for products and services related to autonomy, mobility and connectivity. According to KPMG’s 2017 Global Automotive Executive Study, which polled nearly 1,000 executives with the world’s leading automotive companies, 76% say just one connected vehicle generates more revenue streams than 10 conventional vehicles. At the center of this revolution are emerging deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools; sensor technologies that let trucks, vans or material handling equipment “see”; on-board supercomputers that allow them to become autonomous; near-ubiquitous over-the-air connectivity; and a set of new business models that unlock value from all of that technology.  Even in advance of autonomous vehicles we are beginning to see the early impacts of these technologies in the e-commerce and delivery sectors. Following the success of Uber (which today can get a car to 67% of the U.S. population within 10 minutes), Amazon launched its Amazon Flex application, which opens up last-mile parcel delivery to everyday vehicle owners as a similar transportation service on-demand. In conjunction with an expanding footprint of regional distribution centers and a growing fleet of Prime Air freighters, Amazon promises to change the game in parcel delivery—lowering delivery costs while simultaneously enabling same-day delivery in major metro markets. Already, Amazon-owned assets selectively service up to 44% of the U.S. population. Popular Now Tool and Dying: Auto Leaders, From Ford to FCA, Brainstorm on Saving the Shops that Sustain Them Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case Top 25 Supply Chains of 2016 Moreover, with the growing sophistication of e-commerce data collection capabilities and advances in deep learning and AI, large online retailers like Amazon and Walmart.com will likely be able to understand customer order patterns and predict demand far better than ever before, enabling them to invest even more in forward-deployed, local inventory. This could put even more pressure on the parcel delivery players. As online retailers are able to fulfill more customer demand cheaply and quickly from local warehouses, they could need much less of one of the most profitable services of the major parcel delivery firms: overnight shipping. Ironically, while Amazon’s investment in Prime Air acknowledges the criticality of overnight delivery today, Amazon’s investments in understanding customer behavior might serve to undermine that criticality tomorrow. Deployed together, these emerging technologies offer potentially powerful alternatives to the integrated parcel delivery business models that today predominate. It is not just USPS, FedEx and UPS that need to beware, however—“same-day delivery” is a game-changer for retail. With more products able to be reliably ordered for delivery “this afternoon,” brick-and-mortar retail traffic and volumes will suffer. As “same-day assortment” and selection improves, those e-retailers without the scale and volumes to deeply understand customer demand and forward deploy local inventories into major metro markets will be at a disadvantage in product categories and customer segments where immediacy of fulfillment dominates product feature or assortment. In long-haul trucking the potential may be as profound. Early pilots by Daimler, Otto (Uber) and others have demonstrated the feasibility of fully autonomous on-highway operation and offer the potential to safely open up four to six productive, on-road travel hours a day during which today’s two-driver rigs are parked for crew rest—often while idling and burning fuel to maintain cabin AC or heat. Platooning experiments by others such as Peloton are reporting on-highway fuel savings of 7-14% with vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems that allow multi-truck convoys to safely draft off of one another, slaving one or more rigs to the control of a lead truck. These are giant levers of profitability, with driver wages and fuel cost currently accounting for approximately 65% of operating cost per mile. The economic and societal potential is fantastic and will likely reshape the trucking and logistics industries. Higher rig utilizations and reduced on-highway fuel consumption will erode some of today’s rail and intermodal cost advantages and in so doing open up more time-critical loads to the trucking industry. New, lower-cost last-mile options will open additional home and small-office delivery markets. More local, targeted deployment of inventory will reduce the need for overnight air shipping, simultaneously lowering the cost and increasing the speed of delivery. Already in some global markets, we’re seeing reduced personal vehicle transit for shopping missions in favor of home delivery. It’s not just the technology that is changing. Consumers are increasingly responding to these new models. In fact, the rapid development and adoption of these technologies fuels and is fueled in part by the similarly rapid evolution of customer purchasing behaviors, including the demand for ever-faster fulfillment, the increasing expectation of free or very-low-cost delivery, the willingness—even eagerness—to purchase online (including once “off-limits” items like fresh fruits and vegetables), and the acceptance of novel delivery mechanisms. Consider, for example, some of the manifestations of the “sharing economy,” in which consumers sleep in strangers’ homes (e.g., AirBNB), get into strangers’ cars (Uber, Lyft), and routinely allow strangers without uniforms (e.g., Uber Rush) to deliver packages to and in some cases into their homes. Industry-shaping change is coming to retailing, consumer products, logistics and trucking as a start. First-movers are likely to be able to apply cost and speed advantages to grow share from late adopters. Success (or even survival) requires a clear view of where the market is likely to evolve to, thoughtfulness around changes to your go-to-market and organizational structures, a broad understanding of technology options, active engagement with potential new partners or acquisition candidates, and a focus on applying new technologies or business models to create an engine for sustained growth.   Tom Mayor is the national strategy leader for KPMG’s Industrial Manufacturing practice.

The approval was another step toward building a Lidl grocery store at the corner of Mahoning Avenue and Wilcox Road next to the Austintown Walmart. The commission included a provision that no light be seen where the grocery store meets any adjoining property. Three people were opposed, all of whom live along or off of Wilcox Road. “It’s a narrow two-lane road. Trucks already have problems entering and exiting the Walmart,” John Nock said. Teddi Oberman said it would be at the expense of the residential area nearby. The zone change still must be approved by the Austintown trustees. A public hearing and vote will be scheduled for sometime in May. .

Qualcomm says Apple’s refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartphones will take a big bite out of its profit and revenue. Apple Inc. has sued Qualcomm, saying the chipmaker is abusing its control over essential technology and charging excessive licensing fees. Qualcomm says Apple has indicated that it won’t pay fees until the dispute is resolved. Representatives for the Cupertino, California-based iPhone did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, April 28, 2017.

TVA adds 700 workers for Sequoyah refueling After generating more than 13.5 billion kilowatt hours electricity over the past 18 months, the Tennessee Valley Authority began a scheduled refueling outage Friday on the Unit 2 reactor at its Sequoyah Nuclear Plant near Soddy-Daisy. TVA is bringing in an extra 700 utility and contract workers during the maintenance outage over the next several weeks. About 10,000 work activities are planned, including loading new fuel assemblies, performing inspections of reactor components, maintenance of plant equipment and installing unit enhancements. "Outages like this are vital to continuing nuclear power's role as a key supplier of reliable, low-cost, clean electricity to those we serve in the Tennessee Valley," said Tony Williams, Sequoyah's site vice president. Sequoyah Unit 2 is one of seven operational TVA nuclear reactors in Tennessee and Alabama which collectively supply about one third of TVA's power. Minority supply group honors local VW plant Volkswagen's Chattanooga operation has been named "Corporation of the Year" by the TriState Minority Supplier Development Council. Also, Edkedsha (KeeKee) Mathis, Volks- wagen Group of America's supplier diversity manager for purchasing, was named "Corporate Representative of the Year" by the organization. Volkswagen accepted the awards during the annual Impact Awards Dinner in Nashville. The group selected Volkswagen Chattanooga for providing minority business opportunities. "This recognition does not mean our work is done, but only reinforces our efforts. We remain dedicated to promoting a diverse future," said Christian Koch, Volkswagen Chattanooga's chief executive. May job fairs hire for hundreds of jobs The Georgia Department of Labor has scheduled hiring fairs next month to fill hundreds of jobs being added or replaced by area employers. On Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Quality Staffing will try to hire 100 entry-level quality control employees to work in Rock Spring. The jobs will begin at $11 an hour. Nissan Brake in LaFayette, Ga., is recruiting 60 full-time manufacturing employees at a job fair next Thursday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Fort Oglethorpe City Hall, 500 City Hall Drive. Nissin is recruiting for casting technicians, industrial equipment maintenance workers and machine operators for jobs paying from $11 to $24 an hour. A job fair also is set for Thursday, May 11, from 3-7 p.m. at the Walker County Civic Center to hire workers for Amedisys Home Health and Hospice Care, Audia Plastics, Clumpies Ice Cream, Coca-Cola, Dixie Collision, Dollar General, EnviroGuard, Hammer Down OC, Hayes State Prison, Jimmy Simpson Foundation, Komatsu America Corp., Lake Winnepesaukah, Lookout Mountain Community Services, Mohawk Industries, Primary Health Care Centers, Quality Machine, Rock City, Roper Corp., Ruby Falls, Sprint, Shaw Industries, Vanguard National Trailer Corp., Victory Sign Industries LTD., Walker County Emergency Services, Walker County Sheriff Department, Walker State Prison and Wal-Mart. Apple ceases payments to Qualcomm for iPhone Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Employment costs up by most in a decade Wages and benefits paid to U.S. civilian workers grew steadily in the first three months of the year. The Employment Cost Index, which tracks wages and benefits, was up 0.8 percent in the first quarter, the Labor Department said Friday. That's the biggest quarterly growth since December 2007 and slightly faster than the 0.5 percent growth in the last quarter of 2016. Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of compensation costs, rose 0.8 percent. Benefit costs, which cover pensions and health insurance, increased 0.7 percent. The index has shown steady improvement as the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5 percent.

Holley site in Lantana. (Handout: Mike Langolf) LANTANA Lantana officials and the development group for the incoming Water Tower Commons project are on the same page: Apartments will be part of the residential phase of the development, and they will be marketed toward millennials. But the driving habits of those millennials and how many parking spots they need is where the two sides differ, which has led to a delay in finalizing the residential part of the former A.G. Holley State Hospital land. The developers who are working with The Richman Group want to change the parking ratio from 2.5 spaces per unit to 2.0, saying the town’s code isn’t up to date with the current generation. Less parking would allow more green space, the group said. “They really don’t want to put all this additional asphalt down,” Ken Tuma, a principal with Urban Design Kilday Studios, said on behalf of the project at the April 24 meeting. But town councilmen say they don’t see how one person with one car is going to be able to afford a rent of at least $1,200 and up to $2,000 without someone else’s help, who would bring a second car, and maybe even a third person, with a third car. The proposed apartments are 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms. “I just don’t see how it’s feasible,” Mayor David Stewart said at the meeting. This week, the councilmen turned down the developer’s request for the 2.0 parking ratio, and said they’d allow a 2.15. The group asked the officials to reconsider, and they did. But a motion to accept their 2.0 request failed. The developers hope to come back to the council May 22 with a new proposal, Tuma said. The Commons project has been in the works since 2014, when Lantana Development, a partnership between Southeast Legacy, headed by Kenco Communities’ Ken Endelson, and Wexford Capital, bought the land. The group paid the state $15.6 million for more than 70 acres. Councilmen have already approved the commercial part of the project, which will include more than 100,000 square feet of retail with restaurants. In March, the developer announced the first store that will be part of the commercial project: A Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market. The market will also have a pharmacy. Residents and the council members have known a grocery store would be built, but have long wondered what it would be, with some hoping for a Trader Joe’s. In the residential portion, developers are allowed to build up 1,091 units. The apartments proposed are only one phase of that. The plan was for 360 units in nine 3- and 4-story buildings. Only the four-story buildings would have elevators. Tuma said The Richman Group’s research shows only 30 percent of 1-bedroom units have two cars, and said the town’s code reads as if 100 percent would have two cars. The group also asked for instead of one guest spot for every two apartments, they’d rather one spot for every four apartments. The apartments would come with a clubhouse, a fitness center, an outdoor kitchen area with barbecue grills, game lounges with pool tables, a resort-style pool, a dog park and other usable open green space, according to town documents.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Communication with county of concern Comment from county planning commissioner sparks discussion at city council meeting By Sara Waite Journal-Advocate editor Posted:   04/28/2017 09:44:00 PM MDT The relationship between the Sterling Planning Commission and the Logan County Planning Commission was in the spotlight Tuesday night during the Sterling City Council meeting. During his report, City Manager Don Saling raised concern about a comment made at the last Logan County Planning Commission meeting by commission chair Dave Whitney. Whitney was talking about the requirement that when a permit application comes in for property along the city limits, the county is supposed to contact the city planning commission, and was quoted in the April 20 Journal-Advocate as saying, "whether they even want us to do that, 'cause I went to a meeting and they basically told me they didn't want anything to do with us." Saling said the comment raised some concerns "since we're trying to build a working relationship with the county and improving that relationship." " I guess I'm kind of asking if the city council would support communications to our planning commission to encourage them to have an open dialogue and a good communications process with Logan County," he said. "There are a lot of things that are happening on the edge of the city that will be coming to our planning commission as well as the city council, including a potential new big annexation and subdivision... I really think it's important to have good communications." Council member Bob McCarty expressed support for such a message to be sent to the planning commission. "We need to do everything we can to cooperate with the county," he said. Advertisement Mayor Dan Torres echoed that sentiment, saying "We need to work together." Both McCarty and Torres expressed surprise over Whitney's comment, with Torres saying "I couldn't believe it," and adding that he was concerned about that being the message the county planning commission chair took away from a meeting with the city planning commission. But at the last city planning commission meeting on April 5, commission member Linda Gebauer raised questions about a comment commission chair Stephen Bonham had made at the March 28 city council meeting about efforts to improve the relationship between the two commissions. Bonham told an unhappy Gebauer that he was speaking as an individual, not on behalf of the commission. She said she believed he should have done more to make clear he was not speaking for the commission. "This commission voted months ago that we were not going to pursue this line," she said. "It was evident the county certainly doesn't want to pursue this. And as I believe (Public Works Director) Mr. (George) Good had told us some time ago, if an issue comes up between the city and the county, that that is when there's communication, and there's meetings and that sort of thing." Other news from the city manager's report: • The Sterling Municipal Airport is now registered as an Aviation Development Zone (ADZ) with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, which qualifies aviation manufacturing businesses with at least 10 full-time employees located within the zone for a state income tax credit of $1,200 per new employee. • Undergrounding of power lines along West Main Street between Walmart and Domino's is expected to start in the next few weeks. The bid for the project from Sturgeon Electric came in at $639,587, about $160,000 under estimate, and will be funded from the Xcel Energy 1 percent franchise agreement fee. • The Water Division is assisting on a water main replacement on N. Sixth Street. The contractor working on the roadway experienced numerous water main breaks and the decision was made to replace the line. • Scalva Farm recharge wells have been drilled and crews are setting up to do the piping and electrical work. • The annual citywide Spring Cleanup was running about two and a half days behind schedule due to the large amount of trash, weather conditions, and a truck breakdown. Saling also noted the Sterling Police Department's Drug Take Back Day from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, and the I Am Healthy Northeast Health Fest at Sterling Middle School from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.

The news that the original cast and producers of “Roseanne” wanted to revive the show was a surprise, but not a bigger surprise than the fact that John Goodman would be involved. That’s because in the 1997 series finale of the original “Roseanne,” which ran for nine seasons on ABC, it was revealed that Goodman’s character, Dan Conner, had died of a heart attack. Latest entertainment videos Well, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Also Read: 'Roseanne' Revival in the Works With Original Cast on Board The entire last season of “Roseanne” took an absurdist turn, when Dan survived a heart attack, cheated on Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) with a nurse, and then the whole family won the lottery. But, as it turns out, all of that was just a dream, or rather, a fiction invented by the titular Roseanne in a novel she wrote based on her own life. In reality, Dan did not survive the heart attack and the family did not become rich overnight. So how to solve the Dan problem and bring Goodman back for a revival? Also Read: 'Roseanne' Reunion: John Goodman and Sara Gilbert Reprise Roles 20 Years Later (Video) There’s no word yet, but Barr herself had some ideas a handful of years ago. In a 2009 blog post, Barr revealed where all the “Roseanne” characters might be 20 years later and, yes, it addresses the Dan issue: “D.J. gets published, Mark dies in Iraq, David leaves Darlene for a woman half his age, Darlene meets a woman and they have a test tube baby, Becky works at Walmart, Roseanne and Jackie open the first medical marijuana dispensary in Lanford, Illinois, and pay off the mortgage before the house is foreclosed on, Arnie becomes the best friend of the Governor of Illinois, Mom sells a painting for ten grand, Nancy and Arnie remarry, Jerry and the grandsons form a band like the Jonas Brothers, Dan shows up alive after faking his death, Leon has a sex change op, [and] Bonnie gets busted for selling crack.” The original cast is hoping to mount an eight-episode revival, with Barr, Goodman and Sara Gilbert on board to reprise their roles. The original series executive producers Tom Werner and Bruce Helford are also on board to executive produce alongside Barr and Gilbert. The potential revival is being shopped to broadcast and digital platforms, and original network ABC is in the mix.

The president and his fan base in the right wing media are pretending that he has made historic accomplishments. In the reality-based world, the consensus is that he has done almost nothing. Both of those narratives involve the kind of metric we normally use to evaluate presidencies. If this one has been anything, it’s unprecedented. Using an alternative metric – the number of face-plants, falsehoods, flip-flops, etc, – there is no question that Donald Trump and his aides have brought us at least 100 horrors in the last 100 days. We thought that was worth documenting. 1. Gave a dystopian inaugural address that has been titled “American Carnage.” 2. Insisted on a special press conference (the first of his presidency) to claim that his inaugural crowd was the largest in history, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 3. Scrubbed the White House web site of pages related to LGBT rights, civil rights, climate change and health care on the first day. 4. Counselor Kellyanne Conway attempted to justify White House lies about the size of the inaugural crowd by calling them “alternative facts.” 5. Chose the former executive chair of Breitbart News and white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his Senior Counselor and Chief Strategist. 6. Signed an executive order reorganizing the National Security Council, giving Bannon a seat on the “principals committee” while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. After appointing H. R. McMaster as National Security Advisor, this executive order was reversed. 7. Issued a travel ban that was incompetently administered, leading to chaos. 8. Repeatedly claimed that 3-4 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. 9. Authorized a raid in Yemen in which “everything that could go wrong did.” While the al Qaeda leader who was the target was neither captured nor killed, it resulted in the death of a Navy Seal and dozens of civilians, many of whom were children. 10. Said that the media is the opposition party and tweeted that the press is the enemy of the people. 11. Hired Sebastian Gorka to be his top counter-terrorism aide – a man with long-standing ties to a Hungarian group that the State Department labeled as having been “under the direction of the Nazi Government of Germany” during World War II. 12. Nominated Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General – a man that the Senate had previously determined was too racist to serve as a federal judge. 13. Nominated Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education – a billionaire heiress with no experience or training in public education who has focused on advocacy for charter schools and vouchers. 14. Nominated Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency – an Oklahoma politician who rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and has been described as a leading advocate against the EPA’s agenda. 15. Nominated Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy – a former Governor of Texas who promised to eliminate the Department of Energy while campaigning for president in 2012. As recently as last fall, Perry had no idea that the Department’s main job involves overseeing the federal government’s nuclear labs and programs. 16. Nominated Ben Carson to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development – a neurosurgeon with no training or professional experience in affordable housing. Carson once referred to HUD activities as “failed socialist experiments. 17. Nominated a cabinet that is the richest in American history, with a higher net worth than the combined net worth of one-third of Americans. 18. Gave a speech at CIA headquarters in front of the Memorial Wall that focused on bragging about his electoral victory and the size of the crowd at his inauguration. 19. Refused to release his tax returns. 20. Refused to divest himself of his business interests, setting up what has been referred to as a “half-blind trust” in which his sons will manage his business interests and report to him quarterly. 21. Got angry on a phone call with the Mexican president and threatened to send U.S. troops to stop the “bad hombres” down there. 22. Lost his temper on a phone call with the Australian Prime Minister over a refugee program and hung up on him. 23. Issued a statement recognizing Holocaust Memorial Day that didn’t mention Jews. 24. At the National Prayer Breakfast, asked the audience to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on the Apprentice. 25. Took credit for cost reductions for the F-35 at Lockheed Martin when industry professionals credit them to efficiencies that were developed over time. 26. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban. 27. Referred to the judge who halted his travel ban as a “so-called judge” on twitter and said that he would be to blame if there was a terrorist attack. 28. Counselor Kellyanne Conway made up a fictional “Bowling Green massacre” to justify the travel ban. 29. Fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend the travel ban. 30. During a speech at U.S. Centcom, claimed that the “dishonest press” doesn’t want to report on terrorism. 31. Claimed that he is a “smart person” and doesn’t need an intelligence briefing every day. 32. When Ivanka Trump’s merchandise was pulled from some department stores, Kelllyanne Conway encouraged everyone to “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff” on Fox News. 33. Called Michael Flynn in the middle of the night to ask whether a strong dollar was good or bad for the economy. 34. In his Super Bowl interview with O’Reilly, said that he respected Putin. When asked about the fact that he is a killer, said “We have a lot of killers. Our country isn’t so innocent.” 35. Had to put Vladimir Putin on hold while he received a briefing on the New START treaty. 36. During a lunch with Senators, talked about the need for compromise on immigration reform, but had to be informed about the fact that the “Gang of Eight” bipartisan bill had passed the Senate in 2013. 37. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after current and former U.S. officials revealed that he lied about talking to the Russian Ambassador during the transition about lifting sanctions. 38. After being informed that North Korea had tested a ballistic missile, held a security briefing in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago. 39. In his first and only solo press conference, repeatedly lied and berated the press – leading many to label his behavior as “unhinged.” 40. At a campaign-style speech in Florida, referred to a terror attack in Sweden the night before that didn’t happen. 41. After watching a Fox News segment, sent out a tweet threatening to “send the feds” into Chicago to deal with crime – a threat that hasn’t (as of yet) been acted upon. 42. Referred to his deportation efforts as a “military operation.” 43. Reversed the Obama Justice Department’s order which phased out the government’s use of private prisons. 44. A week before Flynn resigned, Michael Cohn (Trump’s personal lawyer) hand-delivered a sealed proposal to him that came from a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and a Russian mob-connected former employee of the Trump Organization named Felix Sater that contained both damaging information on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and a Russian-Ukrainian “peace plan” that they hoped would facilitate the lifting of sanctions on Russia. 45. Released a budget that cut both EPA and State Department funding by 1/3 as well as decimating domestic programs in order to make a downpayment on his border wall and increase military spending. 46. Defense Secretary James Mattis has to talk the president out of using torture and assure Iraqis that we will not seize their oil – both of which would be war crimes. 47. Said, “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” 48. Employed a management style that created an atmosphere of tension, rivalries and backstabbing among White House staff that is often referred to as a “Game of Thrones.” 49. Repeatedly took credit when corporations announced U.S. jobs plans that predate his presidency (see: Toyota, Charter Communications, Sprint, SoftBank, Intel, Walmart, General Motors, etc.) 50. Justice Department officials revealed that Sessions met with the Russian ambassador on two occasions during the campaign and therefore lied during his confirmation hearing. In response, the Attorney General recused himself from the Russian probe. 51. In a fury over Sessions’ recusal, tweeted that Obama had “wire tapped” his phones during the campaign and compared it to McCarthyism and Watergate. 52. Accused Obama of wire tapping him without knowing the process for getting a FISA warrant. 53. Mobilized the White House to retroactively search for evidence to back up his lie about being wire tapped by Obama. 54. After February’s BLS report citing 235,000 jobs added, Spicer said the president told him to point out that such reports had been phony in the past, but are very real now. 55. Helped build a hotel in Azerbaijan that appears to be a corrupt operation engineered by oligarchs tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. 56. The Trump Organization received approval from China for 38 new trademarks. 57. Put son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has no government experience, in charge of forging peace between Israel and Palestine, steering relations with China and Mexico, reorganizing government, managing changes to the VA, criminal justice reform, and the fight against opioid abuse. 58. Issued a second travel ban, which was also blocked in the courts. 59. The Associated Press reported that Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, had been paid millions of dollars by a Russian oligarch to promote Russian interests. 60. Promised that no one would lose health coverage under Obamacare repeal. 61. After the Republican plan to repeal/replace Obamacare (AHCA) was revealed, negotiated with House Freedom Caucus members to make even more extreme. 62. Lobbied for AHCA after CBO determined it would lead to 24 million people losing their insurance and increased premiums, especially for the 50-65 year-old demographic. 63. Failed to garner enough Republican support in the House to pass AHCA. 64. Without replacements, fired 46 U.S. attorneys with no advance notice. 65. Claimed that Obama had used British intelligence to spy on him during the campaign. 66. Refused to shake German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s hand and then suggested that they had both been spied on by the previous administration. 67. At a House Intelligence Committee hearing, FBI Director James Comey announced publicly that Trump associates are under investigation to determine whether or not they colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. 68. Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers said there was no evidence that the Obama administration had spied on Trump or that British intelligence had been asked to do so. 69. White House aid Ezra Cohen Warnick summoned Rep. Devin Nunes (Chair if the House Intelligence Committee) to a clandestine meeting at the White House in which he shared intelligence documents suggesting that the communications of Trump associates had been inadvertently collected. 70. Nunes announced what he’d seen to the press without consulting with other members of the Intelligence Committee. 71. Later, during an interview with TIME, the president said that his claims about being wire tapped by Obama had been vindicated. 72. Blamed former National Security Advisor Susan Rice for unmasking the names of Trump associates in surveillance reports and suggested that her actions might have been criminal. 73. After reviewing the intelligence documents Cohen Warnick shared with Nunes, members of the House Intelligence Committee (both Republican and Democrat) said that Rice did nothing illegal or even unethical. 74. Federal court documents reveal that former foreign policy advisor Carter Page had been recruited by Russian intelligence operatives in 2013. 75. A group whose chair founded the company that paid Michael Flynn for lobbying work on behalf of the Turkish government announced that it will host a three-day event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. this spring. 76. The judge he critiqued for his “Mexican heritage” signed off on the settlement of a law suit against Trump University for $25 million. 77. Both the Secretary of State and the UN Ambassador stated that getting rid of Bashar al-Assad was not a priority for this administration in Syria. 78. A few days later, Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, something he hadn’t done since 2013. 79. After having denounced his predecessor for considering the use of military force in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons in 2013, ordered the bombing of an airfield in Syria. 80. In referring to Assad, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that “even Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons against his own people.” Spicer later apologized for making a comparison to a man who gassed millions of his own people in concentration camps. 81. A bombing raid in Mosul killed up to 200 civilians. 82. On the same day that she dined with President Xi at Mar-a-Lago, Ivanka Trump received approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks. 83.

Robelio E. Flores-Rivera and Adan O. Vasquez-Rodriguez, have each been charged with aggravated statutory rape, solicitation of a minor, and patronizing prostitution of a minor. TBI Special Agents — with aid from the Elizabethton Police Department, learned the alleged trafficking occurred at a motel along U.S. Highway 19E in Elizabethton, as Flores-Rivera paid a 14-year-old girl $60 and Vasquez-Rodriguez paid a 17-year-old girl $200, according to arrest warrants. Each man was held in the Carter County Jail on $50,000 bond after their arraignment on Tuesday. Their next court appearance is scheduled for Friday, and the TBI investigation into trafficking continues.   Early Wednesday morning, local police and state agents blasted into a Johnson City residence, leading to two drug arrests. Richard Jenny and Melissa Ferguson were jailed in the Washington County Detention Center, following the raid at 715 E. Fairview Ave. The pair were charged after agents found methamphetamine and weapons inside the house, according to a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation news release.  TBI agents used explosives to enter the house to act on a search warrant, creating “several large audible sounds” in the area. The raid was part of an ongoing investigation, the TBI said in a news release. Jenny had been stabbed and shot in recent months in incidents that also led to his arrest. In January, Jenny was shot by a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper during a traffic stop when he allegedly pulled a gun. He and Ferguson both have multiple arrests on their record. Aaron Garland, on trial in Jonesborough for the 2015 death of 59-year-old Karen Parker, was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and robbery. Garland was accused and arrested after he and an accomplice entered Parker’s home and took turns holding her down and ransacking her belongings in a search for car keys, money, and valuables. The two could not find the keys, eventually taking $45 in cash, Parker’s bank card, a $20 WalMart gift card, and her life. Garland’s co-defendant in the trial, Dallas Sarden, faces trial later this year. If social media is any indicator, it seems people are excited about the upcoming addition of a Publix store to our region’s grocery outlets. Publix Super Markets announced Thursday plans for a 45,000-square-foot grocery at the northwest corner of West Market Street and State of Franklin Road, which used to house a Food City store. A news release said the store will employ about 140 people. The Publix news release did not indicate an opening date, only that the store would be “coming soon.” As I sign off, I’d like to remind you that the Area 3 Special Olympics kicked off at the ETSU Mini Dome yesterday, and are continuing today. If you get a chance to visit the dome or support the Special Olympics in any way, I would very much suggest it. It is a very rewarding experience to say the least, and the athletes who compete are some of the most inspiring people you’ll ever meet, so get out and join in the cause.

Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 29 April, 2017 03:28 - - - - print email Comments VF, parent of The North Face, Timberland, Wrangler and other clothing and footwear brands, is promoting Sandra Harris to CIO effective January 1, 2018. Harris, who currently manages workforce productivity solutions as vice president of global business technology, will succeed Martin Schneider, who is retiring at year's end after 11 years as the retailer's CIO. VF Sandra Harris will become CIO of VF in 2018. Harris will work closely with Schneider on the transition, according to the company. "Sandra brings an excellent balance of technology, finance and business acumen to the CIO position,” says VF CFO Scott Roe in a statement. “She is the ideal person to build on the successful foundation that Martin established and further elevate the use of technology to support VF’s global business growth objectives.” Chasing Amazon.com’s tail VF, both a wholesale and direct-to-consumer retailer, faces the same challenge other retailers face: Competing for customers in the on-demand, instant gratification environment created by Amazon.com and other ecommerce companies. [ 30 CIOs share their strategic focus ] To address the Amazon factor, retailers are streamlining supply chains and refining data management strategies to hasten products to consumers. To keep up with consumers' digital and mobile browsing and shopping behaviors, many retailers are also building or experimenting with beacons, in-store tablet technology and augmented reality. Harris is inheriting an IT department that supports crucial digital initiatives for VF. The company has created retail innovation labs, modeled after real stores, to study how retail partners such as Wal-Mart, as well as consumers, react to displays and shop. VF has also invested significantly in its direct-to-consumer platform, using data analytics to inform and refine this platform and market strategy. "We actively harvest data across our ecommerce sites and transform the information into a ‘digital playbook’ that evolves and guides us on what to do next," VF says on its website. "While no tool can predict the future of digital, the playbook enables us to leverage shopping and behavior insights across brands to better understand changes in consumer preferences and then act quickly." VF expects to generate $4.4 billion in sales from its direct-to-consumer platform, 15 percent of which is currently driven by ecommerce, by 2017. A leaner, meaner retailer As it refines its digital playbook VF has also gotten leaner, selling off some businesses and reorganizing its portfolio. Earlier this month VF sold to Fanatics Inc. its Licensed Sports Group, which makes, embroiders and prints T-shirts and sweatshirts for universities, sports teams and Harley-Davidson dealers. [ State of the CIO 2017 research report ] Earlier this year, VF announced that it was folding its Lucy Activewear brand into North Face. In 2016, VF sold its contemporary brands business to Israeli textile company Delta Galil Industries Ltd. for $120 million. Harris, who in her current role oversees 500 people in managing workforce productivity solutions, previously served as VF's vice president and CFO of global supply chain and shared services and direct to consumer. Harris joined VF in 2008 after 11 years in the construction products industry, notably with Wilsonart International where she was responsible for the IT organization and held various leadership roles within finance and accounting.

The company announced this week that its 2017 M-Series and P-Series TVs will once again come with TV-based apps that can be used with a remote control. The company is also going to send out a firmware upgrade to its 2016 Ultra-HD TVs and all other 2017 models later this summer that will add apps to the big screen. All 2016 and 2017 models will still offer Chromecast built-in as well, so consumers will continue to be able to control them with their phone, and launch playback of videos from within mobile apps like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. Vizio took the radical step to ditch all on-screen apps in early 2016, and even shipped some of its TV sets with a tablet instead of a traditional remote control. The company also developed its own program guide app, dubbed SmartCast, for those tablets and other mobile devices in an attempt to simplify casting for its consumers. However, the decision to ditch on-screen apps altogether didn’t go over well with all consumers. Scan the reviews for Vizio’s 2016 TVs on Walmart.com, for example, and you’ll find plenty of reviewers complaining about the need to download apps to their phones, with some of them mentioning that it was the reason they ended up returning the device. A review of Vizio’s cast-only TVs on Walmart.com. Screenshot: Janko Roettgers/Variety Vizio released only limited details on its new TV apps platform. A release promised apps for Crackle, Hulu, iHeartRadio, Vudu, and XUMO. Netflix notably wasn’t mentioned, but a spokesperson told Variety that the company will reveal additional apps in the coming weeks. Vizio’s decision to once again add apps to its TVs could be seen as a set-back for Google and its attempts to make Chromecast the default interface for TV-based streaming. Google first released its Chromecast streaming adapter in 2013, and integrated it into its Android TV platform in 2014. The company struck a first partnership with Vizio to add Chromecast directly to TVs last year, and has since forged similar alliances with a number of other TV brands, including Skyworth, Philips, Toshiba, and Polaroid. Vizio is the first of these companies to integrate Chromecast with a built-in app platform that’s not made by Google. Then again, combining Chromecast with built-in apps could also help to give the technology a wider distribution without scaring off customers that aren’t as comfortable with using streaming apps on their mobile devices.

"It's impressive," said John M. Biela, who owns the Liquors 44 chain with Andrew Morrison. "There are a lot of local breweries out there. You want to find a home for them." Impressive is what Biela and Morrison need these days to keep up. They need to keep up with changing tastes now that everyone has a favorite local microbrewery, and woe to the retailer who doesn't stock a wide selection. And they need to keep up with changing business conditions for liquor stores in Massachusetts. Liquor, beer and wine stores are increasingly owned in chains, often with out-of-state owners. "It's not local anymore," Biela said. "For us, it came down to go or grow."   In August, Liquors 44 bought three Kappy's locations: two on Boston Road in Springfield and one on Memorial Drive in Chicopee. They join previous Liquors 44 locations on Lincoln Street in Holyoke, King Street in Northampton and Route 9 in Hadley. Liquors 44 hosted a grand opening Friday on Boston Road, having moved the store to the Lowe's Plaza from the old Kappy's further east. The new Liquors 44 is in part of a former Stop & Shop with better parking and easier traffic access headed in either direction on the busy divided commercial strip. Besides the cooler, the new location boasts 23,000 square feet of space. Of that, 13,700 square feet is retail showroom. Hadley was once their biggest store at 13,200 square feet. "It turned out to be too small," Biela said. At the new Springfield location, there are 25 employees, an increase of 10 since the move. There is also a mechanized redemption center that takes soda bottles and cans, even store brands, as well as brands Liquors 44 sells. The owners have plans to expand the former Kappy's in Chicopee, doubling it to 15,000 square feet. In the new Springfield store, they've built a tasting kiosk, basically a double-sided bar with no seats where folks can sample products. That's a reflection of a wide-open marketplace where there is not one dominant trend, Biela said. "Everything sells. Bourbons are hot. Single malt (scotch) is hot. Tequilas are hot," he said. When Biela got in the business in 1981, it was more likely that a single trend would dominate sales. At first it was rum. They couldn't stock enough rum. Then wine coolers -- remember the Bartles and Jaymes "Thank you for your support" ads? -- became the rage. And Liquors 44 needs to work against different competitors now. Larger chains have more buying power and economies of scale, spreading fixed operating costs out over a bigger business. Walmart bought a liquor license in Westfield and plans to sell beer, wine and liquor at its superstore there. Costco has liquor, wine and beer at its West Springfield location. National chain Total Wine has three Massachusetts locations: Shrewsbury, Natick and Everett. State law allows one owner to have as many as seven liquor store licenses. Starting in 2020, that limit rises to nine. Liquors 44 has six stores. "Eventually we'll get to seven," Biela said. "But it will be all in the Pioneer Valley. We don't want to get too far east." Liquors 44 won't expand right away because everyone has been busy integrating the Kappy's locations and doing the expansions and improvements.

Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies Connect with us HiTechGazette Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies Alphabet (Google) grows more than expected and eliminates doubts about advertiser leaks Share Tweet Companies Alphabet (Google) grows more than expected and eliminates doubts about advertiser leaks By Liam Davis Published on April 28, 2017 Share Tweet Comment We are in the time of presenting fiscal results for the first quarter of 2017. Now Alphabet has also presented its fiscal results, in that Google is responsible for the vast majority of its revenues after the company grouped their projects to manage them more efficiently. Let’s see these results in more detail. Fiscal results for Alphabet (Google) in the first quarter of 2017 Analysts initially expected Alphabet to have earnings $7.40 per share compared to $7.50 last year. Reported earnings are $7.73 per share that far exceeded investor’s expectations and amounted to $5.430 billion. In terms of income, Alphabet was expected to make $24.2 billion. Reported revenues are $24.750 billion, representing a total growth of 22% over the same period last year. This growth has been fueled by a rise in revenue on mobile ads and on YouTube. Alphabet has a growing trend of over 20% in the last three quarters, which is uncommon for a company that has been in the market for so many years. However, this quarter could have been a bit different as at the end of March many brands withdrew their investments in advertising after some media claimed that Google was placing ads alongside offensive content. Among those brands were Coca-Cola and Walmart. Google did not comment on how much this affected their accounts but what it did was give more control on platforms like YouTube to the brands for where they could and could not place their ads. Finally all this amounted for nothing as Alphabet continues to grow unstoppable as it has for so many years now. Cost per click repeats pattern: decreases as clicks increase The cost per click has not stopped growing since the introduction of smartphones, as there are more users, more searches, and hence more clicks on the ads. The problem is that advertisers spend less money on mobile ads which decreased the amount of money Google makes on per click. The cost per click dropped 19% compared to the same period in 2016. As we have seen, the cost per click continues to fall as the number of clicks increases. In particular, the clicks have grown 44% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. Google search app android 99% of Alphabet’s revenue came from Google while the “Other Bets” section generated a total loss of $855 million that included subsections such as the self-contained car or home thermostats. This segment posted $244 million up from $165 million in the first quarter of 2016. However as we saw the losses were also higher. These results have caused a sudden rise in the afterhours of writing the news. This rise at the moment is of 4% that assumes the value of per share has shot up from the $891 per share at the closing of the bag to $930 per share, this being its historical maximum in the stock market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ‘GoldenFlix’ slated for streaming classic movies and television shows Richard S. Hartmetz of Rochester is seeking $25,000 in his crowdfunding pledge drive with Indiegogo in hopes of funding his new movie streaming service. This new service, called GoldenFlix, will specialize in Hollywood classic movies and television shows in addition to independent films. The tentative start-up date for this new project is September 2017. “We are offering a unique opportunity to be part of a movement in the field of entertainment,” Hartmetz stated. “For far too long, classic movies have been overlooked. Thousands of classic films exist, showcasing some of the best writing, acting, and directing that has ever come out of Hollywood.” Hartmetz founded his own publishing firm in 2012, Starry Night Publishing, which specializes in giving novice authors a chance to get their works in print. In 2014, his affection for classic movies found its way into his company, and Hartmetz began offering movies on DVD, featuring the great superstars of the early to mid-20th century, such as John Wayne, Bette Davis, Jimmy Stewart, and many others. “These are the motion pictures that put the ‘class’ in classic,” Hartmetz said. “These are the films that Netflix won’t stream. These are the films that you won’t find on the shelves in Walmart, or your local video store. That’s not fair!” There are five pledge levels with rewards valued between $5 and $1000. Rewards range from a discount of 10% off the yearly subscription up to a free year on GoldenFlix. The estimated delivery time for the rewards is Sept. 2017. “Our plan is to create GoldenFlix, which will stream thousands of rare and hard-to-find classic films, for a small subscription fee,” Hartmetz said.  “We require funding to set up this streaming service and acquire the films.  The more funding we receive, the more films we will be able to acquire and more bandwidth we will be able to provide.”  Also, if the streaming concept is successful, the future of GoldenFlix will include “classic television shows from the golden-age of TV,” according to Hartmetz. And there may be slots reserved for some of the oft-ignored independent film industry. “This will be your service, a unique opportunity to preserve classic movies and short features from 1900 to 1980, and share them with future generations, commercial-free,” said Hartmetz. “Even if you are unable to support this endeavor financially, we would still appreciate your help in getting the word out about this worthwhile project.” Go to https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/goldenflix-stream-classic-hollywood-films-film-streaming#/ for more information about the project or to make a pledge.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧World News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / World News Sat, Apr 29, 2017 - Page 7　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp British inventor takes flight in an ‘Iron Man’ suit AFP, VANCOUVER British inventor Richard Browning prepares to lift off at a TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, on Thursday. Photo: AFP British inventor Richard Browning lifted off from the shore of Vancouver Harbour on Thursday in a personal flight suit that inspired references to comic superhero Iron Man. Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a TED Conference. The personal flight suit is capable of propelling the wearer much higher and faster, its creators said. “The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier. Browning told of experimenting with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs. Along the way, he said, there were more than a few crashes to the ground. “The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that,” Browning said. The first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on. His start-up, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called “Daedalus.” A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than 1 million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago. Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military, who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an Iron Man suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. “I don’t think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along,” Browning said. He dreams of a flight suit that one day would allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue their journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared with the Iron Man armor worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world. He also described the project as part of a personal journey, inspired by an engineer father with a love for flying machines, but who died when he was just a teenager.

Richard Browning, who has been dubbed the ‘Iron Man’ of Wiltshire, has constructed a personal flight suit and amazed delegates at this year’s TED Conference when he lifted off from the short of Vancouver Harbour. Mr Browning, a Royal marine reserve, said a member the British military had already displayed interest in the suit, and had told him that the Ministry of Defence had given up on the idea of flying soldiers until they saw his design. Although the MoD told the Telegraph they were unaware of the conversation, they said they are currently looking for ‘innovative military solutions’ as part of an £800 million scheme to improve defence. British inventor Richard Browning  Credit:  AFP  GLENN CHAPMAN The suit works using six miniature jet engines, or thrusters, which are attached to a rigid exoskeleton at the back and arms. It takes off vertically and can be controlled by moving the arms, while a display inside the helmet gives updates on fuel consumption. In a demonstration in Canada, Mr Browning flew in a circle for nearly one minute, hovering a short distance from the ground. He said he was inspired by his father, an aeronautical engineer and inventor, who killed himself when Mr Browning was a teenager. "I did this entirely for the same reason that you might look at a mountain and decide to climb it - for the journey and the challenge,” he told reporters. "My approach to flight was why not augment the human mind and body, because they are amazing machines, so I just bolted on what was missing - thrust."  sing thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground Credit:  AFP GLENN CHAPMAN He has now launched a startup company called Gravity, which is working on a marketable suit which they are calling Daedalus. "I don't think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along," Browning said. "I think of it as a bit like a jet ski, a bit of fun or a indulgent toy, but I do have a hunch that stuff will come along to make it more practical." Mr Browning said the suits is capable of flying at 200mph (321km/h) and an altitude of a few thousand feet for around 10 minutes, and insists it is safer than a motorbike. But he does not think that the system is about to go mainstream anytime soon.

Sabino Orlando Martinez, 35, was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiracy to interfere with interstate by robbery, conspiracy to use and carry firearms during a crime of violence and conspiracy to possess firearms during a drug trafficking crime, said acting U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston. Martinez previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine. According to testimony at the trial, Martinez was the man who fired the shot that killed Port Acres mom Allison Neil Clark, 24, on May 14, 2010. He faces up to 100 years in a federal prison at sentencing. Clark's mother, Sharon Neil, who attended Martinez's trial, said the conviction was a relief to the family, who didn't know who killed Allison for almost seven years. "I never thought I'd see this day in my life," said Neil. Martinez was part of a gang that "terrorized south Jefferson County for over 10 years," Featherston said. "They robbed, they exploited, they threatened, they found victims, especially women that they called 'lambs,' which was what their terminology was for their victims, before they robbed them," he said. Clark was found dead in the driver's seat of her Ford Excursion in the southbound lane of the 8000 block of West Port Arthur Road with the hazard lights flashing. She had been shot in the chest. Her 3-year-old daughter was found buckled and unharmed in the backseat, according to Enterprise coverage from the time. Earlier in the evening, Clark had gone to Wal-Mart on FM 365 to buy a gift for her nephew. According to information presented in court, Martinez and the gang members started robbing women in south Jefferson County parking lots beginning in 2001. They committed the robberies to support their crack cocaine habits and committed robberies almost daily from 2009 to 2011, according to Featherston. The gang members would get in special "Batman" suits to commit the robberies, he said. Featherston said Martinez and Orange resident Ozzie Nelson Ibarra, 40, were the leaders of the gang. Video surveillance footage from local businesses placed Ibarra's car in the area where Clark was shot. Ibarra was sentenced to 35 years in prison by a federal judge in February for federal violations related to Clark's murder. More than 17 members of the gang have been convicted of crimes related to the robberies, Featherston said. The case was investigated by the Port Arthur Police Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesley Woods, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Featherston said Woods, along with Port Arthur Police detectives Alton Baise and Paul Arvizo, worked for years on the case, even when it went cold.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Pai's net neutrality Hill briefing postponed By Li Zhou 04/28/17 10:12 AM EDT With help from Margaret Harding McGill and Tim Starks PAI'S NET NEUTRALITY HILL BRIEFING POSTPONED — FCC Chairman Ajit Pai had been slated to give a bipartisan briefing to House Energy and Commerce Committee members this morning on his proposal to roll back the agency's neutrality rules. But it's been postponed due to House votes today, and there was no immediate word on when it would be rescheduled. Pai, who publicly released his proposal Thursday, wants to undo the regulatory foundation of the 2015 Open Internet order. He's also seeking public comment on whether to keep, modify or eliminate the order's three "bright-line" rules of no blocking, throttling or paid prioritization deals. The initial congressional reaction to his plan split deeply along party lines, with Republicans applauding him and Democrats pledging to fight against any reversal. We're tracking. Story Continued Below — For your calendar: The FCC has confirmed that Pai's proposal is up for a vote at the commission's May 18 meeting, and there's a bunch of other items on the agenda. See the full docket for the meeting here. FIRST IN POLITICO: MAJOR FEDERAL IT OVERHAUL BILL RETURNS — Via our friends at Morning Cybersecurity: The Modernizing Government Technology Act, the ambitious plan Congress introduced last year for upgrading aging federal government computer systems, is back. But this time, it’s different. Today, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is reintroducing the bill that stalled late in the last Congress when the Senate balked at its price tag. Now it has a scaled back dollar figure, though the key concepts remain intact. And it has the backing of the Trump White House, despite one key element being held over from the Obama White House. Lead sponsor House Oversight IT Subcommittee Chairman Will Hurd tells Pro Cybersecurity’s Tim Starks that he’s more confident the bill can become law this year thanks in part to revisions that cut back the Obama administration’s plans for a $3 billion fund that would fuel future upgrades, reduce wasteful spending and make agency networks more secure. The revised bill would cap the fund at $250 million in the first year and another $250 million in the second year. The White House’s Office of American Innovation apparently played a notable role in crafting the revised language. The other main concept from last year’s bill would remain: allowing agencies to take savings from IT upgrades and spend them within three years, compared to today’s “use it or lose it” model that only gives agencies one year to spend those funds. What’s more, there are plans for a Senate version in the near future. Also, Hurd said, time is on the bill’s side. Last year, the House passed the bill in the late fall, leaving little time for negotiations. With a bipartisan slate of co-sponsors like the top Democrat on Hurd’s subcommittee, Rep. Robin Kelly, as well as congressional leaders like Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer — the legislation could see floor action soon. More here for Pros.

It’s not quite the jet pack future we were promised, but Richard Browning is flying. The vision, for the moment, is to build a new type of extreme sports equipment. [Photo courtesy TED] By Adele Peters04.28.17 | 10:50 am Eighteen months ago, British inventor Richard Browning tried an experiment: he strapped a small gas turbine to his arm to see if he could get liftoff (don’t try this at home, we’re obligated to add). Several experiments later, after he and his team added more engines to each arm and leg, his homemade jetpack was working, and he could fly for as long as 12 minutes. advertisement At TED 2017, he headed outside to demonstrate for the crowd. The vision, for the moment, is to build a new type of extreme sports equipment–though it could potentially be used in other ways, such as military rescues in areas where a helicopter might attract gunfire. Just saw Richard Browning fly his jetpack at #TED2017 pic.twitter.com/V8Qx39JVaT — Adele Peters (@adele_peters) April 27, 2017 “For the immediate future, I would liken it to a jet ski,” Browning tells Fast Company. “There’s no real practical purpose to it, it’s just a massive amount of fun. But, like technology has a habit, I think actually, by accident, we’ve opened up a whole new avenue of human flight.” Through his startup, Gravity, he’s working to build a version that can stay in the air longer and fly higher. “I don’t think anyone’s going to go down to Walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while,” he told the audience at TED. “But the team at Gravity are building some awesome technology that’s going to make this look like child’s play.” Browning’s vision of an “augmented human” was inspired by his father’s dreams of flight, and his own realization that a set of small jet engines might actually get him airborne. “I think we all, every now and then, dare believe something that’s on the edge of our capability,” says Browning. “And when that thing is also on the edge of what the rest of society thinks is impossible, that’s even more exciting. Sometimes, very rarely, one of those things gets across the line.” The engines could run on biodiesel, but Browning acknowledges that the flight suit isn’t exactly sustainable, at least in its current form. “Even in the display today, I think we burned through 12 liters of fuel,” he says. “It’s not an efficient way of moving around. But then, it’s early stage.” About the author Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.

Since then, they have struggled. Their latest chapter includes advocates who want a share of the money they collect for their wrongful imprisonment and a lawyer who expects a cut even if he is fired. Chuck Liddy cliddy@newsobserver.com Crime April 28, 2017 10:35 AM Pardoned brothers’ payout triggers fight over who gets a cut By Mandy Locke and Joseph Neff mlocke@newsobserver.com jneff@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Two and a half years ago, state prison officials handed Henry McCollum and Leon Brown $45 cash each to help them get their footing after three decades in prison for another man’s crime. Even in the best of circumstances, their homecoming would have been tough. The brothers have IQs in the 50s and 60s; and Brown is also mentally ill. They were plucked out of their Robeson County town as teenagers after being convicted of the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl; in the days after their release, family struggled to shelter them properly. Though free, they were broke and bewildered. Soon, they were surrounded by those who understood what they did not: Their suffering might one day bring big payouts. Over the last two years, consultants and lawyers from out of state have gravitated to the brothers, each aiming to stake a claim in any awards the pair might recoup. Now, some of those players are fighting with each other and threatening to sue over their slice of McCollum and Brown’s awards. “What a sad, sad situation,” said James Coleman, a law professor and co-director of Duke Law School’s Wrongful Conviction Clinic. “These two guys are in the worst position to take care of business for themselves. The state dumps them. They basically wash their hands of these guys.” At least one of these awards will come before a federal judge next month. The Town of Red Springs, where police arrested the brothers, has agreed to pay a settlement. The agreement has been filed under seal and awaits approval from U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle. Intervention with a cost The brothers were released in September 2014 after DNA evidence tied another man to the crime. McCollum’s former death row attorney, Ken Rose, and supporters of the North Carolina Center on Death Penalty Litigation tried to help each brother. They raised more than $14,000 for shoes and underwear, rent and utility bills. A social worker helped enroll them in Medicaid and for food stamps. Still, the brothers struggled while they waited for then-Gov. Pat McCrory to grant an official pardon, which would release state-mandated compensation of $750,000 to each. The family grew impatient. Kimberly Weekes, a consultant from Atlanta, heard about the brothers’ plight from a friend who knew the family. Weekes thought she and her business partner, Deborah Pointer of New York, could bring some pressure to bear on the governor to grant the pardon. She introduced herself to the men and Geraldine Brown, the sister taking care of Leon Brown. In January 2015, the brothers and their sister signed a contract with Weekes and Pointer’s for-profit company. The women, who bill themselves as activists, are not lawyers. They would bring “advocacy and civil rights” services to the case, the contract said. Pointer has worked in the field of college admissions; Weekes has consulted for a number of community outreach projects. In exchange, Weekes and Pointer would be paid an advance and receive a share of the state compensation and any civil awards the brothers received in the future. Weekes informed Rose on Feb. 2, 2015, that she would now be representing the family in civil litigation, the pardon process and fundraising. “They came out of the jail with nothing. … They were in pretty bad shape when we came on board,” Pointer said in a phone interview, defending their payment arrangement. “You reward people that help you. I mean, that’s how I work.” The consultants quickly expanded their role. They urged the brothers to fire their first set of civil attorneys, a lawyer from Michigan and a Wake Forest law professor; Pointer and Weekes solicited a new legal team. Eventually, after lunch at a Marriott hotel in Brooklyn, the women settled on Patrick Megaro of Florida and Scott Brettschneider of New York. “We knew it was a match made in heaven,” Weekes said of the lawyers. A bridge loan Even with the legal team in place, Weekes and Pointer stayed involved for several months. The two describe dozens of hours plotting strategy with the lawyers and working on publicity, including tweeting about the case and having students in Pointer’s New York City community activism class at Metropolitan College in New York City call the governor. Related stories from The News & Observer Brothers return home to freedom State approves payments to Henry McCollum and Leon Brown 2014 Death Row interview with Henry McCollum “[The lawyers] looked to us for everything. Everything. We did the soup and the nuts,” Pointer said. Weekes came to North Carolina to visit and says she spent eight days shuttling the brothers to Walmart and doctors’ appointments. Meanwhile, Pointer worked from New York to secure a settlement advance loan to take care of their living expenses. All told, the two worked for about six months and estimate they spent hundreds of hours helping them; Pointer said she has kept track of their work through email correspondence and phone lists. Pointer and Weekes said Megaro, the attorney, signed off on the loan to the brothers and offered his firm’s guarantee of repayment. The loan carried 19 percent interest. Of the $200,000 total advance, the women took $10,000 each as payment for their help. The $20,000 payment to Weekes and Pointer was to be the first of several, according to a copy of the contract Pointer provided. The women were to receive 5 percent each of the brothers’ $750,000 payout from the state and 1 percent of any potential award secured through civil litigation. The women said they provided their contract with the family to the lawyers and never heard any complaints. Megaro and Brettschneider would also receive a portion of any potential civil awards to the brothers. Megaro declined to say how much, saying it was a confidential agreement with his clients. Pointer and Weekes shared a copy of Megaro’s contract, which they say he provided for their review in March 2015. The contract shows a sliding contingency fee: a third of the first million, with 27 percent of any payouts of more than $2 million. Expenses would be deducted from any award. Such terms are standard in civil lawsuits for damages. But Megaro’s firm added an unusual safeguard. The contract calls for an “irrevocable interest” in the contingency fee he negotiated. Even if the brothers fired him and brought in other attorneys, Megaro would still receive his cut, according to the contract. That arrangement may run afoul of state ethics rules for lawyers that require fees be reasonable and earned, said Ellen Murphy, a professor at Wake Forest Law School who specializes in ethics. Megaro defended his compensation, saying he has invested thousands of hours in the case and has missed much of his sons’ lives while traveling to North Carolina to work on McCollum and Brown’s lawsuit. “I’ve represented them vigorously and zealously because I believe they have been wronged, in my heart…” Megaro said. “I have taken years off my life with the travel and stress of this case,” he added. Rose worked for The Center on Death Penalty Litigation, a non-profit, during the 20 years he represented McCollum; he and a colleague filed the brothers’ request for a pardon for free. Staffers at the center say they donated more than 100 hours of time trying to get the brothers settled after their release. Strained relations After nearly 10 months, McCrory pardoned the brothers in June 2015. The payments it guaranteed are not taxable. With the arrival of the money, allegiances began to falter. Relationships between Weekes and Pointer and the lawyers began to sour after Megaro did not pay them the $37,500 that each was expecting from the brothers’ state compensation. Megaro said the consultants’ contract with the brothers isn’t legally enforceable. “I have no agreement with Deborah Pointer and Kim Weekes,” Megaro said. “I never signed off on any agreement. I have never paid them a single penny nor did I authorize any payment to them, nor would I ever.” Weekes and Pointer vow to sue the lawyers. Other relationships have become strained as well. In a brief conversation with The N&O this month, McCollum had harsh words for Weekes and Pointer, calling them “snakes.” He said “they don’t deserve to get nothing” out of his settlement. Weekes and Pointer said McCollum’s words are hurtful and confusing. Weekes and Pointer also had a falling out with Geraldine Brown, saying “greed” took her over and that she was ill-equipped to care for her brothers. A Fayetteville attorney has now replaced Geraldine Brown as Leon Brown’s guardian. Geraldine Brown couldn’t be reached for comment. Despite quarrels over payments, this is clear: The women and legal team were in communication and collaborating in the spring of 2015, according to emails provided by Pointer. They consulted each other about media interviews for the brothers and a demonstration in Raleigh to apply pressure on McCrory to pardon the brothers. In the email exchanges, Megaro expressed gratitude for the help of Weekes and Pointer, including for alerting him that Brown had been arrested after he got confused one night and began banging on doors at a hotel where he was staying. “Thank you both for helping me,” Megaro wrote in an August email. “This new situation has now created a new sense of urgency so I will have to really start moving on some legal action to make sure he gets appropriate attention.” Brown, who suffers from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, has been declared incompetent and is a ward of the state living in a group home in the Fayetteville area. McCollum has moved to Richmond, Va. Rose, McCollum’s death row attorney, said he fretted over the brothers after Weekes and Pointer got involved. When Megaro was hired to take the case, Rose said the Florida attorney told him to “stay away from” McCollum. (Megaro denied driving a wedge between McCollum and Rose.) Rose has maintained a connection with his former client but is careful to avoid offering any guidance that could be considered legal advice. That distance pains Rose. “This is a guy I had been representing for 20 years,” Rose said. Locke: 919-829-8927 or @MandyLockeNews The story so far Henry McCollum and his brother, Leon Brown, were convicted largely based on confessions that Red Springs Police and agents from the State Bureau of Investigation said they offered. They had been charged with raping and killing 11-year-old Sabrina Buie. McCollum spent more than 30 years on death row; his brother was sentenced to life in prison. In 2014, officials from the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission found DNA evidence matching another convicted murderer on a cigarette butt found at the scene. Attorneys for the brothers had been previously told the evidence had been destroyed. The commission was evaluating only Brown’s case at the time. Commission officials shared the DNA findings with Robeson County District Attorney Johnson Britt and attorneys for the brothers in spring of 2014. Britt and the attorneys decided to jointly ask a judge to free them as soon as possible. A judge granted that request in September 2014. “It was the most perfect way to find justice as soon as possible,” said Britt. Because the brothers were not exonerated through the Innocence Inquiry Commission, the governor needed to grant them a pardon of innocence before they could collect their guaranteed compensation: $50,000 a year for each year in prison with a cap of $750,000. McCrory granted that pardon in June 2015. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:00 Police chiefs, residents stress trust, cooperation in PSA video Pause 0:48 Pardoned brothers’ payout triggers fight over who gets a cut 0:03 2014 Death Row interview with Henry McCollum 2:05 Clay Council on pitching to Josh Hamilton in home run derby 0:34 Grading the Panthers' selection of Christian McCaffrey in the NFL Draft 1:43 Duplin County hog farmer works to balance production and environmental regulations 2:12 Charlotte police defend officers after one put a gun to the head of an unarmed man 0:59 101-year-old woman wins 100 meter dash at World Masters Games 3:16 Take a ride inside Google's self-driving car 1:37 Managing waste and odors from hog farm lagoons Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email VIDEO: A 2014 video shows Henry McCollum and his brother Leon Brown returning home to their sister's house in Fayetteville, N.C. after being released from prison after 30 years.

The latest Marketplace-Edison Research Poll is out this week. Respondents were given the choice between two statements: “Immigrants take jobs away from American workers” or “Immigrants do the jobs Americans don’t want to do.” Sixty percent of Americans chose the latter. President Trump has ordered more deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally, and Texas has seen an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The Pew Research Center estimates that Austin, Texas, is home to more than 100,000 immigrants who live there illegally. They’re not just people doing those jobs Americans don't want to do; they're also consumers. A lot of them are staying home due to increased fears of deportation. Related Local law enforcement in California works with ICE in different ways What will Trump's border wall look like? The list of companies that want to build the wall is growing   “See right here at the Whataburger?" he asked. "And at the corner, what is this? Taco Bell? I saw some trucks, I don’t know. It was immigration or ICE.” Austin’s North Lamar neighborhood is home to a lot of strip malls, and the clientele is mostly Latino. I stopped in at a supermarket and taqueria called La Hacienda and asked manager Juan Rodriguez if business was down because people are afraid. Outside, he pointed to a couple of restaurants next door. In February, he saw trucks pull up and agents in uniform march into businesses. What Rodriguez was describing was part of a five-day nationwide sweep. ICE officers arrested 51 people in the Austin area. More than half had no criminal history; they were just living in the country illegally. Rodriguez said many La Hacienda customers disappeared for weeks, but they're slowly coming back. Javier Bautista stopped for lunch at La Hacienda. He wore the white T-shirt and pants of a painter, and splatters on the clothes showed he's been working. He said the big ICE raid put everyone on edge. “We’re afraid, but we’ve got to confront it and go to work" he said. "Because we’ve got to eat.” It’s a bit less risky for Bautista. He works in private homes, which are less likely to be raided. Those who work in restaurants or outdoor construction sites feel more exposed. “A lot of friends told me they didn’t show up to work many times because they felt they were being monitored by immigration agents,” he said. He said he's noticed a lot of businesses have less foot traffic. And it's not just Hispanic-owned ones like La Hacienda. “In the past months, I would see businesses empty," he said. "Wal-Mart was a little empty. HEB grocery was also empty.” The Spin Cycle Coin Laundry next door is feeling the effect of that diminished foot traffic. “What’s going on is that people are scared and don’t want to leave their homes,” said manager Marta Soto. She said daytime business has dropped dramatically and thinks it’s due to rumors that ICE only works during the day. She is staying open until 1 a.m. to meet changing demand. “Since they don’t want to come in the morning, they can at least come at night," she said. "So we can stay open because we have to do business with them.” It’s been several weeks without another major ICE raid in Austin. That has people venturing out a little bit more. But there’s a feeling there are more big roundups to come.

That’s how Edmontonian Jennifer Schoenberger remembers the Expo Centre one year ago, when she found herself among 84 local volunteers for the Red Cross assembled to do whatever they could to help. Wearing the signature red vest so aligned with the international relief agency, Schoenberger helped to house the most vulnerable among the Fort McMurray evacuees. That included pregnant women, the elderly and anyone else who wouldn’t be able to sleep on a cot among more than 2,000 displaced people. “I’m not sure you could accurately describe it to anyone who wasn’t there,” said Schoenberger, who has served at numerous local emergencies, from large-scale apartment fires to small-scale floods. “There were just people everywhere, waiting to be assessed, waiting to find out where they could put their heads down. They were exhausted, hungry … in all stages of grief … It was such an emotional roller-coaster.” The Red Cross was one of many local charitable and helping agencies that surged into action in Edmonton on or about May 3, 2016. Groups from the United Way to the Edmonton Humane Society rallied to help tens of thousands of Fort McMurray evacuees.   “My Red Cross Alberta team, it was all hands on deck,” said Jenn McManus, vice-president, Alberta and N.W.T., for Red Cross Canada. “We activated and deployed over 3,200 personnel from May 3 to now. This is officially our largest humanitarian domestic response since World War II.” Volunteers came from across Canada and the U.S. Red Cross volunteers came to Edmonton from across Canada and the United States to pitch in. Other local agencies also made contributions, though sometimes on a more modest scale in keeping with their specific mandates. The United Way of the Alberta Capital Region, for instance, is not traditionally a disaster service organization. But it distributed 1,300 backpacks full of pencils and paper to Fort McMurray students going to school in Edmonton so they could enter new classrooms with supplies. The agency is also now sitting on a planning committee charged with dispersing funds gathered by the Red Cross that continue to flow into Fort McMurray to support the rebuilding of the community. The Edmonton Food Bank also was pressed into service and found itself overwhelmed on at least one front by donations from the public. Executive director Marjorie Bencz recalled eight semi-trailers full of bottled water arrived, and bottled water isn’t something they even worry about carrying at the Food Bank. Two semi-trailers’ worth is still in storage. Bencz said her organization was “hit hard” providing food to evacuation centres both inside and outside of Edmonton. But the biggest strain at the Food Bank was on its hamper program. In May 2016, likely in response to Edmontonians having more guests staying with them from Fort McMurray, hamper usage spiked. In May 2015, the Food Bank distributed 15,773 hampers. In May 2016, that number was 23,681. Generous with food and money But Edmontonians were “good to us and generous in terms of food and money,” in response to Fort McMurray, said Bencz. She notes that the Red Cross has committed to provide funding relief for food costs the Food Bank incurred outside of Edmonton, but the cheque has yet to arrive. Dalia Abdellatif is now a paid support worker at Edmonton Emergency Relief Services (EERS). But at the time of the fire, she was a volunteer — one of hundreds who threw themselves into the effort. She remembers arriving at the EERS warehouse on 104 Street downtown shortly after the evacuation was announced, and seeing lineups down the street and around the corner. There were hundreds of people who either needed help or wanted to drop off donations. A chain of people formed, handing boxes of donated items one to another, leading into the 24,000-square-foot warehouse, which was filled and emptied more than once. After a few days, the City of Edmonton secured a temporary space for EERS to use as a donation distribution centre for new items — a former Target store at Kingsway Mall. Abdellatif, 40, a new Canadian who moved from Egypt five years ago, found herself in charge of organizing that centre. The first thing she did was draw a floor plan to organize where the toiletries would be located, where the clothes and shoes would go, and the cat treats. Then she set up at the reception desk and just got to work. Everybody wanted to help. Walmart sent over shopping carts. Home Depot dropped off cardboard boxes that could be packed with donations. Abdellatif left the distribution centre at 11 p.m., and was back early in the morning to open up, sleeping just a few hours in between. “But I wasn’t tired. I was fresh. When you see other people volunteering and doing all this work, it felt like I was doing nothing.” Volunteers were tireless Abdellatif said at least 500 of the centre’s volunteers worked each and every day from the beginning of the crisis to the point that the Target distribution centre closed on July 30, 2016. Cindi Hache, the organization’s executive director, says her organization received a $45,000 grant from the Red Cross to help with expenses, which included feeding volunteers. “For me, it was a really great experience; I haven’t seen that amount of volunteers willing to help. Whenever I remember, I just cry,” said Abdellatif. Volunteers interviewed by the Journal express a similar reaction. They saw people going through terrible times, and were just happy to be there to listen, to offer a hand. The Red Cross’ Schoenberg recalls colouring with two little children who had birthdays while at the Expo Centre. She sang happy birthday to them while their parents lined up for new clothes. Anything to create a sense of normalcy. “I’m just proud to be able to support under the Red Cross, and really humbled and inspired by the community,” she says. “Alberta really set the bar for compassion and understanding, and how we help each other out.” By the numbers The Red Cross response to Fort McMurray was its largest humanitarian domestic response since the Second World War. The organization raised roughly $323 million in this appeal. Breakdown: • $189 million came from Canadians. • $104 million came in matching funds from the federal government • $30 million came in matching funds from the provincial government Total: $323 million The money has been allocated as follows: • $231 million to support individuals and families • $50 million to support community initiatives • $30 million to eligible small businesses • $2.8 million to future disaster planning and preparation • $9.4 million to cost of fundraising, not to exceed five per cent of money donated by the public Other Red Cross statistics tied to the fire: • 10,900 plane and bus tickets booked to help people return home • 37,700 cleanup kits distributed to returning residents • 11,900 families received housing support, including assistance for rent, mortgage and utilities, plus other household goods • 1,950 families received interim lodging in Fort McMurray, Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and other Alberta Communities • 126,468 electronic fund transfers provided direct financial assistance to help residents meet individual needs • 147,000 calls received by 13 call centres to assist evacuated people • 65,000 families registered to receive support • 2,500 cots and 3,000 blankets, plus 2,800 hygiene kits distributed to eight evacuation shelters in Edmonton, Calgary and Lac La Biche.

Amazon.com Inc.’s unbroken 20-year streak of double-digit revenue growth shows no sign of slowing this year, helped by an influx of online shoppers who are abandoning stores and new business for its cloud-computing division. (Reed Saxon/AP) Of Bloomberg Amazon extends sales-growth streak, unfazed by lavish spending Amazon.com Inc.'s unbroken 20-year streak of double-digit revenue growth shows no sign of slowing this year, helped by an influx of online shoppers who are abandoning stores and new business for its cloud-computing division. The company projected sales that may beat estimates in the current quarter, reinforcing its message to investors that big spending on warehouses that hold inventory, movies that engage customers and devices that dazzle are all part of a winning formula. First-quarter sales increased 23 percent to $35.7 billion. Net income was $724 million, or $1.48 a share, the company said in a statement. Analysts estimated profit of $1.08 a share on revenue of $35.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares gained as much as 5 percent in extended trading after closing at a record $918.76 in New York. The stock has jumped 23 percent this year. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce in the U.S. with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 36 percent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

Operating expenses rose 24 percent to $34.7 billion in the quarter. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon on Thursday forecast operating income in the current quarter of $425 million to $1.08 billion on net sales of $35.3 billion to $37.8 billion. That compares with operating income of $1.29 billion on sales of $30.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Analysts projected sales of $36.9 billion in the current quarter. Amazon Web Services revenue gained 43 percent to $3.66 billion. That's slower than 47 percent year-over-year growth in the previous quarter.

And nearly half (47%) of likely Amazon apparel shoppers said they expect to buy more clothes from the e-commerce giant in the next 12 months and fewer pieces from other retailers.

Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a prestigious TED Conference. The personal flight suit is capable of propeling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators. "The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff," the extreme athlete and engineer says. How the flight suit was made Browning experimented with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs, and experienced more than a few crashes to the ground along the way. "The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that," he says, adding that the first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on.

His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called Daedalus. A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than a million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago. Check out another video of him flying: Future of the flight suit Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an 'Iron Man' suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. "I don't think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along," Browning says. He dreams of a flight suit that one day will allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue their journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared to 'Iron Man' armor worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world. He also described the project as part of a personal journey, inspired by an engineer father with a love for flying machines, but who died when he was just a teenager.

Marianne Lavelle By Marianne Lavelle Follow @mlavelles Apr 28, 2017 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson faces international meetings next month on the Paris climate agreement, but the Trump administration has yet to articulate its position on future U.S. involvement in the accord. Credit: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump's divided team of advisers met at the White House on Thursday to air their arguments over continued U.S. participation in the Paris climate agreement, just as international meetings rapidly approach where allies will expect to hear the Trump administration's plans. But there were no signs of a quick resolution. "It's still under consideration," said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Fox News afterward. He said the group met to discuss "all aspects" of the issue, and that the director of the White House economic council, Gary Cohn, "is leading the effort around coming to a conclusion on that." Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has maintained that the U.S. should stay in the accord to keep "a seat at the table" in climate change talks, faces an interim meeting on Paris issues May 8-18 in Bonn, Germany, with treaty participants still in the dark about America's posture. There has been no formal word from Trump on Paris since his campaign pledge to "cancel" the agreement.   Tillerson is former chief executive of Exxon, which has reportedly urged Trump to remain in the accord. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has argued that the U.S. should exit the agreement, which he calls "a bad deal for America." The upcoming Bonn meeting is not an official deadline. But with 195 countries signed on to the 2015 accord, which the United States—the second-largest emitter of carbon pollution—took a leading role in negotiating, international pressure will build for the Trump administration to articulate its stand. The Paris treaty also is sure to be an issue at the G7 summit May 26-27, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said a decision on the U.S. position will be announced before that meeting. The Trump administration was silent on what it would do about the accord even as the president signed an executive order directing federal agencies to rescind the regulations that were put in place to reduce carbon emissions as the U.S. pledged at Paris. Several recent analyses have concluded that the U.S. cannot meet its Paris commitment if Trump's planned policies are put into effect. But there have been clear signals that the Trump team is unwilling to do anything that would crimp the development of fossil fuel energy, which it considers a key to its economic policies. Trump's advisers have been at odds from the start about whether that means abandoning Paris outright. An internal memo circulating at the State Department bolsters Tillerson's case for continued engagement in the Paris process, saying that the treaty imposes few obligations on the United States, Bloomberg News reported. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both of whom now have formal roles in the White House, are thought to side with Tillerson on staying in the agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported that they were responsible for urging the president to strike language critical of the deal from his executive order. But White House strategist Stephen Bannon, who has called government support of renewable energy "madness," is believed to be a leading proponent of abandoning the Paris deal. The website he ran, Breitbart News, portrays global warming as a hoax. (See "Steve Bannon's Trip From Climate Conspiracy Theorist to Trump's White House.") The conservative advocacy group Competitive Enterprise Institute released internet ads this month arguing that participation in the Paris accord will raise U.S. energy prices and slow economic recovery. CEI's director of energy and environment, Myron Ebell, served as head of Trump's transition team for the EPA. Ebell was critical of Trump's executive order for not including a withdrawal from the Paris accord. "It is important to understand that all these policies are closely connected and that striking down most but not all of them will not be sufficient to undo the damage done by President Obama's energy-rationing policies," Ebell said. Some Trump advisers reportedly have advocated a middle ground: staying in the accord but putting in place more industry-friendly regulations to implement the U.S. commitment. The latest cabinet official to advocate a compromise was Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who said the U.S. should stay in the Paris accord but renegotiate the deal—which was 25 years in the making—in a way that forces European nations to take on a larger share of emissions reductions. "I'm not going to tell the president of the United States to walk away from the Paris accord," Perry said at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference in New York on Tuesday. "I will say that we need to renegotiate it." But that is not a compromise that is likely to mollify allies. A spokesman for Germany's environment ministry called Perry's position "absurd." Earlier this month, at a meeting of G7 energy ministers in Rome, Perry thwarted the group's customary joint statement on climate change by insisting that it include language advocating "high-efficiency, low emissions coal and natural gas." Perry's position reflects the views of some companies in the coal industry, including Peabody and Cloud Peak Energy, that have communicated to the White House their hope that the U.S. will stay in the Paris agreement, Reuters reported early this month. The report said the companies, which see international markets as their future, are hoping that the Paris deal spurs funding for carbon capture and storage technology through multilateral finance entities like the World Bank. The coal industry is far from united in this view, however. The National Mining Association's board of directors voted this week to urge Trump to exit the treaty, one day after Pruitt met with the group's leadership to discuss the Paris accord, according to a report by Politico. But heavy hitters in U.S. industry are coming out in favor of staying in the agreement. Sixteen large corporations, including Walmart, Google, Apple and Microsoft, and the fossil fuel companies BP, Shell, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, sent a letter Wednesday urging Trump to maintain U.S. participation. "U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response," the letter said. "We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework." The letter was organized by the nonprofit group C2ES, which has worked to build business coalitions for climate action. A separate open letter signed by more than 1,000 companies, retirement funds and investor activist groups also seeks to make the business case to Trump for staying in the Paris accord. "We want the U.S. economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions can help us achieve these objectives," they wrote. "Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk." Nathaniel Keohane, vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, put out a statement stressing the economic and geopolitical risks to the United States if the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris accord—including denying the U.S. the opportunity to help write the rules to ensure that China and others live up to their pledges. "Pulling out would damage the United States far more than it would damage global momentum on climate action," Keohane said. "It would undermine America's standing in the world, cede clean energy jobs and investment to China and Europe, and potentially even expose our companies to retaliatory trade measures.

Inspired by the Marvel comic superhero Iron Man, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground using thrusters attached to his arms and back, captivating attendees at the Vancouver TED conference. “The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” said Browning, an extreme athlete and engineer, at the gathering where he was representing his flight-suit startup company, Gravity. The personal flight suit, called Daedalus, is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster than demonstrated on the day, according to Browning. He said he had experimented with various numbers and arrays of the engines on his limbs, with some more successful than others. The current suit is capable of flying for around 10 minutes. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A test flight of the Daedalus from early April. “The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that,” said Browning . “I don’t think anyone is going to be going down to Walmart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at his Gravity is moving it along.” A video of Browning’s first reasonably stable, six-second flight in Daedalus has logged more than million views since being posted on YouTube in March. The company has posted various videos showing flights and adjustments to the gear throughout the testing process. A flight suit that could carry a wearer from the beach along the coast and into a mid-air helicopter for further journeys are a while away, said Browning, but the firm has already received interest from investors including some from those in the British military. They told him they had given up on the flight feature of an Iron Man-style suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear.

Video by Greg Southam. Share Adjust Comment Print Organized chaos. That’s how Edmontonian Jennifer Schoenberger remembers the Expo Centre one year ago, when she found herself among 84 local volunteers for the Red Cross assembled to do whatever they could to help. Wearing the signature red vest so aligned with the international relief agency, Schoenberger helped to house the most vulnerable among the Fort McMurray evacuees. That included pregnant women, the elderly and anyone else who wouldn’t be able to sleep on a cot among more than 2,000 displaced people. “I’m not sure you could accurately describe it to anyone who wasn’t there,” said Schoenberger, who has served at numerous local emergencies, from large-scale apartment fires to small-scale floods. “There were just people everywhere, waiting to be assessed, waiting to find out where they could put their heads down. They were exhausted, hungry … in all stages of grief … It was such an emotional roller-coaster.” Jennifer Schoenberger volunteered at the Northlands Expo Centre during the Fort McMurray evacuation in May of 2016. Greg Southam / Postmedia The Red Cross was one of many local charitable and helping agencies that surged into action in Edmonton on or about May 3, 2016. Groups from the United Way to the Edmonton Humane Society rallied to help tens of thousands of Fort McMurray evacuees. “My Red Cross Alberta team, it was all hands on deck,” said Jenn McManus, vice-president, Alberta and N.W.T., for Red Cross Canada. “We activated and deployed over 3,200 personnel from May 3 to now. This is officially our largest humanitarian domestic response since World War II.” Volunteers came from across Canada and the U.S. Red Cross volunteers came to Edmonton from across Canada and the United States to pitch in. Other local agencies also made contributions, though sometimes on a more modest scale in keeping with their specific mandates.  The United Way of the Alberta Capital Region, for instance, is not traditionally a disaster service organization. But it distributed 1,300 backpacks full of pencils and paper to Fort McMurray students going to school in Edmonton so they could enter new classrooms with supplies. The agency is also now sitting on a planning committee charged with dispersing funds gathered by the Red Cross that continue to flow into Fort McMurray to support the rebuilding of the community. The Edmonton Food Bank also was pressed into service and found itself overwhelmed on at least one front by donations from the public. Executive director Marjorie Bencz recalled eight semi-trailers full of bottled water arrived, and bottled water isn’t something they even worry about carrying at the Food Bank. Two semi-trailers’ worth is still in storage. Bencz said her organization was “hit hard” providing food to evacuation centres both inside and outside of Edmonton. But the biggest strain at the Food Bank was on its hamper program.  In May 2016, likely in response to Edmontonians having more guests staying with them from Fort McMurray, hamper usage spiked. In May 2015, the Food Bank distributed 15,773 hampers. In May 2016, that number was 23,681. Generous with food and money But Edmontonians were “good to us and generous in terms of food and money,” in response to Fort McMurray, said Bencz. She notes that the Red Cross has committed to provide funding relief for food costs the Food Bank incurred outside of Edmonton, but the cheque has yet to arrive. Dalia Abdellatif was a volunteer with the Edmonton Emergency Relief Services during the Fort McMurray disaster last year. Shaughn Butts / Postmedia Dalia Abdellatif is now a paid support worker at Edmonton Emergency Relief Services (EERS). But at the time of the fire, she was a volunteer — one of hundreds who threw themselves into the effort.  She remembers arriving at the EERS warehouse on 104 Street downtown shortly after the evacuation was announced, and seeing lineups down the street and around the corner. There were hundreds of people who either needed help or wanted to drop off donations. A chain of people formed, handing boxes of donated items one to another, leading into the 24,000-square-foot warehouse, which was filled and emptied more than once. After a few days, the City of Edmonton secured a temporary space for EERS to use as a donation distribution centre for new items — a former Target store at Kingsway Mall. Abdellatif, 40, a new Canadian who moved from Egypt five years ago, found herself in charge of organizing that centre. The first thing she did was draw a floor plan to organize where the toiletries would be located, where the clothes and shoes would go, and the cat treats. Then she set up at the reception desk and just got to work.  Everybody wanted to help. Walmart sent over shopping carts. Home Depot dropped off cardboard boxes that could be packed with donations. Abdellatif left the distribution centre at 11 p.m., and was back early in the morning to open up, sleeping just a few hours in between.  “But I wasn’t tired. I was fresh. When you see other people volunteering and doing all this work, it felt like I was doing nothing.” Volunteers were tireless Abdellatif said at least 500 of the centre’s volunteers worked each and every day from the beginning of the crisis to the point that the Target distribution centre closed on July 30, 2016. Cindi Hache, the organization’s executive director, says her organization received a $45,000 grant from the Red Cross to help with expenses, which included feeding volunteers. “For me, it was a really great experience; I haven’t seen that amount of volunteers willing to help. Whenever I remember, I just cry,” said Abdellatif. Volunteers interviewed by the Journal express a similar reaction. They saw people going through terrible times, and were just happy to be there to listen, to offer a hand. The Red Cross’ Schoenberg recalls colouring with two little children who had birthdays while at the Expo Centre. She sang happy birthday to them while their parents lined up for new clothes. Anything to create a sense of normalcy. “I’m just proud to be able to support under the Red Cross, and really humbled and inspired by the community,” she says. “Alberta really set the bar for compassion and understanding, and how we help each other out.” Related A year after wildfire: Fort McMurray's uneven recovery Fort McMurray artist uses charcoal from burned trees to create something beautiful Read more on the one-year anniversary of the Fort McMurray wildfire lfaulder@postmedia.com By the numbers The Red Cross response to Fort McMurray was its largest humanitarian domestic response since the Second World War.

The personal flight suit is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators. “The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier. Browning described experimenting with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs. Along the way, he said, there were more than a few crashes to the ground. “The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that,” Browning said. The first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on. His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early version suit called Daedalus. Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an “Iron Man” suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. “I don’t think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along,” Browning said. He dreams of a flight suit that one day will allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue the journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared with “Iron Man” armor worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world. He also described the project as part of a personal journey, inspired by an engineer father with a love for flying machines, but who died when he was just a teenager.

Uber said he’ll take a lesser role on the team and won’t be involved in decisions relating to lidar technology, which is the subject of the suit. Mr Levandowski explained the changes in a staff email obtained by Bloomberg. He said he decided, along with Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, that he should recuse himself from working on lidar, the laser technology used to help self-driving cars see the road. “I currently don’t provide input on detailed LiDAR design choices. But making this organisational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work,” Mr Levandowski wrote in the email. “Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic.” Business Insider reported the change in leadership earlier Thursday. Read more Uber's head of communication becomes latest senior executive to leave Waymo, a sister company of Google working on autonomous vehicles, alleged that Mr Levandowki stole its lidar designs when he was employed there and used them to build the technology that underpins Uber’s self-driving cars. Mr Levandowski joined Uber last year after the ride-hailing company acquired his autonomous trucking startup Otto. Before the legal drama, Mr Kalanick and Mr Levandowski had developed a close bond. Mr Kalanick had described Mr Levandowski as a “brother from another mother.” The company has hired aggressively to build up its autonomous vehicle program for the past few years. After the acquisition of Otto last year, Mr Kalanick put Mr Levandowski at the top of the effort. The 40-year-old CEO has called the race to market self-driving technology an existential threat to Uber’s business.

Former US Attorney General Eric Holder is conducting an internal investigation of the company’s cultural practices after a former employee alleged that her manager had propositioned her for sex and that the company’s human resources department hadn’t taken action. Uber’s chief US competitor, Lyft, is on the rise, catching a tailwind from the #DeleteUber movement. Uber has said its performance last quarter was in line with expectations. Mr Levandowski’s decision to assert his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying has complicated Uber’s legal defence. Alphabet has accused Mr Levandowski of stealing 14,000 files while he worked there. Alphabet claims Mr Levandowski used the files to help Uber replicate Waymo’s lidar technology. Uber has argued that another team at Uber developed the company’s lidar.

The good news is that more and more companies are recognizing this and setting goals. Almost half of Fortune 500 companies (48 percent) have at least one climate change or clean-energy target on the books, an increase from years past. These findings and more comprise a joint report from the World Wildlife Fund, Calvert Investments, CDP and Ceres entitled Power Forward 3.0: How the largest US companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change. The cohort of researchers insist emissions-reduction projects save money: Almost 80,000 projects employed by 190 companies netted almost $3.7 billion in savings last year alone. The annual emissions reductions from these projects equated to taking 45 coal-fired power plants offline for one year. Both the largest and smallest Fortune 500 companies are leading the way. The Fortune 100, the largest companies in the index, continue to be the leaders: 63 percent of them have set one or more clean energy targets. Forty-four percent of the smallest 100 companies in the index have set goals in one or more categories, a 19 percent increase from 2014. Companies within the consumer staples sector have the largest amount of companies with targets, while the energy sector has the smallest amount. Corporate goals are more ambitious than ever One of the most significant new trends among the Fortune 500 is the increasing ambitiousness of the goals, with more companies moving to create science-based targets and set 100 renewable energy goals, the cohort representing NGOs and an investment body concluded. As of January, 210 companies set targets through the Science Based Targets initiative, which galvanizes corporate goal-setting based on climate science. These leaders include American multinationals like Procter & Gamble, General Mills and Kellogg. The Science Based Targets initiative is a collaboration between the WWF, CDP, World Resources Institute and the United Nations Global Compact, in partnership with the We Mean Business Coalition. For what it’s worth, 72 percent of the Fortune 500 (14 percent) reported to either CDP or the Science Based Targets initiative that they intend to adopt a decidedly science-based target within a few years. For its part, consumer packaged goods giant P&G is committed to reducing the emissions from operations by 30 percent by 2020 from a 2010 base-year, according to a Science Based Targets case study. During this time frame, P&G will address the main source of emissions across its value chain, which include targets related to cold-water washing, post-consumer plastic use and zero-deforestation policies. Before setting the target, the company had already committed to sourcing 30 percent of its energy from renewables. And P&G isn’t alone. Renewable energy is looking attractive to a growing number of companies. Almost two dozen Fortune 500s committed to power all of their corporate operations with 100 percent renewable energy, mainly wind and solar. Last year, only a handful of companies made such a commitment. Some of the companies pledged to 100 percent renewables are Walmart, Bank of America, Google and Facebook.  A goal to source only renewable energy is a “signal of high ambition,” the most recent joint report states. And company size is a “key indicator of the likelihood” of setting such a target: 14 of the targets come from companies in the Fortune 100, with four in the Fortune 101-200, three in the Fortune 201-300, and just two in the Fortune 301-400. There are no companies in the bottom quintile of the Fortune 500 with a 100 percent renewable energy target. All 23 companies with such a goal are in four sectors: information technology, financials, consumer staples, and health care. While only a fraction of Fortune 500 companies have adopted such an ambitious goal, more than double the amount (53 companies) have set a target to buy or invest in renewables such as wind and solar. Companies are using various approaches to meet their targets, including unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchases, onsite installations (mainly solar), and larger-scale, off-site purchases. Since the Power Forward 2.0 report, 33 companies signed almost seven gigawatts (GW) in new, direct and off-site corporate renewable energy contracts, with most of them in the Fortune 500.

Home > News By Company > Persistence Market Research Tweet   Gift Card Market Expected to Bring US$ 698.2 Bn by End of 2024 There is an increasing demand for gift cards in the corporate sector across the globe. Companies are offering incentives to employees in the form of gift cards to recognize employees contributions and achievements.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, April 28, 2017 ) Instances where consumers seek alternatives to cash for buying goods will continue to be on a rise in the future. Considering that many people will explore such options, leading retail and banking organizations are offering their customers or members prepaid stored-value money cards, which are commonly called as gift cards. Persistence Market Research, thus, expects the demand for gift cards to witness a considerable upsurge in the years to come. According to its latest report, Persistence Market Research estimates that by the end of 2024, around US$ 698 Bn worth of gift cards will be sold across the globe. Sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/11560 The global gift cards market, which is valued just over US$ 307 Bn at present, will progress at an impressive 10.8% CAGR during the forecast period, 2016-2024. Key findings from the report, titled Gift Card Market: Global Industry Analysis and Forecast, 2016-2024, indicate that demand for gift cards is expected to gain traction in the corporate sector. The worlds corporate setting has actively adopted gift cards as an incentive to employees for their credible performances. The demand for gift cards is further propelled rising proliferation of mobile phones and smartphones. Innovative features in gift cards are also responsible in driving their sales, especially among young demographics. Moreover, rise in number of e-commerce platforms are also expected to boost global sales of gift cards. E-tailing giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and BestBuyCo. Inc. are observed among the worlds leading providers of closed-loop gift cards. In 2016, more than US$ 20 Bn worth of global revenues were amassed from e-Gifting. The report projects that by the end of 2024, global revenues arising from sales of e-Gifting or digital gift cards will grow at a staggering CAGR of 20.7%. Nevertheless, the global gift cards market is anticipated to be dominated by brimming sales of universally-accepted open loop gift cards. While the demand for restaurant closed loop gift cards, retail closed loop gift cards and miscellaneous closed loop gift cards witnesses a decline, universally-accepted open loop gift cards will register a value CAGR of 12.1%. Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc., Edge Loyalty Systems Pty. Ltd., Gyft, InComm, and National Gift Card Corp., QwikCliver Solutions are leading companies offering open loop gift cards. Other key players in the global gift cards market are Apple Inc., Starbucks Corporation, Target Corporation, and Wal-mart Stores, Inc.

Close to 60% of global gift card revenues during the forecast period are projected to be accounted by restaurant and department store merchants. Likewise, growth of global gift cards market will remain largely concentrated in Asia-Pacific. In 2016, North America has been observed to dominate the global gift cards market, but the region will witness a steep decline towards the end of 2024. Asia-Pacific will emerge as the largest market for gift cards, procuring one-third share in terms of global revenues. Europes gift cards market will also grow robustly, exhibiting revenue growth at 11.7% CAGR.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman California’s Cody Meyer Leads Day One of FLW Tour at Beaver Lake presented by General Tire Oklahoma’s Slaton Leads Co-Anglers /EIN News/ — ROGERS, Ark., April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Pro Cody Meyer of Auburn, California, caught a five-bass limit weighing 16 pounds, 1 ounce Thursday to take the lead on opening day of the four-day FLW Tour event at Beaver Lake. The event, presented by General Tire, features a field of 322 of the world’s best bass-fishing professionals and co-anglers casting for top awards of up to $125,000 cash in the pro division and up to $25,000 cash in the co-angler division. A rainy week has brought Beaver Lake water levels up drastically – as much as 8 feet – in the last seven days. As anglers launched from Prairie Creek Park Marina they faced a very different fishery than the one that they had experienced during practice. While many competitors fished shallow water, Meyer ran into a few smallmouth in deeper water with a drop-shot rig. “Today was awesome, but I got really lucky,” said Meyer, an eight-time Forrest Wood Cup qualifier. “I pulled up on a deep spot where I had gotten a bite in practice and caught four good smallmouth. It happened really quickly. I had a limit around 13 pounds or so, and I ended up making my way back to the check-in at Prairie Creek to end my day. I ended up catching two largemouth shallow just before checking in – my two biggest of the day. It was so random, but those big ones really helped.” Meyer’s five-bass limit consisted of two largemouth and three smallmouth bass.  „I caught them on four different baits,” he said. “I flipped a couple, threw some little swimbaits and had a couple of different drop-shot rigs. “I’m looking forward to going back out there tomorrow, but who know what’s going to happen,” Meyer went on to say. “I’ve been here so many times that I know it is very possible to go out tomorrow and not even get a bite. I’m very happy to be where I’m at, though.” The top 10 pros after day one on Beaver Lake are:               1st:          Cody Meyer, Auburn, Calif., five bass, 16-1               2nd:         Christopher Brasher, Longview, Texas, five bass, 15-11               3rd:         Mud Hole Custom Tackle pro John Cox, DeBary, Fla., four bass, 14-4               4th:         Johnny McCombs, Morris, Ala., five bass, 14-3               5th:         Daniel Kweekul, Bryant, Ark., five bass, 13-14               6th:         Jason Reyes, Huffman, Texas, five bass, 13-13               7th:         Keith Bryan, Novato, Calif., five bass, 13-5               8th:         Nick Gainey, Charleston, S.C., five bass, 13-4               9th:         Bryan Thrift, Shelby, N.C., five bass, 12-15               10th:       Timmy Thompkins, Myrtle Beach, S.C., four bass, 12-10 For a full list of results visit FLWFishing.com. John Devere of Berea, Kentucky, earned the day’s $500 Big Bass award in the pro division thanks to a 6-pound, 4-ounce largemouth. Overall there were 637 bass weighing 1,217 pounds, 11 ounces caught by 156 pros Thursday. The catch included 85 five-bass limits. Charley Slaton of Valliant, Oklahoma, leads the co-angler division with four bass weighing 12 pounds, 2 ounces, followed by Rex Jaeger of Hamilton, Ohio, who weighed four bass totaling 11-0, good for second place. The top 10 co-anglers after day one on Beaver Lake are:               1st:          Charley Slaton, Valliant, Okla., four bass, 12-2               2nd:         Rex Jaeger, Hamilton, Ohio, four bass, 11-0               3rd:         Steve York, Bronson, Mich., five bass, 10-15               4th:         Tim Cales, Sandstone, W.Va., five bass, 10-0               5th:         Scotty Villines, Ponca, Ark., five bass, 9-12               6th:         Wataru Iwahori, Palestine, Texas, five bass, 9-2               7th:         Scott Parsons, Rogers, Ark., three bass, 9-1               8th:         Scott Easter, Gentry, Ark., four bass, 8-8               9th:         Don Harvey, Franklin, Tenn., four bass, 8-7               10th:       Steven Meador, Bentonville, Ark., five bass, 8-6 Kevin Medine of Port Allen, Louisiana, earned $250 for the Big Bass award in the co-angler division with a largemouth weighing 6-pounds even.

In FLW Tour competition, pros and co-anglers are randomly paired each day, with pros supplying the boat, controlling boat movement and competing against other pros. Co-anglers fish from the back deck against other co-anglers. The full field of 322 anglers competes Thursday and Friday. Co-angler competition concludes following Friday’s weigh-in, while the top 20 pros based on their two-day accumulated weight advance to Saturday. Only the top 10 pros continue competition Sunday, with the winner determined by the heaviest accumulated weight from the four days of competition. Throughout the season, anglers are also vying for valuable points in hopes of qualifying for the 2017 Forrest Wood Cup, the world championship of professional bass fishing.

Richard Browning in his anti-gravity suit. Image via Youtube. Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a prestigious TED Conference. The personal flight suit is capable of propeling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators. "The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff," the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier. Browning told of experimenting with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs. Along the way, he said, there were more than a few crashes to the ground. "The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that," Browning said. The first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on. His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called Daedalus. A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than a million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago. Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an 'Iron Man' suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. I don't think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along," Browning said. He dreams of a flight suit that one day will allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue their journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared to 'Iron Man' armor worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world. He also described the project as part of a personal journey, inspired by an engineer father with a love for flying machines, but who died when he was just a teenager. #Ani-gravity suit#Iron man#Iron man suit#Richard browning#Ted#Ted 2017 Published Date: Apr 28, 2017 12:13 pm | Updated Date: Apr 28, 2017 12:13 pm Also See Shah Rukh Khan's TED Talk is 'signature SRK': Witty and insightful, with lessons for life Narendra Modi in Gujarat: PM praises Sardar Patel, says nation is what it is because of India's Iron Man Shah Rukh Khan's TED Talk in Canada delivers a message you need to hear: Watch it here T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 Apr 29 RPS Vs RCB 2 Apr 29 GL Vs MI 3 Apr 30 KXIP Vs DD 4 Apr 30 SRH Vs KKR 5 May 1 MI Vs RCB Full Schedule Top Stories Jayalalithaa's cape as shield; Mayawati's handbag, a sword: The weapons of women in politics Judge Who Granted Bail to SP Leader Prajapati in Rape Case Suspended IPL 2017: SRH's Shikhar Dhawan reinvented himself against KXIP to make his case for Team India Why branded drugs cost way more than their generic counterparts Not having a credit score can impact your future.

Mattos said his department is doing all it can, but he wants to get the word out more that the city’s residents need to be the department’s very necessary “eyes and ears who know when something is out of place.” In order to get residents and businesses to report alarms to the police more quickly and reliably, Mattos also said there would be a 60-day moratorium on fines for multiple false alarms. Mattos and other police representatives used the evening to update residents on the investigations into several crimes that have plagued Suisun City since early March. That has included a series of robberies during April, a recurring spate of home burglaries and two separate April 22 shootings. With regard to the early morning gunshots fired at the Ovation Ultra Lounge on Main Street, Mattos said “info is coming in” and police have talked to the business to revise how they are doing business so such an incident doesn’t happen again. The 7 p.m. drive-by shooting on Canvasback Lane has been a tougher investigation because the victim has been uncooperative, Mattos told the audience. With regard to the two Walmart robberies, Mattos said the department has been meeting with Walmart to improve its video system. The home burglaries that hit Suisun City on March 17, March 31 and April 12 are still unsolved despite video of some of the involved vehicles. The criminals have been hitting unoccupied houses but Mattos said he is concerned that they may eventually hit a house that the crooks don’t realize is occupied, “and there is going to be a confrontation.” “We have to put a stop to this and that’s where you come in,” Mattos said, adding that “each of you should know what looks normal at your house.” He told the audience that he has put police volunteer Maureen Johnson to the task of establishing and coordinating a more extensive neighborhood watch program. Anyone interested in becoming block captains can email her at [email protected] , Mattos said. Reach Ian Thompson at 427-6976 or [email protected] .

JimboApril 27, 2017 - 10:22 pm Crime reduction you say? One run Sycamore Charlie out of town, two arrest the pecker woods, three tell the Hispanics trump is coming to build a wall around their family, they will cut an adios real quick, and viola..... heaven on earthReply Report abusive comment HippocrateApril 28, 2017 - 1:24 am Good thought thou I'd wish it was that simple.Reply Report abusive comment CD BrooksApril 28, 2017 - 6:57 am I didn't read anything about traffic crime. Police departments across the country want citizens to alert them and look for trouble. No problem there, but they have to have the personnel available and willing to manage those issues. Once again folks, the remedy is enforcement all day everyday. What we're dealing with today is the absence of that practice. Period.Reply Report abusive comment JazzAzzApril 28, 2017 - 8:01 am Too bad the D.R. can not get things right. 1) It is Canvasback DRIVE, and 2) This shooting at Canvasback & Sunset did not occur at 7PM, but in the afternoon, around 2PM or there abouts, and VERT LOUD!!!! And it is truly unreal that the cops can not find a NEWER Model ORANGE Camaro, which must stand out like a Klan member at a NCAAP rally.Reply Report abusive comment Mayor SanchezApril 28, 2017 - 8:40 am It was a three hour meeting. A portion was about traffic enforcement. Fulmar Street traffic stop sign violation was the subject of an exchange between the Chief and a complaining resident. Chief Mattos mentioned that he himself has frequently monitored the area in unmarked cars and issued tickets to offenders. Commander White said that residents can contact him and he can show records of police ticketings from citywide road traffic enforcements. A resident of Peterson Ranch who wondered why he has not seen a police car in last 4 months in his area was told by Commander White that patrols have been there and everywhere and that the area actually has at least 2 extra police drive by per day since he lives in that area.Reply Report abusive comment CD BrooksApril 28, 2017 - 9:07 am Thank you Mayor, I appreciate the information and the effort. I drive through Suisun often enough to see flagrant violations. Marina Ave is a racetrack. The usual areas Sunset and Railroad Ave, are terrible. Others here have continually expressed concerns over speeding, failure to stop, recklessness in residential areas and around schools. I know you can't be everywhere, but a larger presence and seeing officers out there actually writing citations would be a great deterrent.Reply Report abusive comment Fed upApril 28, 2017 - 10:43 am I saw the police down pintail giving tickets this morning but really need to be around intersections, red light runners are rampant everywhere. And while they are at it, try informing these parent nowadays how dangerous it is to let your kids out of your car in the lane of traffic. STUPID! And irresponsible.Reply Report abusive comment CD BrooksApril 28, 2017 - 11:01 am Fed up, in Fairfield you can count on 3-5 red light runners at nearly every controlled intersection. The eastbound 80 exit onto Manuel Campos is the worst ever. NOBODY (except for me and one other person) stops there on a red and oncoming traffic (having the right of way) is traveling 40 mph+.Reply Report abusive comment What will it take for it to stop?April 28, 2017 - 6:46 am FACT: Our last Suisun City California Census from 2010 states that the population of: "Black or African American alone, percent, April 1, 2010 (a) 20.3%" QUESTION: Then how can a demographic representation of 20.3% of a given race account for more than 96% of our local crime statistics resulting from assault, burglary, drugs, robbery, sex crimes, theft, larceny, murder, vandalism, and weapons charges which requires the majority of our Police and Emergency Resources in Suisun City California? What is wrong with the imbalance of this proportional equation and can someone please explain to me why this is happening and how to make it stop?Reply Report abusive comment It may not stopApril 28, 2017 - 11:07 am A high percent of crime is done by a small portion of the population. Then they cry when they're also proportionally high in the jail and prison population. Do the crime, pay the time (in jail or prison). Quit complaining that the percentage of prisoners (African Americans and Hispanics) are high. If they didn't break the law, they wouldn't be in jail or prison.Reply Report abusive comment Fed upApril 28, 2017 - 4:43 pm 100 % trueReply Report abusive comment Search Recent Articles Home Seller 04-29-2017 Today’s Print Edition Morton fans 12, Astros win 9-4 in A’s 5th straight loss Weather for Saturday, April 29, 2017 Sports on TV/Local sports for Saturday-Sunday, April 29-30, 2017 Rookie Arroyo powers Giants to 4-3 win over Padres Column: Don’t believe the hype about these sporting events Prep softball: Mustangs struggle against Napa in 14-5 loss Solano baseball ends regular season with 6-2 loss to Laney Raiders take UConn S Melifonwu, UCLA DL Vanderdoes on day 2 49ers add CB Witherspoon, QB Beathard on second day of draft Washington DBs popular in 2nd round, Mixon to Bengals Giants take DT Tomlinson and QB of future in Davis Webb Mom, son sue Vacaville School District, alleging failure to provide services Fairfield man suspected of masturbating in front of teen girls enters plea Flite Fest takes to the skies at Solano Fairgrounds Judge extends filing deadlines in Suisun man’s federal suit against police, officials Fairfield police log: April 27, 2017 Suisun City police log: April 27, 2017 Jury trial set in November for Fairfield killer Sloan Special Publications » NewsFeed Commentary Print Edition Twitter Feed Facebook Page Customer service Home Seller 04-29-2017 Stars and Stripes 04-27-2017 American Home Week 2017 Coupons and More 04-02-2017 Discover Solano Spring/Summer 2017 Women Making a Difference 2017 Coupons and More: March 2017 Readers’ Choice 2017 Congratulations Team Travis: February 2017 Wedding Countdown: February 2017 Secrets of Success 2016 Honoring Our Veterans 2016 Solano Senior Living 2016 Solano Life 2016 All About Pets 2016 Medical Guide 2016 Salute to Travis Air Force Base Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service (updated 4/30/2015) and Privacy Policy (updated 4/7/2015).

AMT? Here Are the Tax-Reform Terms You Need to Know by Laurence Arnold More stories by Laurence Arnold and Paula Dwyer @paulaEdwyer More stories by Paula Dwyer April 28, 2017, 12:00 AM EDT President Trump Calls for 'Biggest Tax Cut' Few topics in Washington lend themselves to jargon as readily as taxes. President Donald Trump’s drive for tax cuts, though only beginning, is already sending people diving for their dictionaries. Here are some of the terms worth understanding. As Trump promised, he is focusing on reducing the ... Corporate Tax Rate Like most nations, the U.S. levies a graduated federal tax on the net profits of corporations. Trump’s goal is to slash the top rate to 15 percent, making the U.S. more competitive with the world. Since 1993, the top rate in the U.S. has been 35 percent (which grows to 39.1 percent when state and local corporate taxes are included). That is among the highest in the developed world. But thanks to deductions and credits, few companies pay that amount: In 2012, the effective rate was about 19 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump also wants to slash the tax rates for companies known as ... Pass-Through Entities A business organized as a partnership, limited-liability company or sole-proprietorship reports any profit on its owners’ tax returns -- "passing it through" to them. Taxes on those earnings are set at the individual rate, up to 39.6 percent for incomes above $418,400. Trump’s plan would lower the rate to 15 percent for pass-throughs. Of almost 30 million U.S. companies, about 95 percent are pass-throughs, accounting for about 20 percent of business income. Trump’s proposal could backfire by encouraging high-earning individuals to convert themselves into pass-through companies to get the lower rate. Republican lawmakers talk about pass-throughs as mostly mom-and-pop companies, yet pass-through business income is already concentrated among high earners. Most law firms, hedge funds and real-estate developers, such as the president’s own Trump Organization, are pass-through companies.   For regular people who don’t have pass-throughs, Trump promises lower tax brackets for income tax, plus elimination of the ... Alternative Minimum Tax The AMT was created in 1979 to make sure very wealthy households can’t take advantage of deductions and credits to the point that they pay little or no federal income tax. But thanks to inflation and the value of certain deductions, such as state and local taxes, some 5 million people now get caught by this minimum tax. (That includes Trump, who paid $38 million in alternative taxes on income of $150 million in 2005, judging by two pages of his leaked tax return.) Despite attempts by Congress to limit the AMT’s reach, the number of affected households continues to grow, along with the AMT’s unpopularity. Trump would like to eliminate, as well, the ... Estate Tax For Republicans, this is one of the most unpopular parts of the U.S. tax system, which is why they like to call it the "death tax" and emphasize its effect on inheritance of family farms and small businesses. For Democrats, estate taxes are necessary to break up dynastic wealth and help reverse income inequality. Over the next 30 years, U.S. non-spousal heirs are expected to inherit more than $6 trillion. But not many estates pay the tax these days: In 2014, the U.S. collected only $16 billion this way. Current law excludes up to $5.49 million from an individual’s taxes, or $10.98 million for a couple’s. After that, the rate is 40 percent, but there are numerous ways, such as trusts, to shield assets. A 2015 congressional study found that 99.8 percent of U.S. deaths in 2013 triggered no estate tax. With so many people looking forward to seeing lower tax bills, one question is whether the Trump tax plan can possibly be ... Revenue Neutral This high bar means a proposal has an equal balance of costs and savings, and so will have no net impact on the budget deficit. In his campaign and even recently, Trump had said that his tax plan would be revenue neutral, which suggested it would close enough loopholes and end enough deductions to continue raising the same level of revenue. As outlined, Trump’s plan seems highly unlikely to do that. (One cost estimate has the Trump plan losing between $3 trillion and $7 trillion in tax revenue over a decade.) His team says the cuts will unleash such an economic boom that tax revenues will naturally rise as well.  This idea, of tax cuts paying for themselves, is held dear by Republicans and rests on an economic theory known as the ... Laffer Curve In 1974, economist Arthur Laffer posited that tax cuts would lead to faster economic growth, higher employment and increased personal income, which would make up for some or all of the lost tax revenue. Others took Laffer’s idea and extended it to mean that tax cuts over time will pay for themselves. Trump’s tax plan buys into this by proposing huge tax cuts without fully offsetting them with spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget. The evidence that Laffer is correct is sketchy: President Ronald Reagan cut taxes deeply, but the deficit increased 255 percent by the time he left office in 1989. President Bill Clinton, on the other hand, raised taxes sharply and ended his second term in 2001 with a balanced budget. Laffer notwithstanding, Republicans are at least considering methods to raise money to offset lost revenue. Those ideas include a sustained crackdown on ... Profit Shifting U.S. companies use creative methods to avoid paying the top corporate-tax rate of 35 percent. A favorite is to claim income came from a country -- Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Ireland are popular -- with much lower tax rates. The U.S. taxes companies on their worldwide income, unlike the rest of the developed world; companies, however, can defer paying taxes on offshore profits that are kept outside the U.S. Such tax-avoidance maneuvers cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars a year. Trump’s plan seeks to address this by lowering the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent and switching the U.S. to a territorial system, which taxes only earnings from U.S. sales. Profits stashed overseas would be hit with a one-time repatriation tax. The Trump outline didn’t specify what that amount might be. A different revenue-raising idea that has struggled to win Trump’s favor is called a ... Border-Adjusted Tax This idea for a new corporate-tax system, which would tax imports but not exports, is splitting Republicans and their business allies, and Trump didn’t include it in his plan. House Republican leaders favor border adjustments as a way to boost manufacturing and discourage companies from moving offshore. It would work like this: Companies would pay a 20 percent tax on products that are made abroad and sold in the U.S., or made and consumed domestically. Products made in the U.S. and sold abroad would not be taxed. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and others that depend heavily on low-priced imports to stock their shelves say it would increase costs for their retail customers and could violate trade agreements. Supporters say the higher cost of imports would be offset by a rise in the value of the dollar. One way around the revenue-neutrality bar is to put a 10-year expiration date on the tax cuts, making them ... Temporary Tax Cuts Like George W. Bush at the start of his presidency in 2001, Trump could specify that his tax cuts will expire in 10 years. This would increase the odds of passage in the U.S. Senate, where budget bills that don’t increase the deficit beyond 10 years can pass with a simple majority vote. Other bills require a 60-vote supermajority; Republicans hold 52 seats. Some businesses may consider a 10-year tax cut too short a period for the long-term commitments they require for investment and expansion decisions. On the other hand, most of Bush’s temporary tax cuts wound up becoming permanent. So who will decide whether Trump’s plan is revenue-neutral or revenue-diminishing? Expect to hear a lot about the ... Joint Committee on Taxation Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up This little-known, non-partisan congressional committee is the highly influential referee of whether a legislative proposal will add to the federal deficit. It has Ph.D economists and accountants on its staff, which is led by Tom Barthold, a former professor of economics at Dartmouth College. The chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee take turns leading the panel. How the committee "scores" Trump’s tax proposal will influence its chances at winning passage in Congress.  Thanks to a change enacted by Republicans last year, the committee will use a method known as ... Dynamic Scoring Analysts at the joint committee (and at the Congressional Budget Office) must consider how tax or policy changes might affect behavior -- like how raising taxes on cigarettes might reduce sales. This is known as dynamic scoring, and it’s more art than science. Trump says his plan will encourage companies to expand and hire more workers to put in longer hours, which will lead to stronger economic growth and the payment of new taxes, ultimately offsetting the loss of trillions of tax revenue over 10 years. Lots of Democratic economists -- and even some Republican ones -- disagree with that analysis. The Reference Shelf A QuickTake explainer on the U.S. budget deficit. A 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that almost one-fifth of large American corporations that made a profit in 2012 paid no federal income tax. The conservative Tax Foundation looked at seven tax reforms and found that President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut had the biggest long-term benefit, 8 percent growth. Michael Tanner at the Cato Institute, which favors limited government, says Trump’s corporate tax cuts could eventually mean higher wages for workers. The Laffer Curve was first drawn on a dinner napkin. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Watch him fly Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Richard Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground in his impressive ‘Iron Man’ suit. tech Updated: Apr 28, 2017 08:50 IST Agence France-Presse, Vancouver Richard Browning has created a suit that has inspired references to Iron Man.(Video screengrab) British inventor Richard Browning lifted off from the shore of Vancouver Harbor on Thursday in a personal flight suit that inspired references to comic superhero ‘Iron Man’. Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a prestigious TED Conference. The personal flight suit is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators. “The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier. via GIPHY Browning told of experimenting with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs. Along the way, he said, there were more than a few crashes to the ground. “The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that,” Browning said. The first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on. His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called Daedalus. A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than a million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago. Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an ‘Iron Man’ suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. “I don’t think anyone is going to be going down to WalMart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along,” Browning said. He dreams of a flight suit that one day will allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue their journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared to ‘Iron Man’ armour worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world. via GIPHY He also described the project as part of a personal journey, inspired by an engineer father with a love for flying machines, but who died when he was just a teenager. tags Iron Man Marvel comics Iron Man suit Richard Browning Superhero more from tech Fitbit to the rescue?

Organic Gardening 101 Food Eco Fashion Shop Food sustainability Why It’s More Important To Be An Ethical Omnivore Than A Vegetarian I used to think giving up meat was best for the planet. I was wrong. By Emily Monaco April 27, 2017 Endai Huedl/Getty When I was sixteen, I read an article by Michael Pollan in the New York Times called “Power Steer,” and my life changed. In reading the story, I learned, amongst other things, that steer in America were forced to cannibalize other steer, fed fat and blood and tallow alongside an unnatural corn-based diet; I also learned about the E. coli-tainted floors where the steer were slaughtered before being packaged into shrink-wrapped, perfectly pink steaks. As a city kid from New York, I had never really given much thought to where my food came from, but faced with the reality of the intensive animal farming industry, I had to do something to stop contributing to industrial meat production and all that it represented, from a humane, ethical, and environmental standpoint. I decided to become a vegetarian. Advertisement Advertisement Free Newsletter Keep this field blank Enter your email address You may unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy | About Us (On just a quarter-acre of land, you can produce fresh, organic food for a family of four—year-round. Rodale's The Backyard Homestead shows you how.) I wasn’t wrong, necessarily, to take a stand. Countless studies have shown that the amount of meat we eat in the developed world is unsustainable: after research from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization showed that 120 million more hectares of land in developing countries would have to be devoted to food production to feed the estimated 2050 world population, a report in Nature Communications outlined that, in reality, that population could be fed entirely with the agricultural land we have now—if everyone switched to a 100 percent plant-based way of eating. Vegetarianism, then, seems like the more sustainable option—and also the more ethical. My reaction to Pollan’s article was, first and foremost, to the inhumane treatment of animals in intensive animal farming scenarios: hens who lived their whole lives in space no larger than a sheet of paper, or calves existing in tiny crates less than three feet wide. By taking meat out of the picture, I thought that I was contributing to a solution. Related: 14 Vegetarian Foods That Have More Iron Than Meat But vegetarianism, I later learned, isn’t the only way to eat ethically, and vegetarians can still fall victim to unethical eating. Mindful Omnivorism is Better than Mindless Vegetarianism When I became a vegetarian, my first priority was thinking about what I didn’t eat, not what I did: instead of meat, I filled the space on my plate with potatoes, beans, or pasta—I figured that I’d done my job by saying no to steak. (Here are 6 easy vegetarian sources of protein.) Marissa Landrigan, a former vegetarian and the author of The Vegetarian’s Guide to Eating Meat, had a similar experience when she became a vegetarian in college, relying mostly on prepared foods like frozen vegetarian pot pies and plant-based meats to supplement her meat-free diet. While Landrigan believes “it is entirely possible to be an ethical vegetarian or an ethical vegan,” she does think that there is a risk, as a vegetarian, in relying too much on “foods of convenience,” which can be just as unhealthy–and just as bad for the environment—as meat. (It would have behooved us both to refer to Peter Singer’s 5 rules of ethical eating.) Vegetarians can still fall victim to unethical eating. Endai Huedl/Getty The intensive animal farming industry is undoubtedly disastrous for the environment, contributing 7.1 gigatons of Co2-equivalent emissions every year worldwide (14.5 percent of all man-made carbon emissions). It’s also hazardous to human health: in 2011 the intensive animal farming industry used four times as many antibiotics as the human medical industry, according to Pew Charitable Trust. This regular, low-level agricultural use of antibiotics has contributed enormously to the development of resistant bacteria, which kill 700,000 people worldwide every year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. (Things weren’t always this way—here’s when we started using so many pesticides and antibiotics in farming.) (Like what you're reading?

But when vegetarians turn instead to tofu, they’re not doing much better for the environment or for their own health. (Here are the 5 worst meat substitutes—and what to eat instead.)  Ninety percent of the soy produced in the United States is genetically engineered to withstand herbicides like glyphosate (the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide), deemed a “probable human carcinogen” by the United Nations World Health Organization in 2015. (Here's how much toxic Roundup you're eating.) And much of the tofu consumed in the United States (though not nearly as much as in Europe) is actually grown in South America, where acres of rainforests are being felled to meet growing demands. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the almost 4 million hectares of forests that are destroyed in South America every year can be largely blamed on the production of soy. Quinoa, the protein-rich pseudo-grain, poses a different, no less dire ethical problem: with the increase of its popularity in the developed world, this staple of the Peruvian and Bolivian diet has become too expensive for local farmers to consume. The Guardian reports that farmers in these countries have reduced their own quinoa consumption and replaced it with less nutritious foods, thus depriving themselves of essential nutrients. (Organically grown quinoa is still one of the 11 healthiest foods for you and the planet—but try one grown in the U.S., such as Lundberg quinoa, from California.) Related: I Ate 3 Eggs Every Single Morning For A Week—Here's What I Learned Vegetarians who think that the buck stops with cutting out meat are often, in reality, just contributing to the problem of unethical eating. Demanding Ethical Meat Will Change the Market Back in high school, classmates trivialized my vegetarian diet, saying that one lowly high schooler’s decision to say no to meat wasn’t going to change the world. “Look,” a friend said, pointing to the tray of hamburgers in the dining hall. “Just because you’re not eating one doesn’t mean the cow isn’t dead.” This is, of course, true, but it’s amazing the difference one small step can make. In 2003, former ad man Sid Lerner revived the World War I recommendation for “Meatless Mondays.” Since then, the campaign has grown into a global movement, and in the past ten years, American beef consumption has fallen 15 percent; pork consumption fell 4 percent. Consumer demand has also changed the American market for humane animal products. A great example is the recent cage-free egg revolution: as consumers demand for cage-free increased, individual restaurants and stores from McDonald’s to Walmart responded by refusing to buy battery cage-raised eggs. Today, it’s just not worth it for farmers to produce the latter. “[Major egg buyers] simply cannot tell consumers that the eggs that they’re going to continually purchase come from chickens who are confined to cages, who can’t move,” says Josh Balk, Vice President of Farm Animal Protection at the Humane Society of the United States. “The issue of farm animal confinement, whether egg-laying chickens, veal calves in crates, or mother pigs in gestation grates, is out of step with consumer sentiment on how animals ought to be treated, and that’s why these major corporations have moved.” The same thing appears to be happening currently with regards to chicken raised with antibiotics, which chains like Burger King, Jack in the Box, and Wendy’s have already committed to phase out of their supply chains in the coming months or years. Related: 7 Ways to Make Sure A Restaurant’s Farm To Table Claim Is Legit Supporting humanely-raised animal products does, then, make a difference, as Catherine Friend argues in The Compassionate Carnivore: while vegetarianism may seem kinder to animals on the surface, not supporting the farmers who are raising meat sustainably and humanely sends the message that you don’t care about their efforts; buying products from people who produce ethical meat tells them that their efforts are worthwhile. (The oceans are whole other kettle of fish—here are 12 fish you should never eat.) How to Choose Ethical Meat It’s possible to eat ethically whether you’re eating vegetarian or not–but either way, it requires work, planning, and thought. Eating ethically, for example, doesn’t translate to just eating locally. A 2008 Carnegie Mellon study by C. L. Weber and H. S. Matthews entitled “Food Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States” showed that transportation accounts for only 11 percent of a product’s greenhouse gas emissions–the rest comes from the production methods. If your steak is local but industrially produced, then, you should definitely skip it. Transportation accounts for only 11 percent of a product’s greenhouse gas emissions: the rest comes from the farming methods. Endai Huedl/Getty Choosing local is, however, a good place to start, because it gives you a chance ask questions about where your food comes from and how it’s produced. Whenever possible, choose meat and vegetables that come from farms producing both: this method of agriculture is the most natural way to ensure soil health and a small carbon footprint. Farms that produce solely meat end up with far too much fertilizer to distribute economically, while farms that produce solely crops, particularly if they till, tend to contribute to soil erosion and carbon loss.  “When you have animal integration,” explains Ryland Engelhart, co-founder of Kiss the Ground, a California non-profit dedicated to increasing awareness about the importance of building back healthy soil, “you’re able to convert sunlight, through the grass, and turn that into fertility, and get that back into the soil to build the soil bank account year after year.” Related: 26 Plants You Should Always Grow Side-By-Side The most important thing is to keep asking questions and remain conscious of the effects that your diet has on your health, the health and wellbeing of animals and producers, and the environment. There are, of course, limits to what any individual can feasibly do. In The Omnivore’s Dilemma, Michael Pollan describes his attempt to prepare a meal using only ingredients he had hunted, gathered, or grown himself, noting that this meal was “equally unsustainable” as a fast food meal: you can’t shoot your own wild boar and forage your own mushrooms every day. But it’s definitely a start to become aware–and humbled–by where your food comes from, whether your food includes meat or not. As for me, my shopping is a lot more careful than it once was. I’m no longer blindly vegetarian, buying conventionally produced veggies and assuming I’ve done my part. I buy most of my food through a local coop, where I can get to know the farmers that I am buying from and ask them questions about their practices. Whenever I’m not sure about origins, I try to eat vegetarian or buy certified organic meat and dairy. (Here’s why grass-fed dairy is better for you—and how to avoid the fake stuff.)  I believe that as long as I’m buying and eating consciously, I’m taking a step in the right direction.

Browning's startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called Daedalus. VANCOUVER: British inventor Richard Browning lifted off from the shore of Vancouver Harbor on Thursday in a personal flight suit that inspired references to comic superhero 'Iron Man.' Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a prestigious TED Conference. The personal flight suit is capable of propeling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators. "The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff," the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier. Browning told of experimenting with various numbers and arrays of essentially miniature jet engines on his limbs. Along the way, he said, there were more than a few crashes to the ground. "The whole journey was about trying and failing, and learning from that," Browning said. The first reasonably stable, six-second flight with the gear inspired his team to press on. His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early-version suit called Daedalus. A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than a million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago. Browning said he is already getting interest from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an 'Iron Man' suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear. "I don't think anyone is going to be going down to Wal-Mart with it or taking anybody to school for quite a while, but the team at Gravity is moving it along," Browning said. He dreams of a flight suit that one day will allow its wearer to launch from a beach, soar along the coast and then perhaps hop into a helicopter in the air to continue their journey. Browning has already seen the early-version flight suit compared to 'Iron Man' armor worn by Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, but stressed that his goal is firmly rooted in the real world.
