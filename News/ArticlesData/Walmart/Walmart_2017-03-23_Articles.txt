Walmart is hoping to use in-store drones to deliver merchandise from one area of its massive stores to another. FILE (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) By Kevin Smith, San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: 03/23/17, 10:35 PM PDT | Updated: 2 days ago # Comments Don’t be surprised if one day soon you hear a buzzing overhead while you’re buying socks or laundry detergent at your neighborhood Walmart. The mega retailer has been granted a patent to use in-store drones to shuttle merchandise from one department to another. The company believes the small, unmanned aircraft systems would increase efficiency and in some cases eliminate the need for employees to traverse the entire length of its massive stores to move items around. “In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer,” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. wrote in its patent filing. “Unfortunately, there may not always be enough employees available to assist customers in as timely a manner as the customer might wish.” Increasing competition from online retailers and alternate store formats make it imperative that brick-and-mortar stores be as efficient as possible, the company said, with a strong focus on “the overall customer experience.” A patent approval is no guarantee that Walmart’s in-store technology will be approved as many patents that are filed by businesses are never put to use. Some are not thrilled with the idea Chris Gately, broker/Realtor for Gately Properties in Santa Clarita, wasn’t keen on the idea of drones invading his space at Walmart stores. “It sounds horrible,” he said. “Drones aren’t very quiet and I can just imagine one of them buzzing around and getting caught in some poor lady’s hair. I’d also be concerned that someone might reach up to grab something right when a drone comes by.” Still, Gately said his company has made use of the unmanned aircraft systems. “They are a good tool for the right kind of property,” he said. “They can get good aerial photography of a property like a vineyard. That really makes sense because it gives you something you wouldn’t get from the ground level. They can also be used inside a home to get a nice floating view of the rooms.” Walmart’s in-store drones would include safety features In its patent application filed in September, Walmart said the drones would be controlled by a central computer system that would essentially function as an air traffic control center. The unmanned aircraft would fly using everything from onboard sensors and video cameras to gyroscopes and magnetometers to detect obstacles along the way. The drones would primarily be routed over shelves as opposed to store aisles to avoid buzzing over customers’ heads. Advertisement Drone landing zones would be set up throughout the stores with some in plain sight and others that would be hidden. Burt Flickinger III, managing director for the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, doesn’t like the idea. “It’s very dangerous at this point with drones not being federally regulated,” he said. “This would be too much of a public safety risk. Walmart just needs to allocate more work hours for more people so they can keep their stores sufficiently stocked.” One expert thinks they would work well in warehouse settings Not everyone is a skeptic. Yao-Yi Chiang, an assistant professor of research at the USC Dornsife Spatial Sciences Institute and an expert on drones, likes Walmart’s plan. But his enthusiasm comes with a caveat. “I think it’s a great idea but maybe not within stores where you have customers,” he said. “I think it would work well in big warehouses where you need to deliver an item from one place to another.” Chiang said companies like Amazon are already using robotic vehicles to fetch merchandise off of shelves in their huge fulfillment centers. “I would call that the first generation of routing,” he said. “It’s where you need a track imbedded in the floor that guides the vehicles. Volkswagen has this, too.” Walmart is not the first retailer that has turned to drones to boost efficiency. Amazon hopes to use drones for package delivery Amazon’s Prime Air drone made its first package delivery in December in England. That retail technology hadn’t been seen stateside until earlier this week at Amazon’s MARS 2017 conference at a Palm Springs resort, according to GeekWire.com. The drone’s delivery technique involved the airborne transport of a box containing a bottle of sunscreen. Amazon is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to create a packaged delivery system using unmanned drones. In its newly released annual aerospace forecast, which includes projections for the use of drones, the FAA projects that between the end of 2016 and 2021 the number of commercially used drones will increase from 42,000 to 442,000 with the possibility of as many as 1.6 million in use.

Home Industry Airbnb won’t find a home in China anytime soon: Adam Minter Airbnb won’t find a home in China anytime soon: Adam Minter It's never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 24, 2017 5:51 AM It’s never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. (Reuters) It’s never easy for American businesses to make it in China. Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the U.S. have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. Those stumbles aren’t dissuading Airbnb Inc., however. This week the home-sharing pioneer announced that it’s changing its local brand name in China and doubling its investment there. By any measure, the opportunity is immense. In 2015, Chinese travelers spent nearly $500 billion, and the government expects that number to more than double by 2020 as the country’s middle class expands. But capturing a major piece of that market will require Airbnb to navigate a far more tangled thicket of cultural issues than what confronted Uber and other tech companies in China. And judging by its efforts so far, it probably won’t be up to the task. In theory, China should be one of the world’s biggest and best markets for home-sharing. Chinese travelers took 2.2 billion domestic trips in just the first half of 2016, up nearly 10.5 percent year-on-year. Yet China has only 4 hotel rooms for every 1,000 people, compared to 20 in the U.S. And thanks to China’s housing boom, about 50 million empty homes are scattered across the country just waiting (in theory) for paying visitors. But that doesn’t mean Chinese will jump on the opportunity to rent out their properties or stay in someone else’s home. The biggest barrier is establishing trust between owners and renters. In recent years, Chinese consumers have been confronted by scandals ranging from tainted fast food to dodgy pharmaceuticals. They chronically complain of poor-quality goods and misleading marketing or labeling. And they’re highly suspicious of small vendors. So renting a room from a stranger advertising on the internet won’t come naturally. Homeowners, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Many of China’s vacant properties are purchased as investments, and most affluent homeowners — especially those with desirable vacation rentals — will hesitate to open their doors to poorer tourists, who constitute most Chinese travelers these days and who would be the most likely to forgo a hotel. That reluctance is only heightened by the near-constant stream of news reports about misbehavior among Chinese travelers at home and abroad. Bridging this gap in trust will be difficult. But there’s some evidence that local companies — which are more familiar with local customs and concerns — are figuring it out. For example, Tujia.com, China’s biggest home-sharing site, takes the ambitious approach of managing each of the 400,000 properties on its site (or hiring a third party to do so). That includes hotel-like services, such as housekeeping, as well as conducting due diligence to confirm that listings are accurate. That doesn’t just improve the experience for renters; it also expands the number of properties available by giving owners — many of whom live far away from their investments — less upkeep to worry about and more peace of mind. Airbnb, with its paltry 80,000 listings in China, hasn’t made any such effort, focusing instead on self-starting younger travelers. Where Tujia arranges for home cleaners, Airbnb’s new investments are focused on curated “Experiences,” such as tours of local landmarks, that can be purchased alongside a room. That kind of thing won’t be enough to overcome the cultural barriers inhibiting home-sharing in China. And so far, there’s little evidence that Airbnb is savvy enough to come up with a more appealing approach. On Wednesday, shortly after the company announced its new Chinese brand name — Aibiying — social media users were widely mocking it as nonsensical and hard to pronounce. It’s not all bad news for Airbnb. China’s growing tourism market means that even a niche player focused on adventurous young travelers has a big opportunity. Equally important, outbound travel is growing, and Airbnb’s 3 million global listings will remain the best home-sharing option for Chinese who want one, a fact conceded even by its Chinese competitors. When it comes to winning China’s local home-sharing market, however, Airbnb should probably check out early.

Waller, dean of the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas and a supply chain specialist, said big data and predictive analytics have huge implications in the supply chain. He said technologies are always being improved from the early days of barcodes to radio frequency identification (RFID), but without the application of big data, technology has not been enough to overhaul the supply chain. Waller said the mountains of big data generated by retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, social media and smart objects is enough to paralyze the supply chain unless manufacturer suppliers invest in resources to help them mine, clean and apply the data where it’s beneficial. “The quantity, quality and speed with which we get information today is astounding, but having the data is not enough because data itself is not a solution,” Waller said. “It requires filtering for accuracy and then application for things like forecasting demand or looking at where storing the inventory is most beneficial to supplier and retailer.” He said the need for mathematics, computer science and statistics professionals has never been greater. Waller said there are not nearly enough data scientists in the world and yet those areas of study are not sought after by college students. Waller said without data scientists a maximum supply chain optimization could languish despite new technology applications. MORE AUTOMATION COMING The supply chain is increasingly becoming more automated through instrumentation. Information previously created by people will likely continue to be machine generated, flowing from sensors, RFID tags, meters and GPS tracking. Inventory will be able to count itself. Containers will detect their contents, and pallets will be able to report if they end up in the wrong place. Dr. Matt Waller, dean of the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas Wal-Mart has said it is testing drone technology in its distribution centers to take inventory, because it was more efficient than two workers spending a week’s time counting pallets. The drone can complete the task in about 24 hours. Waller said technology has the potential to displace some workers in the supply chain, but all the data generated by the drone must be checked for accuracy, analyzed and applied by someone. And there’s plenty of job security for data analysts. The supply chain will also become more interconnected in the near term. It won’t just be customers, suppliers and IT systems, but smart objects will likely be used to monitor the supply chain. Experts predict extensive connectivity will enable worldwide networks of supply chains to plan and make decisions together. For instance, looking for ways to optimize transportation routes. Not only will the supply chain of the future be interconnected, but it will also be intelligent. Waller said advanced analytics and modeling will help decision makers evaluate alternatives against a complex set of risks. He said smarter systems will be able to make some decisions automatically, reducing the need for human intervention. AUGMENTED REALITY One of the more recent technologies to be applied to the supply chain is augmented reality. Logistics experts with DHL Trend Research recently noted three key areas where they think augmented reality will benefit the supply chain. • Picking Optimization: Order pickers in a warehouse see a “digital picking list” on a heads-up display (Google Glass). When someone selects the item the visual display calculates the most efficient path through the warehouse and guides that person to the package, scans it as “picked” into a warehouse management system and immediately directs the picker to the next closest package. • Freight and Container Loading: Augmented reality could replace the need for physical cargo list and load instructions by displaying the cargo list on a heads-up visual display with step-by-step instructions on how to most efficiently load a container given its size, dimensions and weight of contents. • Dynamic Traffic Support: Most delivery trucks already come equipped with GPS navigation, but augmented reality systems are the natural successors. Heads-up and windshield displays could allow carriers to efficiently reroute shipments on the fly without causing significant distractions to the driver. The display would show the driver critical information including cargo temperature (important when transporting medical or other fragile goods) gasoline efficiency (which is based on the weight of the truck) and a variety of interesting and critical information. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Supply chain experts are also exploring the possibility of artificial intelligence in the supply chain. The use of autonomous vehicles holds tremendous potential over the next five years. But Waller said smart factories and the on-demand supply chain hold tremendous potential in the near term. He said Spanish apparel retailer Zara has dramatically shortened its supply chain and grown sales in the process. Rather than hire expensive designers, Zara copies popular designs and then allows customers to tweak that design online to fit their taste. Rather than manufacture hundreds of items that might not sell, Zara sends the customer feedback to its manufacturers in Europe and Northern Africa that literally sew the feedback into the next line of clothes. Zara has said the constant changes to its fashion designs have created a “now-or-never” sense of urgency among its shopper base. Waller said Zara is a great example of a startup innovation disrupting traditional retail apparel. He said 3D printers will also allow manufacturers to speed up processing and they could give retailers the ability to make their own products in some cases greatly reducing the length the supply chain. –––––––––––––––– Editor’s note: Dr. Matt Waller, dean of the Sam M.

Bridging the Divide: Within integrated schools, de facto segregation persists News Maryland Baltimore County Arbutus Lansdowne 11-year-old accused of setting fires in Arbutus Wal-Mart A Catonsville boy has been accused of setting fires in an Arbutus store. File photo File photo Jon BleiweisContact ReporterArbutus Times 11-year-old boy charged in relation to Arbutus Wal-Mart fires Baltimore County Police say an 11-year-old Catonsville boy set small fires inside the Arbutus Wal-Mart Supercenter store Tuesday morning. Firefighters and police responded to the store in the Lansdowne Crossing shopping center in Arbutus at 11:08 a.m. Tuesday, after the business was evacuated when multiple small fires were set in different areas of the building. The fires were extinguished by employees, police said. One Wal-Mart worker was taken to a hospital for treatment of minor smoke inhalation, authorities said. Leslee Wright, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the employee has been released and is doing well. County police sought assistance identifying a potential witness, posting a photo of a woman taken from store surveillance cameras on a police website. The woman contacted police and gave them information that helped them identify the boy, said Officer Jen Peach, a police spokeswoman. The boy was charged with attempted first-degree arson, first-degree malicious burning, reckless endangerment and second-degree malicious burning, according to police. Police released the boy to a family member, Peach said. It is unknown how many people were in the store because evacuations started before first responders arrived, Peach and Wright said. The store was closed for the remainder of Tuesday, Wright said. It reopened Wednesday after an inspection from the Baltimore County health department, she said. Wal-Mart estimates a loss of $10,000 in destroyed property, including food that had to be discarded because of smoke damage, police said. The 214,265-square foot store was built in 2007, according to state property tax records.

Revenue, excluding currency, increased 3% to $133.6 billion in retailer's fourth quarter 2016. Comparable store sales in the Walmart U.S. business grew 1.8%, driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. As the industry tries to adapt to a new omnichannel reality, Walmart has been accelerating its e-commerce growth after acquiring Jet.com last year and bringing on Marc Lore as CEO of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business. "We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively," said Brett Biggs, EVP and CFO. The company also saw an uptick in its e-commerce business since its January 31 switch to free two-day shipping with a minimum order of $35.  "Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pickup Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year," said Biggs. Over the holidays, wait times were down for Pickup and the retailer is adding more items to Pickup Today. "Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day," explained CEO Doug McMillon. Walmart said it is now the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and its Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail. Walmart is rolling out new capabilities in the Walmart app in March and a new store experience that allows customers to skip traditional service lines using “express lanes” in these areas. The app will now allow for easy refills of prescriptions and simplified money transferring where the shopper can fill out information on the app ahead of time instead of filling out paperwork in store. After using the app for either of these service shoppers will be able to use the “express lane” to move to the front of the line. The new capabilities are expected to be available in Walmart’s 4,700 stores by fall. “These capabilities are the latest example of how we’re bringing together all of the conveniences of Walmart – great stores, convenient pickup, easy checkout and a top-notch app – to deliver one seamless shopping experience for customers,” said Daniel Eckert, SVP, Walmart Services. Updates to the app aren’t surprising as mobile becomes increasingly important for Walmart. Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores for Walmart, and over half did through mobile devices. Further, more than 70% of traffic to Walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile.  Inside the workforce, Walmart said new technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve its in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp-store basis. The company has also been experimenting with customer experience initiatives, opening two new Supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like scan-and-go, touch-screens where customers can access more items on Walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated Health & Wellness section. Customer expectations continue to change rapidly, noted McMillon. "They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We’re moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future."     YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Fulfillment Is Walmart Poised to Triumph in E-Commerce?

CEO Doug McMillon recently laid out four key priorities for the retailer as it looks to not only continue to dominate the physical retail space but make significant inroads in e-commerce: make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer, and deliver results and position the company to win. Walmart has been playing catchup in the e-commerce space, as market leader Amazon continues as the gold standard upon which all other digital players are judged. Thanks to significant investments in its online capabilities, including its $3 billion Jet.com acquisition, Walmart believes it is making significant enhancements to its digital offerings which will help close the gap with rival Amazon. "We're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction," McMillon said on a recent earnings call with analysts. "We're scaling fast, adding eight million SKUs over the last three months alone. E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores." Since Walmart announced the Jet.com acquisition in August it has been working quickly to merge the two companies and use its considerable scale to increase the operations of both entities. "One of the reasons Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics," McMillon said. "Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours." Former Jet.com CEO Marc Lore is driving U.S. e-commerce for both Walmart and Jet, and McMillon has been pleased with the speed with which the companies have integrated. "Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized," McMillon said. "We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses."   In addition to investing heavily in its U.S. e-commerce operations, Walmart is looking to grow its international business, particularly in China. Online shoppers in China, just like their American counterparts, are making purchase decisions based on the speed and convince with which orders can be fulfilled.   To build out its fulfillment capabilities in China Walmart announced that it plans to invest $50 million in Chinese online grocery and delivery company New Data. "Already, New Dada is enabling two-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations, McMillon said. "It's amazing to see how O2O [online-to-offline] is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable two-hour delivery and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for two-hour delivery going forward." In addition to its e-commerce efforts at home and abroad, Walmart is investing in digital capabilities for its stores to blur the distinction between online and physical retailing. For example, the retailer has launched Scan & Go nationwide at its Sam's Club locations. The mobile check out and payment solution allows members to skip the checkout lane.  "We're pleased with the adoption of this service and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time," McMillon said.

Read her other columns, and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN)Christine Carugati, 18, of Langhorne, Pennyslvania started getting recruited to play college lacrosse the summer after the ninth grade. You heard that right -- when she just finished her freshman year in high school. "What ninth grader knows what they want and what ninth grader, never mind an adult, isn't easily swayed, thinking somebody wants me. It's very intoxicating for any age but for a child especially, so my counsel was to keep all your options open," said her mom, Mary Carugati, during an interview. Christine Carugati started getting recruited for college lacrosse right after ninth grade. And now it appears the courting process is starting even earlier. Syracuse University made headlines recently with word that an eighth-grade girl had verbally committed to play on its women's lacrosse team, a move that appears to be the youngest ever commitment to a men's or women's college lacrosse team, according to Lacrosse magazine. Terry Norpel Dzelzgalvis, who coached recreational league lacrosse for 12 years and played lacrosse at the University of Pennsylvania, said the trend to younger and younger commitments is a big concern in youth sports today. "It's ridiculous, and the parents aren't putting their feet down," she said. (Full disclosure: Norpel Dzelzgalvis and I are friends from college.) Read More JUST WATCHED Should high school athletes get EKG tests? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Should high school athletes get EKG tests? 04:59 The early recruiting by colleges combined with parents' unwillingness to stand up and say no to such practices is just one example of how youth sports has changed and for the worse, coaches, players, authors and parents I interviewed for this story say. And, there are plenty of stats to back up how concerning the problem should be for parents who want the best for their kids. Seventy percent of children leave organized sports by the age 13, according to research by the National Alliance for Sports. Let's put it this way: If your daughter or son plays on a soccer team, seven out of 10 of the members of that team won't be playing soccer or any organized sport whatsoever by the time they enter their teenage years. "Kids are telling us this is not for me. It might be for you, but it's really not meeting our needs," said Mark Hyman, author of three highly-regarded books on kids and sports, including "Until It Hurts: America's Obsession with Youth Sports and How It Harms Our Kids." Hyman, who is an assistant professor of management at George Washington University, likes to compare the situation to what might happen in the business world with the same kind of fallout. "If 70% of Walmart's customers walked out of the store and said, 'This is not for me. I'm not coming back,' the status quo would not stand. Walmart would figure out a different business model but in youth sports, we seem to be very satisfied with a 70% dropout rate." We shouldn't be satisfied and should be very worried about how many kids are dropping out, said John O'Sullivan, a former college and professional soccer player, who has coached on every level from children to college, and who now devotes his energy to the Changing the Game Project. His organization's goal is to return youth sports to the children and to "put the 'play' back in 'play ball.' " "As I say to all the parents at my parents talks, 'This isn't a sports issue. This is a wellness issue,' " said O'Sullivan, citing how this generation is the first generation to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents and it's due to inactivity. "We know all the benefits of activity from better grades to less drugs, less pregnancy, more likely to go to college and on and on and on and yet at the same age when most kids are walking away from sports is that critical age where if they're active then, they're likely to be active for life." Why are kids walking away One of the main reasons kids are walking away is because of injuries due to overuse, many of the people I interviewed for this story say. Every year, more than 3.5 million children under the age 14 need treatment for sports injuries, with nearly half of all sports injuries for middle and high school students caused by overuse, according to research. This is something Hyman knows all too well, he says. His son was a star pitcher at age 10 (he was the coach), and Hyman often thinks about the "pretty profound mistake" he made getting swept up in his son's success. By the time his son was 16, he had a ruptured ligament in his elbow, which spelled the beginning of the end for him, said Hyman. "Was I too invested in his youth baseball career? Yes. Should he have pitched less? Yes. Should I have said no to some opportunities he had to play on teams during times of the year when he should have been resting? Yes," he said. "So, I guess I'm an example of a parent who I think made some mistakes and probably could help parents understand that they shouldn't be in a hurry, that if their kids really have talent and passion that they are going to be OK whether they're playing on six travel teams or just the rec league." How can we keep young soccer players safe? O'Sullivan, who has two young children ages 8 and 10 who play sports, says having a child concentrate on one sport -- and one sport only -- before their middle teenage years is a big part of the problem. Parents believe they need to give their kid an edge, he said, but the irony is they may be hurting their child's athletic future more than helping. "I'd say that overwhelming emotion is one of fear: 'What if I don't give my kid this chance? Am I a bad mom? Am I a bad dad? Will my kid fall behind?' " said O'Sullivan, author of "Changing the Game: The Parent's Guide to Raising Happy, High Performing Athletes, and Giving Youth Sports Back to our Kids." "The actual science and evidence that we look at though shows that except in sports like female gymnastics where kids hit their peak when they're 14- (and) 15-years-old, specializing in one sport before the age of 12 is going to be a far less likely path to actually elite level performance." Most kids who do specialize early often say, when they are asked about any regrets, that they wish they did other sports, he said. Research by the U.S. Olympic Committee shows that the vast majority of elite level athletes are multisport athletes until their middle teenage years, he added. "I just think it helps if you participate in multiple sports," said Norpel Dzelzgalvis, the former Division I college player and former coach. "I think that if you look at most college rosters, you will see that these student-athletes have excelled in multiple sports, and not just the one for which they were recruited to play in college." Can team sports help women crack the glass ceiling? Carugati credits Norpel Dzelzgalvis, one of her daughter's lacrosse coaches from the time she started playing in the second grade and up through the eighth grade, as one of the reasons why her daughter continued to play lacrosse, along with soccer and basketball. "They never made those girls feel like they couldn't play another sport," said Carugati, a mom of three and marketing consultant, who volunteered for her daughter's recreational league lacrosse program. Said Norpel Dzelzgalvis, "We never wanted to tell kids who were 11 years old, 'I'm sorry but you have to commit to this as your year-round sport.' I mean there's plenty of time for that but kids would come to us and say, 'Well, our soccer coach said to us we'll be off the team if we go to our lacrosse game instead of our soccer game.' " Coaches and parents need to 'redefine' success More coaches, who are more focused on keeping the game fun and watching players develop skills that help them for life as opposed to winning at all costs, would no doubt help. But, it isn't easy to ignore those pressures to win, says Hyman. He remembers how all the parents were pleased when the team was winning and how those victories reflected positively on him as coach. "Looking back, none of those things really matter when your kid is 8- or 9- or 10 years old. They should be the least important things," he said. Coaches should be guided by long-term, not short-term, success, said O'Sullivan. "So, you know what, on a 9-year-old team, on an 11-year-old team, 12-year-old team, every kid should play every game. Anyone who doesn't say that doesn't care about kids and doesn't understand anything about talent development. You can't know if an 11-year-old is going to make it or not." JUST WATCHED Should you let your child fail? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Should you let your child fail? 01:09 The concept of success in sports also needs to be redefined, says Janis Meredith, a coach's wife for 29 years and a sports mom for 21 years, who likes to say she has "seen life from both sides of the bench." She writes about sports parenting on her blog JBMThinks.com and is the author of a sports parenting survival guide, including "22 Ways to Let Kids Be Little in Youth Sports." "Success doesn't mean that you're always going to be the star on the team. It doesn't mean that you are always going to start," said Meredith, who tells the story of how her daughter, when she was a senior in high school, thought about quitting the basketball team because she was getting less playing time that she had during her junior year. Her daughter ended up sticking with the team, and decided that her role on the team was going to be "the encourager." At the end of the season, at the awards' dinner, her coach saluted her as the most encouraging player on the team, said Meredith. "And I thought, OK, my daughter wasn't the leading scorer, but you know what, that was success, that she stuck with it and that she turned around her attitude, and that she recognized her role. That to me is success," she added. Parents are too often "looking at the only kind of success that ends with a scholarship and there are other ways to have success." Not to mention that the chances of your child playing college sports is very small. For example, only about 3% of women and men athletes who play high school basketball go on to play in college, according to an analysis by College Sports Scholarships. The car ride home I've thought quite a bit about how youth sports has changed since I have two girls, ages 8 and 9 1/2, who both play a variety of sports. I recently dropped off one of my daughters at a soccer practice and was surprised at how many parents were staying to watch. I believe one caregiver was recording the entire practice on her iPhone. Was she doing that so the girls' parents could see how their daughter did that day? I remembered how when I was a kid and played softball on a church league, no parent, including my own, attended practice and very few attended games. What changed? The reasons are countless and aren't just about sports, but about parenting, too. As we helicopter and hover as parents, we are more involved than ever. Involvement is OK, experts say, but when our kids' sports life becomes more about us and our needs, then we've crossed the line. Narcissistic parenting: When you compete through your child "I think a lot of times parents tend to gauge their own self-esteem on how well their kids do, like, 'I'm so and so's parent. Did you see how well my kid did?' " said Janis Meredith, the blogger. "Maybe they're trying to make up for something that they didn't do when they were younger or something that they did do, maybe they want their kid to live up to them." Our kids get this message from us when we scream on the sidelines -- even when they tell us not to -- or when we choose to do play- by-play analysis in the car ride home. When O'Sullivan was director of coaching for a number of soccer clubs and he did exit interviews with kids who decided to leave the club, he said one of the saddest things he learned is their least favorite moment in sports was the car ride home after the game, he wrote in a blog post. Meredith, a mom of three whose children all played sports from age four through college, said her kids never wanted to dissect the game on the drive home. "I'm a question asker and I tend to ask a lot of questions and so that often got me in trouble because I would say things like, 'What happened?' or 'Why didn't the coach put you in?' ... and they're like, ' Mom, enough, the questions, stop,' " she said. "We learned after a game to let our kids take the lead on the conversation."

The highest paid is Duke Basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski, who reportedly rakes in $7.2 million in salary alone, not including endorsement deals. Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: NCAA by the numbers $74 million: The University of Texas had the biggest profit of any college football program last season, earning $74 million, while the University of Michigan, which pocketed $64.6 million, was number two.

Hide Caption 7 of 8 Photos: NCAA by the numbers 1.6%: That's the percentage of college football athletes who will be drafted by the NFL. Hide Caption 8 of 8 Letting our kids take the lead in conversation -- and when it comes to what sports they play and how often -- is a crucial way to keep sports fun and interesting for our children, these experts say. That is certainly not easy as youth sports has become a multibillion dollar industry, with financial benefits for tournament organizers and apparel manufacturers, and even wins for media companies. (ESPN reportedly pays $7.5 million per year for the rights to broadcast the Little League World Series.) "The line between professional and college and youth sports has really narrowed," said Hyman, who also is author of "The Most Expensive Game in Town: The Rising Cost of Youth Sports and the Toll on Today's Families." "Youth sports are now an entertainment product just like the colleges and the pros ... and on some level, I think parents are influenced by that." Advice for parents So what's a parent to do? No, we can't single-handedly change youth sports as we know it, but if each parent started practicing good, positive, supportive behavior, with the focus on the fun of the game and nothing else, that's how you create a movement, said O'Sullivan. "Then, all of a sudden, good behavior on the sidelines by parents is no longer risky. It's what everyone does. Being quiet on the ride home, it's what everyone does." Carugati says she was influenced by her niece, who is seven years older than her daughter Christine and who played soccer at Villanova. She played three sports, and never wanted to give any of them up, said Carugati. "I think I took my lead from my niece and I wanted my daughter to keep enjoying sports," she said. "I saw it every time the season ended my daughter would be looking forward to the next season and the new sport, and with every change of season, there was new excitement. And I really feel like that kept her interested." And now her daughter Christine, a senior in high school, is gearing up to play lacrosse in college. She received an athletic scholarship from Boston University. Parents should keep their eye on the bigger picture, said Carugati. "The goal is a happy, healthy, well-adjusted, self-supporting adult with a career they are passionate about," she wrote in an email. "When it's no longer fun, it's time to find something else."

Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. In about one months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

Search for suppliers of similar products in the Packaging Network. This look behind the curtain of the largest company in the world takes place in the Delkor booth (#2415) on Wednesday, April 5 from 11:00–11:30 a.m. and 3:00–3:30 p.m. During their discussion “Walmart’s Labeling and Retail Ready Packaging (RRP) Guidelines Demystified,” Chet Rutledge, former senior director, Private Brands Packaging, and Ron Sasine, former director, Private Brands Packaging, aim to keep producers ahead of the curve as retail giants continue to raise packaging expectations. The panel will also address major Walmart efforts to standardize case coding and labeling to maximize efficiency through distribution and store stocking. In Sept. 2016, Walmart selected the Delkor Cabrio Case as its preferred shipper style in its Approved RRP Guide for pouches, bags, cartons and flat packs. First introduced at Walmart for pouches of shredded cheese, today 75 percent of all shredded cheese pouches sold at Walmart stores in the U.S. are shipped to market in a Delkor Cabrio Case. “As attendees will see at ProFood Tech, the Delkor Cabrio Case is having a major impact on Retail Ready Packaging,” says Dale Anderson, president and CEO of Delkor. “Because of the success of Cabrio in the cheese category, Walmart significantly expanded the use of Cabrio to include numerous product categories, such as snacks & nuts, frozen vegetables, sauces, candy, non-food products, and more to come in 2017.” Powered by three of the world’s trade show leaders – PACK EXPO, Anuga and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) – ProFood Tech will welcome more than 6,000 key decision makers to convene with 400-plus of the world’s top suppliers over 150,000 net square feet of exhibit floor. The education offerings expand beyond the show floor as the ProFood Tech Conference Program, produced by IDFA, will offer a wide range of educational experiences covering issues such as: regulations and food safety, consumer trends and marketing, food processing advances and technology, business and leadership development and health and lifestyle. The conference will kick-off with a keynote address by five-time National Football League (NFL) MVP Peyton Manning on Tuesday, April 4 at 8 a.m. In addition, ProFood Tech Learning Hub will feature free, 30-minute educational sessions at the Innovation Stage and the all-new Regulatory Matters stage. The Innovation Stage offers attendees the opportunity to learn from industry experts on topics ranging from hygienic operations and improving sustainability, to advanced spray technologies and using robotic automation. ProFood Tech’s Regulatory Matters stage features presentations by industry experts on topics such as communicating during a food safety crisis, deconstructing Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) rules, combustible dust mitigation in food manufacturing, and constructing a FSMA food safety plan. A roundtable discussion will follow each session, giving attendees the opportunity to share ideas and best practices on these critical topics with peers. The ProFood Tech Learning Hub will also serve as host to both the Manufacturing Innovation Awards (Tuesday, April 4 at 3:00 p.m.), and the Sustainability Excellence in Manufacturing Awards (Wednesday, April 5 at 3:00 p.m.).

Photo Credit: AP Photo/ Alex Brandon Tags These tags are automatically generated. The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy. Published on March 23, 2017 at 4:04 am By Noah M. Horwitz On Tuesday, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, continued his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Among his unimpressive, trite sound bites which had Republicans salivating, there was a patronization of his prose which entailed a quip about legal aid to the poor. If Wal-Mart can offer basic medical services, why can’t it offer basic legal services? Gorsuch rhetorically asked senators. Oh, of all the stores he could have chosen. Access to justice for the poor is indeed a very important issue in this country. A litigant without an attorney, going up against one represented by counsel, is a David-versus-Goliath fight. Many would-be litigants cannot afford attorneys, especially if the injustice they are wishing to overcome is not one involving an inordinately-sizable chunk of money. The modern class action lawsuit was created in 1966 in part to address this issue. When a plethora of prospective plaintiffs have been wronged in the same way, they can band together with common counsel. This reduces costs and ensures justice even for the poor, especially when a large corporation is in the wrong. This process, codified under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court in a 2011 case involving — you guessed it — Wal-Mart. The case involved prospective class of 1.6 million women who currently or formerly had worked for Wal-Mart alleging discrimination on account of sex. The Court ruled the women could not sue together (decertified the class) and, in a 5-4 decision, held that Rule 23 often compels courts to “peek behind the pleadings” before certifying a class action. (The decision also overturned significant precedent, as explained by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an impassioned dissent.) This means that onerous and expensive discovery often must precede the process, thus making the plaintiffs’ day in court more onerous, more expensive and less likely. Critics and studies have shown it has had a chilling effect on similar lawsuits. The author of the opinion was the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who Gorsuch has been nominated to replace. Gorsuch would ostensibly be the swing vote on such a case in the future. And indeed, Judge Merrick Garland, whom former President Barack Obama had nominated more than a year ago for the seat could have been in such a position if he had successfully earned the position — Republicans shamefully refused to even hold hearings for him. Gorsuch’s track record on class actions, however, is not much better. Comprehensive evaluations of Gorsuch’s record show him ruling for the defense on class actions time and time again, with a penchant for decertification of classes. The evidence is consistent with an overall trend, advanced by Senate Democrats, of Gorsuch being hostile to the individual and conciliatory toward big corporations. The Republicans can swoon over Gorsuch’s empty words about legal aid to the poor and downtrodden. But the irony of invoking Wal-Mart in such a pleasantry is not lost. On the issues that will truly matter before such a High and Awesome Court, Gorsuch fails those most in need of his help. Horwitz is a first-year law student from Houston.

The victims told JSO that they didn't know the bills were fake until the day after they shopped at Walmart.  >> Read more trending news “We take these situations seriously and are currently working both internally and with local law enforcement to confirm the claims," Walmart said in a statement.  Robinson and Lattella do not know each other, JSO said in the report. Lattella's son obtained $100 as cash back from a purchase made at 10:30 p.m., police said. The bill obtained was smaller than a typical $100 bill, JSO said, and didn't have proper security markings.  Earlier, about 9 p.m., Robinson said she obtained $100 as cash back from the same register. Robinson received three fake $20 bills with the same serial number, JSO said.  The fake money was confiscated by authorities.  Walmart didn't reimburse the shoppers. The manager on duty told Robinson and Lattella that they would need to file a formal complaint with Walmart's corporate office.  © 2017 Cox Media Group.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China’s biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores and Metro come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world’s biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. Share this story File picture: Nacho Doce/Reuters A spokesperson for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday that the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF and JBS from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounted for less than 10 percent of Sun Art’s beef supply, she said. Read also: SA bans import of meat from Brazil Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, said a source familiar with the matter. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany’s Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world’s top meat exporter. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland.

The so-called “liquor wall” measure (SB 106), which must still get House approval, was approved in a 21-17 vote. Sponsor Anitere Flores, R-Miami, defend her bill at one point by saying, “this is not going to kill anybody. No one is going to die if this bill passes or not.” The issue has led to repeated legislative battles in recent years, pitting Walmart and Target, which want to stock liquor on shelves near other goods, against Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, which have stand-alone liquor stores as part of their corporate blueprints. Flores called the law requiring stand-alone liquor stores “antiquated.” Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, said the 1934 law doesn’t reflect “contemporary life” in which people can order home delivery of liquor through apps on their phones. Walmart and Target lobbyists say the change is needed to meet customers’ demands and convenience. In asking lawmakers to reject the proposal, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, said “large corporate citizens want us to do it (approve the bill) for their own economic purposes.” Latvala’s comment caused Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, to fire back — in a speech that ended with him dropping a live microphone on his desk — by saying, “We talk about who is pushing it, but we know who is pushing against it too, Sen. Latvala. We know who’s pushing against it real hard.” Opponents argue the change will impact small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. Sen. Daphne Campbell, D-Miami, argued that she couldn’t support “a bill that is going to kill my own youngsters.” “How can I do this, to come here and vote for a bill where children or the high school students, going to the store when they have a break to eat lunch, and (they’re) going to buy alcohol,” Campbell said. And “while they’re driving back to school and they die or they get arrested for DUI.” The proposal would stagger the repeal of the law over several years; prohibit new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; and require that small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, be displayed only behind the counter. Also, the measure would require checkout clerks under the age of 18 to be supervised by someone 18 or older when alcohol is being purchased and prohibit the state from issuing liquor licenses to gas stations that are not linked with locations providing more than 10,000 square-feet of retail space. Sen. Frank Artiles, a Miami Republican who called the measure “the Walmart bill,” argued that it would hurt small businesses. The proposal doesn’t “just stack the deck against small businesses; they ensure they don’t get a fair hand,” Artiles said. “If this bill becomes law, it will decimate the family-owned small businesses, and unfortunately a lot of Floridians will lose their jobs.” by Jim Turner, The News Service of Florida Pictured: A separate liquor store next to the Publix in University Town Center on West Nine Mile Road.

The service isn’t free, of course, but for $2 to $5 apiece you can give new life to those DVDs and Blu-ray Discs collecting dust on your shelf. Previously, the disc-to-digital conversion service required people to take their media to Walmart stores, or scan the disc on their PCs using a dedicated desktop software. Pricing remains the same: converting movies you already own is $2 for either a Blu-ray disc to HDX or a DVD to SD, and $5 for DVD to HDX. While the program isn’t free, it's significantly cheaper than re-purchasing your DVD content in digital form, and less challenging and time consuming than ripping them yourself — which is technically still illegal, absurd as it may be. You converted movies will be uploaded to your digital locker on UltraViolet, a cloud-based movie storage service, movies can then be watched on TVs, tablets, smartphones, computers, video game consoles, smart TVs and set-top box devices such as Roku. Keep in mind that Vudu is a closed platform with its own digital rights management system, so any movies you convert into digital format are locked into that ecosystem — you can’t download them or play on unauthorized devices or media solutions such as Plex. The program supports nearly 8,000 films from major studios.

Fiji Time: 3:39 AM on Monday 27 March Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Meat pulled from shelves over food safety fears Reuters Friday, March 24, 2017 SOME of China's largest food suppliers have pulled Brazilian beef and poultry from their shelves in the first concrete sign that a deepening scandal over Brazil's meat processing industry is hitting business in its top export market. The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China's biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 per cent of Sun Art's beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany's Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com one of China's biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process.

Fiji Time: 3:39 AM on Monday 27 March Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business $1.6b expansion Reuters Friday, March 24, 2017 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Chilean unit will invest $US800 million ($F1.6b) in the country over the next three years and open 55 to 60 new supermarkets, the company said on Wednesday, a significant outlay at a time of slow economic growth. As part of the plan, the retail and supermarket chain will also remodel over 50 stores, add more than 5000 jobs, and further develop a large distribution centre near the capital city of Santiago. "We are confident in the future potential of the country, and we are convinced that spaces exist to continue expanding our low-cost model," Walmart Chile general manager Horacio Barbeito said in a statement. "Both in the high and low moments of the economic cycle, consumers are always interested in using their budget efficiently, and this will continue being our focus." Chile's economy has struggled in recent years amid low prices for key export copper and lagging business confidence. Gross domestic product in the fourth quarter contracted 0.4 per cent from the prior quarter, worse than forecast, and first-quarter 2017 figures will be affected by a work stoppage at Chile's largest mine. In its statement, Wal-Mart said the expansion plan will focus on medium-sized stores, such as the company's Express de Lider and Super Bodega aCuenta formats. The distribution centre is already under construction and will require 2000 employees and $US180m ($F373m) in investment, the company added. The company said it will also seek to improve its online department.

The Eureka Fire Protection District turned that dream into a reality Tuesday night. Echele uses a wheelchair and has been a greeter at Walmart for 25 years. Firefighters say he's expressed a great deal of interest in firefighting. That prompted several of the firefighters to coordinate a surprise with the store's managers. Firefighters arrived at the Eureka Walmart and made Echele an honorary firefighter, taking him on a ride. "This was amazing," said Echelle. "I was shocked." He was joined on the truck by his mother. The two were moved to tears over the invitation by firefighters. The truck traveled to Echele's neighborhood where he was greeted by some of this neighbors. "I've been a fan of the fire service ever since I was a kid and never really outgrew it," said Echele. "So, to be able to meet and interact with all these guys is amazing." "It means a lot to us too," said Lt. Steve McKinney, Eureka Fire Protection District. "It's very important for us to have community members like him backing the Eureka Fire District." Firefighters say Echele has routinely expressed support for them. They told him he was welcome to visit their fire station anytime he wants.

If the program goes well, the goal is to have it in stores nationwide within two years.  Walmart is the country's largest retailer and AutoNation is its largest new-vehicle retailer.  CarSaver will allow its users to shop, finance and insure vehicles through its website, touch-screen kiosks or with on-site staff members.  The program can connect users with dealerships within 15 minutes of the store they're in, in which it aims to cut out some of the pressure from shopping for a new ride.  Sean Wolfington, CarSaver's CEO, told the Automotive News that he modeled the Walmart partnership off of Costco's, Walmart's top competition.  "I was impressed with Costco's program and how much easier it was for the dealership because consumers trusted Costco and appreciated the haggle-free pricing and hassle-free experience," the man, who managed a Costco participating dealership 20 years ago, told the publication. "With the reach that Wal-Mart has, this could be a very large-scale buying program, and I think dealers are going to want to participate in it." CarSaver and Walmart ran a pilot program in Stuart, Florida in April 2016, in which Wolfington tells the Auto News that more than half of its appointments led to sales at the 20 participating dealerships. He also said that the program aims to match Costco in selling more than 1,000 vehicles a year at each participating store.  Business Insider reports that if the program expands to 450 Walmart stores, "it could become a major threat to Costco's service."  Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Subscribe on YouTube Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Mar 24, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Survival of Sears and Kmart in doubt, owner says STREAMLINING:Sears Holdings this month sold Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker in a bid to cut costs amid tight competition from Wal-Mart, Target and online stores NY Times News Service The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart on Tuesday said that there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue operating, as brick-and-mortar stores continue to face challenges in an e-commerce world. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporate owner, Sears Holdings Corp, cited its efforts to cut costs, sell property, tap new funding sources and make other moves to stanch the flow of red ink. Still, it reported a US$2.2 billion loss for last year and said it had to use money from its investments and financing activities to fund operations. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in the filing, its annual report. The disclosure is a setback for the company and for Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the combination of the two legends of US retail 13 years ago. Lampert has shut down stores, reshuffled the company’s organization and pushed to have a greater online presence. Still, Sears Holdings has lost more than US$5 billion over the past three years as sales have declined. On Wednesday morning, in the first day of trading after the disclosure, shares in the company tumbled more than 13 percent. Sears, through its catalog, has been a fixture of US homes for more than a century. Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a five-and-dime store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a big-box department store, with blue-light special discounts geared toward penny-wise middle-class Americans. However, both brands were squeezed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc, with its heavy discounts, and Target Corp, which sells affordable goods, but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon.com Inc, presented a more recent challenge. To cope, Sears Holdings has been shrinking. This month, it sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc in a deal valued at more than US$775 million. Still, its long-term debt as of January totaled about US$4.2 billion, almost double from the same period the previous year, according to the filing. Last month, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save US$1 billion annually. The program is focused on streamlining its back-office corporate and support functions, tweaking its product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle its real-estate portfolio. As of January, Sears Holdings had 1,430 Sears and Kmart stores in the US. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3,800 stores in the US and Canada. This story has been viewed 2440 times.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: March 23, 2017 10:08 am Follow @AuroraSentinel NEW YORK | Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is “substantial doubt” it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business.

(AP Photo/LO, File) At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. “I bought my tools from Sears and I’ve still got them,” Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It’s a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it’s been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors’ fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it’s highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. “They’re past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. “When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,” said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. “We still have some of those.” Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. “They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. “It has a lot of good memories,” he said. “It stands for being dependable and reliable.” Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Toby Talbot AP i BY JUSTINE GRIFFIN Tampa Bay Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE Floridians are one step closer to being able to buy whiskey, rum or vodka in a grocery store. Legislators passed the “whiskey to Wheaties” bill in the Florida Senate Thursday, which will allow grocery stores like Publix or Walmart to sell hard liquor on the shelves next to beer and wine instead of in a separate liquor store with its own entrance. Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, who sponsored the bill in the Senate (SB 106), said that the current Prohibition-era law is “archaic” and called for passing legislation that is more relevant and convenient for consumers in Florida. Senators voted 21-17 in favor of the bill. “This was put in well over 80 years ago when Al Capone was still roaming through the streets,” Flores said during a special order discussion when the Senate was in session Tuesday. “The question is, ‘Has this outlived its purpose?’ The answer we can up with in committee is: ‘Yes.’ ” The Senate bill, if put into law, would allow retail stores to add liquor to only a quarter of the stores it has in Florida in phases over five years. It would also prohibit stores from selling liquor within 1,000 feet of schools and require that liquor bottles of 6.8 ounces or less, be stored and sold from behind a counter. Gas stations that have 10,000 square feet or more of retail space and are already selling beer and wine could obtain a hard liquor license under the Senate bill. Wholesale retailers like Sam’s Club and Costco, are also included. Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, made a last ditch effort to stop the bill from moving forward, sparking a heated debate on the floor of the Senate. Lawmakers debated the issue of whether this bill would make it easier for children to drink underage, to the age of clerks who could check out customers buying distilled spirits. “I don’t understand the rush or the importance of doing this,” Latvala said. “People are calling us about health care and criminal justice issues and spillage at Lake Okeechobee. In the 15 years of being here, I’ve never had calls from people who tell me we need to make the purchase of liquor more convenient for me.” Latvala said big box stores who are pushing for the legislation, like Walmart and Target, would have the upper hand over independently owned businesses. “When you’re the major tenant in a shopping center, you have the right to control your competition,” Latvala said. “If one of these big box stores come into a shopping center and don’t want to have the mom and pop liquor store that’s been there for 20 years anymore at the end of their lease, they won’t be there.” The bill, which has surfaced many times over the last six years without success, has pitted retailers like Publix against other big box stores like Walmart and Target. Publix has lobbied against the legislation, saying the company has already invested heavily in its own separate liquor store operation, which can be found adjacent to some of its grocery stores. ABC Fine Wine & Spirits and other independently owned liquor stores say if the bill becomes law, it would hurt local businesses. But Walmart and Target lobbyists say it’s good for consumers. “This is something our customers want,” said Jason Unger, a lobbyist for Target, which has 122 stores in Florida. “Customers have told us that they’d rather be able to buy liquor on our shelves instead of having to make a second stop.” Unger said that claims that this law would hurt small businesses are unfounded. “In California, the largest state in the country, we have less than 2 percent of all liquor licenses out there,” Unger said. “Competition is good for everyone. This is a good pro-business piece of legislation.” A similar bill in the Florida House (HB 81) narrowly advanced in a House commerce committee Wednesday. It’s unclear if the bill will go to a floor vote in the House. Both the House and Senate bills would require clerks to be 18 or older to checkout patrons purchasing alcohol. “This bill was never meant to be so dramatic,” Flores said in closing. How they voted The Florida Senate voted 21-17 on Thursday to allow hard liquor to be sold at grocery stores and big box retailers. The vote split both Democrats and Republicans. Yes Republicans (14): Lizbeth Benacquisto, Fort Myers; Rob Bradley, Fleming Island; Jeff Brandes, St. Petersburg; Anitere Flores, Miami; Bill Galvano, Bradenton; Rene Garcia, Miami; Travis Hutson, Elkton; Tom Lee, Thonotosassa, Kathleen Passidomo, Naples; Keith Perry, Gainesville; David Simmons, Altamonte Springs, Greg Steube, Sarasota; Dana Young, Tampa; Senate President Joe Negron, Stuart.

Walmart has announced that it will now allow Vudu users to convert their disc-based movies to digital ones, regardless of if they’re DVDs or Blu-Rays. The service goes live today and it supports around 8,000 movies. Those movies cover a fairly wide array of studios, including Paramount, Lionsgate, Sony Pictures, and Universal. Converting your movies to digital is a pretty straightforward process, though Walmart notes that they have to take place at the same address you have listed on your Vudu account. In order to begin converting your collection, you’ll need to open the Vudu app and scan the barcode on your case in the Disc-to-Digital menu. Once the barcode has been scanned, you’ll be asked to choose either SD or HDX for your conversion. Standard DVDs can be converted to either SD or HDX, while Blu-Rays can unsurprisingly only be converted to HDX. It seems like a handy little feature to be sure, but it isn’t being offered for free. Converting DVDs to SD digital movies or Blu-Rays to HDX will cost you $2 each, while converting DVDs to HDX movies will set you back $5. That isn’t too bad as far as fees go, but if you’ve got a sizable movie collection, you might want to consider only converting a few of your favorites instead of the whole thing. For those not in the know, Vudu is service that offers video-on-demand streaming but also provides digital copies of Walmart Blu-Rays and DVDs purchased in-store. The ability to convert your existing collection will be going live later today, with Walmart set to flip the Switch at 12PM Eastern. What do you think of Walmart’s fees for conversion?

Menu Home Election 2017 Local News Business Community Schools Sports Voices Bill Rauch Lee Scott Letters to Editor What 2 Do Calendar Contact Full Issues Go Bringing Our Community Together Letter to the Editor Published on March 23, 2017 in Letters to Editor/Voices by The Island News Lady’s Island column omitted information Why did the Island News edition of March 16-23 cut short Bill Rauch’s article: “Time to get out front of the pathways?”   Was it because of space constraints, or did the city of Beaufort edit and shorten his article? Several important topics on costs were omitted which require our attention: • The projected cost of building the pathways and bike ways due to the high cost of right-of-way acquisition (tell Walmart to give up their road frontage). Also the cost of a stoplight at the recycling center for safe vehicle access. Or the weight and size restrictions of vehicles on the new Harbor Island bridge. • The ongoing cost of additional county sheriff patrols as the traffic continues to increase and pedestrian and bike usage increases. • The additional cost and increased manpower of first responders for the distressed bike riders and pedestrians, as well as frantic Walmart shoppers.  These and other additional costs will fall to the county, since the city of Beaufort can’t even provide enforcement of the Woods Memorial Bridge restriction of “NO vehicles three axles or more,” or the speed on Carteret Street or the drivers who don’t move to the right lane at Craven Street to go straight. I guess the meters at the only “Pay to Read Library” in the county, and the parking meters along Carteret Street must be generating enough revenue that other enforcement is no longer needed. I am sure Mr. Rauch would have also included discussion as to why, with a larger population than the city of Beaufort, Lady’s Island has no medical facilities, no public library, no public parks, no adequate public schools, no post office, etc. He also would point out that Lady’s Island has inadequate and unreliable electrical power, no natural gas service, limited potable water supply, and yet someone on the other side of the river has approval authority of all new housing developments and permitting. (Think infrastructure first)! Last but not least, with all the traffic studies, surveys, proposed fixes, new roads, etc., to ease traffic problems, no one will man up and face the $50 million elephant (problem): the two-lane approach to a two-lane swing bridge that is failing and should be replaced with a four-lane road to a four-lane draw bridge with hourly openings only. Maybe in future issues you will publish Mr. Rauch’s priority list of projects, their projected cost as well as estimated completion time frames so that he and Mayor Keyserling can safely ride their bicycles to Walmart and home again with all their purchases without incident.

Video See the smart home appliances of the future at Panasonic House Walmart wants to make it even easier to convert your old DVD and Blu-ray discs to digital formats. The company just announced an upgrade to Vudu’s longstanding disc-to-digital conversion service, doing away with in-store visits or PC-based disc scans. All you need is Vudu’s smartphone app for Android or iOS and the barcode for your old disc—usually found on the movie case. Then just navigate to the disc-to-digital section of the mobile app and scan your barcode. If you’ve already thrown out your DVD cases for a space-saving multi-disc holder, Vudu’s PC-based conversion method is still open to you. The new Vudu program isn’t free, but it's significantly cheaper than re-purchasing your DVD content in digital form. Vudu charges $2 per disc for a one-to-one conversion, such as Blu-ray to a high-definition (HD) digital copy, or DVD to standard-definition (SD) copy. If you want to go all the way and swap out old DVDs for a digital HD copy, you’ll have to fork over $5 per title. Vudu users will also get one free conversion via the smartphone app. Sorry, bleeding-edge TV owners: Vudu’s disc-to-digital program does not support 4K at this time. Brad Chacos Each conversion adds an UltraViolet copy of the converted movie to your Vudu digital locker. Those movies can then be downloaded or streamed using an UltraViolet-compatible app such as Vudu, Flixster, and Verizon Fios. But Vudu’s new program doesn’t necessarily cover all your DVDs. Walmart says the program covers close to 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. One glaring omission: Disney. More titles will be covered in the coming months, according to Walmart. The story behind the story: On the one hand, Vudu’s disc-to-digital program neatly solves the major expense of upgrading content you’ve already purchased in previous formats. The one thing it doesn’t do, however, is give you any significant freedom with your purchased content. UltraViolet is locked down with digital rights management, which means putting your content in Vudu’s cloud locks you into that content ecosystem. That may not seem so bad for now, but what happens if the UltraViolet program disappears or you want to play your content on “unauthorized” software or device such as Plex? The short answer is you can’t. The same problem exists on other digital platforms including Amazon and iTunes so it’s not just Vudu and UltraViolet. Nevertheless, you should think about the commitment you’re making any time you decide to buy video locked down with DRM. This story was updated at 12:19 Pacific Time on March 23, 2017 to correct the pricing for one-to-one conversions. We regret the error.

It’s a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. “I bought my tools from Sears and I’ve still got them,” Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It’s a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it’s been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors’ fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it’s highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. “They’re past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. “When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,” said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. “We still have some of those.” Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. “They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. “It has a lot of good memories,” he said. “It stands for being dependable and reliable.” ——— Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Vudu is expanding its Disc to Digital service to embrace a device most of us carry around all day: a smartphone. Until now, Vudu offered an In-Home Disc to Digital service which allowed you to convert Blu-ray and DVD movies you owned into digital versions for a small fee. In order to achieve that, you needed to download the Vudu To Go app on to your Windows PC or Mac, insert the disc into a DVD or Blu-ray drive, and allow the app to verify the disc. Alternatively, you can visit a Walmart Store with the discs. Both methods described above are a little cumbersome. An increasing number of new PCs don't even include a disc drive anymore, and who wants to travel to Walmart with a box full of discs? So, according to The Verge, starting today Vudu is embracing smartphones. Using Vudu's mobile app on your Android or iOS device, it's possible to scan a movie's barcode using your phone's camera. If it's one of the 8,000 movies currently supported by the service you'll get the option to convert to digital. Related Vudu Offers Free Movie Streaming, if You Watch Some Ads Vudu Offers Free Movie Streaming, if You Watch Some Ads Pricing for the conversion varies based on the type of disc. Blu-ray to a 1080p HD digital copy (HDX) costs $2, as does a DVD to SD digital copy. But if you want to turn a DVD movie into a HDX digital copy, Vudu charges $5. A discount of 50 percent is available if you convert 10 or more movies, though, and every users gets one complimentary mobile conversion. The resulting digital copy is an UltraViolet movie, meaning you'll also need an UltraViolet account and playback is limited to UltraViolet-compatible services and devices. UltraViolet simply acts as a digital locker storing licenses for movies you are allowed to watch rather than storing the movie data itself. For anyone looking to rid themselves of physical media, these cheap movie conversions may be tempting. However, I suspect that $5 DVD to HD price is going to seem too steep for many people, especially when you consider the growing popularity of services such as Netflix for as little as $7.99 a month.

Sears' parent company, Sears Holdings, on Tuesday, March 21, 2017, said there was 'substantial doubt' about the retailer and Kmart's ability to stay in business due to severe losses. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is “substantial doubt” it will be able to keep its doors open. It's a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading, it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. The lone Sears store in Westmoreland County is at the Westmoreland Mall on Route 30, east of Greensburg. Other stores in the region include Indiana Mall outside Indiana, at South Hills Village in Bethel Park, Ross Park Mall in Ross Township, Robinson Town Center in Robinson, Johns­town Galleria in Richland Township ,Washington Crown Center in Washington and a home appliance store in Monroeville. Lee Lange, 63, of Belle Vernon visited the Westmoreland Mall store Wednesday with his wife to pick up an item they ordered online. “The Sears nearest to us ended up being closed,” said Lange, who drives 21 miles to visit the mall anchor store. “We do a lot of our shopping research online. We maybe come here once a month.” Brigette Klosky, 51, of Unity, said she's been “coming to Sears as long as I can remember.” “Sears kind of has its own niche, and I can't stand Wal-Mart, so I don't know where I'll go (if it closes),” Klosky said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct-to-consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it's been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January that it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players has also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, said Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. “They're past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. But the onset of discounters such as Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers including Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Ill., lost $607 million in the most recent quarter amid declining revenue. “They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” Perkins said.

The latest effort is with Utah's Powder Mountain, designed as a purpose-built community. This photo is not of author Steve Andrews.               The invite email for the Summit Series said to check in by 4 p.m. but it's 3:45 p.m. and I'm still roughly half an hour away according to my phone's map. It's hard to keep my eyes on the road because I'm passing incredible possibilities for untouched powder lines as I weave through Utah's Ogden Canyon. I had to make an emergency pitstop at Wal-Mart after the timely realization that I never took my underlayers out of the dryer. At least the lightbulb went off before I got to the hill. Surely there has to be some buffer time to allow for late arrivals like myself, considering the majority of the guests for this weekend are flying into Salt Lake City on a Friday.  As I race through Eden — population 600 with only one gas station and no stoplights — I fail to consider that a lack of cell-phone reception prevents me from checking the directions in my email. I remember reading the check-in location is called Bower Lodge, so I speed uphill on Powder Mountain. I ask a few people where to find Bower, only to meet puzzled faces with no idea what I'm talking about. I zigzag my way between lodges with no luck until I finally reach the top where a ski-patrol shack sits at the end of the road. Surely they will know where it is. They are friendly and welcoming, but after telling them my intention to write a story on the changes taking place here, the room goes quiet and they look around at one another. Another patroller remarks: "No comment" while everyone else laughs.  Another one pipes up: "Come back with a bottle of tequila and we'll tell you some stories."  The guy to my left realizes that the lodge in question is the old clubhouse at the golf course back down in the valley. I thank them and speed back down to check in with no time to spare. While weaving back down toward Eden, my first note-to-self is: Fun-looking mountain but at US$40 million they could probably afford a couple of signs. The Summit Series started as an offer for a free ski weekend from a college dropout wanting to fast-track how to become a successful entrepreneur.  Elliot Bisnow and his "dream list" of 19 people has now blossomed into a community of more than 10,000 individuals who converge under the Summit banner several times a year.  According to their website: "Summit creates unique gatherings designed to catalyze entrepreneurship, creative achievement, and global change to create a more joyful world." To put it another way, they produce events that bring together people who want to meet other big-idea people.   Four years ago, the same people crowd-sourced the funds to purchase Powder Mountain and the land that it's built upon. After 10 years as a brand, Summit now has a home as stewards of an old ski resort that bears the oxymoron of being famous for the fact that nobody knows about it. The group intends to develop a town roughly the size of Telluride — at about 180 hectares with a population of about 2,300 — to serve as a hub for innovators, artists, and anyone else who dreams of a better society. But who doesn't, really? Especially when it comes to the jargon we see in developer's marketing collateral. What makes these guys different? Is it possible to balance their lofty ideals with the end goal that all investors will turn a profit? Is the Summit weekend just an elaborately produced effort to attract buyers to a new purpose-built community in which a few investors stand to make a huge pile of money? That's certainly one way to look at it, and even if that were the only motive, it could be a brilliant marketing campaign in mountain-resort real estate. The founders share high ideals and a grand vision that includes creating co-op work spaces, open venues to encourage interaction, and Burning-Man inspired art installations throughout their new town. But Summit's founders aren't from the mountains, they bought into it. Will the fast-paced city mentality influence the mountain community they hope to create? Or can it be the other way around where the landscape and open spaces help these high-profile influencers not take themselves and life too seriously? FIRST STEPS Powder Mountain has operated as a ski resort for more than 45 years. Rising high above Eden, the area is relatively unknown in comparison to nearby Park City and the resorts within the Cottonwood Canyons.  Eden itself is nothing more than a prime example of resort gentrification: large parcels of land subdivided over the past few decades to make room for townhouses that pack in weekenders from Salt Lake City and points beyond. The mountain's 4,000 hectares receive over 12 metres of Utah's famously dry snow yearly; enough to cause most snow-lovers to take notice. But until the latest change of ownership occurred just over three years ago, the local skiers and boarders rejoiced in their well-kept secret of the lack of crowds.It was their biggest asset. Now that Summit is at the helm, there is potential for Powder Mountain to show up on a radar of skiers and non-skiers: their market is the rich, elite city dwellers from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere who are keen to escape their urban habitat and connect with other like-minded individuals here. Summit began 10 years ago on the Utah ski slopes. The then-22-year old Bisnow wanted to connect with bright minds. In 2005 Bisnow and his father founded Bisnow Media, which last year they sold for a reported $50 million. But early on, as a fresh college dropout, Bisnow admittedly was in over his head. "In my quest to just meet other entrepreneurs and get advice I cold-called 20 people that I'd read about," Bisnow said. "I invited Blake (Mycoskie) from TOMS shoes, and Ricky (Van Veen) and Josh (Abramson) who started (the popular video website) Collegehumor. We went skiing in Alta, which is just over an hour from Powder Mountain. I actually paid for the trip on my credit card and got sponsors to cover the costs. And that was the first Summit." That first meeting was so successful that the group decided to meet again six months later — that time inviting a few more friends and business associates. Steadily the word got out of a gathering of like minds across a wide spectrum of industry with the shared assumption that humanity as a whole is greater than the sum of its individuals. The events became more polished and headline speakers included Quentin Tarantino, Erin Brockovich, and Kendrick Lamar. Additionally you can meander between a full slate of activities including yoga, meditation sessions, even arts and crafts: I made a leather bracelet on Sunday afternoon that I'm pretty proud of. Deals were made and companies were born. Over a short time, the Summit events blossomed and became a destination for self-professed visionaries who were keen to interact and rub shoulders with each other. PURCHASING A MOUNTAIN Greg Mauro, Venture capitalist by day and skier by heart, had been looking for a mountain home for some time. His parents owned a house in Aspen, where his love of the mountains was fostered. But by the turn of the millennium, Aspen had morphed into an overwhelming monstrosity of a resort destination that had lost its small-town charm. He tried living in different areas, including Whistler in 2001. Eventually he discovered the relative solitude of Powder Mountain and fell in love. He invited friends to visit, but on the condition that any photos they took or tales of endless powder runs should be misrepresented as Park City in fear this secret would get out. In 2011, the owners put Powder Mountain up for sale. Originally the plan was to develop three golf courses and a town of 10,000, a vision that sounded all too familiar to this Whistlerite. But those owners couldn't cut it. It was the aftermath of the 2008 recession and their vision was dead in the water. Mauro saw the opportunity to make a deal and approached Summit with an out-of-the blue offer. "We flew out the next day," Bisnow said of the response to Mauro's offer. "He (Mauro) said there's this unbelievable 10,000-acre ski area called Powder Mountain. I think we can get in there and buy it for an unbelievable price and could do something really special." As the Summit members and Mauro looked over the expansive Wasatch mountain range and Salt Lake Basin on a site that would eventually become the Sky Lodge, an unexpected alliance formed virtually overnight. Mauro would ensure that the day-to-day operation of the resort was profitable and the Summit team would focus on building a community by attracting buyers through their trademark events.  In 2013 Powder Mountain changed ownership for $40 million with a consortium of young Millennials at the helm — the first time a group from the new generation was in charge of this type of resort development.  To finance the deal, they crowd-funded the purchase and had no trouble raising the money. The new owners produce events, but they didn't know squat about mountain-community development. "We studied about 30 different mountain communities from all over the world," Bisnow said. "We looked at Aspen, Park City, Telluride. We also looked to communities in Europe and even places like SoHo and Windward Walls in Miami." Bisnow's main concern is the ski-resort explosion of "McMansions" and the "era of huge houses."  In an effort to prevent that from happening at Powder Mountain, they are limiting house sizes to 4,500 square feet, with the majority of the homes taking up around 2,500. The ideal is to blend the homes with the natural environment.  And lots are selling like hotcakes, ranging from $225,000 to more than $2 million. WHO BUYS INTO THIS? On this weekend in late January, the candle-lit steps direct us upstairs toward the commotion taking place inside the Timberline Lodge. At 40 years old, it's the closest thing to a historical building on the mountain. I introduce myself to anyone and everyone and in less than half an hour I meet venture capitalists, app-developers, real-estate tycoons, a New York Times columnist, and a famous movie director as we gather at a long-table dinner that encourages a family-style meal among strangers. Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal tells us that the mission "is to inspire entrepreneurs and innovators from different backgrounds." The criteria has always been the same, he says: "Are you innovators of your discipline, regardless of your level or age? And are you nice people who we want to be around, regardless of personal or professional success?" It sounded fairly clichéd to me. Of course, you want to be around the people you are around, nothing profound there. But at the same time it hints at exclusivity: who judges whether or not a candidate is someone they want to be around? And what if that perception changes? Human nature being what it is, what he said sounded nice, but I know that you can't build a community under those pretenses, no matter how hard you try. He also set a few ground rules: No social media content inside the lodges; and no drinking and driving. Through a Cadillac sponsorship the event featured brand-new black Escalades as shuttles to the venues between mountain and valley. Riding in the $100,000 SUV helped me feel special, but it isn't enough for me to want to drink the Kool-Aid. This event took place a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the U.S., a fact that is unavoidable in conversation. To my relief, many here are as dumbfounded as I am at what had happened. Through dozens of discussions I realize this crowd is well-off, but they're not ostentatious. As everyone finds seats at the table, I sit down next to Colin Eckles: He's in his early 30s and made his fortune selling real estate in China. He now splits his time between Los Angeles and Hawaii, and is developing his own community on 200 hectares on Hawaii's big island — a community that will feature biodynamic agriculture and follow permaculture principles. He wants to construct seven buildings to serve as spiritual centres, coinciding with the seven chakras. "I did the tour," he says, referring to the Summit realty team's guided mountain tour. "And I'm in. I bought a lot."   Eckles was not the only person I spoke to over the weekend who purchased a lot after seeing the land and Summit's plans to orchestrate a new community.  Sitting down for a rest at the Sky Lodge on Saturday afternoon, I met a board member of a high-profile sports brand who made the deposit last year and finally pulled the trigger this weekend to secure his lot. "Now I just have to tell my wife," he says with a nervous grin. At prices up to $2 million or more per home site, it is similar to the Sea to Sky market; although this purpose-built community has a collective intention for 'good business.' The people I meet seem to have an earnest desire to grow a community that differs from other mountain towns. Bisnow himself is building a family home where he plans to raise his kids in this exclusive little hub. This is not a pump-and-dump scheme, and the endgame will be — for now — a mountain community in which everyone is from a similar socio-economic background and shares the same modus operandi of getting rich off of really big, successful ideas. Comparisons could be made: Is it a rich-kids' club? Cult-like? Maybe a bit of both. The people running the show regard art, intelligence, and community as their biggest assets, at least on paper. Their plans promise a respect for Mother Nature and the hope to symbiotically coexist and not to conquer. But come on, don't we all buy into this? And haven't we been duped before? What was obviously missing from the weekend was the dirtbags. This was an affluent, educated bunch of people, but they weren't from the mountains. The group was still coated with their veneer from New York or San Francisco, showing that it's easier said than done to take the city out of the city folk. Mountain culture is much different from SoHo or the Mission district and a big indicator of success will be whether this community can adapt to mountain life by not taking itself too seriously. Will they buy a new jacket when it rips after shredding through the trees, or easily fix it with a strip of duct tape? The urban intellectuals have descended upon the mountains, but will these guys rent out one of their rooms to the dishpig in the back of the kitchen working tirelessly at one of their marquee dinners? Where the Summit team will really have to prove itself is in how well they coexist with the third and fourth generation of Weber County locals who call Powder their home mountain; who love it for its lack of outside attention.  After Summit bought Powder Mountain, Facebook comments were quick and dirty: "Just a bunch of trust-a-farian douchebags that are going to ruin the valley. If you like waste, conspicuous consumption, and rich, overprivileged assholes that drive Escalades in $500 worth of couture "winter apparel" that has never seen actual use, by all means keep making these human-shaped bags of spiders more rich by buying lift tickets to their private mountain. To the very last person, they are a complete waste of blood and organs..." After I followed up with the guy who posted that, he had this to say: "I was unfortunate enough to work for Powder Mountain during the buyout, and subsequently walked off the job with most of the food and beverage staff because they fired the long-time F&B (food and beverage) director with no notice, to bring on a Summit kid." That Feeling The frigid morning air stings my face as I step outside the condo, a gorgeous unit that Summit must have rented from a local family. I can only assume the family owns it from the abundance of creepy portraits where everyone wears the same outfit. The clear blue sky is accentuated with a purple alpenglow sunrise on the eastern hillsides, beckoning all the early-birds who had the discipline to get home at a reasonable hour last night. I run into my new buddy Eckles and we head up the lift. It hasn't snowed for more than five days so I'm not hopeful of finding fresh powder. Yet Powder Mountain's slogan is: Preserving the Powder. There are still countless untracked lines right next to the lift that opened only today. The policies here differ from other resorts: They don't open every lift immediately, which ensures they can still open new terrain in between storms; and they cap day-ticket sales at 2,000 a day. Yes — so across this 4,000-hectare terrain, it means there is always plenty of untracked snow for everyone, even five days after the last storm. For an extra fee of $18 you can take a snowcat up Lightning Ridge toward James Peak for some of the longest off-piste freeride terrain in Utah — something I see as a selling point but may be deemed as extreme by most. The terrain can't hold a candle to what we have in the Coast Mountains, but to be fair, not much can. If Summit is true to its slogan and wants to preserve powder, my main wish would be to save these incredible runs for those who really work for it. Although tracks are present in the trees, the most difficult lines are still fresh for me to leisurely shralp without the pressure to go, go, go like I do at home. Whether hiking, taking a cat or bus, or just eyeing good runs from the lift, there is enough terrain to keep me interested. I find challenging, yet easy-access lines that would have been tracked out at resorts with a bigger scene. This is not an advanced group of skiers and boarders attending this weekend, and for the majority the rolling terrain is more than enough to satisfy. But the Paradise chair was ripe with enough cliffs and pillows to keep even the most discerning powder hound content until the closing bell. It gives me a sense of privacy and solitude that I haven't felt at a ski resort, and it is enough for me to consider that if I were wealthy enough to buy a lot, I would also see a return beyond the financial. I'd be one of the best skiers or boarders on the mountain and would have my pick of challenging terrain without fear of it getting tracked out. My riding partner and I differ greatly in ability but it doesn't matter. Part of the magic of snow sports is the ability to choose your own line and meet up at the bottom of the pitch. As I learn more about Eckles and his past I see how much this trip means to him: He tells me of his high-stress, high-stakes real-estate ventures and the resulting epiphany that life is not all about money. I admire his altruistic intentions for his own development plans, which give me a bit of reassurance that I chose the right path for myself by neglecting the city life and opting to live in the mountains. Like most of us, we come alive when we are given the freedom to creatively express our movement in nature. It's a decidedly first-world luxury that does have its purpose: it helps us lighten up and be present.  The world certainly needs more of that. As much fun as it is to make a new friend, the urge to push myself is too great and I split with Eckles to find some more challenging terrain. I find it in Powder Country, a zone that has no lift at the bottom but instead has a bus that takes you up the canyon back into the resort. Deep snow, a steep pitch, and a few drops are enough to satisfy my craving before heading back into the Sky Lodge for lunch. Steve Andrews was a guest of the Summit Group. He really enjoyed the buffets, free beer, meeting amazing people, and exploring those untracked lines. But for the price tag of $1 million to $2 million, he would put his lessons learned at Summit toward building his own mountain utopia somewhere up north.

Justin Charles Hardwick pleaded no contest to charges of joyriding and third-degree retail fraud. He remains jailed on a bond of $7,500/10 percent. According to the Michigan Department of Corrections, Hardwick has been convicted of felony home invasion and larceny of $1,000 to $20,000. The Chevrolet truck, emblazoned with an orange road commission decal, was recovered when the Hardwick was arrested for attempting to return a stolen home theater surround system to Walmart on Wednesday, March 1. While Hardwick claims to live with a girlfriend in Bad Axe, the court corrected its records to reflect he does not have a permanent address in Huron County. The lack of local connections was cited as the reason his bond was not reduced. Bad Axe Police Chief Dave Rothe said the investigation revealed Hardwick took the vehicle after discovering the keys had been left inside it after road commission employees parked it in the department lot after the work day. According to police, Hardwick attempted to exchange the merchandise for cash, but did not have a receipt. He showed the Walmart associate identification, but the return was denied. Walmart staff later determined the system was stolen and contacted police. Working with Walmart loss protection, Hardwick was identified and located. Both the surround system and the pickup were recovered with no damage.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Business 'Liquor wall' bill narrowly clears House committee Should grocery stores be able to sell liquor? - Orlando News Now A look at the raging debate over whether grocery stores should be able to sell liquor. A look at the raging debate over whether grocery stores should be able to sell liquor. News Service of Florida Privacy Policy A decades-old prohibition on liquor being sold alongside groceries and other retail goods moved closer to repeal Wednesday as a massive lobbying battle continued. The so called "liquor wall" bill (HB 81) narrowly advanced out of the House Commerce Committee in a 15-13 vote --- sending the measure to the House floor --- after being amended to more closely resemble a bill (SB 106) that is up for a vote Thursday in the Senate. House bill sponsor Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, said the amendment addressed concerns of other House members about the bill, which also narrowly passed two subcommittees. "I think anytime that you have an issue that revolves around or has anything relating to alcohol, you're bound to expect it to be somewhat controversial for some of the members," Avila said. Both proposals seek an end to a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores to be separate from groceries and other retail goods. The issue has led to repeated legislative battles in recent years, pitting Walmart and Target, which want to stock liquor on shelves near other goods, against Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, which have stand-alone liquor stores as part of their corporate blueprints. Walmart and Target lobbyists say the change is needed to meet customers' demands and convenience. Target lobbyist Jason Unger said if the proposal becomes law, the Minnesota-based company, with 122 locations in Florida, would still have to wait for liquor licenses to become available from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. "I also want to point out that local zoning in your counties and cities will still control whether Target can sell spirits in its stores," Unger said. Opponents argue the change will impact small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get their hands on liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. "I know when I'm in a big-box store it's often impossible, impossible to find somebody to help me," said Rep. Eric Eisnaugle, an Orlando Republican who voted against the bill. "So, the thought that somebody may actually be there to see a minor stealing a bottle of spirits, that was a compelling point." But Rep. James Grant, a Tampa Republican who supports the proposal, said the growth of app-based home liquor delivery services may have a bigger impact on the fate of the different businesses. "What is gobbling up the small business now is not whether a particular good goes into a big box store," Grant said. "What will have the effect is that we now have the ability, with the downloaded mobile application and a credit card, to not even have to get in our car to go to a store to buy it, regardless of what name is on the store, how big that store is and what protections are in place." Avila's amendment Wednesday included provisions in the Senate measure that would stagger the repeal of the law over several years; prohibit new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; and require that small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, be displayed only behind the counter. Chuck Kelley, owner of Beach Liquor in Panama City, Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Crestview, called the delayed implementation "selective relief" designed to let some businesses get out of existing leases. Both bills also would require checkout clerks under the age of 18 to be supervised by someone 18 or older when alcohol is being purchased. Avila's proposal does not include a Senate prohibition on liquor licenses being issued to gas stations that are not linked with locations providing more than 10,000 square-feet of retail space. The Senate provision would allow larger retailers that sell beer and have gas memberships, such as Sam's Club and Costco, to obtain liquor licenses. Avila said he's still working that issue with the various parties involved in the legislation.

Starting today, all you need to “convert” DVDs and Blu-rays collecting dust on your shelf into streaming digital movies you can watch anywhere is the case they came in and your smartphone. To be a little more specific, you scan the film’s barcode using Vudu’s mobile app and your phone’s camera. (Both Android and iOS are supported.) From there, you pay a small fee to gain access to that same movie as an UltraViolet digital copy. 8,000 movies can currently be converted via the new method. “There is something for everyone including fan favorites like the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and the Bourne series, as well as classics like Top Gun and The Godfather,” a spokesperson told The Verge in an email. Participating studios include Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal, and Warner Bros. Scan, pay a couple bucks, get UltraViolet copy It costs just $2 to make a “like” conversion. The easiest way to think of that is by resolution / video quality. Converting a Blu-ray to an HDX (high bitrate 1080p) digital copy costs two bucks. Converting a DVD to an SD digital copy? Also two bucks. If you want to upgrade a DVD to a high-definition digital version, that costs a little more: $5 for each conversion. Current Vudu users will be gifted one free conversion for trying out the service. UltraViolet movies can be watched with apps including Vudu and Flixster (both of which support offline playback). Verizon FiOS also supports the digital locker via its set-top box and mobile app. But Amazon Video, a massively popular streaming service, still does not, so your movie library is no good there. Same goes for iTunes, obviously. Those are the ways most people get their digital movies, so it’d sure be great if they found a way to do something similar. And if not, so long as you’re fine using Vudu and find your movie collection wasting space, this is almost certainly a cheaper option than rebuying everything digitally. Disc-to-digital initially began as an in-store program at Walmart. But the company soon after started letting customers make the disc-to-digital conversion using a home PC.

Sears said that there is “substantial doubt” that it will be able to remain in business. The company, which runs Kmart and its namesake stores, has struggled for years with weak sales. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Copyright - Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and MICHELLE CHAPMAN AP Business Writers NEW YORK (AP) — Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. It's a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." ––– Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota. AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report from Newark, New Jersey.

Digital Trends Home > Gaming > How you can try the Nintendo Switch before you buy How you can try the Nintendo Switch before you buy Want to try the Nintendo Switch? Now you can rent your own demo station By Steven Petite — March 20, 2017 8:10 AM Subscribe Share Nintendo Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you are undecided on the Nintendo Switch, or just want to see what all the fuss is about, there’s a number of ways to try the console before you decide to invest in the console. Nintendo will bring a Switch demos to a select number cities, though we also expect major retailers to start integrating demo kiosks to storefronts in the coming months. More: Here’s where you can pre-order the Nintendo Switch Retail Stores Nintendo’s has partnered with six major retailers — GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Toys “R” Us, Walmart, and Target — to sell the Switch. Of those six, only GameStop has started receiving Switch kiosks in stores across the country. From speaking with multiple GameStop stores, the kiosks only let customers interact with the Switch’s touch display to play game trailers. We’ve reached out to GameStop to find out if and when it expects to receive playable demo units. The other five retailers don’t have Switch kiosks in stores… yet. We spoke with Target and Best Buy, and will provide updates as we hear more. We also contacted Amazon, Toys “R” Us, and Walmart, but have yet to hear back. GameTruck mobile gaming parties If you don’t want to go to a retail store to try out the Nintendo Switch, you can always bring the experience to you, instead. Nintendo has partnered with GameTruck, a mobile gaming party service, to add Nintendo Switch consoles and games such as 1-2 Switch and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to its fleet of rental demo stations through 20, 2017. The stations will also feature Mario Kart 8 Deluxe once the game launches at the end of April. Each GameTruck will be accompanied by “game coaches,” who can provide tips to those unfamiliar with the system. Each truck will have multiple Switch consoles, so no one will have to wait very long, and party guests can try out the system in its docked, tabletop, and handheld configurations. GameTruck is currently available in 30 U.S. states, with locations limited to major cities thus far. You can enter your location information on the company’s website to find the closest GameTruck-supported area right here. Updated on 3-20-2017 by Gabe Gurwin: Added information on GameTruck parties in 30 states.

Sears Holdings, the holding company for the two iconic retail brands, warned investors late Tuesday that it can’t promise it will stay in business. It included the language in its annual report while insisting it might still turn things around. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” said the statement. While its recent history has been written in red ink, Sears was once one of the nation’s most powerful companies, both the Walmart and Amazon of its time. But its once-proud brands have mostly been forgotten by the modern American shopper. Now Sears Holdings is not even sure it can raise enough cash through loans and debt financing to survive. The company owes $4.2 billion, up from about $3 billion a year ago. It lost $2.2 billion in the fiscal year ending in January and has not turned an annual profit since 2010. Its losses since then total $10.4 billion. Sears Holdings said its ability to sell assets, such as stores and store leases, could be limited because it needs those assets to pay for pension plans. In January, Sears sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker. It is looking to sell Kenmore appliances and Diehard auto parts. The company issued a statement later Wednesday stressing that despite the cautionary language in the annual report, it believes it is on course to turn around its struggling business. “It is very important to reiterate that Sears Holdings remains focused on executing our transformation plan,” said Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar. “This is evident in the decisive actions we have taken in recent months. Despite the risks outlined we remain confident in our financial position.” Still, Sears Holdings has been in trouble almost since the 2005 merger that joined the two department store brands. At the start of 2006, it had 3,400 U.S. stores and 370 more in Canada that it has since sold. By the end of this January, it had only 1,400 stores left, all in the United States. The company still has 140,000 employees, but that too is down sharply from the 355,000 it had in 2006. Even that doesn’t tell the full picture of the decline. Sears was once the nation’s largest retailer and business employer. Long before the ascendance of Walmart, and decades before Amazon was even born, the Sears catalog was how many Americans learned to shop from home for a large variety of items they wanted. It developed an extensive store network, helping furnish homes as Americans moved to the suburbs after World War II — and causing trouble for small, locally owned shops. The company at one time grew to include not just the retail business but a bank, a brokerage, a real estate company and what was then the world’s tallest building, the Sears Tower, for its Chicago headquarters. Kmart had a proud tradition of its own as one of the first major discount chains. Its history, like that of Sears, stretches to the late 19th century. It became known for its “blue light specials,” short-lived sales signaled by a flashing light and a public address announcement. Kmart also bought many other retail chains that have since gone out of business, including Borders Books and Sports Authority. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002 shortly before Sears merged with its remains. The retail landscape is littered with storied brands that have closed in recent years as brick-and-mortar stores became an albatross in the face of growing competition online. Just in the last year, Sports Authority and The Limited have closed, and RadioShack and American Apparel are both in their second bankruptcies and in danger of shutting down. Macy’s, JCPenney and Staples have announced widespread store closing plans. The problems for Sears started well before the growth of online shopping. More than 20 years ago, it began to suffer from competition from low-price competitors such as Walmart, and big-box stores such as Home Depot. It lost its place in the Dow Jones index of the nation’s most important companies in 1999. Then came growing competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Analysts said Sears Holdings did little to invest in either the Sears or Kmart brand, instead trying to cut its way back to profitability by trimming advertising and closing stores. It announced plans to close 150 more stores in January, and its stock hit a post-merger low in February. Then the stock rebounded when the company announced a deal with creditors to borrow $140 million more and cut at least $1 billion in operating costs a year, along with reducing its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion. The “going concern” warning sent shares down about 15% in midday trading Wednesday.

As long as China is governed by engineers, I reckon this breakneck transformation will shock, intimidate and challenge us for decades to come Ask people in the US or Europe about Chinese technology and most will still cast a dismissive smile and say China remains home of the cheap and cheerful copycat stuff that fills Walmart shelves. The dangerous naivity of this view was brought home forcefully at our APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) meetings last year – the first in San Francisco and the second in Shenzhen. The first thing we noticed was that our internet worked noticeably faster in Shenzhen than around San Francisco. The second was that our Chinese colleagues were paying for everything via AliPay on their smartphones. In awe of the smart technologies on display at PayPal, Google and Dolby sound studios, we were blown away by Huawei, where 40 per cent of its 170,000 staff are working on pure research, and the foundations being are being laid for roll-out of 5G across the whole of China by 2020. Hardly a week goes by without fresh reminders of extraordinary technological developments occurring on the mainland – many unique to China. Take the bike-sharing boom that has gripped Shanghai and other mainland cities over the past year. Many cities worldwide have bike-sharing operations, but none like those offered by Mobike and Ofo in Shanghai: find your brightly-coloured bike (there are an estimated 450,000 of them parked around Shanghai), open the Mobike app on your phone, scan the QR code on the bike, and you are away. AliPay charges you a security deposit, and user charges of RMB1-2 an hour. The bikes are GPS-tracked. This e-payment revolution has left the rest of the world in the dust. China’s digital payments market is today 50 times larger than that in the US. China’s digital payments market is today 50 times larger than that in the US More seriously, look at the 500-metre-wide radio telescope in Guizhou province that has joined the global search for extraterritorial life. Or the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer which is by far the fastest in the world. Or lithium battery development. Or 3D-printed blood vessels made from stem cells…the list goes on. I even noticed this recently when a tech publication compared the specs of the pride of America’s drone market – the GoPro Karma – with the Mavic Pro drone made by DJI in the Pearl River Delta. By every measure the Mavic was superior – it flew faster, flew twice as high, weighed 25 per cent less, could fly 30 per cent longer time, and cost US$749 compared with the GoPro’s US$799. Where do the GoPro team go to slit their wrists? This extraordinary transition from cheap and cheerful to world-matching high tech is not an accident, and in many governments around the world it is triggering alarm and protest. Back in the early 2000s, China’s engineers – whoops, party cadres – realised that as “manufacturer to the world” its companies were playing a mug’s game. They had captured the low-cost assembly parts of the global supply chains of companies worldwide, but this kept their millions of migrant workers in virtual poverty, while they were importing high-value-adding components from manufacturers in the US, Japan, Germany and Korea. Domestic patent applications inside China have soared from nothing at the start of the century to 928,000 in 2014 – 40 per cent more than the US’s 579,000 and almost three times Japan’s 326,000 These engineers quickly worked out that if they were ever going to build a middle-class consumer economy, China’s workers would need to earn much higher wages – which meant higher productivity, and the technological capacity to make the high-value-adding sophisticated components inside China. From this, the Made in China 2025 scheme was conceived, attracting billions of dollars into research at home, and the acquisition of foreign companies, and foreign talent, wherever possible. Within two years high-tech experts, particularly in the US, were pressing panic buttons. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told the US Congress in January that China had plunged into “an aggressive by-hook-or-by-crook strategy that involves serially manipulating the marketplace and wantonly stealing and coercing transfer of American know-how”. In truth, China’s government was not doing anything unique or even novel. The Made in China 2025 initiative was based on Germany’s Industrie 4.0 blueprint for technology development. What is awesome is the speed and effectiveness with which they have built this technology self-reliance initiative from scratch. A total of 19 data labs have been established in universities across the country. STEM education (science, technology, engineering and maths) is being prioritised countrywide. A “Qianren Jihua” (Thousand Talents) scheme is trawling the world to attract brilliant scientists. And for a US official who has for decades had first-hand experience of how US government-funded defence industry research has been carefully used to fuel the US’s technology leadership worldwide, complaints about Chinese government support for high-tech research sounds a tad hypocritical. But Mr Atkinson is right to be unnerved, and wary of the massive global implications of what is now occurring across the mainland. From a horse-and-cart economy just three decades ago, China is not only being transformed: its lack of legacy technology infrastructure, and a ruthlessly hypercompetitive private sector, are leapfrogging in ways most of the rest of the world can barely imagine. China’s Huawei in 2015 became the world’s biggest issuer of new international patents. According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, domestic patent applications inside China have soared from nothing at the start of the century to 928,000 in 2014 – 40 per cent more than the US’s 579,000 and almost three times Japan’s 326,000. China’s engineers – whoops, party officials – have not simply been driven by the quest for technology leadership, or fear of reliance on technology from overseas. They hate its gigantic deficit in royalty and licence fees to foreign technology-holders. From zero payments for intellectual property in 2000, China today pays royalty and licence fees of almost US$20bn. Since its companies currently earn a meagre US$1 billion a year in such payments from foreign companies, that means an intellectual property deficit of over US$18bn. As long as China is governed by engineers, I reckon this breakneck transformation will shock, intimidate and challenge us for decades to come. And I suspect Americans will respond the way they know best – as lawyers.

By Brian Thiede, Lillie Greiman, Stephan Weiler, Steven C. Beda, Tessa Conroy / The Conversation March 23, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Delpixel / Shutterstock Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) householders worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). According to recent research, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of rural economies and communities. – Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the service sector. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan Beetpickers in Utah or the Camas Papermakers in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? – Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas Disability matters in rural America. Data from the American Community Survey, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. While rural-urban differences in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until recently. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional level, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America. American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in demographics, economic patterns, health and service access and state disability policies. While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. Disability is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly measure disability, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as inaccessible housing. – Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent less than one-sixth of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. – Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Tessa Conroy and Steve Deller, Professors of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Beth Mole - Mar 23, 2017 11:15 pm UTC Enlarge / Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos CEO. Getty | CNBC reader comments 70 Share this story Theranos CEO and founder Elizabeth Holmes is planning to give up some of her personal shares to investors who pledge not to sue the disgraced blood-testing company, the Wall Street Journal reports. The deals would only involve investors from the last round of funding, which ended in 2015 and brought in more than $600 million. These investors include the family of US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the family behind Walmart stores, and John Elkann, who controls Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Investors could get about two free shares of the company for every share they bought. The deals would also mean that Holmes could lose her majority stake in Theranos. “This is an affirmative development for the company, providing a path forward in partnership with employees, investors, and other stakeholders,” Theranos director Daniel Warmenhoven told the WSJ. “Elizabeth elected to contribute her own equity to protect any dilution of shares held by other parties.” He added that she showed “a level of selflessness and grace reflecting her commitment to the company’s success.” Theranos, once a dazzling biotech start-up valued at $9 billion amid promises that it could revolutionize the blood-testing industry, appears to be nearing rock bottom. Federal regulators shut down the company’s labs and banned Holmes from the industry after problems with its technology and the company’s practices were revealed. Theranos is appealing the sanctions. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department have opened investigations into the company, as well. Theranos has now pivoted to device manufacturing but still faces lawsuits from investors, its former business partner Walgreens, and customers who received inaccurate blood test results. It has laid off nearly half of its employees and seen its value plummet. At the end of last year, Theranos told investors it had $200 million on hand, not including a $40 million in debt. Now the company is said to be down to around $150 million, still not including debt. Beth Mole Beth is Ars Technica’s health reporter.

clock menu more-arrow Guides The South's 38 Essential Restaurants The dining rooms, shacks, stands, storefronts, and counters that define America’s most vibrant dining region by Bill Addison Mar 23, 2017, 10:50am EDT Prince’s Hot Chicken Helen Rosner tweet share pin Last July I had a pulled pork plate that perfectly summarized dining in the South right now. It was at Miller Union, a convivial restaurant in Atlanta (where I live — at least, for the week or so a month when I’m not on the road). You’ll find pulled pork plates everywhere in the South, of course; on this one, devised by chef and Georgia native Steven Satterfield, the meat came heaped over a handsomely misshapen johnnycake, lacy around the edges and ideal for soaking up the pork’s juices. Thin pickle rounds were scattered over top, and the whole thing was completed by tangy coleslaw, two crimson tomato slices seasoned with coarse pepper, and a side of barbecue sauce. The tastes roused me to the summer moment, and they also conjured similar Southern meals I’d relished all around this section of the country, at cafeteria-style meat-and-threes, and soul food restaurants, and barbecue establishments. The food on that plate resonated even further, though. The cornmeal in the johnnycake echoes the masa that chefs at taquerias throughout the South use to make tortillas. Other local cooks might take the same pork and braise it with soy sauce and ginger, or marinate it in Korean chile paste, or roast it until the skin crackles. The tomatoes might be into an Italian marinara or “put up” as ruddy South Indian-style chutney zapped with curry leaves and cumin seeds. Southern food is a mosaic. A constellation of culinary influences came together over the last 300 years to give us defining pleasures like skillet fried chicken, cornbread, cheese grits, collards in porky potlikker, and caramel cake. This was a cuisine built on Native American acumen, colonialism and the spice trade, adaptive farming in fertile soil, and on the sheer resilience of Africans sold or born into the horrors of slavery. The food of the region constantly evolves, its repertoire extending far beyond the Antebellum pantry. A constant influx of immigrants makes the South their home. Newcomers adapt regional standards to their tastes; their foods become indelible to our collective identity. The array of excellence and welcome multiculturalism — never before so vibrant in the South and across America — is a driving force behind this collection of the essential dining destinations in the region. Geographically, we framed the South to encompass central Virginia (we’ll tackle Washington D.C. and its metro area in a later survey of the Mid-Atlantic) to Louisiana, and including the mountain states of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia (though no West Virginia restaurants made the cut this time). Texas is Texas; it’ll have its very own map. The South is the part of the country I know best, but no one person could author an unimpeachable declaration of the essential restaurants across this dazzling corner of America. On this list — presented in alphabetical order by state and restaurant — you’ll find a rich cross-section of voices and palates contributing their opinions. Twelve writers and experts joined me in narrowing the South’s dozens of standouts down to 38, a brutal task. Their names are attached to their contributions, and you’ll find their bios at the end of the article. Special thanks to Jennifer V. Cole, the most well-traveled Southerner I know, for obsessing with me via shared spreadsheets and fevered phone conversations. Of course famed regional specialties (shrimp and grits, whole hog barbecue, mac and cheese, berry cobbler) make appearances here. So do posole, and Sichuan pork belly, and a spin on bibimbap that incorporates fried catfish. Your favorite didn’t make the cut? Some of mine didn’t, either. As with any Eater map, this ensemble is a living document, a work in progress, and an invitation to debate, savor, and celebrate. — Bill Addison, restaurant editor See the 38 best restaurants in the South, in map form! → ALABAMA Fisher’s at Orange Beach Marina Orange Beach, Alabama Fisher’s at Orange Beach Marina WHAT: The bounty of the Gulf, in its freshest and finest expression. WHY: Beachside restaurants across the South often (distressingly) serve fish flown in from elsewhere. This dock-chic treasure, though, offers the true local catch. Chef Bill Briand’s unremitting support of area fishermen and oyster farmers yields dazzlers such as roasted Bon Secour oysters buoyed by garlic-leek butter, or curried grouper collar packed with silky flesh and swathed in a cloak of tomatoes, charred peppers, and mint. — Jennifer V. Cole 27075 Marina Road #300 Orange Beach, AL 36561 (251) 981-7305 | fishersobm.com Highlands Bar and Grill Birmingham, Alabama Bill Addison WHAT: The flagship restaurant of the empire overseen by Frank and Pardis Stitt, the South’s first couple of gracious hospitality. WHY: Decades before all of America came to worship fried chicken and shrimp over grits, Frank Stitt forged a cuisine that applied French techniques to ingredients grown on Alabama farms and fished from Gulf waters. Highlands opened in 1983, and has stayed strikingly relevant since day one: A recent stunning dinner of lemony pan-seared shad roe, duck ballotine spiced with juniper and cumin, and pastry chef Dolester Miles’ edge-of-spring strawberry cobbler reminded me of its magnificence yet again. — B.A. 2011 11th Avenue South Birmingham, AL 35205 (205) 939-1400 | highlandsbarandgrill.com ARKANSAS Courtesy of The Hive The Hive Bentonville, Arkansas WHAT: This ambitious restaurant in the artsy 21C Hotel sits a short mile away from the massive Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Walmart-heiress-led museum that has turned this northwestern Arkansas town into a cultural magnet. WHY: From the restaurant’s perch at the fringe of the Ozarks, chef Matthew McClure delivers a pitch-perfect mix of dishes that blends Southern warmth and Americana-style heartiness, including a 25-minute egg with pork belly and kale as well as beef rib-eye grilled over wood and served with roasted potatoes. — David Ramsey 200 NE A Street Bentonville, AR 72712 (479) 286-6575 | thehivebentonville.com FLORIDA Bill Addison Alter Miami, Florida WHAT: A playful, exciting, and unexpected ascendant in Miami’s buzzing Wynwood Arts District. Alter’s cramped, stripped-down space in a former warehouse departs from the town’s unending voracity for glitz, but locals and visitors eagerly wade into the melee. WHY: The South never really embraced modernist cooking; the success of chef and co-owner Brad Kilgore’s breakout hit is the deserving exception. Whirling with global flavors, his vibrant creations (poached egg dressed in scallop espuma and truffle pearls as one example) are so exquisitely constructed that cleaning your plate feels like an act of vandalism. — Lee Klein 223 NW 23rd Street Miami, FL 33127 (305) 573-5996 | altermiami.com El Palacio de los Jugos Miami, Florida T. Tseng/Flickr WHAT: An exuberant array of traditional Cuban foods and fresh juices, vended from stalls squeezed into a tropical fruit market. Portions are huge, prices are modest, and the mojo-marinated lechón asado is killer. WHY: To lunch at outdoor tables alongside the bustling crowds, with your Styrofoam container of comida, is to take a colossal bite of the Miami-Cuban cultural and culinary experience. El Palacio has multiple locations, but the original on Flagler is the one to visit. — L.K. 5721 W. Flagler Street Miami, FL 33144 (305) 264-8662 | elpalaciodelosjugos.com GEORGIA Bill Addison Five & Ten Athens, Georgia WHAT: The polestar of chef, cookbook author, and Top Chef judge Hugh Acheson’s Georgia restaurant cadre. He opened Five & Ten, his first venture, in 2000 in a lovably scruffy space before relocating it to a genial Colonial Revival–style bungalow in 2013. WHY: Executive chef Richard Neal winningly carries on the easy-to-love aesthetic established by Acheson — a culinary style that plucks ideas from the French and Italian canons but still lands squarely in the South. A recent dazzler: buttery cornmeal porridge, a shade soupier than breakfast grits, covered with a sustaining tangle of collards, chard, kale, beets, and pickled hedgehog mushrooms. — B.A. 1073 S. Milledge Avenue Athens, GA 30605 (706) 546-7300 | fiveandten.com Bill Addison The Grey Savannah, Georgia WHAT: A transformed Greyhound bus station showcasing both a gleaming Streamline Moderne interior and the remarkable culinary talents of Mashama Bailey. WHY: Memories of her childhood summers in South Georgia inspired Bailey to leave Manhattan in late 2014 and lead the Grey’s kitchen. Her self-described “port city Southern food” summons Savannah’s centuries-old spice trade. Serrano chiles set blaze to smoked collard greens, chermoula brightens grilled broccoli, and za’atar adds lemony zest to bison meatballs. — Adrian Miller 109 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard Savannah, GA 31401 (912) 662-5999 | thegreyrestaurant.com Heirloom Market BBQ Atlanta, Georgia Bill Addison WHAT: A barbecue restaurant like no other, reflecting Atlanta’s love for smoked meats while also evincing the city’s Korean culinary riches. (The metro area is home to one of the country’s fastest-growing Korean-American communities.) WHY: Look no further than the spicy Korean pork sandwich, the magnum opus of chef-owners Jiyeon Lee and Cody Taylor. Gochujang chile paste imparts sweet heat to pork rib meat, which smokes over hickory and pork before being chopped, topped with kimchi coleslaw, and served on a potato bun. — B.A. 2243 Akers Mill Road Southeast Atlanta, GA 30339 (770) 850-1008 | heirloommarketbbq.com Bill Addison Kimball House Decatur, Georgia WHAT: The cocktail and oyster bar of your dreams, opened in 2013 in a historic train depot in downtown Decatur, the smaller, hipper city adjacent to Atlanta. WHY: It’s the best place to start a night (the weekday oyster happy hour is the best in town) or end one (the staff sings a charming last-call song with xylophone accompaniment). The cocktail list, though short and accessible, is creative and ever-changing, so it always feels exciting. Same goes for the oyster selection; co-owner Bryan Rackley culls a daily-changing list of 20 or so bivalves from small producers around the South and beyond. Looking for a heavier snack? Order the exceptional, creamy-crisp pommes macaire. — Sonia Chopra 303 E. Howard Avenue Decatur, GA 30030 (404) 378-3502 | kimball-house.com Bill Addison Masterpiece Duluth, Georgia WHAT: The Sichuan jewel of Buford Highway, Atlanta’s famous corridor of restaurants serving cuisines from every corner of the globe. WHY: Ri Liu is a masterful classicist, the kind of chef who carves dragons out of carrots, transforms a hunk of pink pork belly into a glazed mahogany square, and turns the most basic white fish into something fiery and menacing (and also entirely delicious) with layers of chopped red chilies and scallions. Service is notoriously slow, but patience yields a wealth of intricately balanced dishes, many depth-charged with Sichuan peppercorns. — Jennifer Zyman 3940 Buford Highway Duluth, GA 30096 (770) 622-1191 Bill Addison Miller Union Atlanta, Georgia WHAT: Airy dining rooms filled with knotty wooden tables. Punchy, potent cocktails sipped alongside grit fritters flecked with country ham, or hummus made from red peas and benne seeds. Servers wearing pale blue cotton shirts and sincere smiles. Dishes like apple- and sorghum-glazed quail with dirty rice or rabbit braised in Dijon and cream that, in their elemental goodness, bring you back to yourself. Sounds great, right? That’s Miller Union. WHY: Chef and co-owner Steven Satterfield is a quiet virtuoso — the kind of chef to whom farmers rush to deliver their first-of-season asparagus and peaches, the kind of honest soul around which community blooms and flourishes. — B.A. 999 Brady Avenue Northwest Atlanta, GA 30318 (678) 733-8550 | millerunion.com Bill Addison Staplehouse Atlanta, Georgia WHAT: An airy, perpetually packed dining room where the kitchen converts heady ideas and contrapuntal flavors into true pleasures. WHY: A tragedy that became a triumph: Founding chef Ryan Hidinger passed away before he could open the restaurant, ultimately started by his widow Jen Hidinger, sister Kara Hidinger, and brother-in law Ryan Smith, whose mind-bending cooking deeply honors Ryan Hidinger’s memory. The menu changes nightly, but look for silky cabbage leaves blanketed with shavings of sake katsuobushi (a riff on Japan’s bonito flakes, made here from salmon or trout) in a sauce electric with house-made shrimp paste. — B.A. 541 Edgewood Avenue Southeast Atlanta, GA 30312 (404) 524-5005 | staplehouse.com KENTUCKY 610 Magnolia Louisville, Kentucky WHAT: A special-occasion restaurant open since 1978, whose energized, avant-garde tasting menus are thanks to Edward Lee, who took over as chef-owner in 2002. WHY: There’s an exhilarating contrast between the calm, flatteringly lit dining room and the eclectic, unexpected plates conceived by Lee and executive chef Kevin Ashworth. The most memorable dishes subtly incorporate Lee’s Korean culinary heritage, such as wagyu beef tongue with sauerkraut kimchi over caraway johnnycake, or king crab punched up with daikon, carrot, ginger, and cured egg yolk. — B.A. 610 W. Magnolia Avenue Louisville, KY 40208 (502) 636-0783 | 610magnolia.com Tortillería y Taqueria Ramírez Lexington, Kentucky Bill Addison WHAT: An exceptional taqueria and tortilla factory — and the only one in Kentucky that uses Weisenberger corn, a variety milled in the nearby town of Midway since 1865. WHY: A family-run success story, helmed by Laura Patricia Ramírez, this is the standout restaurant in Lexington’s community of Latino immigrants (affectionately known by its residents as the “Bluegrass barrio” and “Mexington”). In addition to fantastic tacos and one of the best overstuffed, Mission-style burritos outside of San Francisco, the menu also offers the intense flavors of the Mexican state of Jalisco, in particular the famous pozole rojo, guajillo-spiced pork and hominy stew. ­— Steven Alvarez 1429 Alexandria Drive Lexington, KY 40504 (859) 455-9237 LOUISIANA Bill Addison Dooky Chase New Orleans, Louisiana WHAT: A low-slung corner spot in Treme where you’ll get the best gumbo and fried chicken in town. WHY: This institution began life in 1941 as a bar; since then, it’s hosted civil rights leaders, famous musicians, at least two U.S. presidents, and generations of devoted New Orleanians. Leah Chase took charge of the kitchen in 1946 after marrying Edgar “Dooky” Chase, Jr. (who died in 2016). She earned a towering reputation for Creole cooking with her standard-bearing versions of beloved staples like shrimp with lima beans and her Lenten specialty, the meatless stew of greens and spices known as gumbo z’herbes. — L. Kasimu Harris 2301 Orleans Avenue New Orleans, LA 70119 (504) 821-0600 | dookychaserestaurant.com Josh Brasted Galatoire’s New Orleans, Louisiana WHAT: A time machine right in the middle of Bourbon Street, where tuxedoed servers deliver French Quarter classics to well-coiffed locals and spiffy tourists. (It’s one of the few remaining restaurants where gentlemen are politely required to wear a jacket after 5 p.m.) WHY: In a city that does lunch like no other, the pageantry of the midday meal at this landmark (open since 1905) goes unparalleled. Waiters bounce around the room, balancing martinis and hefting magnums of wine to ensure no glass goes dry. Follow their advice (you’ll never see a menu unless you explicitly request it) and revel in bacon-wrapped oysters en brochette, eggplant dressed with bearnaise and (improbably but deliciously) powdered sugar, and jumbo lump crab ravigote tinged with Creole mustard and horseradish. — J.V.C. 209 Bourbon Street New Orleans, LA 70130 (504) 525-2021 | galatoires.com Bill Addison Hawk’s Restaurant Rayne, Louisiana WHAT: The painted crawfish emblazoned across the front door of this sprawling, communal restaurant says it all: This pilgrimage-worthy operation is only open during prime Louisiana crawfish season, usually from January to late May. WHY: The boiled, peppery crawfish served at Hawk’s have meat that’s extraordinarily sweet, thanks to the particular way Anthony and Jennifer Arceneaux keep them in clean-water tanks. Plowing through a three- or five-pound order underlines the thrill of experiencing a regional delicacy at its physical and spiritual source (in this case lush Acadiana, in Southern Louisiana). — B.A. 416 Hawks Road Rayne, LA 70578 (337) 788-3266 | hawkscrawfish.com Bill Addison Herbsaint New Orleans, Louisiana WHAT: The firstborn among Donald Link’s Crescent City empire, and a restaurant that pulls off several balancing acts simultaneously to stand at the epicenter of New Orleans dining, steadfast but never dull. WHY: Chef de cuisine Rebecca Wilcomb knows how to deliver NOLA-style succor with her cooking; the dishes, like the sounds from a second-line band, are at once profound and buoyant. Her spin on carbonara using fresh-made spaghetti, guanciale, and fried-poached egg reveals an Italian lilt to the menu, but the classic, always-righteous gumbo and the coconut custard pie with buttermilk Chantilly cream bring the flavors bounding home. — B.A. 701 St. Charles Avenue New Orleans, LA 70130 (504) 524-4114 | herbsaint.com Josh Brasted La Petite Grocery New Orleans, Louisiana WHAT: The quintessential modern New Orleans restaurant, housed in an 1800s-era Creole cottage on a Garden District street corner. (As the name implies, a grocery once occupied the space.) WHY: Chef Justin Devillier, who runs the restaurant with Mia Freiberger-Devillier (the two are married), cooks as an homage to the past while also looking to the future; his approach puts him at the forefront of the city’s dining scene. He references French cuisine and traditional New Orleans fare for consummate dishes like sherry-spiked turtle Bolognese and paneed rabbit flanked with spaetzle and mustard greens, not to mention a terrific burger. — L.K.H. 4238 Magazine Street New Orleans, LA 70115 (504) 891-3377 | lapetitegrocery.com Bill Addison Parkway Bakery & Tavern New Orleans, Louisiana WHAT: The ever-popular stalwart for po’ boys in the Bayou St. John neighborhood, about a 15-minute drive from the French Quarter. WHY: Let’s lay this to rest: There is no singular best place for po’ boys in New Orleans. But Parkway (which, if there were a best, would assuredly be a contender) is undoubtedly the nexus of the city’s legendary sandwich culture, the fundamental place from which all other opinions spin. Unlike the fare at shops that specialize in fried seafood or cold cuts, all of Parkway’s sandwiches are excellent, particularly the fried shrimp, the roast beef, and of course the one that’s piled high with fried oysters, though it’s only available on Mondays and Wednesdays. — B.A. 538 Hagan Avenue New Orleans, LA 70119 (504) 482-3047 | parkwaypoorboys.com MISSISSIPPI Bully’s Jackson, Mississippi Courtesy of Bully’s WHAT: A family-run restaurant — its walls covered with paintings and photos of cultural icons like Martin Luther King, Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, and Malcolm X — established by Tyrone Bully in 1982. It’s the kind of place where you might notice cooks coming out of the kitchen to strip collards and mustard greens or peel sweet potatoes at a prep table just off the main dining room. WHY: Bully’s sets the benchmark for soul food. Its repertoire consists of definitive classics like smothered turkey necks, chitterlings, oxtails, rice and gravy, and macaroni and cheese. Don’t miss those wonderful greens, and be sure to finish your meal with blackberry cobbler. — A.M. 3118 Livingston Road Jackson, MS 39213 (601) 362-0484 Courtesy of Snackbar Snackbar Oxford, Mississippi WHAT: A clubby, wood-lined saloon and oyster bar in a college football town that also supports some notably sophisticated dining options (many of them run by Snackbar owner John Currence). WHY: Currence and executive chef Vishwesh Bhatt launched Snackbar in 2009 as a brasserie whose dishes meandered through France, the South, and Bhatt’s native India. But in the last few years Bhatt has wandered even further in his cooking, to outstanding effect: He braises lamb shanks in fragrant Persian spices, and riffs on bibimbap using fried catfish and Mississippi brown rice grits. — B.A. 721 N. Lamar Boulevard Oxford, MS 38655 (662) 236-6363 | snackbaroxford.com NORTH CAROLINA Sonia Chopra Chai Pani Asheville, North Carolina WHAT: Indian-style street food that neatly incorporates Southern produce and techniques in a Bollywood-inspired space. WHY: Too many Indian restaurants in the South have yet to fully move beyond the tikka-masala-and-garlic-naan usuals. Owner Meherwan Irani (who opened Chai Pani in Asheville in 2009; there’s a second location in Decatur, Georgia) and his team have a fresh take on Indian food that’s approachable and exciting. Look for smart takes on flavorful chaats and other shareable plates, alongside desi staples like rotating vegetarian and non-veg thalis that emphasize traditional favorites (butter chicken, saag paneer, Parsi red curry). — S.C. 22 Battery Park Avenue Asheville, NC 28801 (828) 254-4003 | chaipaniasheville.com Bill Addison Chef and the Farmer Kinston, North Carolina WHAT: This restaurant, with its tranquil red brick and wood interior, is the big draw to Kinston (pop. 22,000), thanks to chef Vivian Howard and her star turn on PBS’s award-winning series A Chef’s Life. WHY: The local ethos of Howard and her husband, Ben Knight, is truly helping transform rural eastern North Carolina. Inspired by her celebrity (and her restaurant’s steady business), farmers are turning once heavily industrial tobacco and hog farms into more sustainable chicken and pork operations. Tourists and locals alike revel in Howard’s savvy interpretations of sustaining Southern food. Cornmeal lends subtle crunch to tagliatelle; collards come creamed, pickled, or flash-fried; and, at the height of summer, buttermilk is whipped into savory ice cream as a dip for fried okra. — Victoria Bouloubasis 120 W. Gordon Street Kinston, NC 28501 (252) 208-2433 | chefandthefarmer.com Kate Medley Crook’s Corner Chapel Hill, North Carolina WHAT: The birthplace of the modern Southern culinary movement, sparked by founding chef Bill Neal (who died in 1990) and carried on with heart and intelligence by longtime chef Bill Smith. WHY: If you eat shrimp and grits at only one restaurant in America, make it this one. Smith, who is among the food industry’s most outspoken advocates for the rights of immigrant restaurant workers, also has a roster of annual specials that loyalists anticipate with marked calendars: His honeysuckle sorbet, for instance, only available in May and early June, literally freezes the essence of spring. — B.A. 610 W. Franklin Street Chapel Hill, NC 27516 (919) 929-7643 | crookscorner.com Kindred/Facebook Kindred Davidson, North Carolina WHAT: A paean to the Cal-Ital aesthetic (gorgeous produce and warm flavors, sunny decor, casual but ultra-informed service) that flawlessly translates to the Southern dining landscape. WHY: Husband-and-wife team Joe and Katy Kindred worked at top San Francisco restaurants before opening their own place in a converted brick storefront in Joe’s tiny hometown, 20 miles north of Charlotte. Katy composes a killer wine list. Joe makes improbable, transcendent pasta dishes, like strozzapretti in a sauce of eggplant, country ham, chiles en adobo, and vanilla bean. It’s worldly cooking, but sitting beneath the pressed-tin ceiling and breaking into billowing milk bread feels like you’ve pulled up a chair to Sunday supper. — J.V.C. 131 N. Main Street Davidson, NC 28036 (980) 231-5000 | kindreddavidson.com Bill Addison Poole’s Diner Raleigh, North Carolina WHAT: The renovated 1940s diner that Ashley Christensen took over in 2007, kicking off her spectacular rise as one of the South’s most renowned chefs and restaurateurs. Also, home to the best mac and cheese on the planet. WHY: Come simply to revel in the North Carolina bounty. Trust that there will be tomato pie, chilled whipped corn soup, and tilefish piled with succotash as summer crests, and crisped pork shoulder over butternut-maple grits with red-eye gravy to bolster you when cooler temperatures again arrive. — B.A. 426 S. McDowell Street Raleigh, NC 27601 (919) 832-4477 | ac-restaurants.com Bill Addison Saltbox Seafood Joint Durham, North Carolina WHAT: A beachy take-out shack in (landlocked) Durham, just outside the rejuvenated downtown. Long lines stretch from the window where diners place their orders, but the wait is unquestionably worth it. WHY: Chef Ricky Moore grounds his cooking in his eastern Carolina upbringing. Seafood caught that morning arrives from the coast just after dawn; Moore sets his specials accordingly. It could be croaker, mackerel or bluefish, oysters, clams or shrimp, all either fried or griddled (your choice). Grab a seat at one of the outdoor tables; Moore’s “good” tea (sweetened with simple syrup over crushed ice) rounds out the picnic experience. – V.B. 608 N. Mangum Street Durham, NC 27701 (919) 908-8970 | saltboxseafoodjoint.com Bill Addison Skylight Inn Ayden, North Carolina WHAT: The 70-year-old paragon of eastern Carolina-style whole-hog barbecue. WHY: Driving through the town of Ayden, 88 miles east of Raleigh, it’s impossible to miss Skylight’s building, mounted with a likeness of the United States Capitol dome. The whole-hog barbecue tray, Skylight’s time-honored specialty, starts with a cardboard boat full of chopped, long-smoked meat, every part of the pig tossed together and seasoned with vinegar, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. A slab of dense, creamy corn pone comes stacked atop the pork, and that’s topped by another checkered boat, this one full of creamy coleslaw. Together the trio is icon, sculpture, and pure joy. — B.A. 4618 S. Lee Street Ayden, NC 28513 (252) 746-4113 | skylightinnbbq.com SOUTH CAROLINA Bertha’s Restaurant Charleston, South Carolina Bill Addison WHAT: A modern exemplar of Gullah cuisine (the 300-year-old Lowcountry cooking tradition with deep ties to African coastal rice culture), served in a two-story brick building painted purple and sky blue. WHY: Albertha Grant started the restaurant in 1980 and died in 2007; her three daughters now run the business, filling trays with foods that typify their heritage. Sultry okra stew rich with garlic and pork is a signature. So are stewed gizzards and chicken necks with velvety lima beans, tomato-stained red rice, and fried pork chops marvelous enough to risk staining your clothes. — J.V.C. 2332 Meeting Street Road Charleston, SC 29405 (843) 554-6519 Jason Stanhope FIG Charleston, South Carolina WHAT: A refined haven on a busy downtown corner that reigns as the perpetual darling of Charleston’s fanatically observed restaurant boom. And rightly so. WHY: Every element — serene dining room, crowded bar, adventurous wine program, affable service, and incredible European-Southern cooking — adds up to a polished sum. Chef-owner Mike Lata and executive chef Jason Stanhope start with immaculate Lowcountry seafood for inspiration, but meatier dishes (like gnocchi with lamb Bolognese, or suckling pig and Carolina gold rice middlings gilded with shishito leaves and benne seeds) flaunt the same extraordinary quality and meticulous execution. — B.A. 232 Meeting Street Charleston, SC 29401 (843) 805-5900 | eatatfig.com TENNESSEE Dancing Bear Lodge Appalachian Bistro at Dancing Bear Lodge Townsend, Tennessee WHAT: The airy dining room of a 36-acre resort perched on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. WHY: Chef Shelley Cooper does her mountain grandmother proud with the likes of roasted cauliflower soup with crisped country ham, oxtail-and-duck-stuffed cabbage rolls, and sorghum-syrup sweet potatoes dotted with local blue cheese. Stay the night in one of the lodge’s cozy cabins, and grab a bag of the jerky-like Benton’s bacon that Cooper coats with benne seed, sorghum, and chile to fortify a glorious hike. — Ronni Lundy 7140 E. Lamar Alexander Parkway Townsend, TN, 37882 (800) 369-0111 | dancingbearlodge.com Bill Addison Arnold’s Country Kitchen Nashville, Tennessee WHAT: The most splendid manifestation of the steam-table meat-and-three, a cafeteria style of Southern restaurant that particularly thrives in Nashville. WHY: Owner Kahlil Arnold has a special knack for coaxing flavor from humble ingredients. Customers shuffle through the line (which, at lunchtime, often stretches out the door) toward regional wonders: fried chicken, turnip greens, creamed corn, fresh peach pie. A meat-and-three line has been called the great equalizer to the welcome table; Arnold’s draws everyone from policemen to preachers to John Prine. — Jennifer Justus 605 Eighth Avenue South Nashville, TN 37203 (615) 256-4455 | arnoldscountrykitchen.com Hog and Hominy Hog & Hominy Memphis, Tennessee WHAT: A renovated ranch house turned into a slick pizzeria; the kind of pie shop, though, that also serves sweetbreads doused with buffalo sauce and romaine salad amped with chicken skins and pecorino. WHY: Chef-owners Andrew Ticer and Michael Hudman combine the heritages of Italy and the American South with exceptional finesse. Pizzas topped with combinations like pork belly, egg, celery leaf, and sugo pull focus, but don’t miss inspiring brainstorms like gnocchi formed from biscuit dough. — Evan Mah 707 W. Brookhaven Circle Memphis, TN 38117 (901) 207-7396 | hogandhominy.com Bill Addison Husk Nashville Nashville, Tennessee WHAT: A stately 19th-century house, transformed into a transportive restaurant whose kitchen weaves narratives about history and reclamation and home. WHY: Because it’s Husk. If I could will myself there, I’d be eating Brock’s Appalachian sour corn cakes, fried chicken skins with Alabama white sauce, and Gullah-inspired crab rice right this minute. Alongside its sister location in Charleston (which is the original; I love both but favor the Nashville setting), it’s hard to think of a more famous Southern restaurant. Its chef, Sean Brock, is the modern face of the culinary South. His cooking exists at the nexus of mind-expanding innovation and deeply researched tradition. — B.A. 37 Rutledge Street Nashville, TN 37210 (615) 256-6565 | husknashville.com Helen Rosner Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack Nashville, Tennessee WHAT: The creator and perfector of Nashville-style hot chicken. WHY: As hot chicken’s cayenne flames continue to blaze across America, it’s imperative to savor it at the source. André Prince Jeffries, whose great-uncle Thornton Prince III perfected the dish in the 1930s, currently oversees the family business. When you reach the end of the ever-long line, make your choice: plain, mild, medium, hot, and x-hot, and (lord help you) xx-hot. Even mild and medium can quickly induce sweat and tears; any fierier is straight masochism. — B.A. 123 Ewing Drive Nashville, TN 37207 (615) 226-9442 | princeshotchicken.com VIRGINIA Kate Thompson Metzger Bar and Butchery Richmond, Virginia WHAT: A 40-seat restaurant in Richmond’s 200-year-old Union Hill neighborhood, where German meat markets once thrived. WHY: Inspired by the local history, chef and co-owner Brittanny Anderson singles out German cuisine (which we don’t see enough in restaurants, in the South or across America) as a backdrop for her varied, deeply considered repertoire. Her kitchen is as likely to prepare grilled green garlic topped with crumbled North African merguez as it is schnitzel over choucroute garnie, and it’s all sublime. — B.A. 801 N. 23rd Street Richmond, VA 23223 (804) 325-3147 | metzgerbarandbutchery.com The Shack The Shack Staunton, Virginia WHAT: A 400-square-foot red brick building in a small Shenandoah Valley town. The virtuosity of chef-owner Ian Boden makes his tiny restaurant the very definition of destination dining. WHY: Boden’s culinary career has taken him to Vermont; New York; Charlottesville, Virginia; and eventually to Staunton, where he fell hard for a mountain woman with deep local roots. In his snug cafe of a dining room, he serves a daily changing a la carte menu whose dishes teeter between Appalachia and the world beyond the region. Plates like turnip kraut with black garlic and sour cream, pork pierogi in caramelized milk sauce, and banana pudding that is both miso-salty and memory-sweet are evidence of his rich journey. — R.L. 105 S.

If I remember correctly, it’s the democrats that want to legalize drugs so people like this can be a burden on our society, rape our children, steal from the innocent. There should be discretion in law enforcement. With this much evidence on scene, maybe we should just let them overdose and not be a burden on the taxpayers.

They obviously have some sort of past that they feel tge need to use and numb the pain. What if this was some of your children getting busted, you would not appreciate people disrespecting them that way. As some of you are writing your hateful comments you probably have a beer in your hand. This is America if they want to use and break the law they will pay the consequences. I hope they get the necessary help to get better. Reply Anonymous R on March 23, 2017 at 12:35 pm I hate to tell you but the victims that addicts steal from, assault, murder are also humans. Those are the people I will save my sympathies for. I also have sympathy for the tax payer that is just getting by on the money he earned and would have done great things with a little extra money if his taxes weren’t so high. Druggies through incarceration, treatment programs, welfare, free medical care, etc.. are a big chunk of that tax money. Remember this, no junkie started out hopelessly addicted. They all started by taking pills for fun or taking more then the doctor prescribed. They all moved to buying them on the streets because the doctor cut them off for not following the rules. They all decided to move to heroin for a cheaper high. All junkies make an awful lot of bad decisions to get where they are now then expect everyone else to bail them out. People like you make it sound like they were born with a needle in their arm.

Global e-commerce major Amazon is aiming to enter the food retailing sector in India with investment plans of $515 million over the next 5 years. Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday confirmed the company's investment plans while adding that Metro Cash & Carry has also shown interest in food retailing. Back in January, Amazon had filed its application with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). Online players Grofers and Big Basket also have also submitted FDI proposals regarding retail trading of food items. While Amazon is one of the major e-commerce players in India, Grofers and Big Basket are into online grocery space. Last year, in June, the government allowed 100 per cent FDI in multi-brand food retail, including through e-commerce. However, the food products have to be produced, processed or manufactured in the country. However, while the move has drawn little interest from international retail players so far who have complained that just having "food only" stores was not a viable option. Multinationals including Walmart and French retailing major Auchan Group have indicated their interest in investing in the country if the government allows "food plus" in foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail, official sources said. While the Food Processing Industries Ministry wants FDI rules to be eased in multi-brand retail and allow food retailers to sell non-food items to the tune of 25 per cent of all shelf products, other ministries including DIPP are examining the matter, a senior government official said. On this note, Badal said the government will have to sort out the debate by November, this year when her ministry plans to organise the World Food Festival. Of the Rs 30 lakh crore retail pie in India, food constitutes Rs 4 lakh crore. The food processing sector received $5.76 billion in FDI equity inflows from 2010-11 to 2015-16, according to government figures. In the current financial year, till December incoming FDI reached 663.23 million. Badal added that the government plans to establish a National Food Grid to boost processing level of farm produce and reduce wastages by compressing gaps in supply chain. For this, a number of mega food parks, as well as cold chain projects are being approved. Japanese firms plan Indian units A number of Japanese companies have shown interest in setting up units for food processing, an official said. "Japan is keen to source its requirements from India. It already sources 40 per cent of products from abroad," the official said. Companies like Ajinomoto, Marubeni Corporation and Calbee are seeking investment opportunities in states. Kagome, the world's largest producer of tomato-based foods like ketchups, is among these. 13SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Sarabhai VS Sarabhai on Hotstar: An Analysis Digital Snapdeal puts its most fashionable foot forward; l...

Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek Inside Alabama’s Auto Jobs Boom: Cheap Wages, Little Training, Crushed Limbs The South’s manufacturing renaissance comes with a heavy price. by Peter Waldman More stories by Peter Waldman March 23, 2017, 4:00 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints Regina Elsea was a year old in 1997 when the first vehicle rolled off the Mercedes-Benz assembly line near Tuscaloosa. That gleaming M-Class SUV was historic. Alabama, the nation’s fifth-poorest state, had wagered a quarter-billion dollars in tax breaks and other public giveaways to land the first major Mercedes factory outside Germany. Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai followed with Alabama plants of their own. Kia built a factory just over the border in West Point, Ga. The auto parts makers came next. By the time Elsea and her five siblings were teenagers, the country roads and old cotton fields around their home had come alive with 18-wheelers shuttling instruments and stamped metal among the car plants and 160 parts suppliers that had sprouted up across the state. A good student, Elsea loved reading, horses, and dogs, especially her Florida cracker cur, named Cow. She dreamed of becoming a pediatrician. She enrolled in community college on a federal Pell Grant, with plans to transfer to Auburn University, about 30 miles from her home in Five Points. But she fell in love with a kindergarten sweetheart, who’d become a stocker at a local Walmart, and dropped out of school to make money so they could rent their own place. Elsea went to work in February 2016 at Ajin USA in Cusseta, Ala., the same South Korean supplier of auto parts for Hyundai and Kia where her sister and stepdad worked. Her mother, Angel Ogle, warned her against it. She’d worked at two other parts suppliers in the area and found the pace and pressure unbearable. Elsea was 20 and not easily deterred. “She thought she was rich when she brought home that first paycheck,” Ogle says. Elsea and her boyfriend got engaged. She worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, hoping to move from temporary status at Ajin to full time, which would bring a raise from $8.75 an hour to $10.50. College can wait, she told her mom and stepdad. On June 18, Elsea was working the day shift when a computer flashed “Stud Fault” on Robot 23. Bolts often got stuck in that machine, which mounted pillars for sideview mirrors onto dashboard frames. Elsea was at the adjacent workstation when the assembly line stopped. Her team called maintenance to clear the fault, but no one showed up. A video obtained by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration shows Elsea and three co-workers waiting impatiently. The team had a quota of 420 dashboard frames per shift but seldom made more than 350, says Amber Meadows, 23, who worked beside Elsea on the line. “We were always trying to make our numbers so we could go home,” Meadows says. “Everybody was always tired.” Pictures of Elsea in her mother’s home in Valley, Ala. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek After several minutes, Elsea grabbed a tool—on the video it looks like a screwdriver—and entered the screened-off area around the robot to clear the fault herself. Whatever she did to Robot 23, it surged back to life, crushing Elsea against a steel dashboard frame and impaling her upper body with a pair of welding tips. A co-worker hit the line’s emergency shut-off. Elsea was trapped in the machine—hunched over, eyes open, conscious but speechless. No one knew how to make the robot release her. The team leader jumped on a forklift and raced across the factory floor to the break room, where he grabbed a maintenance man and drove him back on his lap. The technician, from a different part of the plant, had no idea what to do. Tempers erupted as Elsea’s co-workers shoved the frightened man, who was Korean and barely spoke English, toward the robot, demanding he make it retract. He fought them off and ran away, Meadows says. When emergency crews arrived several minutes later, Elsea was still stuck. The rescue workers finally did what Elsea had failed to do: locked out the machine’s emergency power switch so it couldn’t reenergize again—a basic precaution that all factory workers are supposed to take before troubleshooting any industrial robot. Ajin, according to OSHA, had never given the workers their own safety locks and training on how to use them, as required by federal law. Ajin is contesting that finding. An ambulance took Elsea to a nearby hospital; from there she was flown by helicopter to a trauma center in Birmingham. She died the next day. Her mom still hasn’t heard a word from Ajin’s owners or senior executives. They sent a single artificial flower to her funeral. Alabama has been trying on the nickname “New Detroit.” Its burgeoning auto parts industry employs 26,000 workers, who last year earned $1.3 billion in wages. Georgia and Mississippi have similar, though smaller, auto parts sectors. This factory growth, after the long, painful demise of the region’s textile industry, would seem to be just the kind of manufacturing renaissance President Donald Trump and his supporters are looking for. Except that it also epitomizes the global economy’s race to the bottom. Parts suppliers in the American South compete for low-margin orders against suppliers in Mexico and Asia. They promise delivery schedules they can’t possibly meet and face ruinous penalties if they fall short. Employees work ungodly hours, six or seven days a week, for months on end. Pay is low, turnover is high, training is scant, and safety is an afterthought, usually after someone is badly hurt. Many of the same woes that typify work conditions at contract manufacturers across Asia now bedevil parts plants in the South. “The supply chain isn’t going just to Bangladesh. It’s going to Alabama and Georgia,” says David Michaels, who ran OSHA for the last seven years of the Obama administration. Safety at the Southern car factories themselves is generally good, he says. The situation is much worse at parts suppliers, where workers earn about 70¢ for every dollar earned by auto parts workers in Michigan, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Many plants in the North are unionized; only a few are in the South.) Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, March 27-April 2, 2017. Subscribe now.  Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek Cordney Crutcher has known both environments. In 2013 he lost his left pinkie while operating a metal press at Matsu Alabama, a parts maker in Huntsville owned by Matcor-Matsu Group Inc. of Brampton, Ont. Crutcher was leaving work for the day when a supervisor summoned him to replace a slower worker on the line, because the plant had fallen 40 parts behind schedule for a shipment to Honda Motor Co. He’d already worked 12 hours, Crutcher says, and wanted to go home, “but he said they really needed me.” He was put on a press that had been acting up all day. It worked fine until he was 10 parts away from finishing, and then a cast-iron hole puncher failed to deploy. Crutcher didn’t realize it. Suddenly the puncher fired and snapped on his finger. “I saw my meat sticking out of the bottom of my glove,” he says. Now Crutcher, 42, commutes an hour to the General Motors Co. assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., where he’s a member of United Auto Workers. “They teach you the right way,” he says. “They don’t throw you to the wolves.” His pay rose from $12 an hour at Matsu to $18.21 at GM. In 2014, OSHA’s Atlanta office, after detecting a high number of safety violations at the region’s parts suppliers, launched a crackdown. The agency cited one year, 2010, when workers in Alabama parts plants had a 50 percent higher rate of illness and injury than the U.S. auto parts industry as a whole. That gap has narrowed, but the incidence of traumatic injuries in Alabama’s auto parts plants remains 9 percent higher than in Michigan’s and 8 percent higher than in Ohio’s. In 2015 the chances of losing a finger or limb in an Alabama parts factory was double the amputation risk nationally for the industry, 65 percent higher than in Michigan and 33 percent above the rate in Ohio. “I gave them a very strong message … ‘American consumers are not going to want to buy cars stained with the blood of American workers’ ” Korean-owned plants, which make up roughly a quarter of parts suppliers in Alabama, have the most safety violations in the state, accounting for 36 percent of all infractions and 52 percent of total fines, from 2012 to 2016. The U.S. is second, with 23 percent of violations and 17 percent of fines, and Germany is third, with 15 percent and 11 percent. But serious accidents occur in plants from all over, according to more than 3,000 pages of court documents and OSHA investigative files obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Michaels, who was running OSHA when Elsea was killed, was furious when he learned how it happened. A year earlier, while attending a conference in Seoul, he’d paid a visit to executives at Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Co. to warn them that OSHA had found serious safety violations at many of their Korean-owned suppliers in the Southeast. Michaels told the carmakers they were squeezing their suppliers too hard. Their productivity demands were endangering lives, and they had to back off. Elsea was killed at this plant only a month after Ajin settled OSHA violations related to eight other workers’ injuries. Photographer: Rob Culpepper “I gave them a very strong message: ‘This brings shame on your reputation. American consumers are not going to want to buy cars stained with the blood of American workers,’ ” says Michaels, who in January rejoined the faculty of George Washington University. “They didn’t acknowledge the problem but said they were committed to safe working conditions. Clearly, they didn’t make safety a requirement for their suppliers.” Safety is a top priority at Hyundai’s Alabama operation, says spokesman Robert Burns, who added that Hyundai promotes safety at suppliers’ plants with quarterly forums and requires suppliers to comply with OSHA standards. After Elsea’s death, Ajin issued a statement saying all employees were being retrained in safety procedures. “Ajin USA is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Regina Elsea,” it said. A spokesman, Stephen Bradley, says the company can’t comment on the incident because of litigation. Elsea’s death “was a tragic accident, and Ajin remains deeply saddened,” the company said in a written statement. “Safety continues to be our guiding principle.” Ajin had settled other OSHA violations a month before Elsea was killed. Eight workers had fingers crushed or fractured in recent years in welding machines. After the first seven injuries, Ajin’s safety manager recommended installation of a machine controller called Soft Touch, which slows welding electrodes and stops them from closing together if a finger is detected. Nothing happened. Then an eighth worker smashed his thumb. For the unsafe welding machines, OSHA fined Ajin a total of $7,000. In December, after investigating Elsea’s death, OSHA fined the company $2.5 million for four “willful” citations, the agency’s most severe sanction, reserved for violators that “knowingly” disregard employee safety. Ajin is contesting the findings. The pressure inside parts plants is wreaking a different American carnage than the one Trump conjured up at his inauguration. OSHA records obtained by Bloomberg document burning flesh, crushed limbs, dismembered body parts, and a flailing fall into a vat of acid. The files read like Upton Sinclair, or even Dickens. Last year a 33-year-old maintenance worker was engulfed in flames at Nakanishi Manufacturing Corp.’s bearing plant in Winterville, Ga.—after four previous fires in the factory’s dust-collection system. OSHA levied a $145,000 fine on the Japanese company, which supplies parts to Toyota Motor Co., for a willful violation for knowingly exposing workers to unguarded machinery. The plant’s maintenance chief told the OSHA investigator that he’d been too busy to write up proper lockout procedures for working on the system. The technician suffered third-degree burns all over his upper body. Phyllis Taylor, 53, scorched her hand inside an industrial oven last year at the HP Pelzer Automotive Systems Inc. insulation plant in Thomson, Ga., while baking foam rubber linings for BMW hoods. The oven had been down for repairs earlier that day, and “there was always pressure to catch up,” Taylor says. She slipped on a puddle of oil at her feet, and as she instinctively grabbed the oven in front of her, the door slammed down on her hand. She’d been telling her supervisor for weeks about the oil leak. “They don’t pay you no mind; they just want you to work,” says Taylor, who had skin graft surgery but still can’t close her dominant hand. The plant’s maintenance manager told OSHA, “The focus of this plant is production at all costs.” OSHA fined HP Pelzer $705,000 for 12 “repeat” safety violations. “You heard all day long, ‘If we don’t get these parts out, the customer is going to fine us $80,000’ ” Nathaniel Walker, 26, had been doing the same high-wire act for three years at the factory of WKW-Erbsloeh Automotive, a supplier of metal trim parts to Mercedes and BMW, in Pell City, Ala. Every Saturday he climbed onto a ventilation duct above big dipping pools of acid on the plant’s back line, where the aluminum parts were anodized to give them a protective coat. It was always a race. At first, Walker and a co-worker had 24 hours to clean and service as many of the 34 tanks as possible. As production demands rose, management cut that to 14 to 16 hours, and sometimes to as few as 6. The job required balance and dexterity. Walker and his colleague hopped on and off the 4½-foot-high ventilation shafts, hauling hoses, tools, and 50-pound bags of caustic soda. They were always exhausted—Walker worked from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m., seven days a week, for up to six months straight. There were no gangways, no cables, no handrails. The only training the workers got from the plant’s German supervisors, according to Walker, was in how to rinse off the ventilation ducts so they weren’t so slippery. In July 2014, Walker fell in. He was balancing on the duct between two tanks—one empty, one full—while using a crowbar in the empty one to remove and replace a lead cathode. His hands slipped, and he tumbled backward into a vat of sulfuric and phosphoric acid 4 feet deep. Submerged, he swam for a second before righting himself. A nearby co-worker quickly pulled him out and hosed him down, minimizing damage to his skin and eyes. Walker’s cotton shirt pulled off his skin like wet tissue paper. His throat burned and swelled from swallowing the solution. He spent four days in intensive care and didn’t fully recover for months. OSHA fined WKW-Erbsloeh $178,000 and issued the company a willful violation for failing to secure the work areas around open chemical tanks. The agency had inspected WKW-Erbsloeh eight times since 2009 and issued multiple citations after another worker’s arm was chewed up in a polishing machine and a third employee lost a thumb. Walker was earning $13 an hour when he fell into the acid. “I was way, way underpaid for working all the time in a risky situation like that,” he says. Ray Trott, a retired U.S. Marine aircraft maintenance chief, worked for WKW-Erbsloeh as a production manager until 2015. He says the German managers didn’t seem to understand the American workers and were never satisfied with what they got from them. “If you made 28,000 parts one day, the next day they’d want 29,000,” Trott says. “You heard all day long, ‘If we don’t get these parts out, the customer is going to fine us $80,000.’ ” Reco Allen, with his oldest son, in Tanner, Ala. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek Reco Allen, 35, took a job at Matsu Alabama to get his life together. After dropping out of high school, he’d worked briefly at McDonald’s, then sold marijuana for a living. When he turned 30, with three kids younger than 6 and his wife working at Walmart, Allen decided dealing dope was no way to raise a family. “They’d see cars pulling up, hear people talking, and ask, ‘Daddy what are you doing? You ain’t got no job.’ I wanted to better myself.” He applied at Surge Staffing, a temp agency that was hiring workers for Matsu. Allen’s dad, who’d worked at the facility for a few weeks after a 30-year career making furniture at Steelcase Inc., told him to stay away—the Matsu plant was too dangerous. “Don’t let the monster eat you up,” he told his son. Allen took a $9-an-hour job on the overnight shift as a janitor. He passed up higher-paying positions on the assembly line, because “the machines scared him,” says Adam Wolfsberger, the former manager at Surge Staffing who hired Allen. The only training he received was where to find the mop and broom, Wolfsberger says. He stood there for an hour, his flesh burning inside the heated press. When emergency crews finally freed him, his right hand was severed at the wrist On April 2, 2013, after Allen had been on the job for about six weeks, a plant supervisor ordered him to put down his broom. He assigned him to work the rest of the shift on one of the metal-stamping presses instead and admonished him not to tell anyone about the job switch. Matsu was producing only 60 percent of its parts quota and could have been fined $20,000 by Honda for every minute its shortfall held up the company’s assembly line, according to a deposition by the plant’s general manager at the time, Robert Todd, in a workers’ compensation suit filed by Allen in state court in Huntsville. Allen testified in the case that his only operating instructions came from a co-worker who told him: “Get these blanks out of the bin. You load them in the machine, and you make sure you get back.” Stepping back was essential, not only to avoid injury but to clear the vertical safety beam, or light curtain, which is supposed to deactivate the machine if a worker is standing too close when an operator cycles it on. At about 4 a.m., Allen, wiry and 5 feet 9 inches, was leaning inside the machine with his arms extended upward, loading metal bolts. Suddenly the die, which stamps the metal parts, slammed onto his arms. “It felt like the whole world was coming down on me,” he says. The press operator hadn’t noticed him working inside the machine, and Allen’s frame was so slight that the safety beam missed him. He stood there for an hour, his flesh burning inside the heated press. Someone brought a fan to cool him off. “I was just talking to myself about what my daddy had told me,” Allen says. When emergency crews finally freed him, his left hand was “flat like a pancake,” Allen says, and parts of three fingers were gone. His right hand was severed at the wrist, attached to his arm by a piece of skin. A paramedic cradled the gloved hand at Allen’s side all the way to the hospital. Surgeons removed it that morning and amputated the rest of his right forearm to avert gangrene several weeks later. Allen and his sons watch a soccer match after basketball practice at Tanner High School in Tanner, Ala. Photographer: Johnathon Kelso for Bloomberg Businessweek Matsu, it turned out, had known for years that Press 10, where Allen was dragooned into working, was dangerous. Three years earlier a press operator on the plant’s safety committee reported a near miss on an identical machine after the light curtain failed to pick up a worker. The safety committee recommended fixes to the vertical beam, but nothing was done, according to testimony in the court case. In 2012 a worker on that same press had his hand crushed. In response, Todd, the general manager, recommended installing horizontal beams to eliminate the blind spot in the vertical light curtains of both machines. It would have cost $6,000 to $7,000, Todd testified. John Carney, the company’s vice president for operations at the time, rejected the proposal. Instead, he told Todd to install a safety bar, for $150, Todd testified. It failed to protect Allen. After Allen’s injury, Surge Staffing gathered its 80 or so Matsu workers for a meeting, says Wolfsberger, the former Surge manager. That’s when the agency learned the plant had provided no hands-on training, routinely ordered untrained temps to operate machines, sped up presses beyond manufacturers’ specifications, and allowed oil to leak onto the floor. “Upper management knew all that. They just looked the other way,” says Wolfsberger, who left Surge in 2014 and now manages a billiards parlor. “They treated people like interchangeable parts.” An administrative law judge with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission approved a $103,000 fine against Matsu, ruling that Allen’s injuries resulted from its “conscious disregard or plain indifference” to his safety. Matcor-Matsu did not respond to phone messages and emailed questions, nor did its attorney, John Coleman. After the commission’s 2015 decision, Coleman told the Birmingham News the judge was mistaken and that Allen was trained but didn’t follow the rules. Allen sued the company and reached a multimillion-dollar settlement out of court. He and his wife purchased 15 acres and a big house with a fish pond near the Tennessee River, prepaid their kids’ college tuition, and bought a bright-green Buick Roadmaster. “I’d rather have my arm back any day,” Allen says.   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

To do so, the chain is taking a few pages straight out of Wal-Mart's playbook. Following another slowdown in sales growth at its established shops, Dollar General on Thursday outlined its strategy to drive the business forward. While that plan includes the addition of 1,000 locations this year, it also incorporates investments that should boost performance at its existing stores.

[WILL VRAGOVIC | Times] Here's what you may have missed, and what you need to know as you start winding down: STERNBERG: RAYS' TOP CHOICE FOR STADIUM UNAVAILABLE Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg still expects to conclude the search for a new stadium site in the Tampa Bay area this year, but revealed today that they have been denied their top choice, or even top two. "We had some ideas on locations that just weren't available, that I thought would have worked perfectly, but they're off the table,'' Sternberg said in Port Charlotte. "So we're sort of moving down our list to Nos. 2, 3 and 4.'' Asked how confident he was their years long search would conclude with a workable site in the Tampa Bay area, Sternberg said: "It's unknown at this point.'' HEALTH BILL VOTE DELAYED IN HOUSE Republican House leaders delayed their planned vote todayon a long-promised bill to repeal and replace Obamacare in a stinging setback for House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump in their first major legislative test. AP SOURCE: U.S. TO APPROVE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE The Trump administration will approve the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, senior U.S. officials said, after the State Department delivers a positive recommendation to start construction on a long-delayed project that has served as a flashpoint in the debate about climate change. The 1,700-mile pipeline, as envisioned, would carry oil from tar sands in Alberta to Houston-area refineries, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Environmental groups objected to the pipeline's route and argued it would encourage the use of dirty sources of energy that contribute to global warming. ISIS CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR LONDON ATTACK; UTAH MAN KILLED ON BRIDGE The Islamic State group claimed responsibility today for an attack by a man who plowed an SUV into pedestrians on one of London's famous bridges and then stabbed a police officer to death at Britain's Parliament. A Utah man visiting London with his wife for their 25th anniversary and a British woman who was a school administrator were killed by the SUV attack on Westminster Bridge and 29 others were hospitalized, seven critically. Others were injured and treated at the scene. YOUR AFTERNOON TRAFFIC AND WEATHER REPORT As you head out for your drive home, check out our live blog for the latest traffic updates and road conditions across Tampa Bay. 'AMERICA'S TOY SCOUT' BUYS, SELLS PIECES OF OUR CHILDHOOD AT TAMPA AUCTION The third of Joel Magee's six days of scouting for toys across the Tampa Bay area brought dozens of hopeful sellers and a heavy dose of nostalgia to the Toy Buying Show at the Tampa Marriott Westshore for people selling off items they'd held onto for a lifetime — sometimes two lifetimes. But nobody matched Magee himself when it came to geeking out over the past. His enthusiasm and personal stories were what turned a business transaction into a "show." FLORIDA SENATE TO VOTE ON LETTING GROCERY OUTLETS SELL HARD LIQUOR IN STORES Floridians are one step closer to being able to buy whiskey, rum or vodka in a grocery store. Legislators passed the "whiskey to Wheaties" bill in the Florida Senate today, which will allow grocery stores like Publix or Walmart to sell hard liquor on the shelves next to beer and wine instead of in a separate liquor store with its own entrance. The Senate bill, if put into law, would allow retail stores to add liquor to only a quarter of the stores it has in Florida in phases over five years. ST. PETE PONDERS POT SHOPS The St. Petersburg City Council took a baby step toward regulating medical marijuana today, with one eye on pending state legislation and another on preventing a cluster of pot-dealing clinics operating too close together. A council committee unanimously approved requesting the city attorney's office to draft an ordinance that would prohibit dispensaries from setting up shop within 1,000 feet of each other or a church or school. Mayor Rick Kriseman's administration had proposed allowing dispensaries to operate like pharmacies, allowing them to open wherever Walgreens and CVS, for example, already do business. SEMINOLE TRIBE SEARCHES FOR REMAINS OF ANCESTORS ON EGMONT KEY Scattered throughout Egmont Key in plain sight are remains of its bustling past as the location of Fort Dade, built to protect the Tampa Bay area from invasion during the Spanish–American War in the late-1800s. But hidden somewhere underground on the scenic island at the mouth of Tampa Bay lies evidence of its darker days as home to a U.S. military internment camp for about 300 Seminole Indians in the mid-1800s. Today, the Seminole Tribe of Florida stepped up its efforts to find these ancestors. MAN SHOOTS TWO IN SEFFNER, ONE FATALLY, THEN CALLS 911 Deputies are investigating a shooting that left one man dead and another injured Wednesday night. A man identified as the shooter called 911 to report the incident and remained on the scene until deputies arrived. REPORT: ALBERTSON'S IN EARLY TALKS TO BUY SPROUTS Albertsons Cos., the grocery-chain operator backed by Cerberus Capital Management, has held preliminary talks to merge with Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., according to a Bloomberg news report. The talks have involved a plan to take organic grocer Sprouts private and add it to Albertsons' portfolio, which includes eponymous grocery stores and the Safeway store brand, Bloomberg said. MAN ARRESTED ON CHARGES HE CRITICALLY INJURED USF STUDENT ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY Police arrested Zachary Kenneth Allen, 23, of Largo on charges he punched and critically injured a University of South Florida student on St. Patrick's Day. Brian Neal, 26, is still in the hospital with life-threatening injuries. FLORIDA SENATE ADVANCES BILL THAT TRIES TO LIMIT 'GOTCHA' PUBLIC RECORDS LAWSUITS The Florida Senate today gave preliminary approval to a compromise proposal aimed at cracking down on "gotcha" public records requests while preserving the attorney fees leverage the public has against public officials who violate Florida's Sunshine laws. The bill is intended to crack down on a small group of serial records abusers who attempt to snag unsuspecting public officials into violating public records laws in an effort to coerce a financial settlement. WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR GORSUCH TO REACH SUPREME COURT There are two potential paths through the Senate to the Supreme Court bench for Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's nominee. One way or the other, he's expected to be approved thanks to the 52-48 Republican majority. FLORIDA SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS HILLSBOROUGH MAN'S DEATH SENTENCE The Florida Supreme Court today overturned the death sentence of a man who raped and fatally stabbed a Seffner mother of three in 2007. While the court upheld the murder conviction of Kenneth Ray Jackson, it ordered that he be resentenced because the jury was not unanimous in its recommendation that he receive the death penalty. BODY-CAM VIDEO SHOWS DEPUTY USING STUN GUN TO STOP PASCO MAN Pasco County deputies used a stun gun Wednesday night to stop a Hudson man who attempted to flee a drug arrest after he was pulled over for running a stop sign. Crews for the Spike TV show "Cops" were filming a segment as a deputy's body camera documented the arrest, which occurred around 11:50 p.m. after 34-year-old Cameron Ajax Jones was pulled over at Oakley Avenue and U.S. 19 in Bayonet Point, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. STAMKOS KNOWS TIME IS RUNNING OUT ON RETURN Steven Stamkos was once again the last Lightning player to leave the ice following today's morning skate in Boston. There's no question Stamkos is pushing hard to return as soon as he can, especially with his team fighting for its playoff life with 10 games to go. But Stamkos said progress in his recovery from mid-November right knee surgery has been slow. Stamkos reiterates the standings will not factor in his return date; he'll only come back when he feels 100-percent comfortable. And he's not sure if that'll happen by the end of the regular season. FORMER JEFFERSON QUARTERBACK GIVEN SIX YEARS FOR ARMED ROBBERY Former Florida Gators cornerback and Jefferson High star Deiondre Porter has been sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to an armed robbery charge in Jacksonville. Porter was arrested in April in connection with the robbery of a T-Mobile store. KATY PERRY'S RAINBOW-COLORED SHOE LINE IS GIVING US LIFE In the saturated realm of celeb shoe lines, Katy Perry's new collection is exceedingly on-point. The collection dropped in February, and the headline-making design has been one named for Hillary Clinton. The styles, many of which are named after Perry's famous friends, are available at Macy's and online. Afternoon update is a weekday feature from tampabay.com.

Press enter to search Is Walmart About to Revolutionize Buy Online Pickup In-Store? 10/31/2016 Shoppers are increasingly leveraging buy online pickup in-store (BOPIS) to get their digital orders in their hands as quickly as possible, but many retailers are still struggling with the logistical challenges. Walmart's latest pilot might be the answer. Walmart has built a vending machine style tower at its Bentonville, Arkansas location that fulfills shoppers BOPIS orders seamlessly and automatically. According to Business Insider when a customer approaches the giant product-filled tower, they simply enter their online order number and the machine produces their products out of a vending machine style shoot. While Walmart is still piloting the new in-store fulfillment technology the tower can potentially solve one of the key challenges retailers face with BOPIS — speedy, seamless, accurate order fulfillment. "We know speed and convenience are important to our customers, and we're always looking for new ways to bring it to them," Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told Business Insider. "We are excited to be one of the first companies to test this new technology and are looking forward to hearing feedback from our customers and associates."

That gleaming M-Class SUV was historic. Alabama, the nation’s fifth-poorest state, had wagered a quarter-billion dollars in tax breaks and other public giveaways to land the first major Mercedes factory outside Germany. Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai followed with Alabama plants of their own. Kia built a factory just over the border in West Point, Ga. The auto parts makers came next. By the time Elsea and her five siblings were teenagers, the country roads and old cotton fields around their home had come alive with 18-wheelers shuttling instruments and stamped metal among the car plants and 160 parts suppliers that had sprouted up across the state. A good student, Elsea loved reading, horses, and dogs, especially her Florida cracker cur, named Cow. She dreamed of becoming a pediatrician. She enrolled in community college on a federal Pell Grant, with plans to transfer to Auburn University, about 30 miles from her home in Five Points. But she fell in love with a kindergarten sweetheart, who’d become a stocker at a local Walmart, and dropped out of school to make money so they could rent their own place. Elsea went to work in February 2016 at Ajin USA in Cusseta, Ala., the same South Korean supplier of auto parts for Hyundai and Kia where her sister and stepdad worked. Her mother, Angel Ogle, warned her against it. She’d worked at two other parts suppliers in the area and found the pace and pressure unbearable. Elsea was 20 and not easily deterred. “She thought she was rich when she brought home that first paycheck,” Ogle says. Elsea and her boyfriend got engaged. She worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, hoping to move from temporary status at Ajin to full time, which would bring a raise from $8.75 an hour to $10.50. College can wait, she told her mom and stepdad. On June 18, Elsea was working the day shift when a computer flashed “Stud Fault” on Robot 23. Bolts often got stuck in that machine, which mounted pillars for sideview mirrors onto dashboard frames. Elsea was at the adjacent workstation when the assembly line stopped. Her team called maintenance to clear the fault, but no one showed up. A video obtained by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration shows Elsea and three co-workers waiting impatiently. The team had a quota of 420 dashboard frames per shift but seldom made more than 350, says Amber Meadows, 23, who worked beside Elsea on the line. “We were always trying to make our numbers so we could go home,” Meadows says. “Everybody was always tired.” After several minutes, Elsea grabbed a tool—on the video it looks like a screwdriver—and entered the screened-off area around the robot to clear the fault herself. Whatever she did to Robot 23, it surged back to life, crushing Elsea against a steel dashboard frame and impaling her upper body with a pair of welding tips. A co-worker hit the line’s emergency shut-off. Elsea was trapped in the machine—hunched over, eyes open, conscious but speechless. No one knew how to make the robot release her. The team leader jumped on a forklift and raced across the factory floor to the break room, where he grabbed a maintenance man and drove him back on his lap. The technician, from a different part of the plant, had no idea what to do. Tempers erupted as Elsea’s co-workers shoved the frightened man, who was Korean and barely spoke English, toward the robot, demanding he make it retract. He fought them off and ran away, Meadows says. When emergency crews arrived several minutes later, Elsea was still stuck. The rescue workers finally did what Elsea had failed to do: locked out the machine’s emergency power switch so it couldn’t reenergize again—a basic precaution that all factory workers are supposed to take before troubleshooting any industrial robot. Ajin, according to OSHA, had never given the workers their own safety locks and training on how to use them, as required by federal law. Ajin is contesting that finding. An ambulance took Elsea to a nearby hospital; from there she was flown by helicopter to a trauma center in Birmingham. She died the next day. Her mom still hasn’t heard a word from Ajin’s owners or senior executives. They sent a single artificial flower to her funeral.

Georgia and Mississippi have similar, though smaller, auto parts sectors. This factory growth, after the long, painful demise of the region’s textile industry, would seem to be just the kind of manufacturing renaissance President Donald Trump and his supporters are looking for. Except that it also epitomizes the global economy’s race to the bottom. Parts suppliers in the American South compete for low-margin orders against suppliers in Mexico and Asia. They promise delivery schedules they can’t possibly meet and face ruinous penalties if they fall short. Employees work ungodly hours, six or seven days a week, for months on end. Pay is low, turnover is high, training is scant, and safety is an afterthought, usually after someone is badly hurt. Many of the same woes that typify work conditions at contract manufacturers across Asia now bedevil parts plants in the South. “The supply chain isn’t going just to Bangladesh. It’s going to Alabama and Georgia,” says David Michaels, who ran OSHA for the last seven years of the Obama administration. Safety at the Southern car factories themselves is generally good, he says. The situation is much worse at parts suppliers, where workers earn about 70¢ for every dollar earned by auto parts workers in Michigan, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Many plants in the North are unionized; only a few are in the South.) Cordney Crutcher has known both environments. In 2013 he lost his left pinkie while operating a metal press at Matsu Alabama, a parts maker in Huntsville owned by Matcor-Matsu Group Inc. of Brampton, Ont. Crutcher was leaving work for the day when a supervisor summoned him to replace a slower worker on the line, because the plant had fallen 40 parts behind schedule for a shipment to Honda Motor Co. He’d already worked 12 hours, Crutcher says, and wanted to go home, “but he said they really needed me.” He was put on a press that had been acting up all day. It worked fine until he was 10 parts away from finishing, and then a cast-iron hole puncher failed to deploy. Crutcher didn’t realize it. Suddenly the puncher fired and snapped on his finger. “I saw my meat sticking out of the bottom of my glove,” he says. Now Crutcher, 42, commutes an hour to the General Motors Co. assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., where he’s a member of United Auto Workers. “They teach you the right way,” he says. “They don’t throw you to the wolves.” His pay rose from $12 an hour at Matsu to $18.21 at GM. In 2014, OSHA’s Atlanta office, after detecting a high number of safety violations at the region’s parts suppliers, launched a crackdown. The agency cited one year, 2010, when workers in Alabama parts plants had a 50 percent higher rate of illness and injury than the U.S. auto parts industry as a whole. That gap has narrowed, but the incidence of traumatic injuries in Alabama’s auto parts plants remains 9 percent higher than in Michigan’s and 8 percent higher than in Ohio’s. In 2015 the chances of losing a finger or limb in an Alabama parts factory was double the amputation risk nationally for the industry, 65 percent higher than in Michigan and 33 percent above the rate in Ohio. Korean-owned plants, which make up roughly a quarter of parts suppliers in Alabama, have the most safety violations in the state, accounting for 36 percent of all infractions and 52 percent of total fines, from 2012 to 2016. The U.S. is second, with 23 percent of violations and 17 percent of fines, and Germany is third, with 15 percent and 11 percent. But serious accidents occur in plants from all over, according to more than 3,000 pages of court documents and OSHA investigative files obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Michaels, who was running OSHA when Elsea was killed, was furious when he learned how it happened. A year earlier, while attending a conference in Seoul, he’d paid a visit to executives at Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Co. to warn them that OSHA had found serious safety violations at many of their Korean-owned suppliers in the Southeast. Michaels told the carmakers they were squeezing their suppliers too hard. Their productivity demands were endangering lives, and they had to back off. “I gave them a very strong message: ‘This brings shame on your reputation. American consumers are not going to want to buy cars stained with the blood of American workers,’ ” says Michaels, who in January rejoined the faculty of George Washington University. “They didn’t acknowledge the problem but said they were committed to safe working conditions. Clearly, they didn’t make safety a requirement for their suppliers.” Safety is a top priority at Hyundai’s Alabama operation, says spokesman Robert Burns, who added that Hyundai promotes safety at suppliers’ plants with quarterly forums and requires suppliers to comply with OSHA standards. After Elsea’s death, Ajin issued a statement saying all employees were being retrained in safety procedures. “Ajin USA is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Regina Elsea,” it said. A spokesman, Stephen Bradley, says the company can’t comment on the incident because of litigation. Elsea’s death “was a tragic accident, and Ajin remains deeply saddened,” the company said in a written statement. “Safety continues to be our guiding principle.” Ajin had settled other OSHA violations a month before Elsea was killed. Eight workers had fingers crushed or fractured in recent years in welding machines. After the first seven injuries, Ajin’s safety manager recommended installation of a machine controller called Soft Touch, which slows welding electrodes and stops them from closing together if a finger is detected. Nothing happened. Then an eighth worker smashed his thumb. For the unsafe welding machines, OSHA fined Ajin a total of $7,000. In December, after investigating Elsea’s death, OSHA fined the company $2.5 million for four “willful” citations, the agency’s most severe sanction, reserved for violators that “knowingly” disregard employee safety. Ajin is contesting the findings. The pressure inside parts plants is wreaking a different American carnage than the one Trump conjured up at his inauguration. OSHA records obtained by Bloomberg document burning flesh, crushed limbs, dismembered body parts, and a flailing fall into a vat of acid. The files read like Upton Sinclair, or even Dickens. Last year a 33-year-old maintenance worker was engulfed in flames at Nakanishi Manufacturing Corp.’s bearing plant in Winterville, Ga.—after four previous fires in the factory’s dust-collection system. OSHA levied a $145,000 fine on the Japanese company, which supplies parts to Toyota Motor Co., for a willful violation for knowingly exposing workers to unguarded machinery. The plant’s maintenance chief told the OSHA investigator that he’d been too busy to write up proper lockout procedures for working on the system. The technician suffered third-degree burns all over his upper body. Phyllis Taylor, 53, scorched her hand inside an industrial oven last year at the HP Pelzer Automotive Systems Inc. insulation plant in Thomson, Ga., while baking foam rubber linings for BMW hoods. The oven had been down for repairs earlier that day, and “there was always pressure to catch up,” Taylor says. She slipped on a puddle of oil at her feet, and as she instinctively grabbed the oven in front of her, the door slammed down on her hand. She’d been telling her supervisor for weeks about the oil leak. “They don’t pay you no mind; they just want you to work,” says Taylor, who had skin graft surgery but still can’t close her dominant hand. The plant’s maintenance manager told OSHA, “The focus of this plant is production at all costs.” OSHA fined HP Pelzer $705,000 for 12 “repeat” safety violations. Nathaniel Walker, 26, had been doing the same high-wire act for three years at the factory of WKW-Erbsloeh Automotive, a supplier of metal trim parts to Mercedes and BMW, in Pell City, Ala. Every Saturday he climbed onto a ventilation duct above big dipping pools of acid on the plant’s back line, where the aluminum parts were anodized to give them a protective coat. It was always a race. At first, Walker and a co-worker had 24 hours to clean and service as many of the 34 tanks as possible. As production demands rose, management cut that to 14 to 16 hours, and sometimes to as few as 6. The job required balance and dexterity. Walker and his colleague hopped on and off the 4½-foot-high ventilation shafts, hauling hoses, tools, and 50-pound bags of caustic soda. They were always exhausted—Walker worked from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m., seven days a week, for up to six months straight. There were no gangways, no cables, no handrails. The only training the workers got from the plant’s German supervisors, according to Walker, was in how to rinse off the ventilation ducts so they weren’t so slippery. In July 2014, Walker fell in. He was balancing on the duct between two tanks—one empty, one full—while using a crowbar in the empty one to remove and replace a lead cathode. His hands slipped, and he tumbled backward into a vat of sulfuric and phosphoric acid 4 feet deep. Submerged, he swam for a second before righting himself. A nearby co-worker quickly pulled him out and hosed him down, minimizing damage to his skin and eyes. Walker’s cotton shirt pulled off his skin like wet tissue paper. His throat burned and swelled from swallowing the solution. He spent four days in intensive care and didn’t fully recover for months. OSHA fined WKW-Erbsloeh $178,000 and issued the company a willful violation for failing to secure the work areas around open chemical tanks. The agency had inspected WKW-Erbsloeh eight times since 2009 and issued multiple citations after another worker’s arm was chewed up in a polishing machine and a third employee lost a thumb. Walker was earning $13 an hour when he fell into the acid. “I was way, way underpaid for working all the time in a risky situation like that,” he says. Ray Trott, a retired U.S. Marine aircraft maintenance chief, worked for WKW-Erbsloeh as a production manager until 2015. He says the German managers didn’t seem to understand the American workers and were never satisfied with what they got from them. “If you made 28,000 parts one day, the next day they’d want 29,000,” Trott says. “You heard all day long, ‘If we don’t get these parts out, the customer is going to fine us $80,000.’ ” Reco Allen, 35, took a job at Matsu Alabama to get his life together. After dropping out of high school, he’d worked briefly at McDonald’s, then sold marijuana for a living. When he turned 30, with three kids younger than 6 and his wife working at Walmart, Allen decided dealing dope was no way to raise a family. “They’d see cars pulling up, hear people talking, and ask, ‘Daddy what are you doing? You ain’t got no job.’ I wanted to better myself.” He applied at Surge Staffing, a temp agency that was hiring workers for Matsu. Allen’s dad, who’d worked at the facility for a few weeks after a 30-year career making furniture at Steelcase Inc., told him to stay away—the Matsu plant was too dangerous. “Don’t let the monster eat you up,” he told his son. Allen took a $9-an-hour job on the overnight shift as a janitor. He passed up higher-paying positions on the assembly line, because “the machines scared him,” says Adam Wolfsberger, the former manager at Surge Staffing who hired Allen. The only training he received was where to find the mop and broom, Wolfsberger says. He stood there for an hour, his flesh burning inside the heated press. When emergency crews finally freed him, his right hand was severed at the wrist On April 2, 2013, after Allen had been on the job for about six weeks, a plant supervisor ordered him to put down his broom. He assigned him to work the rest of the shift on one of the metal-stamping presses instead and admonished him not to tell anyone about the job switch. Matsu was producing only 60 percent of its parts quota and could have been fined $20,000 by Honda for every minute its shortfall held up the company’s assembly line, according to a deposition by the plant’s general manager at the time, Robert Todd, in a workers’ compensation suit filed by Allen in state court in Huntsville. Allen testified in the case that his only operating instructions came from a co-worker who told him: “Get these blanks out of the bin. You load them in the machine, and you make sure you get back.” Stepping back was essential, not only to avoid injury but to clear the vertical safety beam, or light curtain, which is supposed to deactivate the machine if a worker is standing too close when an operator cycles it on. At about 4 a.m., Allen, wiry and 5 feet 9 inches, was leaning inside the machine with his arms extended upward, loading metal bolts. Suddenly the die, which stamps the metal parts, slammed onto his arms. “It felt like the whole world was coming down on me,” he says. The press operator hadn’t noticed him working inside the machine, and Allen’s frame was so slight that the safety beam missed him. He stood there for an hour, his flesh burning inside the heated press. Someone brought a fan to cool him off. “I was just talking to myself about what my daddy had told me,” Allen says. When emergency crews finally freed him, his left hand was “flat like a pancake,” Allen says, and parts of three fingers were gone. His right hand was severed at the wrist, attached to his arm by a piece of skin. A paramedic cradled the gloved hand at Allen’s side all the way to the hospital. Surgeons removed it that morning and amputated the rest of his right forearm to avert gangrene several weeks later. Matsu, it turned out, had known for years that Press 10, where Allen was dragooned into working, was dangerous. Three years earlier a press operator on the plant’s safety committee reported a near miss on an identical machine after the light curtain failed to pick up a worker. The safety committee recommended fixes to the vertical beam, but nothing was done, according to testimony in the court case. In 2012 a worker on that same press had his hand crushed. In response, Todd, the general manager, recommended installing horizontal beams to eliminate the blind spot in the vertical light curtains of both machines. It would have cost $6,000 to $7,000, Todd testified. John Carney, the company’s vice president for operations at the time, rejected the proposal. Instead, he told Todd to install a safety bar, for $150, Todd testified. It failed to protect Allen. After Allen’s injury, Surge Staffing gathered its 80 or so Matsu workers for a meeting, says Wolfsberger, the former Surge manager. That’s when the agency learned the plant had provided no hands-on training, routinely ordered untrained temps to operate machines, sped up presses beyond manufacturers’ specifications, and allowed oil to leak onto the floor. “Upper management knew all that. They just looked the other way,” says Wolfsberger, who left Surge in 2014 and now manages a billiards parlor. “They treated people like interchangeable parts.” An administrative law judge with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission approved a $103,000 fine against Matsu, ruling that Allen’s injuries resulted from its “conscious disregard or plain indifference” to his safety. Matcor-Matsu did not respond to phone messages and emailed questions, nor did its attorney, John Coleman. After the commission’s 2015 decision, Coleman told the Birmingham News the judge was mistaken and that Allen was trained but didn’t follow the rules. Allen sued the company and reached a multimillion-dollar settlement out of court. He and his wife purchased 15 acres and a big house with a fish pond near the Tennessee River, prepaid their kids’ college tuition, and bought a bright-green Buick Roadmaster. “I’d rather have my arm back any day,” Allen says.

Photo courtesy of Dell.com Forbes has updated its eponymous billionaires list for 2017, and Texans make quite a showing among the Bill Gateses, Mark Zuckerbergs, and Warren Buffetts of the world. Fort Worth-based Alice Walton, an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune and the current chairman of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, is the highest Lone Star State entrant at No. 17. Her $33.8 billion net worth is far and away the largest of any of the Texans on the global list. Austin's Michael Dell isn't far behind though. Dell's chairman and CEO is No. 38 with his $20.4 billion, which is thanks in part to the approximately $60 billion merger between Dell and computer storage giant EMC that closed in September 2016. His ranking is down a bit from last year, even though his net worth has gone up. The self-made Andrew Beal (No. 127, net worth of $10.4 billion); investor Robert Rowling (No. 234, net worth of $6.2 billion); and Trevor Rees-Jones (No. 294, net worth of $5.3 billion) are Dallas' highest entrants. Oil is the common denominator among Houston's richest. Richard Kinder, chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan, and his $7 billion are No. 194; and Dannine Avara, Scott Duncan, Milane Frantz, and Randa Williams are all tied at No. 261 with $5.7 billion. Other big Texas names on the list include Jerry Jones ($5.2 billion), Ray Lee Hunt ($4.8 billion), Robert Bass ($4 billion), H. Ross Perot Sr. ($4 billion), Mark Cuban ($3.4 billion), John Paul DeJoria ($3.1 billion), and W. Herbert Hunt ($2 billion).

After being called to the Pasco Walmart about a shoplifting in progress Wednesday, witnesses gave a description of the suspect vehicle as it was leaving. Pasco police quickly located the car by the Road 68 off ramp onto the Interstate and swooped in. Not only did they find the stolen merchandise, but one of the people in the car was arrested for drugs and paraphernalia. Two suspects are now facing shoplifting charges, the driver was found to be driving on a suspended license, and the fourth person gets the drug charges.

Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to “do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans.” Wait a minute — Steve Schwarzman? Isn’t he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes — and holy money bags, there’s Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump’s whole “jobs” panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them “responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.” But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he’s brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he’s doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there’s not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called “job-creation plan” announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn’t create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that “freeing” banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump’s scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn’t require them to invest in jobs — so they won’t. There’s a name for this: fraud.   OtherWords columnist Jim Hightower is a radio commentator, writer, and public speaker. He’s also the editor of the populist newsletter, The Hightower Lowdown.

Photo by Jim Olive/Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau Entrepreneur and reality TV star Tilmann Feritta is No. 693 with $2.9 billion. Courtesy of Landry's Inc. Texans owner Bob McNair, pictured her at the Super Bowl Luminaries of the Game gala, is No. 544 on the Forbest list with $3.5 billion. Photo by Dave Rossman Forbes has updated its eponymous billionaires list for 2017, and Texans make quite a showing among the Bill Gateses, Mark Zuckerbergs, and Warren Buffetts of the world. Fort Worth-based Alice Walton, an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune and the current chairman of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, is the highest Lone Star State entrant at No. 17. Her $33.8 billion net worth is far and away the largest of any of the Texans on the global list. Oil is the common denominator among Houston's richest. Richard Kinder, chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan, and his $7 billion are No. 194; that's quite a jump in both ranking and net worth since last year. Dannine Avara, Scott Duncan, Milane Frantz, and Randa Williams, the heirs of oilman Dan Duncan, are all tied at No. 261 with $5.7 billion. Other Houston billionaires include oilman Jeffery Hildebrand (No. 402 with $4.3 billion), car distributor Dan Friedkin (No. 522 with $3.6 billion), Texans owner Robert McNair (No. 544 with $3.5 billion), philanthropist John Arnold (No 660 with $3 billion), entrepreneur Tilman Fertitta (No. 693 with $2.9 billion), oilman George Bishop (No. 814 with $2.5 billion), Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander (No. 1,098 with $1.9 billion), and investor Fayez Sarofim (No. 1,290 with $1.6 billion). Austin's Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell computers, is No. 38 with his $20.4 billion, which is thanks in part to the approximately $60 billion merger between Dell and computer storage giant EMC that closed in September 2016. The self-made banking mogul Andrew Beal (No. 127, net worth of $10.4 billion); investor Robert Rowling (No. 234, net worth of $6.2 billion); and Trevor Rees-Jones (No. 294, net worth of $5.3 billion) are Dallas' highest entrants. Beal and Rees-Jones have each slipped a bit in the rankings since last year, though Rowlings made a big jump from No. 286. Other big Texas names on the list include Jerry Jones ($5.2 billion), Ray Lee Hunt ($4.8 billion), Robert Bass ($4 billion), H. Ross Perot Sr. ($4 billion), Mark Cuban ($3.4 billion), John Paul DeJoria ($3.1 billion), and W. Herbert Hunt ($2 billion).

Posted By: Sunil Fernandes Updated: Friday, March 17, 2017, 9:30 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns Markets are not exactly cheap at the moment and it is difficult to find stocks that are good long term bets, as well as stocks that are low priced. Here are a few stocks that could be great buying opportunities in India at the current levels. They are low priced stocks that may not have a face value of Rs 10, though are inexpensive. Welspun India Welspun India is the world's second largest terry towel producer in the world. It is also among the top three home textile manufacturers in the world and the largest home textile company in Asia. The company supplies to to 17 of the top 30 global retailers across the wold including names like Bed Bath and Beyond, Macy's, Wal-Mart and JC Penney among others. 34% of FY16 sales of the company came from innovative products and 13% of FY16 sales from branded products. The promoters continue to have a solid holding of more than 73 per cent in the company. Huge potential for growth in Welspun India The company has a key market in the US, whose home textile market alone is worth $45 billion. India has some advantage in the export markets vis a vis markets like China on account of being the largest exporter of cotton and also having a 25 per cent surplus cotton, which is exported. All these play to the advantage of Welspun, which has a very large share in the terry towel market across the globe. In fact, India's share in the towel business has increased 10 per cent in the last 6 years. Welspun India: Excellent low prices stock with good fundamentals In the next few years, the company's flooring business which was recently set up will start driving growth, which should be a big positive. For the quarter ending December 31, 2017, the company reported an EPS of Rs 1.5, with a net profit of Rs 154.94crores. If we assume that it reports an EPS of Rs 10 next year (2017-18), the stock is not heavily priced at a p/e of just 7 times one year forward. A great low priced stock to buy at the current p/e levels. Check stock quote of Welspun here Gitanjali Gems The biggest trigger for this stock is that its subsidiary Nakshatra World has filed for an IPO. According to some unconfirmed numbers the company would raise Rs 650 crores. Nakshatra sells jewellery under the established brands of Nakshatra, Gili, Asmi, Sangini, Diya, Parineeta and Rivaaz. Gitanjali's own network of own stores, shop-in-shops and franchise outlets spans across 200 cities and 3,000 points of sale. We believe that going forward this company could improve its performance and the share price move higher. Low priced stock at low valuations and less risk The company has already reported an EPS of Rs 5 for the first three quarters and even if it does an EPS of Rs 6-7, the p/e of the company is barely 10 times. Gitanjali is planning to reduce debt and start the de-leveraging exercise. this should make it a great low priced stock to buy in India. Check stock quote of Gitanjali here       South Indian Bank This is one banking stock that has not seen a great rally. We believe that in the coming quarters the bank will improve its non performing assets a great deal. In fact, the stock is trading at a p/e of just about 7 times one year forward earnings. At Rs 20, there is nothing much to lose in South Indian Bank stock. Buy on declines this low prices banking stock.

The NGO's program engages global brands and retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Mars, Nestle, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, and Walmart in a collaborative approach to address human trafficking in global supply chains. As part of the collaboration, both firms intend to provide workers in Strategic Partner supply chains with access to Issara’s independent migrant worker helpline, Golden Dreams smartphone app, and worker voice channels—available in four languages. Additionally, Thai Union commits to continue to incorporate the Issara Institute’s Inclusive Labor Monitoring Program in its facilities, and aims to have it integrated throughout their seafood supply chains, down to fishing vessels. “Thai Union’s commitment expands across the entire supply chain, including proactively embedding Issara Institute in their supplier code of conduct. Issara’s worker voice systems aim to empower migrant workers, and at the same time provide progressive businesses such as Thai Union with tools for greater supply chain control, risk management, and respect for the rights and dignities of workers,” pointed out Issara Institute Founder and Executive Director, Lisa Rende Taylor Ph.D. For his part, Darian McBain Ph.D., Thai Union’s global director for sustainable development, stressed the importance of public and private sector collaboration to drive positive change. The director also stated the firm he represent’s intention to further enhance labor conditions for workers. “Involvement from international institutions not only helps industry participants understand the importance of change in these critical areas, but also helps validate the progress which is achieved,” he concluded.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 23, 2017 11:55am   Comments Share: Water crises of various forms have plagued the United States in recent years. The West is still recovering from persistent droughts and dam destruction, and communities nationwide are battling rusting pipes and tap-water pollution. Scott Pruitt has accordingly listed water infrastructure as a priority for the Environmental Protection Agency. Despite the deluge of issues, the water industry is surging faster and more forcefully. The Rising Tide Of H2O Whether the high-end brand name or the generic case sold at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), bottled water has supplanted soda as the American drink of choice. Ten years ago, consumers imbibed a mere 21 gallons of bottled water per capita. In 2016, that figure hit 39.3 gallons, which, for the first time, surpassed the fluid quantity of soda (38.5 gallons). In some cases, the consumption was a necessity. Tap-water contamination in Flint, Mich., Toledo, Ohio, and other areas of the country prompted distribution of bottles for both drinking and bathing. The limited resources and accelerated droughts in certain regions bolstered bottled water sales in the short term — but they may have harmed the industry in the long run. Resistance To Groundwater Access Global regions formerly generous to water sellers are pushing a conservation-based environmental agenda that directly conflicts with beverage business. Most recently, in drought-suffered India, PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) and The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) have been boycotted by the India Resource Center and trade organization Vanigar Sangram, which claim the companies have exploited Tamil Nadu’s limited water resources. Similarly, Michigan residents have appealed to Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation to oppose Nestle SA (ADR) (OTC: NSRGY) (VTX: NESN)’s use of county groundwater for its Ice Mountain brand. MCWC Vice President Jeff Ostahowski told the Metro Times that Nestlé had nearly dried the state’s Sanctuary Springs, and a county circuit court judge ruled that the corporation caused significant environmental harm. While some take ecological issue with Nestlé’s Michigan venture, others have opposed its evasion of financial responsibility. The company pays the state $200 a year for paperwork fees — no taxes, no licensing fee and no royalty for sales of the natural resource. Only the city of Evart, which supplies one-fourth of Nestlé’s Michigan water, charges for its wells. The municipal fee is $2.30 per 1,000 gallons. The issue has been up for public comment for months, with the state offering additional extensions on the comment period. The next public hearing is scheduled for April 12. A Boost From The Soda Crash Even as the water industry struggles under ecological strains, it continues to benefit from consumer trends favoring healthy options and skirting recently enacted sugar taxes. Various levies have threatened the soda industry, and related businesses are turning toward the calorie-free, sugar-free, artificial-flavor-free market. Essentially, they’re taking on water. The movement began with National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: FIZZ)’s LaCroix, which exploded in recent years and doubled in sales. New Castle Equity Research and Credit Suisse have asserted beliefs in the carbonated water’s continued expansion. Considering the drink’s success, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (NYSE: DPS) began pushing their own lines of sparkling and classic water. As long as they continue to adjust to trends and get along with local well owners, beverage companies and manufacturers such as Cott Corporation (USA) (NYSE: COT) are poised to ride the tide of the bottled water craze.

Officers arrived at the Wal-Mart in the 4900 block of Garth Road around 12:40 a.m. Monday after reports of two small children left alone in the store's parking lot. Investigators said the children, ages 1 year and 3 months old, were fastened into car seats while sitting in a red Ford pick up truck with the windshields and engine running. Police reached out to the stores managers, who had store employees attempt to find the owners of the truck. Investigators said the couple emerged from the store carrying groceries about 20 minutes into the search. The couple approached the officers and identified themselves as the children's parents, 18-year-old Verenice Moran and 23-year-old Yonatan Vazquez. The parents claim they were inside the store for about 15 minutes, but police said it was at least 40 minutes. Moran and Vazquez were arrested and taken to the Baytown Jail. Meanwhile, their children were given to a family member. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office has charged the couple with abandoning or endangering a child.

Douglas Elliman There are 2,043 billionaires in the world as of 2017, according to tracker of the wealthy Forbes, and 82 of those 10-digit folks have homes in New York City. While that may not sound like a sizable amount, considering the exorbitant price of real estate in these parts, it’s actually enough to garner New York the distinction of being home to the most billionaires in the world. That got us thinking: Where are these people of unconscionable wealth posting up? The world’s 10th richest individual, New York’s very own former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, certainly didn’t deign to move from his townhouse on East 79th Street to Gracie Mansion during his tenure. (On the other hand, certified non-billionaire Mayor De Blasio, who is living in Gracie Mansion, is currently looking to rent part of his Brooklyn townhouse for less than $2,000 per month—but we digress.) From townhouse fortresses to megamansions, sprawling condos to penthouses among the clouds, we’ve charted where a few handfuls of New York billionaires are known to hang their hats (and their invaluable art collections, etc.). Steven Cohen’s plans for a sprawling megamansion on the corner of Perry and Washington streets got the go-ahead from Landmarks in February. Leroy Street Studio Architecture via LPC Steven Cohen Hedge fund manager Steven Cohen owns not one, but two properties of note in New York City. The first, a duplex at former billionaire magnet One Beacon Court, has been on and off the market since 2013, when Cohen first listed the Gwathmey Siegel-designed apartment for $115 million. A series of tragically gratifying price chops has ensued, bringing its most recent asking price down to $67.5 million. (For those counting, that’s a reduction of nearly $50 million.) Cohen’s second property of note, pictured above, is still on the drawing board. Plans for a Perry Street megamansion, comprising a connected four-story and six-story building, for the hedge funder and his family were approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in February. Ah, just the kind of place to hang Cohen’s unique art collection, including works by Picasso, Munch, Koons, and the like. Alice Walton’s modest-ish Park Avenue apartment. Alice Walton Walmart heiress Alice Walton was declared the 17th wealthiest person in the world by Forbes in 2017, but her Park Avenue condo seems modest when viewed alongside those of her fellow New York City billionaires (as you’ll see). Walton shelled out $25 million for the duplex in the Zeckendorf-developed 515 Park Avenue in 2014. The 6,286-square-foot home has some 52 windows with expansive vistas, a grand staircase, and came along with a one-bedroom guest apartment with views onto 60th Street, which could alternately be used as two staff suites. Bill Ackman The original Billionaire Building, One 57, is home to its fair share of very wealthy people, among them Chinese billionaire Liu Yiqian, but no billionaire is more noteworthy here then Bill Ackman. The hedge funder, along with “a couple very good friends,” purchased the building’s Winter Garden penthouse for $91.5 million in 2012. The sale of the 10,000-square-foot condo closed in April 2015, just four months after another of the building’s penthouses closed for a whopping $100.5 million, making it the city’s priciest condo on record. (Alas, it sold to an anonymous LLC.) Ackman has expressed that he didn’t purchase the $91.5 million penthouse to live in—why would he do a thing like that?—but rather to flip, because according to Ackman, that’s how billionaires have fun. Roman Abramovich’s three Upper East Side townhouses will be combined, but will appear as separate townhouses from the street. Stephen Wang + Associates Roman Abramovich Russian business magnate Roman Abramovich got the thumbs up from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to combine his townhouses at 1, 13, and 15 East 75th Street into one ginormous 18,000-square-foot home in June 2016. The new design for the three townhouses was drawn up by starchitecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, naturally, and will include a 30-foot backyard and an indoor swimming pool. While the megamansion’s exterior will maintain the look of three separate of townhouses, its rear facade will be reconstructed as a glass and bronze curtain wall. One other fun fact: Every full bathroom in the megamansion, of which there will be seven, will have a bidet. ODA Architecture Chinh E. Chu What does one do in an 18,000-square-foot apartment? It’s a question for Blackstone financial whiz Chinh E. Chu, who is believed to have purchased this one-and-a-half-floor spread in Trump World Tower back in 2007 for $34.3 million. The jumbo-sized penthouse got a complete overhaul from architecture firm ODA sometime in the seven years following the purchase, which brought it some pretty over-the-top amenities, including a 30-foot waterfall and reflecting pool, an art gallery and sculpture garden, a teahouse, a recording studio, and a 2,000-bottle wine cellar. A full photo (and video) tour, this way. Rupert Murdoch For News Corp titan Rupert Murdoch, one penthouse just wasn’t enough: In 2014, the Wall Street Journal proprietor shelled out $57.25 million for floors 58 to 60 within luxury tower One Madison. Just one year later Murdoch put the 6,850-square-foot penthouse on the market for $72 million and headed for a more fiscally modest $25 million townhouse in the West Village. The townhouse at 278 West 11th Street served as a bed-and-breakfast before being converted into a single-family residence with herringbone hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, several fireplaces, a huge roof terrace, and a lovely landscaped garden. Perhaps the downsize was too great for Murdoch. He sold the townhouse for $27.5 million in July 2016. Murdoch still owns, and is still trying to ditch, the One Madison pad. via LPC Presentation Materials Dexter Goei The Landmarks Preservation Commission gave telecom executive Dexter Goei the go-ahead to merge his two properties at on West 11th Street into one massive single-family home just this month. Goei purchased the two townhouses in 2016 for a mere $31 million and cooked up plans to convert the properties into one 11,000-square-foot abode designed by architecture firm Arcologica. The renovation is slated to cost $1.3 million—no big for a billionaire—and will include restoring the facade, replacing front doors, and attaching shutters to 17 of the 21 front windows, as well as gutting the interiors and building it back up into a family home. Len Blavatnik Businessman Len Blavatnik’s financial rebound was swift after he shelled out $3.3 billion in 2011 to acquire Warner Music: In 2015, Blavatnik dropped $77.5 million on a 14-room duplex at 834 Fifth Avenue, making it the city’s most expensive sold co-op. Being the truly extravagant rich guy he is, Blavatnik also owns a handful of other Upper East Side properties, including the city's widest mansion, on East 63rd Street (price tag: $31.25 million); a palatial apartment at 998 Fifth Avenue ($27 million), and Edgar Bronfman's East 64th Street townhouse ($51 million). (That's doesn't include a brief flirtation with the Mark's $60 million penthouse.) Carlos Slim’s ornate Fifth Avenue mansion. StreetEasy Carlos Slim In 2010, Mexican mogul Carlos Slim purchased the landmarked Benjamin N. Duke house across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art for $44 million, but it wasn’t long before Slim re-listed the glorious mansion for $80 million. In January 2016, the home was removed from the market without explanation and hasn’t appeared again since. Beyond the bright red facade are details that include a sweeping staircase, hand-carved wood paneling, intricate plastering, and terraces overlooking the Met. Juan Beckmann Vidal Slightly wealthier than upstairs neighbor 432 Park developer Harry Macklowe, Juan Beckmann Vidal became the newest known buyer at the city’s tallest residential tower in February, when a lawsuit lobbed by the Jose Cuervo chairman against Macklowe claimed that a “catastrophic water flood” from Macklowe’s penthouse damaged his palatial apartment. Vidal shelled out for a $46.25 million 432 Park Avenue apartment in 2013, but the sale has yet to close. Vidal is now looking for an out from the sale, and is formally requesting his $11.56 million security deposit back. Ross’s living has some serious barrel-vaulted ceilings. Wilbur Ross Trump cabinet member Wilbur Ross may be a billionaire, but he’s holed up in some considerably more modest digs than his peers. The former banker and current U.S. secretary of commerce listed his lavish Billionaire’s Row penthouse back in 2015 for $21 million, but soon after his appointment in February, the 171 West 57th Street penthouse reappeared early this month asking $16.5 million. Among the apartment’s opulent features are five wood-burning fireplaces and a dining room that can comfortably seat 30. Michael Bloomberg The former mayor of New York City resides in a Beaux Arts townhouse at 19 East 79th Street and, keeping in step with the growing megamansion trend, has slowly been acquiring the apartments within the adjacent building at 17 East 79th Street. As of now, Bloomberg owns five of the six apartments in the neighboring townhouse, and is thisclose to creating a megamansion of his very own and joining the ranks of his fellow billionaires. Sean Parker’s West Village spread. Christopher Bride/PropertyShark Sean Parker Rumor has it that Napster founder and inaugural Facebook president Sean Parker plans on creating a West Village megamansion of his very own. Parker purchased the townhouse at 36 West 10th Street in August 2016 for $22 million. The interesting part? He already owned the neighboring townhouses at 38 and 40 West 10th Street, which props up the suspicion that Parker is plotting his own Frankenmansion. If he is indeed thinking of creating a huge home, he’d need to get the okay from the Landmarks Preservation Commission first, as the townhouses are in the Greenwich Village Historic District. (But as the experiences of his fellow billionaires in front of the LPC have proven, it can be done.)

Terence Patrick/CBS Courtesy i By Jeff Clark jclark@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Band Perry — siblings Kimberly, Neil and Reid — will soon be making their way to Gulfport for the Mississippi Bicentennial Celebration South on April 1. A limited number of free tickets to the concert are available at some area Wal-Mart stores in exchange for canned food items. But before they return “home,” their grandparents still live in Gulfport, they made an appearance Wednesday night on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” on CBS.   And while the band did not appear in the popular “Carpool Karaoke” segment with Corden, they did perform their new single “Stay in The Dark” as well as debut a new look, which includes darker hair and bangs for Kimberly Perry. “Stay in The Dark” is a single from the band’s upcoming third album “Bad Imagination,” which finds The Band Perry making the jump from country pop music to more traditional pop music. Taylor Swift made a similar move with the release of her album “1989” in 2014. The move was very successful for Swift as “1989” has sold almost 10 million copies. The Perrys were dressed in black and red, which did not go unnoticed by Corden. “I think probably what you see before you now is sort of what we have always felt on the inside finally making its way to the outside,” Kimberly Perry said to Corden when asked about the new look.   Jeff Clark: 228-896-2329, @thejeffclark Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Bicentennial Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:14 Police vs Fire in Gulfport BBQ Showdown Pause 0:06 Watch a rock sink in quicksand at Round Island 3:41 His hospital staff rushed to fulfill his final wish: to marry his fiancé 1:45 Woman's death being treated as a homicide 1:57 Eliza O'Neill, 1 year after experimental treatment for Sanfilippo Syndrome 1:38 Eat healthy, live longer 1:44 Gaming commission votes to deny two casino applications 0:20 Two people escape car fire without injury in Harrison County 3:38 Would open Youth Courts in Mississippi help children or hurt them? 3:29 Stennis Space Center ready for any mission Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 2 days ago Ocean Springs teen pumped to see The Band Perry 2:05 2 days ago Ocean Springs teen pumped to see The Band Perry 0:49 5 days ago Get tickets for the Bicentennial and help others 1:31 10 days ago "This is a big fish" View more video Bicentennial Why a Band Perry ticket will kick off a special week for special teen Bicentennial performers The Band Perry bring new look, sound to James Corden Got your free Band Perry Tickets?

Consumer Reports issued a list of what it considers the most dangerous dietary supplements this week, titled “15 Supplement Ingredients to Always Avoid”, warning about the risk of potentially serious health risks linked to ingredients, ranging from seizures and organ damage to death. The report was compiled by a panel of expert doctors and dietary-supplement researchers, which identified dietary supplement ingredients that can harm consumers, cause side effects, or interact with other medications. All of the ingredients on the list are in products sold frequently online or in major retail stores, like GNC, Costco, CVS, Walmart, and Whole Foods. The list of supplements Consumer Reports is urging consumers to avoid includes: Aconite Caffeine Powder Chaparral Coltsfoot Comfrey Germander Greater Celandine Green Tea Extract Kava Lobelia Methylsynephrine Pennyroyal Oil Red Yeast Rice Usnic Acid Yohimbe ”Our experts agree that none of these supplement ingredients provide sufficient health benefits to justify the risk,” Consumer Reports experts state. Caffeine Powder Concerns Caffeine powder, also called 1,3,7–trimethylxanthine in many products, has been the focus of growing concern in recent years, due to a number of seizures, cardiac arrest, and even death associated with its use. Manufacturers claim caffeine powder will improve attention, enhance athletic performance, and aid with weight loss. In July 2014, the FDA issued a safety advisory about the potential health risks with powdered caffeine, warning consumers to avoid using the products after they were linked to reports of serious injury and death. A recent investigation by the FDA has also shown an increase in hospitalizations from caffeine toxicity reported across the country in recent years, stemming from the use of energy drinks, shots and other products containing high amounts of caffeine and other stimulants. With the popularity of pure powdered caffeine growing, the FDA has recorded an increased number of hospitalizations from toxic caffeine levels in younger generations across the country in recent years. Many of the cases are directly related to the use of energy drinks, energy shots, and other harmful caffeine stimulants labeled as “All Natural.” Symptoms of caffeine overdose can begin by feeling flushed which includes a rapid or dangerously erratic heartbeat, vomiting, diarrhea, disorientation, and at extremely dangerous levels may cause seizures leading to death. But caffeine powder is not alone on the list for links to concerns of severe illness and death. Many sellers of Comfrey, also sold as blackwort and slippery root, claim it can relieve coughing, heavy menstrual periods, aid with stomach problems and treat cancer. Consumer Reports warns it can cause liver damage, cancer, and possibly death. Green tea extract is often marketed as a weight loss supplement. In many cases, it will cause dizziness, ringing in the ears, elevate blood pressure and heart rate, cause liver damage, and also result in death. Kava, or kava kava, is sold to consumers to help with anxiety and insomnia. Consumer Reports warns it causes liver damage, exacerbates Parkinson’s disease and depression, and may cause death. Yohimbe is marketed as a treatment for low libido and erectile dysfunction, as well as depression and obesity. In many consumers, it will increase blood pressure, cause rapid heart rate, seizures, headaches, liver and kidney problems, panic attacks and also has a risk of death. Consumer Reports warns that the ingredients can interact with both prescription and over-the-counter medications, such as cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-thinners, like aspirin and warfarin. The severity of the side effects caused by the supplements depends on a consumer’s pre-existing conditions, the amount the ingredient consumed, and how long the consumer was exposed to the ingredient. The group releases the list because dietary supplements are largely unregulated. The FDA does not oversee dietary supplements the way drugs or food products are regulated. Dietary supplements don’t require FDA approval before being sold on the market and the FDA only regulates supplements if a serious problem occurs.

The update is an expansion of Walmart's "Disc-to-Digital" in-house service, which encouraged customers to bring their physical movies to a local Walmart to transfer them into cloud storage, and in recent years also added digital conversion on home computers. Now, Mobile Disc-to-Digital will work on both iOS and Android devices and will support nearly 8,000 films from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. VUDU said it intends to keep adding support from more distributors over the coming months. “The average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays. We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Jeremy Verba, general manager, Vudu. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” “Like Walmart, at Vudu we’re always striving to save our customers time and money,” added Verba. “Our Mobile Disc-to-Digital service is a key part of Vudu’s broader effort to make digital entertainment access simple and convenient.” To convert a movie into a digital copy, customers must navigate to the new disc-to-digital section of the VUDU app and scan the physical barcode of the film they want to digitize. Here they will be presented with digital options and prices: converting a DVD to SD or a Blu-ray disc to HDX costs $2, while converting a DVD to the higher-definition HDX costs $5. Users can keep scanning and adding movies in bulk, and once the digitalization is finished, all of the movies can be viewed on any VUDU-enabled device. To ensure that users are scanning in copies of films that they have already purchased, the VUDU app will enable disc-to-digital conversions only when it can determine that the user is at their designated home/billing address. VUDU is available on the iPhone and iPad [Direct Link], and today's Mobile Disc-to-Digital update will go live at 12:00 p.m. EDT. An engineer working for the streaming company recently confirmed that an Apple TV app is in development, with no clear timetable as to when it might debut.

Disney has BY FAR the most consumer-friendly disc/digital policy in the industry, and it's not even close. I feel like you are talking without knowledge of what Disney actually does here. Every Disney new release comes with a "Disney Movies Anywhere" code in the box. Enter it online, and you now own that movie on iTunes, Amazon, Google, Xbox, and Vudu, in addition to being able to view it within the Disney Movies Anywhere app. I believe the same applies if you purchase digitally. If I buy a Disney movie on iTunes, it is also added to my account on Amazon, Google, etc. So we don't need Disney to adopt a policy like Vudu, we need other studios to adopt policies like Disney.

I love the cross-platform aspect of Plex, but my wife prefers to buy from iTunes. As a result, half of our movies are missing depending on what playback device we're using. My only concern with programs like that one has been quality degradation. All of the movies i've used with it have the exact same quality as iTunes has. Rating: 1 Votes dmylrea 3 days ago at 09:23 am I know exactly how it works. Currently own 139 DMA titles. My greed comment had nothing to do with DMA. I agree 100%, DMA is great. Disney nailed it. Buy/redeem once and it's available everywhere. I'd love to see the entire industry move to that model so there is no lock-in anywhere. My greed comment was about Disney in general. Everything they do is priced just a little higher than the rest. Disney digital titles start at $19.99, whereas the rest of the industry starts new releases at $14.99. Disney titles, when on sale are never as low as all the other studios. -Kevin So surely you feel the same about Apple? Like Apple, Disney is a niche in their industry and they typically create superior content. Most of the other studios put out junk with an occasional gem.

Curly hair should be healthy, frizz-free, defined, and effortlessly fabulous. Consequently, as a beauty advocate and product innovator, Dellinger worked passionately to produce an award-winning line of organic hair care products for women and girls with natural waves, curls and kinks. Frustrated with the lack of effective products for her newly natural, curly hair, Dellinger left her post as marketing manager at Intel Corporation to pursue her passion to giving consumers with naturally curly hair effective and eco-conscious products that are natural and safe for all ages to use. In 2002, Dellinger pioneered the newly natural market when she launched CURLS, a family of organic hair care products targeted for women embracing their natural textures … a market previously unanswered by the beauty industry. Dellinger’s astute business acumen and natural talent for delivering market-driven products gave way to an instant demand for her product line. Soon thereafter, CURLS was available all over the United States, Canada, Brazil, Africa and the U.K.. As CEO and founder of CURLS, Dellinger singlehandedly built a strong demand for her brand and products. Soon Target, Sally Beauty, Wal-Mart and CVS came knocking at her door. CURLS has partnered with these national retailers and is currently in negotiations with Boots in the United Kingdom. Dellinger, who was recently honored by rolling out as one of the Top 25 Women of Dallas, shared her journey and valuable tips on hair and haircare maintenance for “CURListas.” Were you always interested in hair/hair care? If not at what point in your life did you develop an interest? As long as I remember, I’ve always had a fascination with hair. I started to comb and maintain my hair from the age of 5 on. … I taught myself how to French braid by the age of 6. My mom didn’t have to do my hair for picture day, I preferred to do it myself! Taking great care of it and always looking my best was important. CURLS is just an extension of that fascination. There on so many natural hair care brands and products in the market right now. You entered the category early, how do you continue to grow and sustain the CURLS brand and differentiate yourself from the others? Very true! My motto is “you must innovate or you will evaporate.” We have been in the industry for 15 years. Keeping the brand fresh, customers excited and sales high don’t happen by sheer luck, it is all hard work, innovation, and being authentic. This is why CURLS, a pioneer in the natural hair care category is not only still relevant, we are still thriving and growing. Best tip/tips for women transitioning from processed to natural hair? I created my Blueberry Bliss Curl Collection for natural and transitioning CURListas. Blueberry Extract, the key ingredient in the entire collection, is clinically proven to repair damage, prevent breakage, AND encourage hair growth! Very important note: the point where your natural and your relaxed hair meet is the most vulnerable — therefore is more likely to break if not properly handled and taken care of. You want to keep your hair well conditioned and hydrated to ensure a smooth, breakage free transition. Here are a few key steps that you must commit to: 1. You definitely want to start by giving yourself a weekly deep treatment with heat for the next few months. 2. It is imperative that you moisturize your hair daily with a rich leave-in conditioner to soften the hair, ease combability, moisturize and condition. 3. Over shampooing (with traditional shampoos) and under conditioning are common culprits for dry, breakage-prone hair. Therefore, shampooing more than [once] a week is not recommended. On the other “shampoo-less” days do a conditioning rinse — rinse hair to remove styling products (this is where using the right products that are water soluble come in), apply an ample amount of conditioner, comb through, rinse and proceed with styling. Doing so will pump much-needed moisture back into your hair without stripping away essential nutrients, rinse away unnecessary dirt and oil and give yourself a fresh, clean start. 4. Using the right products, with quality ingredients is absolutely necessary. Avoid products with mineral and/or petrolatum oil in them…as both of these synthetic oils coat and suffocate the hair shaft, blocking moisture out thus drying out the hair. Remember, dryness leads to breakage. If applied directly to the scalp, mineral and petrolatum oil can actually retard growth. If your hair requires oil, always opt for a natural oil such as olive, jojoba, coconut, almond oil, etc. These natural oils actually penetrate and moisturize the hair. 5. Avoid drying products such as gel, hairspray and mousse with drying alcohol. If you need curl enhancement, opt for curl enhancers, lotions and creams. 6. Reduce the number of times per month you heat process your hair. If you currently are doing so three times a month, cut back to two times a month with a goal of [once] a month max! This will ensure the health and integrity of your hair. 7. Make sure you get regular trims … starting off with an inch or two is a great idea!

Photo provided by Xavier Jordan Photography CURLS has been featured in a host of beauty publications, including lnStyle, Essence, Glamour, Ebony, Modern Salon, and various other hair and salon trade publications. Additionally, Dellinger made an appearance on The Real daytime talk show. Discerning celebrity consumers like Halle Berry, Alicia Keys, Nia Long, Tia Mowry, Chili of TLC, Blair Underwood, Ashanti, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Echo Kellum seek out the superior quality and natural components of CURLS products.

But this kind of growth, like that associated with Coursera, is “ faster than Facebook,” specifically in terms of having a user growth rate greater than 2,000%. That’s growth from roughly 160,000 learners at one university in 2011 to 35,000,000 learners at 570 universities and twelve providers in 2015.   — OnlineCourseReport, State of the MOOC 2016 There’s a saying that Edtech is the new Fintech. It’s easy to see why: despite decades of people pushing for e-learning models, education has barely moved outside its Industrial Revolution roots. The majority of the world still sits in rows before a teacher and a whiteboard. The majority of students jump over pointless educational hurdles to learn a subject, fork over large sums of money, take notes, and fall asleep in class.* The numbers, though, say this is changing. The past few years have seen the incredible rise of the MOOC (Massively Open Online Course) model. Systems like Coursera, Udacity, and edX are becoming incredibly popular: Coursera alone, as of the time of writing, has users from over 200 countries — over 22 million registered users, 1 million of them from China, 1.7 million of them from India. Despite the high drop-off rate you get with online courses, those numbers are far too large to be ignored. This is largely thanks to respected US universities (like Georgia, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and Stanford) and tech recruiters throwing their weight behind specialized courses that are more industry-relevant.** How Does This Play Out? Very soon, MOOCs will start offering bachelor’s degrees, kicking off a whole domino effect of economic repercussions for international students and campuses. A sizeable chunk of the education market involves international students paying for a British, US, or Aussie degree. According to trade.gov, the US plays host to almost a million foreign students now; and for Australia, Deloitte estimated education exports to be an $18.8 billion dollar market — making it Australia’s third largest export. Involved in this are the costs of paying a middleman ‘offshore campus’ for tuition; migration; and money flowing from, say, India to the Australia, in the case of students who end up living there for a while. Coursera already plays host to Masters degrees from the University of Illinois, and Udacity’s Nanodegree and edX’s Micromasters are making waves; the platforms have certainly proved capable of hosting a degree-level education. Once recognized bachelor degrees appear online, the whole education model changes. After all, the bach degree is the basic unit of a college education; most people need one, and it’s the keystone that unlocks both careers and further education. What happens? Initially, I believe there’ll be an upswing in new students — people signing up who could not otherwise attend a brick-and-mortar university — but over time, the digital model will cannibalize the older one. After all, if the same qualification is made available online, without all the hassle of migration, and without the need for a middleman other than the MOOC platform, that money starts flowing away from the current path and directly into Coursera and the universities. What Does This Mean for Universities?  The cost of an affordable education will drop rapidly, and many — though not all — universities will die. We know what the Internet does to things — the economies of scale make the overheads of building space, teacher:student ratios, and the actual brick-and-mortar of a university largely redundant. It’s Amazon vs Walmart all over again, and all it takes is one institute pricing their tuition a little bit cheaper to set off a race to the bottom. But again, Amazon hasn’t killed Walmart; it’s killed the smaller players, but not the giants. In the same way, I think the Ivy League — where people gain not just an education, but also powerful connections that make their careers — will survive; if anything, it’ll become an even more exclusive experience. What happens? The smaller universities, the bit players, will likely feel the squeeze, while the large universities will be able to sell their online education at even more competitive prices to destroy the bottom of the market. What About Degrees?  The degree becomes less valuable as a unit of education; the course becomes more valuable. The beauty of breaking down education into topical chunks is that we students now have complete control over what we learn. There’s nothing to stop you from, say, taking both literature and robotics (I took Greek myth, cryptography, and data science). In this context, we’ll probably, and very slowly, shift to a social acceptance model where a series of good-sized courses strung together will be as much use to a career as a single degree. Notes *A friend of mine even pointed out that the majority of our schools could even serve as prisons: they have the same cell-based architectures and are designed to cram as many entrants into a space as possible. **I’m a huge proponent of this system, for the record: thanks to Coursera, I’ve been able to teach myself data science, statistics, Greek and Roman mythology, and cryptography basics — niche skillsets that aren’t taught everywhere and would normally require me to migrate to learn.

London police say they are treating a gun and knife incident at Britain's Parliament "as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise." The Metropolitan Police says in a statement that the incident is ongoing. It is urging people to stay away from the area. Officials say a man with a knife attacked a police officer at Parliament and was shot by officers. Nearby, witnesses say a vehicle struck several people on the Westminster Bridge.

The police have said they believe they knew who the attacker was, but have not yet revealed his name. But they did say they searched six locations, including in Birmingham and London. FLORIDA SENATE TO VOTE ON LETTING GROCERY OUTLETS SELL HARD LIQUOR IN STORES Will Floridians soon be able to buy whiskey, rum or vodka in a grocery store? The Florida Senate is expected to vote today on the "whiskey to Wheaties" bill, which would allow grocery stores like Publix or Walmart to sell hard liquor on the shelves next to beer and wine instead of in a separate liquor store with its own entrance. CENSUS: TAMPA BAY SHOWS FOURTH HIGHEST POPULATION GROWTH IN NATION The Tampa Bay area leads the way as three metro areas in Florida were among the nation's 10 biggest gainers in the number of people moving there last year. The U.S. Census Bureau said the Tampa area had the nation's fourth-highest gain from people moving there last year. Some 58,000 new residents moved there. ANNAPOLIS TO OAKLAND: BRIAN GREGORY'S FATEFUL CAREER TWIST [CHARLIE KAIJO | Times] In a previous life, new USF coach Brian Gregory was a barely-used guard on Navy's 1985-86 team that reached the Elite Eight. Virtually every coaching journey contains an odd detour or curious fork that alters the trajectory of one's career — or even life. For new USF coach Brian Gregory, that sudden turn occurred after his freshman season at Navy, when he chose to transfer to Oakland University, a Michigan-based school he had never seen. IF IT'S SPRING, IT MUST BE CHASCO FIESTA TIME Elsewhere, the start of spring might conjure up visions of tulips and cherry blossoms. In these parts, the return of Chasco Fiesta is a sure sign that things are about to heat up. The annual event kicks off Friday in downtown New Port Richey for a nine-day run, which will feature carnival rides and barbecue fare, boat and street parades, a varied lineup of daily music at Sims Park and the traditional Native American festival on the banks of the Pithlachascotee River. EPILOGUE: FORMER DUNEDIN MAYOR, LEGISLATOR JERRY REHM REMEMBERED FOR DEDICATION TO THE PUBLIC Gerald "Jerry" Rehm's community advocacy started in the 1960s when he became one of the youngest mayors ever elected in the city. From there, it never really stopped. Although he is best known for leading the charge to preserve Caladesi Island as a state park while the development boom paved over Old Florida, he also worked to improve the lives of foster children, spearheaded transportation projects as a state legislator, and saved a candy business that later made therapeutic mints for cancer patients. He died from pancreatic cancer on March 10, his 90th birthday. AP EXCLUSIVE: U.S. PROBES BANKING OF EX-TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHIEF U.S. Treasury Department agents have recently obtained information about offshore financial transactions involving President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as part of a federal anti-corruption probe into his work in Eastern Europe, The Associated Press has learned. Information about Manafort's transactions was turned over earlier this year to U.S. agents working in the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network by investigators in Cyprus at the U.S. agency's request, a person familiar with the case said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to publicly discuss a criminal investigation. TAMPA'S NEW JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER CREATES PARKING PROBLEM, NEIGHBORS SAY Known as the JCC, the Bryan Glazer Family Jewish Community Center has 229 approved parking spaces — less than half the number the city typically would require — so many visitors must find parking off-site, including at Vila Brothers Park. The JCC is using the park with city permission. Indeed, before the center opened, the park was used for overflow parking during Mayor Bob Buckhorn's state-of-the-city speech last year. But residents are not too happy about the situation, Richard Danielson writes. REVIEW: HULU'S 'HARLOTS' EXPLORES 18TH CENTURY PROSTITUTION THROUGH THE 'WHORE'S EYE VIEW' [Hulu] "Harlots" on Hulu explores prostitution in 18th century London through the eyes of the prostitutes themselves. Harlots explores prostitution in the 1700s from social, political and business angles, Chelsea Tatham writes. It's not a condemnation of a lifestyle nor is it nonstop soft-core pornography. There are plenty of sex scenes, but they're far from erotic. Read more of her review here.

Name: Subject: Message: The Vudu mobile app can now turn your DVD and Blu-ray movies into digital versions Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 5 153 16 While many movie fans watch films at home via online streaming or download services, they likely still have a bunch of old DVD and Blu-Ray discs that are sitting on a shelf gathering dust. Today, Vudu, the movie and TV show download service that’s owned by Walmart, has announced an update to its mobile app that will help people turn their disc films into digital versions. See also: Best video streaming apps and video streaming services for Android December 4, 2016 With this update, the Vudu app now has a “Disc-to-Digital” section. In order to get a digital version of your disc movie, you go to that section of the app and then use it to scan the barcode on the disc’s case. Then you select if you want the movie in SD or HDX format. The price to convert a DVD to SD, or a Blu-Ray to HDX, via the app is $2, while converting a DVD to HDX format will cost $5. Once that selection has been made and paid off, the movie will be available to watch or download on any device that has supports Vudu. The company is offering the first such conversion for free. This service is certainly one that’s been made for all those folks who have either big or small DVD or Blu-Ray collections. Vudu currently allows over 8,000 movies to be converted with this new service, covering most of the major Hollywood film studios. One big exception is  Disney; if you have any discs from that company or any of its sub-brands like Pixar or Marvel Studios, Vudu’s service is not available, although Walmart does say that more movies “will be added in the coming months.” Do you have a lot of DVDs or Blu-Rays lying about, and would you use this service from Vudu to get digital copies of those movies? Let us know if you will access this new service in the comments!

Top Livingston County Area News Get the Latest on 93.5 FM Hartland Twp. To Move Farmer's Market To Newly Opened Store March 23, 2017 A large retailer’s grand opening this weekend will help support the rural nature of its community. Rural King is holding its grand opening event beginning today and running through this Sunday, in Hartland. The superstore which specializes in farming, work, and recreational items is in the location of the old Wal-Mart on M-59. Township Supervisor Bill Fountain said that Rural King is going to be the new home for the Hartland Farmer’s Market moving forward. Fountain said that organizers have already established a solid working relationship with Rural King and that they will be able to use the parking lot as well as some of the sheltered area. He told WHMI the store was an important part of the growing development of the township. He said that they continue to work at finding the best balance between the rural, commercial, and new housing stock. The Supervisor said he believes that at end of the day the township is in a position to have smart growth and work with businesses that want to come into Hartland and be successful.

Picture: Contributed 09:35 Thursday 23 March 2017 A PENSIONER who emigrated from the Capital has gone on trial in Canada accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend and hiding her body. Andrew Watson, 78, was arrested by detectives probing the disappearance of Lise Fredette, whose body has never been found. Prosecutors told jurors at the Peterborough Superior Court of Justice in Ontario that Watson was a “jilted and controlling” ex-boyfriend and he had killed 74-year-old Miss Fredette as the “final act of harassing her”. Watson, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested ten days after Fredette was last seen leaving her job at Walmart on November 12, 2014. Her glasses and keys were found next to her car at home and there was blood in her driveway. Detectives searched a number of areas using dogs, heat-seeking equipment, divers and a ground-penetrating radar but have found no trace of the pensioner, who was declared dead days after she went missing. The court heard that Watson and Fredette met at a dance in 2011 and dated on and off for a few years before their relationship ended for good in April 2014. Fredette started dating another man a few months later but prosecutors allege Watson would sit outside her home and bombard her with letters. In one letter read to jurors, Watson wrote: “I’m very worried about you going to bed at 1am. “I keep wondering how you can have sex with someone you don’t love. Perhaps you should sit down and consider how you’re going to pay for this lifestyle.” Fredette contacted police about Watson’s behaviour in September 2014 and again in November 2014 just days before she went missing. Her daughter Natalie Leclerc said she was aware that Watson, who is believed to have emigrated in the 1960s, was harassing her mother and watching her. She told the court her mother had gone to Watson’s house to ask him again to leave her alone and saw a piece of paper where Watson had recorded her whereabouts. She said: “My mom told me she could see him from her place. “We want to find my mom and put her to rest – we know she’s dead.” Giving evidence, Fredette’s friend Catherine Lockwood said: “He was controlling and possessive. “I told her I felt he was stalking her and that she should tell her kids. He wasn’t stopping.” The court also heard DNA testing revealed the two pools of blood in the driveway belonged to Fredette and one on the pavement was Watson’s. The jury also heard police searched Watson’s basement – finding a shovel sitting in a bucket filled with liquid believed to be bleach. A mixture of Fredette’s and Watson’s blood was on the handle and Fredette’s blood was on the metal. Watson denies charges of first-degree murder and criminal harassment. The trial continues.

Between 2015 and 2016, the estimated population of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metropolitan statistical area increased by 11,583 -- or 2.3 percent -- from 513,449 to 525,032, according to the Census Bureau. The metropolitan area has seen a 12.8 percent increase in population since 2010. The Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area includes Benton, Madison and Washington counties in Arkansas and McDonald County in Missouri. The rankings are based on percentage growth. Northwest Arkansas ranked No. 25 the previous year. The three fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation were The Villages, Fla., with a 4.3 percent increase; Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, S.C.-N.C., with a 3.9 percent increase; and Bend-Redmond, Ore., with a 3.6 percent increase. The Villages is a retirement community west of Orlando whose metropolitan area includes all of Sumter County, Fla. This was the fourth year in a row that The Villages ranked No. 1 in percentage population growth. Its 2016 population was estimated at 123,996. Two metropolitan areas in Texas, Dallas and Houston, had the largest numerical increases in population, according to the Census Bureau. Each grew by more than 100,000 between 2015 and 2016. Four metropolitan areas -- Austin, Texas; Raleigh, N.C.; Orlando, Fla.; and Las Vegas -- were among both the 25 fastest-growing and the 25 largest numeric-gaining between 2015 and 2016. For all four areas, net domestic migration was a larger component of change than either net international migration or natural increase, according to a news release from the Census Bureau. Among the nation's 10 largest metropolitan areas, Chicago was the only one that didn't grow in population between 2015 and 2016. The Chicago metropolitan area -- America's third-largest -- had a decrease in population of 19,570, or 0.2 percent, for a total of 9,512,999. ARKANSAS AREAS Seven of Arkansas' eight metropolitan areas grew in population from 2015 to 2016, but not by as much as Northwest Arkansas. The Jonesboro metropolitan area was second in Arkansas -- and 105th nationwide -- with an increase of 1.1 percent from 128,390 to 129,858. Since 2010, Jonesboro has seen a 7.1 percent increase in population. The Jonesboro metropolitan area includes Craighead and Poinsett counties. "In the past five to eight years, we've put a plan in place -- a structure that focused on safety, jobs, highways and quality of life," Jonesboro Mayor Harold Perrin said. "One of the biggest factors in our growth is the medical community. We are currently experiencing more than $1 billion in medical expansion, and we are one year into the medical school program at Arkansas State University." The Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway metropolitan area was third in Arkansas -- and 213th nationwide -- with an increase of 0.4 percent from 731,542 to 734,622. Since 2010, the Little Rock metropolitan area has had an increase in population of 4.6 percent. The Little Rock metropolitan area includes Faulkner, Grant, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski and Saline counties. "I am encouraged by the steady, consistent growth of the Little Rock MSA," said Mark Stodola, mayor of Little Rock. "The demographic differences between Northwest Arkansas and Little Rock are significant. Little Rock enjoys a very diverse population. We are now a minority/majority city with 48 percent of our population Caucasian, 41 percent African-American, 7.5 percent Hispanic, and 3.5 percent Asian." The vast majority in Northwest Arkansas are white, according to earlier census figures. The Pine Bluff metropolitan area was the only one in Arkansas to have a decrease of population between 2015 and 2016. The estimated population of the metropolitan area dropped by 2.1 percent during that time, from 93,904 to 91,962. Pine Bluff ranked 380 out of 393 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States in percentage population growth or decrease from 2015 to 2016. Since 2010, the Pine Bluff metropolitan area has had an 8.1 percent decrease in population. The Pine Bluff metropolitan area includes Cleveland, Jefferson and Lincoln counties. Pine Bluff Mayor Shirley Washington didn't return a message left for her Wednesday morning. ARKANSAS COUNTIES Benton County, in the northwest corner of the state, had the largest percentage increase in Arkansas, adding 7,440 -- or 3 percent -- to its population and raising the total to 258,291. Bentonville, the county seat, is home to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. "Bentonville and Northwest Arkansas, in general, is a place where people have a reasonable chance of success if they're willing to work hard, and they come with certain skill sets," said Troy Galloway, Bentonville's director of community and economic development. By contrast, Lee County in the Delta saw the greatest decline in population -- 3.5 percent. Lee County's estimated population dropped by 335 to 9,310 last year. Terry Sandefer, who became county judge for Lee County in January, said he hopes to attract more business to the county, but he's not sure how to do that. Sandefer said tourism has helped by luring fishermen and campers to Mississippi River State Park, but the county needs more jobs to reverse the trend of out-migration. Sandefer noted that the census count for Lee County includes inmates at the East Arkansas Regional prison unit, which has a capacity of 1,624. Pulaski County in central Arkansas held steady with an increase in population of 318 -- or 0.1 percent -- to 393,250. Faulkner County, which is included in the Little Rock metropolitan area, had an increase of 884, or 0.7 percent, in population, ranking it No. 5 in the state for numerical population growth and No. 11 for percentage population growth. "You always want to grow more," said Jack Bell, chief of staff for Conway Mayor Bart Castleberry. "We like growth." Bell said Conway, which is the Faulkner County seat, had 10 percent annual population growth each decade from the 1950s through 2000. "We're not growing at the pace we have in the last few decades, but we're still seeing some growth that we're appreciative of," he said. Benton and Washington counties ranked first and second in numerical growth as they have for at least six years. Washington County added a net total of 3,816 residents in 2016. Craighead County, where Jonesboro is located, ranked third for numerical growth last year, increasing its population by 1,473. Crawford and Madison counties in Northwest Arkansas also are in the top 10 for numerical growth, both with greater population growth than Pulaski County. Madison County's population increase of 355 -- or 2.3 percent -- ranked it No. 2 in the state in percentage increase. Madison County's County Judge Frank Weaver was skeptical. "That's news to me," he said Wednesday. "Right off the top of my head, I can't visually see that. It's a quandary to me. I don't know where they came up with numbers like that." Across Arkansas, more counties continued to lose population than gain population. However, 2016 was the second year that 27 of Arkansas' 75 counties gained population, compared with a total of 20 counties that recorded population gains in 2013 and 2014, according to the U.S. Census. NORTHWEST ARKANSAS Most of the growth from 2015-16 came from the net total of 6,564 residents who moved to Northwest Arkansas from other states or other parts of Arkansas, according to the new census estimates. "The majority of our growth comes from people moving in, indicative of the economic opportunities available here," said Mervin Jebaraj, assistant director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. "The major employers recruit strongly from different regions all over the country." The vendors for major employers, especially Wal-Mart, attract new residents, Jebaraj said. Northwest Arkansas' unemployment rate dropped to 2.8 percent in January, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this month. With such low unemployment in Northwest Arkansas, one way to fill jobs is to attract people from other areas, Jebaraj said. Mike Harvey, interim CEO for the Northwest Arkansas Council, said the region lost jobs in 2008 and 2009, but had an average annual job growth of 9,600 to 11,500 for 2014, 2015 and 2016. Job growth dropped off in the fall, leading Harvey to worry that low unemployment was stifling the region's ability to grow. The slowdown likely was a pause, he said. Civic and business leaders across the region are intent on continuing the growth, Harvey said. "It always seems like they're looking at what's next," he said. "There's a real concerted effort to raise the standard of living here. The people are a byproduct." In the coming months, the Census Bureau will release 2016 population estimates for cities and towns, as well as national, state and county population estimates by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, according to a news release.

The event is from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on April 1 in the parking lot of the First Presbyterian Church at 3810 Robert Grissom Parkway in Myrtle Beach. Kids will learn safety on tricycles and bicycles, on computers and in the water. New York Life Representatives will offer to fingerprint kids and give the fingerprint kits to parents, so that parents may put them on file with law enforcement if they choose. The Optimist club partners with the Myrtle Beach Police and Fire/Rescue Departments for the event. Kids will get to see their vehicles and equipment. The firefighters will pass out free helmets to the kids until all the helmets purchased by the Optimist Club are gone. Pat Henry, who chairs the event, said the club members pay out of pocket to have the event. The only way it makes any money is the small amount brought in from raffling donated items, including a remote-controlled car from Ridemakezr. Six sparkling new bikes ranging from toddler size up will be raffled. Walmart donated a boy’s and a girl’s bike, as it does annually. Bobby Kelly’s State Farm donated money for one bike, and Attorney Cliff Tall, an Optimist Club member, donated a boy’s and a girl’s bike with training wheels. Henry will purchase another one from the club. “If we make two or three hundred dollars on the raffle, there is always someone who needs it,” Henry said, naming some of the organizations that receive assistance from the club, which include Fostering Hope, the Children’s Recovery Center, Sea Haven, New Directions, the Waccamaw Youth Center, Special Olympics and others. Kids need to take their own bikes. Beach Bike Shop personnel will be there to inspect them and make minor repairs. The kids – with special provisions being made for the smaller kids – will ride in a “parade” behind the police Bicycle Patrol. They’ll learn about some road signs and other things to help them become safe riders. “They (kids) just think that’s super-hot,” Henry said. A special police unit that works with Internet (cyber) crimes will be there to teach computer safety. With more children being lured through people they meet on the Internet, and with more crimes of different kinds being committed because the Internet makes it possible, If your children use computers, this valuable knowledge could save their lives, just as safety on wheels or in the water can. Lifeguards from Lack’s Beach service will teach the kids about safety in the water and other important lessons, such as the meanings of different color flags, and about rip currents, sting rays and other dangers. Henry said it is important that they keep the kids entertained, and Conley the Magician, who will be there, is good at that. With a project like this, the club members reach out to family, friends and wherever they can find the help they need, and they are very grateful for all the people who will be helping, Henry said. Boy Scouts will be handing out free water and ice. There will be free snacks for everyone. And they are hoping to have face-painting. Since there is work going on in the parking lot, those going to the event will need to go in via Rhonda Brown Way, which is by the Fire Department. For more information, call Henry at 231-6738.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 March 2017 by satprnews satprnews Sugar-Free Food and Beverages Market to See 10.16% CAGR Growth to 2021 Sugar-Free Food and Beverages Market Report 2021 has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. MarketSizeForecasters.com adds new research covering major players in the Sugar-Free Food and Beverages market: Hershey, Kellogg, Mars, Nestle, and Unilever. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, and PepsiCo. Analysts forecast the global sugar-free foods market to grow at a CAGR of 10.16% during the period 2017-2021. Request a sample copy of Sugar-Free Food and Beverages Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/get-sample/13931 Commenting on the report, an analyst said: One trend in market is increasing offerings from private labels. The global sugar-free food and beverages market is highly fragmented owing to the presence of a large number of major and small players. The prevailing competition in the market is further intensifying with the increasing popularity of private label brands, which are now competing with leading global brands. In some regions, such as North America, many private label sugar-free food manufacturers market and sell their products by claiming the same formulations as branded products, thereby undercutting the branded label retail prices and reducing the market share of major brands. Private label products are offered at a lower price than nationally branded products. For instance, Walmart Great Value’s sugar-free oatmeal cookies are priced at $2 while the same product offered by Archway Cookies is priced at $3. The listed pricing for this Sugar-Free Food and Beverages Market report starts at $ 3500. Request Discount for Sugar-Free Food and Beverages Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/enquire-for-discount/13931 According to the report, one driver in market is shift toward healthy snacks and beverages. Consumers across the world are moving toward healthier diets and lifestyles. Most consumers now check the ingredients label before purchasing any food or beverage product. Specifically, consumers are becoming conscious about the amount of sugar intake and try to restrict it to the permissible levels. This preference for healthier alternatives has been fueling the global sugar-free food and beverage market. Higher disposable income has further contributed to this, as consumers now can afford to spend more on expensive sugar substitutes. New and existing vendors have started offering a wide choice of products and value-added offerings to cater to this growing demand. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is lower acceptance due to ambiguity on safety profile of artificial sweeteners. Studies conducted by different institutions highlight the adverse health effects of conventional sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners have been known to cause health-related problems. The risk of metabolic syndromes was compared in two groups of people one group comprised people who consumed sugar-sweetened beverages and the other comprised people who consumed artificially sweetened beverages. Results suggested that the risk was similar for both groups. Women who consumed more than two sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages a day were found to have a significantly greater risk for coronary heart disease. Similar results emerged from other studies conducted to measure the elevated risk for hypertension and vascular conditions. Due to the adverse health effects, many limit their consumption of sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners are used in diabetic food to lower the calorie content. Thus, the adverse health effects of sweeteners will affect the global diabetic food market as well. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Advertisement New Health and Human Services (HHS)Secretary Dr. Tom Price and Clinton News Network (CNN) anchors Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash held a televised Town Hall on March 15. Blitzer and Bash obviously struggled to understand Price’s free-market, patient-centered ideas. The Republican Health Care plan, according to Price, was “about the carrot, not the stick.” When Blitzer stated only the individual mandate can keep young people buying insurance so the exchanges won’t collapse, Price’s response was one of the best I have heard on a corporate news show. “What I hear you saying, Wolf, is you want to force young people into buying a product they don’t want, correct?” Price went on to say that young people should be able to buy or not buy the health insurance of their choice. When Blitzer kept pointing out that under the plan Medicaid would be cut by billions, Price told him patiently that he should not measure the effectiveness of a program by how many tax dollars are spent on it, but whether it works for people. Numerous studies have shown that Medicaid does not produce positive health benefits. Its main benefit can be mental, in that it removes fear of medical bankruptcy. That goal can be accomplished outside of Medicaid itself. When Price suggested that the Republican plan would incentivize more community health clinics to spring up, Bash asked incredulously, “How would they just pop up?” Bash, how does any new business just pop up? It’s called free market capitalism, Bash. Remove government obstacles, and supply will meet demand. It has already begun with basic health clinics at Walmart and Walgreens. The left believes that health care is a right, but the Republicans correctly understand it is a service. Once you demystify its essential nature, it becomes easier to analyze using standard economic tools. Price understands that insurance coverage does not equal health care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is failing because it lost sight of basic principles like freedom of contract. The left as usual focused on equality of outcome, which cannot be attained, even with state coercion. In fact, the coercion built into the program only made their centrally planned and bureaucratically controlled plan even more unstable. Price wants to bend the cost curve down and increase the supply of health care services by political angioplasty—removing the regulatory cholesterol clogging the arteries of commerce. The ACA gives an enormous amount of power to the HHS secretary to examine regulations and remove those that do not work. If Price is serious about regulatory reform, he will have to look at his own profession. American doctors earn on average $250,000 a year, more than twice the world average. A good deal of the disparity is due to the Progressive era crony capitalist government privileges they enjoy. The American Medical Association has actively lobbied for laws that limit the supply of health care providers since they kept Florence Nightingale and her nurses from ministering to the poor in America’s immigrant ghettoes. Occupational licensure laws, hospital residency requirements, obstacles to medical school admissions and barriers to immigrant doctors artificially inflate the cost of health care by restricting the supply of doctors. The new Republican administration needs to cut the regulatory barriers to entry that keeps health care demand outpacing the supply of providers. There is talk of draining the precautionary principle swamp at the FDA to lower the approval cost of prescription drugs. Free markets always do the best job of matching supply with demand. The Republicans have the power, and they have the ideas. Let’s get ’er done!

In a 10-K filed late Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, toward the end of a section called "Uses and Sources of Liquidity," Sears's language became unusually dire. "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," the filing says. This was after it had gone through a long list of asset sales, loans and cost savings initiatives Sears has either previously engaged in, is currently engaged in, or is planning to engage in to shore up its balance sheets and stop the bleeding. [See: 7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2017.] "If we continue to experience operating losses, and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the mechanisms described above or through some combination of other actions, while not expected, we may not be able to access additional funds under our amended domestic credit agreement and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us," Sears's 10-K filing says. Translated, Sears is essentially saying that even though it's taken a series of extreme steps to boost its liquidity -- including selling its Craftsman brand, spinning off stores into a real estate investment trust, and vowing to trim costs by $1 billion this year -- it's very possible those efforts leave Sears still cash-strapped and looking for a capital injection ... and it's possible no one will want to help Sears when that day comes. Sears used to be one of the great American corporate success stories, and for many decades it was a reliable cash cow. However, the company's been woefully unable to adapt to the modern retail environment, and even big-box retailers like Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT) and Target Corp. ( TGT) became a competitive issue for Sears by the 1990s. In the 2000s, with Amazon.com ( AMZN) now flexing its e-commerce muscles, Sears started to fall apart. In 2005, billionaire hedge fund guru and Kmart chairman Eddie Lampert, who had a huge stake in Kmart after leading it out of Chapter 11, arranged the Kmart-Sears merger. Since then, Lampert has been shamelessly stripping Sears to its bones. In November, Mark Cohen, a former chairman and CEO of Sears Canada and current Columbia Business School professor, described Lampert's actions as outright "asset stripping." Many of Sears's most valuable real estate has been sold to Lampert's own hedge fund, ESL Investments, only to be leased back to Sears. And when Sears needs capital? It gets ESL on the phone and borrows from them. In November, Cohen thought that Lampert would eventually strip Sears down to nothing, but he insisted that process could take many, many years, saying, "This is gonna be the longest-running death in the retail industry in its history. He's selling off the fingers, the toes, there's an arm that's come off, there's another one yet to be harvested. The corneas are gone, one of the kidneys is gone -- but it's still got a heartbeat." [See: 10 of the Worst Performing Stocks of 2016.] Still having a heartbeat is no consolation for investors in the struggling retailer who watched SHLD stock lose 13 percent of its value in the first hour of trading on Wednesday. Down 47 percent in the last year, 90 percent in the past five years, and 95 percent in the last 10 years, the stock chart has been trending the same direction as revenue and earnings: down.

Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is "substantial doubt" that it will be able to keep its doors open. Company shares tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Could Sears soon join Gordmans in bankruptcy? Mar 24, 2017 Updated Mar 24, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Sears signage is shown on its department store in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood on Wednesday in New York. Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is "substantial doubt" that it will be able to keep its doors open. Company shares tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. NEW YORK (AP) — Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money, there is “substantial doubt” it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Walmart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading, it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday that it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. “I bought my tools from Sears, and I’ve still got them,” Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It’s a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct-to-consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it’s been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors’ fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it’s highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January that it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. Sears, like Omaha-based Gordmans — which recently filed for bankruptcy — and many department stores, has been thwarted by a new type of consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Walmart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seems to matter. “They’re past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgment of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. The onset of discounters like Walmart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. “They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” Perkins said. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the Internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. “It has a lot of good memories,” he said. “It stands for being dependable and reliable.” Copyright 2017 Associated Press.

Variety Editions: U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today! Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Digital News Walmart’s Vudu Mobile App Will Let You Scan DVDs to Convert Them to Digital Copies — But There’s a Catch Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor @xpangler Share This Article LinkedIn Email Print Talk Courtesy of Vudu March 22, 2017 | 09:01PM PT Conversion feature, which costs $2 or $5 per disc, works only from customer's home address Vudu, Walmart’s premium video-streaming service, will now let people “convert” DVD and Blu-ray Disc collections into digital copies — which they can then watch on hundreds of different internet-connected devices — using their smartphones. The new Vudu Mobile Disc-to-Digital feature allows customers to scan the UPC bar code on a DVD or Blu-ray case using the service’s app, then pay to gain access the movie on Vudu’s streaming service. The feature is slated to go live in the Vudu apps for iOS and Android on Thursday, March 23, at 12 p.m. ET. But there’s a key catch: Customers must be physically located at their home billing address in order for the disc-to-digital conversion to work from their phones. That’s an anti-fraud measure designed to ensure someone actually owns the DVD — and is not, say, running willy-nilly through the aisles of a Walmart store scanning bar codes. Vudu’s app uses GPS to verify a user’s location and make sure it matches the address on file. In addition, the mobile-conversion feature will be capped at 100 titles per year for each account. Meanwhile, the feature isn’t free, although Vudu users will receive one complimentary first-time mobile conversion. Customers can convert a DVD to standard-definition digital or a Blu-ray disc to HD digital for $2 each. To upgrade DVDs to HD, Vudu will charge $5 per title. And there’s another gotcha: Disney is not participating in the Vudu Mobile Disc-to-Digital program. The feature is available for close to 8,000 movies from Lionsgate, Paramount Home Media Distribution, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Vudu says it will add more titles in the coming months. Movies available to convert with the Vudu Mobile Disc-to-Digital service include the “Lord of the Rings,” “Harry Potter” and “Jason Bourne” franchises; older films like “Top Gun” and “The Godfather”; comedies like “The Hangover” and “Planes, Trains and Automobiles”; animated films including “Kung Fu Panda” and “The Lorax”; and romances like “The Notebook.” Vudu’s Mobile Disc-to-Digital is similar to the in-home Disc-to-Digital service it has offered for several years; that uses a PC’s DVD drive to scan a disc to verify ownership before it’s made available digitally. Vudu also offers InstaWatch, which automatically sends customers a digital copy of eligible DVDs or Blu-ray discs purchased at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. The aim for Vudu is to provide a convenient way for consumers to upgrade their physical movie collections to digital (and, of course, for Vudu to profit from that). According to the company, the average movie collector owns nearly 100 DVDs and Blu-rays. “We know these customers have invested a lot into building their physical movie collections,” said Vudu GM Jeremy Verba. “As more and more customers create digital libraries, we are constantly looking for ways to help them unlock additional value from the movies they already own.” Founded in 2004, Vudu was acquired by Walmart in 2010. Vudu is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., while the retailer’s Walmart.com and e-commerce teams are based in San Bruno. Filed Under: Blu-ray Disc Vudu Walmart Want to read more articles like this one?

You can scan your friends movies, scan movies in the store…you can even look up a product listings, copy the upc, and use a free UPC generator to make a barcode to just scan right off your computer screen. Tested and it works. Reply Report comment View From The Porch (@ClydesPlace) says: March 23, 2017 at 9:37 pm You don’t need this nonsense. It’s just another way for studios to control what you own, how you own it, and where and when you can watch it at their price and convenience not yours. Want to know why there is pirating? Because of money making schemes like this. I literally own over 3000 DVD’s and Blu-rays, bought and paid for. And for the studios, the money I poured into them just isn’t enough. It’s always pay more, pay more, pay more. But I pay once, and only once. But yet, I have put my entire library on my own home digital network, and can watch any one of those TV shows or movies that I bought and paid for anywhere in the house at the push of a button. And it’s not that hard to do. It’s why I feel no need to purchase digital copies either. Studios should wise up and once you purchase something, let you do with it what you damn well please. That’s my philosophy. Reply Report comment sure jan says: March 23, 2017 at 10:03 pm All of my thumbs are up, sir. Reply Report comment Phil A (@Adventfire) says: March 23, 2017 at 6:31 pm If you can only use this “mobile app scan” at home whats the point of it being mobile? and like before whats to stop someone from switching their address to a dvd store then switching it back when they are done? Not that it works in the first place. A lot of people can even it get it to scan their barcodes right. Reply Report comment jedi77 says: March 24, 2017 at 2:10 am The conversion must be done at home. After that you can watch the film digitally wherever you want. Reply Report comment dipitydo says: March 23, 2017 at 8:22 am What is to stop you from using WalMart’s address as your own? Reply Report comment jedi77 says: March 24, 2017 at 2:09 am The conversion must be done at home. After that you can watch the film digitally wherever you want. Reply Report comment Tim James says: March 23, 2017 at 9:40 am You’re only making more trouble for yourself if you’re having your bills delivered to Walmart. Reply Report comment So what says: March 23, 2017 at 6:08 am This has been available to consumers for years. Many people get a Redbox and record it, and they’ve only spent $1.50 for that movie. And if I wanted, I could give 10 copies to friends. But the second I ask for a quarter for each copy I’m breaking the law. Did I miss anything? Reply Report comment CDK says: March 23, 2017 at 6:46 am Yeah, most technical people don’t know how to rip. And many are confused by the legality of it bc technically you shouldn’t be ripping unless you own and it’s for your personal backup. This allows non-techies to stream, and, sell all those pesky discs cluttering the house. Reply Report comment Shandy says: March 22, 2017 at 9:15 pm I have this app as well as hundreds–no, probably more like several thousand VHS tapes and DVDs/Blu-rays. If the app cost a flat amount and would then miraculously convert all your tapes and discs for free, including ALL bonus material, so that you could then sell your physical collections…that would be useful…but…heh. =\ Just to convert for the heck of it, at $2-5 a pop? Not sure why people would need that. Most discs now come with digital copies anyway, so once you own it physically you also own it digitally…and as for all the older stuff…the physical copies are just fine. Unless it’s something you REALLY have to be able to bring with you somewhere you don’t have a player for it, I’m trying to figure out the point… Reply Report comment CDK says: March 23, 2017 at 6:50 am I use the service because VUDU has tons of additional deals Amazon and iTunes never have. I’ve replaced all my discs with streaming and the house is less cluttered bc of it. And, I can stream on my mobile without having to bring a portable player along on trips. Does it suck spending for something you already own – yes. But, the desktop version gives you 50% off on your first ten conversions, and, I’ve found deal sites where I can buy the code for cheaper than renting. I used to hope they’d give you all your conversions for a flat fee, but that doesn’t make business sense from their angle. Reply Report comment shandy says: March 23, 2017 at 3:05 pm I see. That’s cool, especially the not having to bring the portable player. And the codes. All our discs and tapes are neatly shelved, so clutter’s not really an issue, except for the occasional dusting off. xp See All 13 Comments More Digital News from Variety The Power of Content Wear Your Heart on Your Sleeve With The Alice & Olivia Love Pill… Family-Branded Films On Fire At The B.O.: 'Beauty And The Beast'… Russian Economy Is So Bad That Consumers Can't Afford New Shoes… Quotes of the Week: The Walking Dead, Bones, The Flash, Late… Studio Ghibli Easter Eggs: Video Shows Unique Connections… Subscribe to Variety Today!

But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to WalMart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minn., 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations.

Rob Moore   Contact Editor CORNELIA — What was a reported as a head-on wreck with possible serious injuries just outside Cornelia Wednesday afternoon wasn't as bad as feared, according to the Georgia State Patrol. The wreck was reported about 1:40 p.m. on Locke Road, just off Chase Road behind Walmart in Cornelia, according to Trooper 1st Class J. Tucker of GSP Post 7 in Toccoa. A 2001 black Ford Crown Victoria driven by James Brown, 43, of Cornelia was traveling north on Locke Road, while a black 2004 Nissan Xterra driven by Natasha Haney of Demorest was traveling south, Tucker said. The Ford crossed the center of the roadway and struck the Xterra, Tucker said.  Brown was cited for failure to maintain lane. He and his passenger, 24-year-old Kenneth Brown of Clarkesville, were injured in the collision, as was Haney. All three occupants were transported by ambulance to Habersham Medical Center with minor injuries, Tucker said.

The Musketeers were supposed to be done by now. At least that’s what everyone told them. Xavier, after all, lost star sophomore point guard Edmond Sumner, a projected NBA draft lottery pick, to a torn ACL in a Jan. 30 game against St. John’s at Madison Square Garden. Then it lost leading scorer Trevon Bluiett for two games. It all spiraled into a six-game losing streak in February, when good teams are cementing their NCAA Tournament status. “It’s been well documented that we had a tough February. We lost Edmond at St. John’s, we lost Trevon for a stretch of games, we played really good teams and lost six in a row,” Xavier coach Chris Mack said Wednesday. “After the fifth loss, we decided to have a calendar made for each one of our players and talk about February … and really wanted our players to focus on turning the page. So we decided to have our players burn those calendars. “We did it in the big aluminum trash can in the locker room. We made sure the fire chiefs were out of the building.’’ They burned the calendars and put the ashes in a clear urn-like jar they bought at a Walmart. Mack said the urn remains “ever-present.” “It’s always on the scorer’s table when we practice,” he said. “It’s always in the locker room when our guys come off the floor. We take it everywhere we go. It’s just a reminder that good things and special things can happen as we look forward and not worry about what happened in the past.” Quentin GoodinGetty Images Point guards rule college basketball — particularly in the NCAA Tournament. So how was Xavier going to survive, make a run in the Big East Tournament (where it got to the semifinals) and prosper in the NCAAs without Sumner, who was averaging 15 points, five assists and 4.3 rebounds per game when he was injured? “It’s a shocking deal when you lose one of the best point guards in the country,” Mack said. “I’m just proud of our group for being able to stick with each other and not necessarily worry about outsiders’ expectations or outsiders’ perceptions of our so-called problems.” A big part of Xavier’s success in the clutch since the big burn has been the rapid education of freshman point guard Quentin Goodin, who ably has taken Sumner’s place. “Quentin goes from being the backup quarterback to the starting quarterback of our team,” Mack said. “He goes from playing 12 minutes to 35 minutes a game. All of a sudden, he’s thrown out there and he’s got to play through his mistakes, and he’s playing against really, really good players.” Goodin, who has averaged 8.8 points and 4.4 assists per game in five postseason games, credited Sumner for his accelerated development. “He’s guided me through this whole path,” Goodin said. “I just try to give [Goodin] words of encouragement,” Sumner said. “Sitting on the sideline, I kind of see more than I did when I was playing, actually. I just try to keep him up, keep his spirits up, keep his confidence high and let him know there’s going to be ups and downs.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under chris mack ,  march madness ,  xavier musketeers Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Why Michigan will win, beyond Derrick Walton's cellphone p...

(Rialto PD) KABC By Leticia Juarez Wednesday, March 22, 2017 07:15PM RIALTO, Calif. (KABC) -- Rialto police arrested a man they say took dozens of "upskirt" videos of female shoppers at stores throughout San Bernardino County. The suspect, Mark Anthony Duchane, 30, would secretly record women under their skirts and dresses and then engage them in conversation while recording their faces, investigators allege. Officials said they found images of 42 women on his phone and are still working to identify most of them. Most of the videos were taken at shopping centers in Rancho Cucamonga, Ontario and Rialto, as well as one in Orange County, in 2016 between May 29 and June 12, officials said. One victim recalled her encounter with the suspect in an interview with Eyewitness News. Last June, she said, she was shopping with her 8-year-old daughter at a Walmart in Rialto. A man was squatting down looking at items on a lower shelf, and then stood up and engaged her in conversation about hair products, she said. She had no idea what was happening, but after he left, her daughter told her what she saw. "She said the gentleman you were speaking to just took a picture of you underneath your dress, mommy," recalled the woman, who asked to not be identified. "I was shocked initially," she said. "I went back and tried to look for him myself, but i didn't find him." Investigators eventually identified Duchane - who was on parole - as the suspect, arrested him and discovered the 42 images hidden in various apps on his phone, officials said. "This man was extremely calculated," said Sgt. Cameron Nelson with the Rialto Police Department. "He was preying on females. He was stalking them through parking lots, through the grocery store aisles." Police say the alleged victims appear to range in range from 16 to 60. Anyone who may have been a victim or who has information about the case can contact Rialto police at (909)820-2557.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (11) New York • Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minn., where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. » Next page...

India’s one of the biggest e-commerce site, Flipkart is reportedly in talks to acquire eBay as a part of its fresh funding of around $2 billion.    According to a report by Factor Daily, two people familiar with the talks said that eBay’s India operations will be merged into Flipkart as a part of the deal. Further, the latest round of fundraising is led by Chinese internet giant Tencent and it has eBay and Microsoft as backers, the two people were quoted by the report.   If this report is believed to be true, then Flipkart’s position in the e-commerce domain will surely strengthen giving a stiff competition to its arch rival Amazon in this space. Earlier this week, Bloomberg also reported that Flipkart has raised around $1 billion and aims to raise another $1 billion in next few months.   Other than this, Flipkart is also in talks with Walmart to raise funds and there is a high possibility that US retailer could invest in the company soon.   Previously, in an attempt to enhance the overall shopping experience for both businesses and consumers, Flipkart tied up in a strategic partnership with Microsoft through after which the company now adopt Microsoft’s Azure as its exclusive public cloud platform.   Microsoft’s Azure comes with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities which would help in innovative merchandising, advertising, marketing and customer service. Machine Learning is the future and implementing it in the back-end e-commerce business will surely help Flipkart operate it functions a lot efficiently.

Motor Sports Newswire PRESS RELEASE DISTRIBUTION Home Distribution Services RSS News Feed About Us Contributors Contact Us STOP – Don’t throw that non-working lawn equipment away! 23 03 2017 New Fix-It-Fuel® Saves Outdoor Power Equipment Damaged by Ethanol, Saving Consumers Time, Money and Aggravation. SAN ANTONIO, TX – March 23, 2017 – (Motor Sports Newswire) – With spring-time approaching and mowers, blowers and string trimmers being pulled from garages across the land, you can almost hear the collective groans of the many homeowners who discover their equipment won’t start. The likely culprit? Ethanol in pump gas which, when left in the tank through the off-season, attracts moisture, forms deposits, clogs and collapses fuel lines, often rendering equipment inoperable. Worse, such fuel-related problems aren’t covered by manufacturers’ warranties. Ethanol-blended gas kills small engines in outdoor power equipment, but VP Fix-It-Fuel brings them back to life! For the many frustrated consumers faced with paying hundreds of dollars for repairs or simply throwing their equipment away, salvation is at hand with Fix-It-Fuel®, a new product manufactured by VP Racing Fuels. Fix-It-Fuel is a fuel system treatment that cleans and rejuvenates poor running and non-running small engines damaged by ethanol-blended pump gas. It’s designed for any 2- and 4-cycle application including lawnmowers, string trimmers, chainsaws, motorcycles, ATVs, generators and more. Fortified with Mechanic In A Bottle™, Fix-It Fuel is an ETHANOL-FREE gas + oil blend that cleans and repairs the fuel system without having to remove the carburetor or injectors. It works in five easy steps – Purge, Pour, Prime, Penetrate and Pull. That is, purge the engine of old fuel, pour in Fix-It-Fuel, turn the engine over to prime it, let it sit awhile to penetrate, then pull to start it up. Fix-It-Fuel can bring your outdoor power equipment back to life, avoiding costly repairs, downtime and the aggravation that comes with it. It’s packaged in convenient quart-size containers and available at AutoZone, Home Depot and Walmart among other retail locations. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent these fuel system problems in the first place? You bet. VP Racing Fuels recommends using ETHANOL-FREE VP Small Engine Fuel in outdoor power equipment on an ongoing basis. It prevents ethanol-related problems, makes equipment easier to start and helps it run more efficiently. In addition to an ethanol-free gasoline blend for 4-cycles, VP Small Engine Fuels include pre-mixed gas + oil blends for 2-cycle engines, meaning no measuring or mixing is required. VP Small Engine Fuels are conveniently packaged in quart,1-gallon and 5-gallon containers and each blend will remain stable up to two years in the equipment and five years in the container. The outdoor power equipment industry has identified ethanol-blended pump gas as the number one problem currently confronting the industry, with VP Small Engine Fuel recognized by many as the most complete and cost effective solution to prevent ethanol-related problems.

The former Boston Red Sox prospect apparently developed quite the sweet tooth when he came to the United States, as he once had 85 Twinkies in a week, according to his agent David Hastings in Eli Saslow’s recent ESPN the Magazine article on the Chicago White Sox third base prospect. And his Twinkie obsession didn’t end there. “Moncada discovered Twinkies at Wal-Mart and started consuming them by the box, sometimes eating more than 10 in a single sitting even as the Red Sox were trying to counsel him on diet and nutrition,” Saslow wrote. “When David took Moncada to the dentist in the winter of 2015 — the first dental visit of Moncada’s life — he had about 15 cavities, David says.” Yeah, that seems like a pretty likely side effect of that many Twinkies.

Photographer: PETER R. BARBER A grocer could be coming to the Mohawk Harbor site to complement the apartments and offices opening this summer, Galesi Group CEO David Buicko said Thursday. Buicko gave a presentation about the Mohawk Harbor development to area business and municipal leaders Thursday morning in the Electric City Innovation Center, a collaborative work space located on State Street. Following his remarks, he detailed what’s still to come on the 60-acre site. The Galesi Group is the developer responsible for the $480 million project, which spans the stretch of land between Erie Boulevard and the Mohawk River. It includes luxury apartments, office and retail space, hotels and Rivers Casino & Resort. The Riverhouse Apartments will offer 206 units when completed this summer. With that influx of residents, and the lack of a true grocery store in or near the Stockade, Buicko said he thinks some kind of grocer is needed. “Unfortunately, for major grocers it’s too small of a market right now, but we’re looking at talking to a couple of boutique operations,” he said. “Hopefully we can attract something.” There’s a Wal-Mart in Glenville a little less than two miles from the harbor site, and a Hannaford and Price Chopper situated about four miles down the road. Construction continues daily on the harbor and is visible from Erie Boulevard. While the Courtyard by Marriott and casino have opened, the rest of the developments are likely to be completed by late fall. The Riverhouse and One Harbor Center, which includes office and retail space, are expected to open around July. The apartment complex will feature retail space on its main floor. Druthers Brewing was announced in January as the first tenant.   Riverfront townhouses and Two Harbor Center, which will also offer office and retail space, are on track to be completed by about October, Buicko said. Work continues on installing boat slips in the harbor itself, and on establishing a bike path on the site. After that, he said, developers will step back and assess the market before moving forward with a second phase of work on the site. “We’re creating something that’s never been done in the Capital Region. Is it a matter of do we need more retail? Do we need more office space if those fill up?” he said. “We’re going to see because you just don’t know how deep the market is.” View Comments Hide Comments Related Content Park Ave house torn down before tenant could retrieve belongings Postal clerk accused of taking $1,000 money order Capital Region Land Bank gets $1.7 million Schenectady house to be demolished after Wednesday blaze SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL Premium Content DeMarco's offers classic Italian in charming setting 1:14 AM Pass ethics reform — no strings attached 1:00 AM Birdwatchers enjoyed winter season 1:00 AM Foss: I'd vote no on proposed Shen land sale 12:56 AM Stay up-to-date with the Daily Gazette's PM Edition The latest news delivered directly to your inbox every day at 2 p.m. Email Address Most read in News Family, community mourn Saratoga mother of 3 GE to cut some local salaried positions Glenville may buy historic Yates Mansion Park Ave house torn down before tenant could retrieve belongings GOP leaders pull healthcare bill without enough votes to pass it The locally owned voice of the capital region Facebook Twitter Instagram Google Plus Pintrest RSS The Daily Gazette Co. 2345 Maxon Rd Ext.

Credit: Mitch Hooper | Engagement Editor Members of the Ohio State Student/Farmworker Alliance, farmworkers from Immokalee, Florida, and other protesters from across the country will join together Sunday in Columbus for the coalition’s national Return to Human Rights tour to continue pushing its message to Wendy’s of joining the Fair Food Program as well as continuing putting pressure on the university to end its contract with Wendy’s for its Wexner Medical Center location. The march will begin at Goodale Park at 1 p.m. and end on campus. Santiago Perez, a member of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, said the group is expecting more than 1,000 people from across the country marching on Sunday. Perez said he has worked almost every position as a farmworker. Through his experience, he said he feels farmworkers haven’t had a voice to fight for their rights, and this march gives them a chance to have that voice. “I worked numerous years in agriculture, so I’ve seen the good side of things, and I’ve seen the bad side of things,”  Perez said through translator Jordan Buckley, a member of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Leonel Perez, a farmworker and a member of the CIW, said the group has been organizing the march through Columbus since February. The march will feature floats created by OSU students of the Student/Farmworker Alliance as well as floats created by members of the CIW. Perez said this march excites him and the groups involved as they have won many campaigns in the past and are hoping to win this one as well. “We want to demonstrate in front of the company Wendy’s that we possess dignity,” Leonel said through translator Buckley. “And that’s what we are looking for: recognition of our dignity as well as justice for the farmworkers.” The Student/Farmworker Alliance is demanding the university ends its contract with Wendy’s so that they will join the Fair Food Program and adhere to its standards for tomato pickers. The program has added 14 major corporations to its program, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle and Wal-Mart, but it hasn’t convinced Wendy’s to join. OSU’s contract with Wendy’s, which leases a location at the Wexner Medical Center, states the school will work to find “a resolution of the concerns of the Student Farmworkers Alliance regarding the procurement of tomatoes for the operation of Tenant’s business at the Premise that is satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.” Previously, the university set up a meeting between Wendy’s and the Student Farmworkers Alliance, but the group declined to meet, citing a message posted to Wendy’s website dating from 2013. In that statement, which has since been updated and changed, Wendy’s said it was being targeted by CIW and that the restaurant should only have to negotiate directly with the supplier, not a third-party organization like CIW. The Fair Food Program, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a workers’ rights organization — and the Alliance for Fair Food work together to ensure the protection of rights and wages for farmers and farmworkers in Immokalee, Florida, according to their websites. Unlike McDonald’s and Burger King, for example, which buy tomatoes from farms in Florida that are protected by the Fair Food Program’s code of conduct, Wendy’s gets its tomatoes from Mexico. In addition to the march on Sunday, CIW will be hosting a vigil outside of the Wendy’s headquarters in nearby Dublin, Ohio, on Friday, where farmworkers from Florida will be joining members in Columbus at 3:30 p.m. Additionally, on Saturday, a conference will be held at Summit on 16th United Methodist Church at 10 a.m. with different human rights organizations attending conducting educational workshops. The conference will end around 10 p.m. with musical performances including performances from the Peace Poets, a spoken word group from New York, and Olmeca, a hip-hop artist from California.  The Return to Human Rights tour began March 16 and runs until March 29, with stops in 13 different cities. Following the stop in Columbus, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers in conjunction with the Alliance for Fair Food will end the tour with a vigil in Tampa, Florida, according to a press release from the CIW.

Ryan/Globe Staff A Gulf gas station was sold at a busy intersection in Boston”s Fenway neighborhood. By Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff  March 23, 2017 Massachusetts drivers had best keep a close watch on their car’s gas gauge these days. The number of gas stations across the state has plummeted over the past decade, with an even sharper decline in Greater Boston, making a quick fill-up harder to find. Advertisement The city’s downtown area, in particular, has become somewhat of a gas station desert, forcing motorists to range farther afield to fill up their tanks. The number of Massachusetts gas stations dropped 12 percent between 2005 and 2014, according to data tracked by the US Census Bureau. In Greater Boston, the drop was 14 percent. Nationally, the decline was 5 percent. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Some mom-and-pop operations have been squeezed out by bigger suburban stations. Stricter environmental standards have prompted some stations to close rather than pay for expensive equipment upgrades, analysts say. View Story Graphics: Gas stations on the decline in Mass. These maps show where gas stations are and charts show how their numbers have dropped over the years. But perhaps the main factor for the decline: the soaring value of real estate. Especially in urban settings, land has become so valuable that it has enticed many station owners to sell. Joe Elias, owner of a longstanding Gulf station at the busy intersection of Boylston Street, Park Drive, and Brookline Avenue in the Fenway, sold the nearly half-acre lot for $16.9 million last month, state records show. Advertisement “It’s a matter of numbers — what makes sense financially and what doesn’t,” said Elias, who still owns gas stations in suburban Millis and Medfield. “And what makes sense for pretty much everyone [who runs a station in the city] is to take the money and run.” Star Market bought the property so it could tear down the gas station and expand parking for an existing grocery store next door, according to a spokeswoman for the company. Elias, 48, of Wrentham, said he bought the station about two decades ago and hadn’t planned to sell it. A father of three teenagers, he said he envisioned his children would eventually take over the business. But Elias said his hand was forced by rising property taxes and increasing interest to buy the station’s property, in the middle of a Fenway neighborhood where construction is booming. Cashing in on gas station property is appealing because the profit margins of selling fuel tend to be slim. “You don’t make a lot of money selling gas,” said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the national Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing. While profits can vary, Lenard estimated that most “make about a nickel a gallon.” Much of the profit from gasoline sales goes to companies that pump the oil from the ground, refine it, and transport gas to stations. Station owners must also pay to staff the location and have other expenses, like transaction fees on credit card purchases. ‘What makes sense for pretty much everyone [who runs a station in the city] is to take the money and run.’ Selling gas used to be more profitable, Lenard said. Decades ago, when gas was much cheaper, customers were more loyal to a particular station or brand. Now, ever cost-conscious drivers tend to go wherever gas is cheapest, driving around to save pennies per gallon. That forces stations to constantly undercut one another’s prices to attract customers. Stations make most of their profit today not by selling gas, but by selling other products on site, like coffee and snacks in a convenience store. David L Ryan/Globe Staff The lot that was home to this Gulf gas station in the Fenway neighborhood sold for $16.9 million. More and more big-box retailers and grocery stores, like Walmart and Costco, are adding gas stations in little-used sections of their parking lots or building new stores with them. Such large retailers “may not even care if they make money selling gas,” Lenard said. Instead, the stations serve as a way to attract drivers “who come for the gas and then go inside and fill up a shopping cart.” Stricter environmental standards, including rules passed in the late 1980s requiring stations to upgrade underground tanks where gasoline is stored, have also been blamed. Nationwide, gasoline use by motorists dipped during the recent recession as people drove less, but rebounded when the economy recovered. Motor vehicle gasoline consumption hit an all-time high in 2016 of more than 9.3 million barrels per day, data from the US Energy Information Administration show. The record was set even amid improvements in fuel-efficiency, growing prevalence of electric vehicles, and heightened concern of vehicle emissions contributing to global warming. Despite their declining numbers, gas stations still aren’t all that hard to find in many suburban areas. In 2014, there were 1,988 gas stations in Massachusetts, according to data tracked by the US Census Bureau. The exceptions are areas where there are simply too few people to support the businesses, and city centers, where real estate is most expensive. Grampy’s, the last gas station in downtown Boston, closed its location on Cambridge Street in Beacon Hill several years ago. It was torn down and replaced with a five-story office building. Its departure has been an inconvenience for delivery drivers at Felcaro Pizzeria next door, according to a manager of the restaurant, Mohammed, who declined to give his last name. “It’s definitely an issue for our drivers,” he said. “There can be delays because they have to take extra time to get gas.” The closest station is in Charlestown, he said. Mohammed recalled one time, since Grampy’s closure, on a “busy, busy, busy day” when a driver got stranded. “He was waiting until he had a delivery over in that direction [near the Charlestown gas station] but he ended up running out of gas first.” Matt Rocheleau can be reached at matthew.rocheleau@globe.com.

The lockdown was initiated following a report of an armed student threatening to shoot. Listen Listening... / 1:11 WBFO’s Avery Schneider reports. The lockdown began around 2 p.m. Thursday, after what Tonawanda Police described as an "unconfirmed report" of an armed student at the Northtowns Academy. The school, located on Dexter Terrace off Niagara Falls Boulevard, houses the Erie 1 BOCES exceptional education program, focusing on core curriculum classes. Police told reporters they believe the call came from a female student, who later admitted it was a lie. Listen Listening... / 1:03 WBFO's Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley spoke with Town of Tonawanda Police Capitan Joseph Carosi on Thursday afternoon. "About 2:15 this afternoon, we were notified that there was an unconfirmed report that there was an armed student inside the building at the NorthTowns Academy, Erie 1 Boces. The school immediately went into lockdown. Right now we are just trying to figure out what is going on," Carosi said. Police from the Town of Tonawanda responded in conjunction with the Town of Amherst Police Department because the school sits close to a jurisdictional border. Police also closed Dexter Terrace to traffic at Niagara Falls Boulevard. Parents of students at Northtowns Academy were asked to gather in the parking lot of Home Depot Plaza on Niagara Falls Boulevard outside the former Walmart, while police assessed the situation at the school on Dexter Terrace. Credit Avery Schneider / WBFO News "We are in direct communications [with the school] right now. We have no reports of any violence or any issues right now inside the school. We are taking a proactive response to make sure the safety of students and faculty are safeguarded," said Carosi. Parents were notified of the event by robo-call and were asked to go to 2065 Niagara Falls Boulevard in the Home Depot Plaza, the site of a closed Wal-Mart for a staging area with police. Some called the school directly for information. “They just wanted to know the same questions. What was going on? And we shared the same information – exactly what we could, what was taking place, and everything was handled. All calls went very well,” said Erie 1 BOCES Director of Exceptional Education Justin DeMartin. Immediately after the lockdown was lifted, DeMartin spoke to reporters outside the school. When asked to confirm the report of the weapon came from a student, DeMartin said he could not comment because the situation involved students. He did, however, confirm the report was made to a staff member. For almost two hours, students remained safely locked in their classrooms. DeMartin praised the cooperation of faculty, students, bus drivers and parents for their calm response to the situation. “All schools across the county, and even the state, follow the same lockdown safety procedures. And they handled everything as they should have and how it’s always been practiced within any drill,” said DeMartin. Faculty worked side by side with Town of Tonawanda Police throughout the lockdown – an interaction DeMartin described as “excellent.” On Friday, the school will return to normal activity. “We will obviously debrief with both students and staff,” said DeMartin. “But everything will go as usual.” Parents will receive an update by phone.

EDT THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I want to thank you for your support on healthcare.  That’s been great.  I know you had a big problem with Obamacare, and everybody, so welcome to the crowd.  But I very much appreciate you being here and I very much appreciate your support. I’m honored to welcome all of the many truckers and the trucking industry leaders to the White House.  And I must say, really, you are the leaders.  You are the big ones.  I’m very impressed I was able to get you -- I think it was the White House that was able to get you.  (Laughter.)   No one knows America like truckers know America.  You see it every day, and you see every hill and you see every valley and you see every pothole in our roads that have to be redone.  Every town, every forest, from border to border, to ocean to ocean -- it’s true.  It’s true.  And you love America, and you love the spirit, and we love your spirit.  And we want to thank you very much, because -- very special people. Through day and night in all kinds of weather, truckers course the arteries of our nation’s highways.  You carry anything and everything -- the food that stocks our shelves, the fuel that runs our cars, and the steel that builds our cities.  You think I wrote that?  (Laughter.)  Not bad, is it?  (Laughter.)  Save that -- I want to save that paragraph.   But America depends on you.  And you work very hard for America.  Many of you spend weeks away from your families doing what can sometimes be a very difficult and dangerous job, to put it mildly.  But you take care of yourselves, you look out for your friends, and you don’t stop until the job is done.  That’s true.   Obamacare has inflicted great pain on American truckers.  Many of you were forced to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.  You experienced a crippling rise in premiums and a dramatic loss in options.  And you just take a look at what’s happened to the costs, and it’s incredible.  You look at what’s going on with deductibles where they’re through the roof, so essentially you don’t have it because hopefully you’ll never have to use it because you won’t have that kind of injury or sickness. So you know the problems, and it’s put a lot of the trucking businesses out of business, which is pretty tough.  In addition, many union drivers are slated to have their plans taxed to pay Obamacare, and they’ve been against it for a long period of time. And trucking companies that are considered large employers have to offer government-mandated health insurance.  You have the mandate that just doesn’t work for them.  You’re forced to do things that you don’t want to do. Today, the House is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.  We’ll see what happens, going to be a very close vote.  After we repeal and replace Obamacare -- and by the way, it’s close not because Obamacare is good, it’s close -- politics.  They know it’s no good.  Everybody knows it’s no good.  It’s only politics, because we have a great bill, and I think we have a very good chance.  But it’s only politics. After we repeal and replace Obamacare, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure truckers stay busy moving American goods made by American companies and workers.  Big difference out there now, don’t you think?  Big difference.   We will rewrite our broken tax code and fix our terrible trade deals.  We will also eliminate job-killing regulations where -- you guys are so subject to regulations, and we’re going to free it up.  It’s going to be freed up.  You’re going to be back to business.  And we’ll make sure America’s infrastructure is the best in the world.  Right now it’s probably the worst it’s been in 40 years.  I have friends in your business, they say trucking from Los Angeles to New York and back, it’s very tough on the trucks -- never used to be that way -- with the condition of the roads and the highways.   So I look forward to hearing from you.  We’re going to have a long talk -- although I’m not going to make it too long because I have to get votes.  I don’t want to spend too much time with you and then lose by one vote.  (Laughter.)  Then I’m going to blame the truckers.  (Laughter.)   But we’re going to talk for a little while and then I’m going to go back to business.  And I appreciate you all being here.  And maybe we’ll go around the table, just introduce yourself and your company real fast, and we’ll leave the press stay because I’m sure they’ll be very excited by that.   And let’s go. MR. CONGDON:  Okay.  I’m David Congdon, I’m the CEO of Old Dominion Freight Lines.  We’re a truckload carrier based in North Carolina, and we operate 8,000 tractors, 25,000 trailers, and do about $3 billion in sales, 19,500 employees.   THE PRESIDENT:  Wow, that’s fantastic, David.   How do you compare size-wise with the other big ones? MR. CONGDON:  We’re the third-largest in the list of the truckload sector. THE PRESIDENT:  Who is the largest? MR. CONGDON:  The largest is FedEx Freight.   THE PRESIDENT:  I see, and they’re here, too.   MR. CONGDON:  We have -- freighters at the table. THE PRESIDENT:  Where’s FedEx Freight? MR. DUCKER:  Here, sir.   THE PRESIDENT:  Very impressive.  Oh, you’re central casting, look at that.  (Laughter.)  Great company. MR. BURG:  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Jim Burg, JBTC Trucking from Macomb County, Michigan -- a county you carried well. THE PRESIDENT:  I did. MR. BURG:  First time since 2004. THE PRESIDENT:  Love that state.  (Laughter.)  Bringing back a lot of jobs, you see what’s happening. MR. BURG:  Started the company with one truck in 1984, built it up to a 90-truck operation.  We’re a flatbed carrier that hauls steel and construction materials within Michigan and the Midwest.   THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  Say hello to Michigan for me. MR. BURG:  I certainly will. THE PRESIDENT:  We like that sound:  Breaking news, Donald trump has won Michigan.  (Laughter.)  You know what, we’re doing even better now because we’ve brought back -- Ford is moving back in and General Motors, they’re going to be doing a lot of new plants and thousands and thousands of people coming back into Michigan.   MR. BURG:  We’ll be hauling the steel for those plants. THE PRESIDENT:  I know you will, I know you will.  Good.  Thank you very much.   MR. BURCH:  Mr. President, it’s an honor to be here.  My name is Kevin Burch.  I’m President of Jet Express Trucking out of Dayton, Ohio, a truckload carrier.  I’m also this year’s chairman of the board of American Trucking Association.  Originally from Flint, Michigan, we were involved with handling a lot of the water, and appreciate all your support in helping us. THE PRESIDENT:  They just gave a check for $100 million to Flint.  Think of that whole horrible deal.  That’s great political leadership.  What a disaster.  In order to save a fee, they went to bad water and spent a fortune on pipes and infrastructure.  *** …I’m the president of the Wisconsin Motor Carriers Association.  We represent the trucking industry in Wisconsin.  There are 50 associations across the entire country ** the umbrella under the American Trucking Association.  We have over 1,100 members in our association.  There are over 15,000 trucking companies in Wisconsin.  And prior to that time, I spent 18 years in the Wisconsin state legislature.  And also, Reince Priebus and I are graduates from UW-Whitewater, and have been buddies for about 20 years ourselves.  So it’s an honor to be here, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  He’s doing a good job. MR. NASH:  Mr. President, Dennis Nash.  I’m the founder and CEO of The Kenan Advantage Group, based in Canton, Ohio.  We’re in the tank truck hauling business, primarily fuels and chemicals.  We have about 10,000 drivers located in 38 states.

FULLER:  Eric Fuller, CEO of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, out of Chattanooga, Tennesse.  We’re the second-largest privately-held truckload carrier.  We have about 7,000 tractor, 10,000 employees. THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Good job. MR. SMITH:  John Smith, from CRST in Cedar Rapids.  Second generation -- my dad started the business.  Third generation is coming in, so we hope to keep it going.  Would like to invite you to Cedar Rapids.  We also do a lot of training and bringing in the new blood to the industry, and I think it’s quite unique and would love to get you out there. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Cedar Rapids was very good to me.  You know that, right?  So I like Cedar Rapids.  Say hello to the people. MR. SMITH:  I will. MR. SPEAR:  Mr. President, I’m Chris Spear.  I’m president and CEO of the American Trucking Association.  Thanks to you and Mr. Vice President for hosting us here today. We have one in 16 jobs in this country.  And in 29 states, truck drivers are the number one job.  So for the 7.3 million employees in the industry, 3.5 million drivers, we have 12 of them here today that have 29.4 million accident-free miles.  Safety is our number one priority.  And obviously we are here to help you get the job done.  We would love to see Obamacare replaced.  We love the bill.  We want to bring costs down.  We want to make our lives and our families better.  And we believe this is the proposal to get the job done. THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great, great proposal.  And you’re going to have competitive bidding.  You’re going to have those insurance companies going wild for your companies.  And you’ll be able to pick the right plan and the right doctor -- which as you know, was a big lie.  But you’re going to have the plan and the doctor, yeah.  And I think we’re doing well.  We’ll find out in about three hours. MR. SPEAR:  Absolutely. THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know why I’m with you.  (Laughter.)   That’s all right.  Thanks, Chris. MR. OSTERGARD:  Mr. President, it’s an honor to be here.  I’m Tonn Ostergaard, president and CEO of Crete Carrier Corporation, a family-owned trucking company in Lincoln, Nebraska.  We run a little over 5,000 trucks.  And we’re just proud to help you make America great.  Thank you.

Share this article Share 1k shares He then slipped through a gate into the precincts of Parliament where he hacked to death Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old constable. Born Adrian Elms in Kent, Masood had converted to Islam and was ‘on the radar’ of MI5. Police said he had been ‘inspired’ by international terrorism. But last night attention turned to whether the attacker, who is said to have acted as a ‘lone wolf’, could have been radicalised online. Speaking at a security conference in the US, Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson called on internet giants to take action. He said: ‘We are going to have to engage not just militarily, but also to stop the stuff on the internet that is corrupting and polluting so many people. ‘This is something that the internet companies and social media companies need to think about. Wedding Day: Murdered constable Keith Palmer with wife Michelle ‘They need to do more to take that stuff off their media, the incitements, the information about how to become a terrorist, the radicalising sermons and messages. That needs to come down.’ In the hours after the London attack, the Daily Mail found vile Islamic State terror manuals online through simple searches on Google and Twitter. One included a section on using vehicles as weapons. It told jihadists in the West to learn from Palestinian terrorists who ‘have resorted to using cars as tools of war, also knives as weapons which are easily available from DIY stores’. The manual was published a year ago, before the vehicle attacks in Nice, Berlin and London, which have killed 102 people and injured more than 500. Another Islamic State publication was available through Google and Twitter with detailed instructions on how to cause mayhem. It was written after the Bastille Day attack in Nice, when a truck was used to murder 86 people – ten of them children and teenagers – at a fireworks display. It said the Nice attack ‘superbly demonstrated’ how vehicles can be used for terror, having the effect of ‘smashing their bodies while crushing their heads, torsos and limbs under the vehicle’s wheels leaving behind a trail of carnage’. It added: ‘Vehicles are like knives, as they are extremely easy to acquire. But unlike knives, which if found in one’s possession can be a cause for suspicion, vehicles arouse absolutely no doubts due to their widespread use throughout the world. It has been shown that smaller vehicles are incapable of granting the level of carnage that is sought. One of the main reasons for this is smaller vehicles lack the weight and wheel span required for crushing many victims. ‘The type of vehicle most appropriate for such an operation is a large load-bearing truck.’ The guide also gave instructions on where on the body to strike with a knife. The social media giants were criticised by MPs last week for failing to do enough to remove extremist content. Last night, Google removed links to the manuals that were found by the Mail. A spokesman said: ‘We are deeply troubled by violence and acts of terrorism and our thoughts are with the victims of yesterday’s attack in London. We remove links to illegal content in search when reported to us.’ Standing together: Thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square today to pay a defiant tribute to those who lost their lives in the attack Links to the Islamic State manuals were available on Twitter, as well as pictures of pages with detailed instructions on how to kill innocent people. Twitter removed one suspect user’s account after being contacted by the Mail. But other images were not removed as these had been posted by academics who were not promoting the manuals in a positive way. Twitter said that in the last six months of 2016 it suspended 376,890 accounts for violations related to promotion of terrorism. A spokesman added: ‘We don’t comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.’ Among those injured in Wednesday’s attack were nationals from France, Romania, South Korea, Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy, the US and Greece. Twelve of the victims had to be treated in hospital for serious injuries. UK students Travis Frain and Owen Lambert were among the injured, as were four South Korean tourists, including one with serious injuries.   YouTube makes money on sick hoax claim videos  KATHERINE RUSHTON, MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY EDITOR FOR THE DAILY MAIL Google is making money from vile claims that the London terror attack was a hoax, and that its victims were actors and mannequins. Netflix, Guess, Trivago, Opodo, Asus and SunLife insurance have adverts alongside videos published by conspiracy theorists on Google’s YouTube platform. Within hours of the attack, YouTube was hosting hundreds of videos claiming the atrocity was faked. One user sang Allahu Akbar to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down – a reference to Westminster Bridge where the attacker ploughed into pedestrians. Google profits from the ads itself, but also hands a cut directly to those who post shocking videos. Some of those posting about Wednesday’s attack claimed that those who were injured and killed were in fact actors using plastic limbs and that the emergency services were in on an elaborate plot to terrify ordinary citizens. Conspiracy theorists: The vile videos have adverts alongside them Ads from the online travel site Opodo appeared on posts by the user Russianvids, claiming that a woman trapped under a bus looked like a mannequin ‘they pulled out of Walmart’. One of the viewers said the ‘actors are terrible’. Others claim that the atrocity was orchestrated by Jews trying to frame Islamists, Freemasons, or the ‘New World Order’ – a name used to describe a new, global totalitarian government which is allegedly taking over the world. They even drew links to the Prime Minister and the Queen. Many of the wild theories also dwell on the date of the attack – 22 March, or 3/22 as it would be written in the US. The fantasists claim that the number 322 has occult associations, and point out that is shorthand for Skull and Bones, an American secret society. One user, ScreamCrow Face, published a series of rants suggesting that London Mayor Sadiq Khan staged the attack to support his demands for more police on the streets. The video featured ads by Opodo, Asus, Guess, Trivago and Sleep mattresses. Yesterday, Google had disabled ads on many but not all of the hateful videos. The firm places the ads using automated technology rather than human judgment. Those posting videos on the site receive up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views, and many are watched millions of times. Many of the users who have posted hoax claim videos about the attack have made money from YouTube, but not necessarily from ads on that video itself. The videos only host ads where clearly stated. A YouTube spokesman said last night: ‘Videos threatening violence are against YouTube’s policies and we remove them quickly when they are flagged to us. ‘When it comes to advertising, we have strict guidelines that define where ads should appear.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 1k shares Most watched News videos Wrath of the Queen's Guardsman as dancing tourist gets telling off Presenter Rachel Burden silences a crying baby with utter ease People huddle together amid reports of gunshots in Bellagio Hotel Footage of the moment Khalid Masood was shot by police Andrew Neil's strong message to terrorists on BBC's This Week Dashcam captures gun-wielding woman being run over by police Awkward!

If it passes, healthcare stocks (insurers, primarily) are expected to rise; if it fails it calls into question President Trump’s ability to get things like tax reform done as well.

Investors in Theranos' latest funding rounds could get about two additional shares for each one they bought, according to the Journal, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Investors likely paid $15 to $17 a share, but with the additional shares, the effective cost would now be lowered to about $5, the sources told the Journal. Holmes would give up her majority stake in the start-up as part of the deal, which could potentially affect early shareholders such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Walmart's founding family, and media titan Rupert Murdoch, the Journal reported. Neither Theranos nor the organizations affiliated with named investors were immediately available for comment. Though Theranos raked in more than $600 million in its latest funding rounds, it now has about $150 million or less in cash, excluding debt, a source told the Journal. Theranos was founded by Holmes to realize the dream of testing blood by the drop, not the vial. But earlier reporting by the Journal called into question the efficacy of the blood tests, prompting investigations and sanctions from regulators. Theranos has since promised to be more transparent about its technology. For more on the story, see the article at WSJ.com.

The streak began on October 11 and was the longest uninterrupted rise since 1995. The only casualty was complacency, never a good idea, nor are emotional reactions to stock prices. Average returns after similar streaks are have averaged 13% in 12 months. With television commentators shouting for our attention, their appeals to anxieties can provoke nervous selling and other hasty decisions. Perspective is essential and that very successful investor, Mr. Warren Buffett, can help. “Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.” So far this century, the Dow has almost doubled despite terrorist attacks, continuing Mideast conflicts and the introduction of Twitter. The trick is to ignore the chaff of media chatter and social chitchat and make sensible investment decisions. Holding stock in growing companies without obsessing over price fluctuations works. A long-term perspective is essential. Mr. Buffett, again, “Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.” My favorite buy, Apple (AAPL-$141) is his newest. The corporate quarterly earnings season returns in to a couple of weeks and Apple reports in a month. Typically, analysts try to attract attention by forecasting disappointments and the company then exceeds expectations. Its current price after backing out the 7:1 stock split in 2005 is just under $1,000. I’m sure it break that adjusted $1,000 level soon. Steve Jobs would have liked that. Mr. Buffett jokes that Apple began to interest him when he took a dozen kids to Dairy Queen (which his Berkshire Hathaway owns) and they all pulled out iPhones. Observing helps. Looking around shopping malls today makes it no surprise that Sears (which bought Kmart for reasons unknown) is considering bankruptcy or that Macy’s is closing 100 stores. In contrast, Amazon (AMZN-$647), an essential holding, has over 43% of all online sales and a market cap over $400 billion, $90 bigger than Wal-Mart. By traditional marks, its valuation is scary but it owns Amazon Web Services (AWS), the pioneer and leader in the cloud-based computing industry. AWS, which accounts for 74% of Amazon’s operating profit, could be theoretically valued at $375 billion, indicating that the combination is actually undervalued. Stock advisors used to build portfolios around traditional big-asset companies like Exxon, AT&T and U.S. Steel. Those static choices could not compete with accelerating technologies that direct us now to stocks like Nvidia (NVDA-$107) and Broadcom (AVGO-$216). Texas Instruments (TXN-$89) reported strong growth in expanding auto and industrial applications. It also reports earnings in a month, which will show continuing double-digit percentage growth. It’s a new buy, particularly suitable for retirement accounts with a 2.3% yield and dividend increases for 13 (!) straight years. Applied Materials (AMAT-$38) supports these companies with manufacturing equipment. It just reported record order growth and is another buy recommendation. So is new buy Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-$32). Both have reasonable valuations and attractive yields. The louder the voices on TV, the weaker their logic. Keep a long view and, if in doubt, tomorrow is another day.

(Photo source: WLOX) GULFPORT, MS (WLOX) - The police investigation into a deadly traffic accident involving a Gulfport police officer is complete, and will soon be presented to a grand jury. Edgar Lambert, Jr., 54, was killed Jan. 19 when he was hit by a Gulfport police vehicle while crossing U.S. Highway 49. It will be up to a grand jury to decide if the officer will face charges in Lambert’s death. The Biloxi Police Department was called in to handle the accident reconstruction and investigation. On March 23, he DA’s office confirmed the police report was received and will be presented to a grand jury in the near future. The accident, which happened across from the Walmart Super Center on U.S. 49, raised questions about the lighting in an area. Since then, Gulfport has worked with MDOT to improve lighting along that stretch of the busy highway. Copyright 2017 WLOX. All rights reserved.

It happened at an apartment in Isabella County’s Union Township Wednesday night shortly before midnight. According to the sheriff’s office – two 19-year-olds from Lake were arguing over money. The victim told deputies that he was arguing over $15 inside his apartment with his friend. His friend allegedly demanded money from the victim who refused to pay. The suspect stated he would stab the victim if he didn’t pay. At some point during the argument the suspect allegedly pulled out a boot style knife and stabbed the victim in the leg. The victim along with friends tried to stop the bleeding, but couldn’t.  They then went to Walmart to get medical supplies. At Walmart someone called 911. Deputies arrived and found the victim still bleeding.  They assisted the teen until EMS arrived. He was taken to the hospital for treatment of the non-life threatening wound. Deputies located and interviewed the suspect, who allegedly admitted to stabbing his friend during the argument. A report of the case has been filed with the Prosecuting Attorney for review. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Live From Charlevoix Walking for a Cause Shared Skies In Traverse City Joining Forces for a Cause Leelanau Christian Neighbors MDOT’s 2017 Road Plan State News Michigan High School Graduation Rates Very Similar to Previous Year MDOT Lifts Spring Weight Restrictions from US-10 South to State Border AMBER ALERT UPDATE – CHILDREN WHO WERE IN BACKSEAT OF STOLEN CAR FOUND SAFE IN FLINT New Law Allows State Regulation of Ridesharing Businesses such as Uber and Lyft DNR Releases 2016 Forest Health Highlights Report Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission now Permanent, Manistee County Resident one of 15 Members World News RECALL – OK Food Recalls over 900,000lbs of Breaded Chicken that could have Metal Pieces Inside RECALL – Canadian Company Recalls Pig Ears over Salmonella Concerns J.C.

Starbucks shareholders elected three new members to the company’s board of directors; one of them is Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. By Alex Eule March 23, 2017 3:55 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is joining the Starbucks board, and he could help the company become even more tech-savvy. Illustration: Fran Parente Starbucks and Microsoft have always shared Seattle-area roots, but now the companies are sharing something else: Satya Nadella. Nadella is Microsoft’s CEO, but, as of Wednesday, he’s also a member of Starbucks’ Board of Directors. Nadella was first nominated by Starbucks in January. Shareholders made it official during the company’s annual meeting yesterday. More from Barron’s Next Five Reasons Starbucks Should Rebound This Year Why Starbucks Might Be Innovating Too Fast When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare A major tech name joining Starbucks’ board might not sound particularly compelling for a coffee company until you realize that Starbucks has become something of a technology powerhouse in its own right. The company has made more progress in the area of payment technology than any other traditional retailer. Mobile payments, using Starbucks’ app, now represent 27% of transactions at Starbucks’ stores. Advanced ordering via the app, which began nationwide just 18 months ago, already accounts for 7% of transactions. But the quick progress hasn’t come without headaches. On its last earnings call, Starbucks blamed tech-related growing pains for fewer in-store transactions. Turns out that so many people are ordering in advance that in-store customers are facing longer waits. As a director, Nadella won’t have any role in Starbucks’ day-to-day operations; board members are there to oversee and supervise the company on behalf of shareholders. As a big-company CEO, Nadella might also offer some helpful insights to Kevin Johnson, who takes the reins as Starbucks’ new CEO on April 3. The two will find plenty to discuss over coffee. Nadella and Microsoft know a few things about technology -- what works and what doesn’t -- and how to bring it to the masses. There’s also the possibility that Nadella will learn something about implementing payment technology, which could help Microsoft down the road. In addition to Nadella, Starbucks shareholders also elected two other new board members: Rosalind Brewer, head of Wal-Mart unit Sam’s Club, and Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, executive chairman of the LEGO Brand Group. Starbucks nominated all three executives to be board members in January. At the time, Starbucks outgoing CEO Howard Schultz said the board additions “will strengthen our leadership and add unmatched expertise in technology, strategy, and retail to the company at a time of unprecedented change for our industry.” Big Picture: By joining Starbucks board of directors, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could help the coffee chain solidify its technology lead in the payments world.

The lockdown was initiated following a report of an armed student threatening to shoot. Listen Listening... / 1:11 WBFO’s Avery Schneider reports. The lockdown began around 2 p.m. Thursday, after what Tonawanda Police described as an "unconfirmed report" of an armed student at the Northtowns Academy. The school, located on Dexter Terrace off Niagara Falls Boulevard, houses the Erie 1 BOCES exceptional education program, focusing on core curriculum classes. Police told reporters they believe the call came from a female student, who later admitted it was a lie. Listen Listening... / 1:03 WBFO's Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley spoke with Town of Tonawanda Police Capitan Joseph Carosi on Thursday afternoon. "About 2:15 this afternoon, we were notified that there was an unconfirmed report that there was an armed student inside the building at the NorthTowns Academy, Erie 1 Boces. The school immediately went into lockdown. Right now we are just trying to figure out what is going on," Carosi said. Police from the Town of Tonawanda responded in conjunction with the Town of Amherst Police Department because the school sits close to a jurisdictional border. Police also closed Dexter Terrace to traffic at Niagara Falls Boulevard. Parents of students at Northtowns Academy were asked to gather in the parking lot of Home Depot Plaza on Niagara Falls Boulevard outside the former Walmart, while police assessed the situation at the school on Dexter Terrace. Credit Avery Schneider / WBFO News "We are in direct communications [with the school] right now. We have no reports of any violence or any issues right now inside the school. We are taking a proactive response to make sure the safety of students and faculty are safeguarded," said Carosi. Parents were notified of the event by robo-call and were asked to go to 2065 Niagara Falls Boulevard in the Home Depot Plaza, the site of a closed Wal-Mart for a staging area with police. Some called the school directly for information. “They just wanted to know the same questions. What was going on? And we shared the same information – exactly what we could, what was taking place, and everything was handled. All calls went very well,” said Erie 1 BOCES Director of Exceptional Education Justin DeMartin. Immediately after the lockdown was lifted, DeMartin spoke to reporters outside the school. When asked to confirm the report of the weapon came from a student, DeMartin said he could not comment because the situation involved students. He did, however, confirm the report was made to a staff member. For almost two hours, students remained safely locked in their classrooms. DeMartin praised the cooperation of faculty, students, bus drivers and parents for their calm response to the situation. “All schools across the county, and even the state, follow the same lockdown safety procedures. And they handled everything as they should have and how it’s always been practiced within any drill,” said DeMartin. Faculty worked side by side with Town of Tonawanda Police throughout the lockdown – an interaction DeMartin described as “excellent.” On Friday, the school will return to normal activity. “We will obviously debrief with both students and staff,” said DeMartin. “But everything will go as usual.” Parents will receive an update by phone.

Khabaugh Musgrave. (Lake County Sheriff's Dept. / Post-Tribune) Ruth Ann KrausePost-Tribune Privacy Policy The father of a 15-month-old Gary girl who died earlier this month after suffering brain injuries and retinal hemorrhaging consistent with shaken infant syndrome has been charged in connection to her death, according to court records. Khabuagh Musgrave, 23, was charged Wednesday in Lake Superior Court with aggravated battery and battery resulting in death of a person younger than 14, according to court records. Musgrave was not in police custody as of Thursday afternoon and a warrant was issued for his arrest, according to court records. His daughter Najae Musgrave, of the 4400 block of East 6th Avenue, died earlier this month and the Cook County Medical Examiner's office ruled her death a homicide, Gary Lt. Thomas Pawlak said earlier this month. Najae Musgrave was transported by ambulance to Methodist Hospitals Northlake Campus in Gary at 11:30 a.m. on March 6, according to court documents. She was in a coma when she arrived and scans of the toddler's head showed no significant brain activity, court records said. Her lungs also showed signs of bruising, she had an old injury on her nose, an old burn mark on her right knee, a new burn mark on her left foot and scabs around her neck, court records state. Gary police investigating 1-year-old's death as homicide Becky Jacobs Gary police are investigating the death of a 1-year-old child in Gary last week as a homicide, according to police.

Gary police are investigating the death of a 1-year-old child in Gary last week as a homicide, according to police. The death of Najae Musgrave, of the 4400 block of East 6th Avenue, was ruled a homicide from child abuse by the Cook County Medical Examiner, according to Gary Lt. Thomas Pawlak. ... (Becky Jacobs) From Northlake, the child was taken to University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, where she was declared brain dead at 1:44 p.m. that day, according to court records. Khabuagh Musgrave told police he had worked the overnight shift at Wal-Mart in Portage, the records state. He told police that when he arrived home, he checked on his children and laid down until about 8:30 a.m. when his girlfriend, the mother of his two children, left for work, the records state. He told police he then ate breakfast, watched part of a movie and told the children to take a nap because he was going to sleep. He said he put Najae down on her stomach. At 11 a.m., he went to check on the children and when he picked up Najae, her head fell back and she wasn't breathing properly, court records state. Musgrave suggested to police his son could have injured Najae with rough playing, or he could have hurt her unintentionally by playfully throwing her in the air, according to court documents. Musgrave also said that the day before, Najae crawled out the front door onto the porch and tried to crawl down the porch steps while he was putting his son in the car seat, the records state. The child rolled down the steps onto the sidewalk, cried for a while, but seemed to be fine, documents said. The mother told police that Musgrave didn't tell her about that incident until Najae was taken to the hospital, court records state. Photos: Mugs in the newsOpen link In May 2016, child welfare authorities investigated an earlier report of child abuse against Musgrave and the child's mother, but the mother told police the allegations were unfounded, documents said. The woman told police she and Musgrave had domestic issues nine months to a year before the baby's death, documents said. No hearing dates have been set yet.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment German software giant SAP SE said Wednesday it will team with the British financial IT firm Everledger Ltd. to build blockchain capabilities into its cloud-based business network, a move that could help logistics users improve data security and generate more accurate tracking and tracing of goods. Adding blockchain technology to SAP Ariba applications and the Ariba Network could transform global supply chains just as it is already impacting industries such as banking and insurance, agriculture, energy, healthcare, and media, the company said. At its core, blockchain is a digital ledger that can be used to drive business processes involving multiple parties, upending the way goods and services are traded, SAP said. "One of the things blockchain does is facilitate greater visibility and trust," Joe Fox, senior vice president for business development and strategy at SAP Ariba, said in a release. "In embedding it across our applications and network, we can enable supply chains that are smarter, faster, and more transparent from sourcing all the way through settlement." SAP Ariba will develop its blockchain tools by joining forces with Everledger, a London-based IT company that provides technology services to the banking and financial services industry. Everledger securely captures the defining characteristics of valuable objects such as diamonds and creates a digital thumbprint of the asset that is stored on the blockchain. This information—including history, transport, events, and ownership—is relied upon by multiple stakeholders across global supply chains to verify authenticity. Blockchain has been gaining traction in logistics over the past year through initiatives such as a $2.3 million push by Dutch supply chain firms to apply the technology to the country's logistics sector, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s decision to use the software to track its food shipments in China, and the announcement by Danish shipping giant Maersk Line that it had teamed with IBM Corp. to use blockchain to speed the flow of data through its global supply chain. #Logistics #Software & Systems Resources Mentioned In This Article Everledger IBM Maersk Line SAP Wal-Mart Related Articles SensorThink launches warehouse execution system Digital logistics market set for 8.1 percent compound annual growth through 2022 TMW Systems links its TMS with driver retention software Transfix adds online load booking to freight marketplace app MercuryGate program connects TMS users with logistics experts More Videos » Technology Videos Orchestrating Your Next Best Move With Real-Time Visibility Logistics technology tools that matter Ruan: A Culture Enhanced by People, Process and Technology Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The former Hope's Door president suspected of stealing more than $30,000 from the charity is facing felony charges in Wood County Circuit Court. Wochit Karolyn D. Weber, 45, of Wisconsin Rapids was president of Hope's Door when she used her Hope's Door credit card to purchase $25,460.90 worth of gift cards, a $641 washing machine and car repairs for her son from 2013 to 2015, according to court records. Wood County Assistant District Attorney Michael Zell filed felony charges of theft and passing a forged document against Weber on Wednesday. Weber is scheduled to make her initial appearance on the charges April 14. Hope's Door underwent a renovation in 2015 and changed its name to Random Acts of Kindness. No one returned a call Thursday morning to answer questions about Weber's current status with the charity. According to court documents: On Feb. 23, 2015, Jennifer Concklin, a volunteer for Hope's Door, reported to police that there had been misuse of donations to Hope's Door by Weber. Concklin became suspicious when she noticed $20,000 worth of expenditures not accounted for in the account records and confronted Weber about it. Weber said she had receipts that accounted for the spending, but then told Concklin that she was no longer comfortable with Conklin handling the finances for the charity. RELATED: Police: Bank manager stole $3K from vault RELATED: Clark County cop quits after alleged theft of money, steaks Weber said Hope's Door was hers, she would do with the money as she saw fit and she was not about to let her family go without things, Concklin told police. Police began going through receipts that were for the purchase of gift cards. Each receipt had the name of a Hope's Door client on it. As police began contacting the clients, police learned that time after time the noted recipient of the gift card had not received it. Police also found receipts for gas that contained the names of Hope's Door clients or volunteers. Again, police contacted the people named on the receipts and learned they had not received the purchase. One volunteer said he was fishing in Canada at the time a receipt indicated the charity had bought gas for him, and that the charity had never reimbursed him for gas. Weber purchased a Maytag washing machine for $641.55, along with a five-year protection plan for it; the receipt for the machine had a client's name on it. When an officer talked to the client, he said he had received a used Kenmore washing machine from Hope's Door. Weber told police she had the new washing machine delivered to her own home to protect the identity of the client. She said she took the machine to Hope's Door so the client could pick it up there. When confronted with the evidence, Weber said she might have written the client's name on the receipt by accident and might have mistakenly used the wrong credit card to purchase it. Police searched Weber's home and found the washing machine. They also found 36 cans of chicken breasts, 22 cans of tuna, eight cans of cooked ham, eight packages of fishing hooks and 20 cans of dog food. All of the items had been donated to Hope's Door by Walmart. In total, police found 453 items, valued at $2,665.83, donated by the store in Weber's home. Police learned Weber used a check from a Hope's Door account to pay $525 for her rent. The check also had Concklin's signature on it, but Concklin told police she never signed it. Weber used her Hope's Door credit card to pay for repairs for her son's vehicle and buy four new tires for it. She also used Hope's Door money to pay for her son's housing at college. Weber told police her son was a client of Hope's Door and could receive benefits. Weber told police it is her sole discretion as to what to use the charity's money for. Weber spent $2,977.13 for her son's college and vehicle expenses. The total amount Weber took from the charity, including washing machine, rent, gift cards and family expenses, amounted to $32,443.30. If convicted, Weber faces a maximum of 16 years in prison.

Adam Hayat is charged with possession of an unregistered firearm, legal language that prosecutors call a destructive device. He appeared in court wearing shackles, and was seen repeatedly fidgeting in his chair and at times appeared to be talking to himself. Last month at the Downtown Sheraton (1550 Court Place), hotel staff said they went into Hayat's room and found the word "explosives" written on a mirror and homemade pipe bombs in a safe. The hotel was evacuated and the bomb squad removed the devices. There were no injuries. Hayat was later arrested in Los Angeles and made his first court appearance Monday. Hayat is a former Marine and an American citizen of Pakistani descent. He lived in the hotel for about two months and skipped out on a $10,000 bill. His public defender did not raise the issue of competency during Thursday's court appearance, though that could change at a later hearing. Hayat's attorney argued his client should be sent to a halfway house while he awaits trial, but prosecutors objected, saying Hayat is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors said Hayat has admitted to making the bombs and that he got the supplies from Home Depot and Wal-Mart. Hayat admitted to making the bombs with the intention of killing himself in Pueblo. Prosecutors also said Hayat twice tried to buy firearms from Bass Pro Shops before the pipe bombs were found. The shops declined his requests even though Hayat doesn't have a criminal history. When found in Los Angeles, officials searched Hayat's hotel room and found a hatchet knife and drug paraphernalia. Hayat, who has no ties to Colorado, is a suicide risk and has self-reported issues with mental illness, prosecutors said. The judge later ruled Hayat will stay in jail with 24-hour supervision and to receive treatment. He faces up to 10 years in federal prison and up to $250,000 in fines if convicted.

PAYCHECK SAMPLER: WHAT 25 AREA BIG SHOTS EARN A sampling of the compensation received by many area CEOs, university presidents and health care officials shows mostly robust pay packages for a majority of top execs in Tampa Bay. TECO Energy CEO John Ramil, now retired from the Tampa power company, so far tops the pay scale for executives of publicly traded companies as of 2016.

URBAN FARMING TAKES ROOT IN NEW PORT RICHEY FRONT YARDS In broad daylight and right in the front yard, something is happening in New Port Richey. The New Urbanism movement has taken hold and urban agriculture is flourishing. Jim Kovaleski, a self-proclaimed urban farmer, thinks it's because the city has cheap land, low taxes, free compost, an urban agriculture ordinance and a free-to-vendors, year-round farmers market — a formula he thinks is perfect for attracting the growing number of people interested in urban farming.

Joel Guy, Jr., 28, has been indicted by a Knoxville grand jury for two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of abusing a corpse, and one count felony murder. Detectives believe Guy Jr. – a current Baton Rouge resident – traveled to Knoxville the week of Thanksgiving. At some point he allegedly murdered his parents, then dismembered them and attempted to dissolve their bodies in acid. RELATED STORIES: Man accused of dismembering parents during Thanksgiving visit to Knoxville  The crime scene and remains of Joel Guy Sr. and Lisa Guy were discovered during a welfare check, which was requested after Lisa did not show up for work. Detectives said they believe Guy's parents were going to cut him off financially and that may have led to the killings. Investigators say they have video evidence showing Guy purchasing items at a Knoxville WalMart and those items were later found in the home where his parents were murdered. They claim the items were used in an attempt to cover up the crime scene. Guy was arrested at his Baton Rouge apartment on Nicholson Drive on Tuesday, November 29. He was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. Because the crime happened in Knoxville, Guy will have to be prosecuted there. Copyright 2017 WAFB.

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – The Finish Line, Oxford Industries, Shoe Carnival By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 24 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Destination XL moved to a profit but booked lower sales, while Caleres moved to a loss in the quarter. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  The Finish Line Athletic footwear and apparel retailer The Finish Line said its fourth-quarter earnings performance represented a disappointing finish to a financially challenging year for the company, with net sales falling 0.4% year-on-year to US$557.5m. Same-store sales decreased 4.5%. In the 13 weeks to 25 February, the company made a loss of $9.5m, compared to net income of $4m in the year-ago period. Despite this, CEO Sam Sato said the company is confident that the numerous operational improvements it has made throughout the past year have created a "more efficient company with a stronger foundation to support enhanced profitability and increased shareholder value over the long-term." Oxford Industries Oxford Industries booked a mixed fourth-quarter as it saw earnings tumble on charges and sales edge up. In the three months ended 28 January, earnings dropped to US$10m from $17.5m a year earlier. The company incurred $7.1m of charges associated with inventory markdowns, severance and closing three outlet locations related to actions to improve the operating performance of its Tommy Bahama brand. Gross margin was 42 basis points higher at 56.2%, while consolidated net sales increased to $261m compared to $259.6m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Shoe Carnival Show carnival has moved to a net loss of US$920,000 in its fourth-quarter from earnings of $4.2m a year earlier as a result of non-cash impairment charges. Gross profit margin narrowed to 27.5% from 29.2%, while net sales edged up $0.5m, or 0.2%, to $234.2m. Comparable store sales were down 1.2%. CEO Cliff Sifford, said: "We believe the strong athletic footwear cycle we experienced during the year will continue into 2017 and we are pleased with the early results from our casual sandal footwear." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp said it was "very pleased" with its fourth quarter results, which exceeded both sales and earnings guidance, despite seeing a 25.1% drop in net income to US$100.5m from $134.2m in the year ago period. For the quarter ended 29 January, revenue of US$2.1bn was flat compared to the prior year period. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 3% to $932m, while Calvin Klein revenues fell 1% to $795m. Meanwhile,Heritage Brands' sales decreased 5% to $381m. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which exceeded both our sales and earnings guidance despite the volatile macroeconomic environment and the highly promotional retail market in the US. We continued to demonstrate strong momentum in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it saw "solid progress" on its strategic plan in the fourth quarter, which led to sales growth in its core global brands, expansion in gross margin and earnings in line with guidance. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$9m, compared to a loss of $17.7m in the year-ago period.   Gross margin expanded 150 basis points to 38.7% from 37.2%, while total sales dropped 4.7% to $204.2m from $214.4m last year. This reflected a 1.4% (3.2% on constant currency) increase in men's business including Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, Golf Lifestyle Apparel and Nike, offset by a number of factors, including a comparable sales decline of 6.2% within direct-to-consumer business as store traffic dropped by 15%. J Crew US fashion retailer J Crew booked a mixed fourth-quarter as the company moved to a profit but booked lower sales. Net income amounted to US$1.1m from a loss of $7m a year earlier, while gross margin widened to 34.7% from 33.3%. Net sales at J Crew were down 5% to $572.6m from $604.5m last year, while those at Madewell rose 11% to $102.9m from $92.5m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, total revenues fell 2% to $695m, while comparable company sales decreased 5% following a decline of 4% in the fourth quarter last year. CEO Millard Drexler noted: "While the overall retail environment remains challenging, we continue our disciplined management of expenses and inventory and remain focused on delivering the very best, iconic J.Crew and Madewell products our customers love across all channels. As a team, we are taking important steps to drive improved operational excellence across the company."  Destination XL Group Destination XL has booked a mixed fourth-quarter as the company moved to a profit but booked lower sales. Earnings amounted to US$1.8m from a loss of $1.4m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 44.9% from 45.8% due to a drop in merchandise margin and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Total sales of $122.6m were down slightly from $124m in the prior-year quarter. Total comparable sales dropped 2.4%, while DXL comparable sales fell 1.9%. "Despite the 2016 retail environment being one of the most challenging in recent memory, we were very pleased to deliver strong growth," said CEO David Levin. "We enter the new fiscal year keenly focused on continuing to grow our customer base by leveraging our fully developed fleet of DXL stores and elevating our digital distribution channel." Caleres Footwear retailer Caleres booked a loss of US$6.6m in the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin was up 4 basis points to 40.8%, while net sales increased 5.1% to $639.5m, compared to $608.7m last year. "Despite a promotional and challenging retail environment in the fourth quarter, we maintained our consistent approach of managing the areas under our control while continuing to rapidly respond to changing consumer shopping behaviours," said CEO Diane Sullivan.   Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a net loss of US$12.8m for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.8m in the year-ago period. Fourth-quarter gross margin decreased to 28.8% of sales from 36.1% of sales in 2015, primarily due to reduced merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs. Sales for the period were $218.2m, a decrease of 12% on last year's $247.3m. Same-store sales were also down 12% for the quarter. CEO John Cato said 2016 was a "very disappointing year" for the company. He added: "The overall apparel retail environment continued to be difficult and was compounded by several mistakes of our own.  We also are being impacted by the disruption caused by the growth of online sales at other retailers, resulting in lower store traffic.  In the back half of the year, we made several mistakes in our merchandise assortment, fit and timing.  This resulted in significant reductions to regular priced sales causing us to liquidate a large portion of our slow selling inventory which put severe pressure on earnings." DSW DSW said its return to year over year earnings growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net income rising 158.5% to US$30.5m, compared to $11.8m in the year-ago period. Gross profit increased by 50 bps, while total sales edged up slightly, increasing 0.4% to  $674.6m. Comparable sales meanwhile, decreased 7% compared to last year's 0.7% increase. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "After making fundamental changes to our core business last year, we are laser focused on driving comp growth through our merchandise and allocation initiatives and the elevation of our customer's digital experience." The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores saw earnings and revenue decline in the fourth quarter. The York, Pennsylvania-based company recorded net income of US$44.7m, down from $50.6m in the year-ago period. Gross margin increased 145 basis points to 36.2% compared to last year, primarily due to reduced markdowns and lower distribution costs, partially offset by deleverage from lower sales volume. Total sales in the period decreased 5.5% to $877.3m, versus $927.9m last year, while comparable store sales decreased 4.7% as compared with the prior year period. Tilly's  Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's says it is encouraged by its fourth-quarter results as earnings reached US$6.3m from $2.9m a year earlier. Gross margin dropped to 30.6% from 31.4% last year, primarily due to a 60 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns and a 20 basis point increase in buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Total sales edged up 0.7% to $160.2m, while comparable sales were up 0.1%. CEO, Ed Thomas, said: "While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to seek ways to improve profitability and continue our progress during fiscal 2017." Genesco Genesco booked declines in both earnings and revenue during the fourth quarter. Net earnings reached US$46.5m compared to earnings of $44.7m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped 5% to $883m from $932m, reflecting the sale of the Lids Team Sports business in the fourth quarter of last year and a decrease of approximately 2% in sales from the remaining businesses. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalogue sales were flat  with an 8% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 6% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 2% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 1% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group.  Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends posted profit and sales increases in its fourth-quarter.

Revenues were down 15.7% to $280m from net sales of $332m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 16.1%. Online sales were down 8.8% to $32.2m for the 13-week period ended 28 January.  Zumiez  Zumiez said its fourth-quarter earnings performance exceeded expectations,with net income in the period ended 28 January, increasing 38.3% to US$18.2m, compared to $13.1m in the year-ago period. Net sales for the quarter were also up, increasing 8.7% to $263.6m from $242.4m, while comparable sales for the period increased 5.1% compared to a 9.5% decrease last year. Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, moved to a loss in its fourth-quarter. For the period ended 31 December, net loss from continuing operations was US$4.9m, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.7m for the prior year period. Net sales, meanwhile, were up 108% to $42m from $20.3m in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands, as well as 3% growth in Robert Graham. Gross margin fell to 51.8% compared to 59.9% last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans, which carries a lower gross margin rate as a wholesale business. Sears Holdings US retail giant Sears Holdings revealed a widening of its net loss in the quarter to US$607m from $580m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.3%, primarily attributed to lower margins in the apparel business, and an increase in promotional activities. Net revenues fell to $6.1bn from $7.3bn in the prior year quarter. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "We delivered significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter, reflecting our firm focus on profitability to offset ongoing revenue pressures. Building on this positive momentum, we are taking decisive actions to become a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability." Tailored Brands Tailored Brands, the former Men's Wearhouse, said it has booked a lower than expected fourth-quarter, despite driving its net loss down to US$30.1m, compared to $1.1bn last year. Retail gross margin increased 60 basis points to 39.0%, primarily as a result of "anniversarying" an $11m inventory write-down in last year's fourth-quarter. "Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross margins," said CEO Doug Ewert. Express Express said its fourth-quarter earnings were in line with its guidance, despite net income dropping to US$22.8m from $56.1m a year earlier. Merchandise margin declined by 330 basis points, driven by increased promotional activity. Net sales fell 11% to $678.8m from $765.6m, while comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 13%. CEO David Kornberg, noted:  "Despite ongoing pressures in the retail sector, our fourth quarter earnings were in line with previously issued guidance. As expected, our store performance continued to be impacted by challenging mall traffic and a promotional retail environment. As our industry adapts to changing consumer preferences, we continue to invest in our omni-channel and marketing capabilities to ensure that we capitalize on this evolution."  The Children's Place The Children's Place has achieved what it says was a "spectacular" year thanks to significant progress on its numerous self-help initiatives. "Our product assortment, supported by a foundation of superior design, sourcing and merchandising capabilities, clearly resonated with our customers," said CEO Jane Elfers. Net income for the quarter almost doubled to US$34.2m from $17.5m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 36.1% thanks to merchandise margin leverage and a higher Average Unit Retail (AUR). Net sales were up 4.5% to $520.8m on a comparable retail sales increase of 6.9%. For the full year, earnings soared 77% to $102.3m, while net sales were up 3.4% to $1.78bn. Stein Mart Stein Mart has revealed a "disappointing" fourth-quarter as the company continued to work through higher than desired inventory levels and the impact of changes to marketing, merchandising and promotions implemented during the third quarter. The company moved to a net loss of US$4.9m from earnings $6.3m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 22.8% from 26.8% a year earlier. Total sales were down 2.2% to $385.5m, while comparable store sales dropped 5.5%. CEO Hunt Hawkins, said: "With our new executive leadership now in place, 2017 will be a year of transition as we refine and organise around our strategies. Lessons learned from last year have us keenly focused on changes we need to make to our business to significantly improve management of our inventories and increase sales productivity." Weyco Group Weyco has booked a mixed fourth-quarter as earnings rose but sales fell. For the three month period, net income amounted to US$8.3m from $8.2m a year earlier. The 2015 figure included a $458,000 earnout payment relating to the company's 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. Without this, earnings would have been down 9%. Net sales for the quarter were down 6% to $82.1m. Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said it was pleased with its fourth-quarter, despite booking a mixed period which saw revenues rise but earnings fall. For the 13 weeks to 28 January, net income fell 30% to US$90.2m, compared to $129m in the year-ago period. Net sales increased 10.9% to US$2.5bn, while same-store sales were up 5.3%. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will "continue to be aggressive" and evolve its business.  Black Diamond Black Diamond has narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter, to US$1.39bn from $31.7bn a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 29.1% from 33.5%, weighed down by foreign currency headwinds. Sales were down 6% to $41.4m, due to unseasonably dry European winter conditions impacting ski product sales and the company's measured approach to scaling back its apparel line. CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits." Sequential Brands Brand management company Sequential Brands narrowed its losses to US$980,000 in the fourth quarter, from $5.7m in the same period last year. Revenue for the three months to 31 December increased 44% to $45.4m, compared to $31.4m in the year-ago period. For the year ending 31 December, 2017, the company is expecting $170m to $175m in revenue. CEO Yehuda Shmidman said: "Looking ahead, despite a challenging macro retail environment, we will remain focused on growing our core business and maximising operating efficiencies, inclusive of new revenue initiatives already underway." Stage Stores Stage Stores moved to a loss in the fourth quarter and revealed a drop in sales. For the quarter ended 28 January, net loss was US$6.8m versus a profit of $21m last year. Net sales fell 9.6% to $454.4m, compared to $502.6m in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were down 8.5%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "Our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings reflect continued challenges in our oil impacted and border states, as well as the overall soft retail environment. Weak traffic led to heightened promotional activity and gross margin pressure in the quarter, yet we are pleased to end 2016 with inventory levels that are 6% lower than last year. In addition, our direct-to-consumer business grew at a double digit rate as we enhanced our customers' online experience."   Burlington Stores Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue incense in the fourth quarter, booking a 27.1% rise in net income from US$98.8m to $125.6m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 41.8%, driven by improved shortage results. Net sales were up 9.4%, or $144.9m, to $1.7bn from $1.5bn thanks to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and $82.1m in sales from new and non-comparable stores. For the full year, the company expects sales to increase in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%, and comparable sales to be up 2% to 3%. Abercrombie & Fitch Co Abercrombie & Fitch said its fourth-quarter results did not meet expectations, despite 2016 being a year of "significant progress" on each of its strategic priorities. Earnings were down 15.4% to US$48.8m, while gross margin narrowed 90 basis points to 59.3%. Net sales fell 7% to $1.04bn, with comparable sales for the quarter down 5%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 13% to $442.4m, while Hollister sales were down 2% to $594m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 8% to $688.2m in the US, and 5% to $348.2m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "We continued to proactively respond to the evolving retail landscape through our store closure and channel optimisation initiatives. While the environment is likely to remain challenging in 2017, we have a strong balance sheet and continue to aggressively manage costs … to position our business for sustainable growth." Croc's US footwear firm Crocs  booked revenue in-line with guidance at US$187.4m from $208.7m a year earlier. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 10.5%. The company reported a net loss of $40.6m, compared to a loss of $70.2m in the year ago period. CEO Gregg Ribatt said: "Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations while our adjusted gross margin rate improved by approximately 550 basis points versus prior year. This gross margin gain was less than previously anticipated due to currency and channel mix fluctuations and also to certain one-time events, however we are still on track to achieve our medium-term target for gross margins in the low 50% range." Crocs also revealed Ribbatt will step down as CEO but continue in his board role. Andrew Rees, who joined the company in June 2014 as president, will be promoted to president and CEO, effective 1 June. The company will also close aroundd 160 stores by the end of 2018, reducing its total store count from 558 to around 400.  American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a decline in both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, with net income slipping 33.1% to US$54.6m from $81.7m in the year ago period. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 35.4%, compared to 35.1% last year. Total revenues decreased 1% to $1.1bn from $1.11bn in the same period last year. Consolidated comparable sales were up slightly, following a 4% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "We've made great progress, yet we have much more opportunity across the marketplace. I'm confident that the strength of our brands and focused priorities will enable us to deliver long-term returns to our shareholders." Ross Stores Ross Stores booked fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat company expectations. Net profit grew 13.8% to US$300.6m from $264.2m last year, while total sales rose 8% to $3.5bn. Comparable store sales were up 4% versus a 4% gain in the prior year. CEO Barbara Rentler noted: "We are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multi-year comparisons and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continued to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home."For the year ending 3 February, 2018, the company has forecast EPS in the range of $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it is pleased with the momentum in its core business after delivering what it called "solid" earnings results in the fourth quarter. For the three months ended 31 December, earnings climbed 11.5% to US$28.7m from $25.7m last year. However, the company said overall sales declined "modestly" due primarily to softness in its private label footwear and cold weather accessories businesses. Sales were down 2.3% in the period to $336.4m, compared to $344.3m last year. Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 38.7% as compared to 36.1%. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said while the company is cautious about the overall environment, it is confident it can drive top and bottom line growth in 2017 and beyond. Target Corp US retail group Target has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its fourth-quarter on the back on soft store traffic declines and what it calls rapidly-changing consumerbehaviour. For the three months ended 28 January, net earnings tumbled 42.7% from US$1.4bn to $817m. Sales dropped 4.3% to $20.7bn from $21.6bn, reflecting a 1.5% decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 34% and contributing 1.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 26.9%, compared with 27.9% in the year ago period. The retailer said it will reveal a new financial model later today, designed to position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in "this new era in retail".  "Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behaviour, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores," said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker has generated what it says is its seventh consecutive year of "meaningful" sales and profit growth as it revealed higher earnings in its fourth-quarter to US$189m from $158m a year earlier. Gross margin improved to 33.7% of sales from 33.6% a year ago, while total sales climbed 5.3% to $2.11bn. Comparable store sales increased 5%. CEO Richard Johnson, said: "Generating our seventh consecutive year of meaningful sales and profit growth is a strong testament to Foot Locker's solid position at the centre of sneaker culture. Due in part to the change in the cadence of income tax refund check distribution, we are facing a challenging retail sales environment as we enter 2017; however, we believe the strategic initiatives we have in place, coupled with our strong vendor relationships, will enable us to deliver another year of record performance." Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, reflecting what it calls "continuous improvements" to its operating model. For the period ended 28 January, net earnings were up 11.7% to US$201m, from $180m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.4% to $4.2bn compared to $4.1bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.9%. Gross margin, meanwhile, improved 112 basis points, reflecting strong inventory execution in addition to reduced competitive markdowns. For the full year, the company reached record sales of $14.5bn, up from $14.1bn last year. Carter's Carter's has had what it says was a "strong finish to another record year" as it revealed higher sales and earnings in its fourth-quarter. Net income was up 20% to US$87.1m, while operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.9%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 7.8% to reach $67.7m, thanks to revenue growth in nearly every business segment. CEO Michael Casey, said: "Our focus on providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel, extending the reach of our brands, and improving profitability enabled us to achieve our 28th consecutive year of sales growth, improve our profit margins, and increase the return of capital to shareholders. We are forecasting good growth in sales and earnings in 2017." Kohl's Department store retailer Kohl's has posted what it says are "weak" sales results for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic. For the three months ended 28 January, net sales dropped 2.8% to US$6.21bn from $6.39bn in the year-ago period. Net profit was also down, falling 15% to $252m, compared to $296 last year. Gross margin was flat at 33.4%. CEO Kevin Mansell, said: "Sales results were weak for the quarter in total, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic, and offset somewhat by strength in online demand. We saw improvement in merchandise margin, and our team continued to manage inventory and expenses extremely well. In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour in early March. We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home."

Meanwhile, the company reported net sales of $4.5bn, an increase of 2% compared to sales of $4.4bn for the year ago period. Comparable sales were flat for the period.

Iconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group booked a loss of approximately US$297.5m in its fourth-quarter, compared to a loss of around $263.0m a year earlier. Licensing sales fell 8% to $87.1m Revenue in the prior year's fourth quarter included approximately $1.3m of licensing revenue from the Badgley Mischka brand, Iconix said, for which there was no comparable revenue this year, due to its sale in the first quarter. The company also made an operating loss of around $385.8m, as compared to a loss of $398.2m in the year ago period. CEO John Haugh said: "2016 was a year of transition for Iconix. Our operating performance was in-line with our guidance. I believe the changes we have made over the past year provide a strong foundation to drive long term growth and shareholder value."  Chico's FAS Chico's says it is "extremely pleased" with its fourth-quarter results as it moved to a profit thanks to gross margin expansion and execution of its strategic initiatives. Earnings amounted to US$13.5m from a loss of $21.1m a year earlier, while gross margin expanded to 35.5% from 34.4%. Sales, meanwhile, dropped 4.9% to $600.8m as a result of the sale of the firm's Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business last year. Excluding this, sales dropped 2.3%, primarily reflecting a decline in comparable sales of 2.5%, comprised of reduced transaction count and an increase in average dollar sale.

In many cases, taxpayers Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Americans are a workaholic bunch, but sometimes life has other plans, which can arrive in the form of a sick parent, a serious illness or a new child. One-quarter of working Americans took time off for medical, parental or family reasons in the last two years, according to a new study from the Pew Research Center. How workers pay for their leave varies considerably, with wealthier Americans more likely to receive paid leave benefits from their employers. Almost half of Americans who earn less than $30,000 annually said they turned to public assistance to make ends meet while on parental leave, while almost 6 out of 10 said they went into debt.  Play Video CBS Evening News D.C. city council votes to mandate 8 weeks of paid family leave The District of Columbia's city council approved a measure to provide eight weeks of paid leave for parents of a newborn or adopted child. It wou... Regardless of income, Americans are cobbling together methods of affording paid family or medical leave, a necessity given the U.S. is the sole country among 41 of the biggest and most developed nations lacking paid parental leave.  Americans are allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for medical or family issues, however.  Even households earning more than $75,000 -- or those comfortably within the middle class -- are going into debt, cutting back on spending or cutting their family leaves short in order to afford time off.  “Even those who receive pay are combining benefits,” said Julianna Horowitz, one of the Pew researchers. “What we come away with, in terms of policies, is that it’s very complicated. It’s not as simple as some people suspect.” The issue of paid parental leave has taken center stage in the U.S. with President Donald Trump’s promise to address the issue with the help of daughter Ivanka Trump. Yet Pew found that the most common reasons for taking paid leave aren’t related to the birth or adoption of a child, but personal medical problems.  About 15 percent of American workers surveyed by Pew took time off from work to deal with their own serious health issue, while another 9 percent said they wanted or needed time off but weren’t able to take it. That’s more than double the rate of workers who said they took time off for the birth or adoption of a child.  “A lot of the time the debate over paid medical leave centers around parental leave, or whether a father should take leave, but personal medical leave and taking time off to care for sick family members are among the more common reasons to take leave,” Horowitz said.  Play Video CBS This Morning Deloitte announces 16 weeks of paid family leave program Some of America's leading companies are picking up on more paid time off for family care. This week, Deloitte, an auditing and tax-services compa... Almost half of middle-aged Americans said they needed to take family leave to help a seriously ill parent. For senior citizens, the primarily reason for taking family leave was to help a seriously ill spouse.  Those pressures may only intensify as the American population ages, Horowitz noted. The share of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to rise to almost 22 percent by 2040, up from about 15 percent currently, according to the Administration on Aging. On top of dealing with aging parents, workers are also coping with their own health issues.  “Some of these demographic changes have propelled these changes into the national debate,” she said. The financial impact of taking leave, for whatever reason, can be substantial. About 8 of 10 workers who took leave and received either no or a portion of their pay said they had to cut back on spending to make ends meet. Almost four out of 10 went into debt, while one-third delayed paying their bills. Across all incomes, almost 2 out of 10 leave-takers went on public assistance.  Low-income workers feel the most pain when it comes to figuring out how to pay for leave. They’re not only the least likely to receive paid leave benefits from their employers, but they’re more likely to struggle as a result of taking unpaid time off. Almost half delayed paying their bills and went on public assistance. Almost one-third of Americans earning less than $30,000 annually said they needed or wanted to take leave, but weren’t able to do it.

YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki tells "Sunda... The issue highlights how low-wage corporations may be pushing costs onto taxpayers. Employers such as Walmart and McDonald’s cost taxpayers $153 billion per year because their workers turn to food stamps and other benefits to supplement their low wages, a 2015 study from the University of California at Berkeley found.  Roughly one out of 10 workers earning more than $75,000 weren’t able to take leave, Pew found. The main reason for failing to take a needed leave? Most said they couldn’t afford the lost wages, while about half said they worried they’d lose their job.  So should workers have access to paid leave? The vast majority of those surveyed by Pew support the idea, although views on funding paid leave vary by age, income and political affiliation. Americans are split on whether it should be a federal mandate, with about half thinking it should be up to employers whether to offer it.  A majority of both Republicans and Democrats believe that employers should pay for medical and family leave, rather than the federal government. “The public doesn’t seem to necessarily be supportive of the government providing it,” Horowitz said. Compared with European attitudes to the government’s role in paid leave, “Americans tend to take a more individualistic approach.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.
