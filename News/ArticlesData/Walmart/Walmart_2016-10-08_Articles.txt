Bearish bets on China’s second-largest e-commerce company rose to record levels after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said in a regulatory filing that it raised its stake to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The increased investment came after a 34 percent rally in JD.com’s U.S.-traded stock in the past four months narrowed its 2016 decline to 16 percent. Wal-Mart is boosting support as JD.com’s 2016 adjusted net loss is forecast to widen 10 percent to 947 million yuan ($142 million) as intensifying competition with market leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. forces the company to increase spending. Expenses are rising as JD.com expands its delivery network to serve smaller towns and increases product offerings. Economic growth that is decelerating to the slowest pace since 1990 adds to the challenge. “An expectation that a partnership with an American company will bring an improvement to JD.com right away may be overly optimistic,” Gil Luria, an analyst who covers technology and e-commerce companies at Wedbush Securities Inc., said by phone. “Investors need to see a competitive match-up versus Alibaba, which is a hard task now that the economic growth is slowing.” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has said that the company needs to succeed in China, where it estimates 25 percent of global retail growth will come from in the next five years. The closer collaboration can help JD.com increase delivery speeds to rural areas. “We believe this strategic alliance will help us grow e-commerce even faster in China," said Dan Toporek, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. Josh Gartner, a JD.com spokesman in Beijing, declined to comment on the stock performance or the partnership with Wal-Mart. A significant share of JD.com’s business is generated from selling products it holds in its own inventory. This has helped speed deliveries, guarantee products’ authenticity and thus gain market share. It also has driven up costs. Operating losses are projected to widen to 1 billion yuan at the end of this year from 864 billion yuan in the first quarter, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The number of shares borrowed to sell JD.com short rose to 63.8 million last week, the most since the company’s 2014 initial public offering. “It’s more Wal-Mart’s attempt to increase their exposure to the Chinese retail sector than JD.com’s attempt to beat the main competitor,” Michelle Ma, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said by phone from Hong Kong. “Alibaba has a stronger overall online platform, in terms of user traffic, engagement, the brand name and the breadth of the product offering.” Jialong Shi, an analyst at Nomura who rates the stock a buy, said the collaboration with Wal-Mart should help the company gain an advantage in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, such as home appliances, soft drinks and processed foods. “For consumers online, you have a great partner to be able to do online to offline shopping with,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, which runs an exchange-traded fund investing in Chinese internet companies. “A partnership with a widely-known brand for Chinese consumers will have a big additive effect.” Twenty-five analysts covering JD.com rate it a buy, while 10 recommend holding the stock and one says sell, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While JD.com has been broadening its offerings, it still generates more than half its revenue from electronics and home appliances. A sharp slowdown in smartphone and PC sales puts the company at a disadvantage to Alibaba, which has a broader product line and a stronger customer base, according to Henry Guo, an analyst at M Science LLC. “For JD.com, there is a lot of work ahead to increase its market share in the e-commerce industry,” Guo, who has covered U.S.-listed Chinese stocks for a decade, said by phone. “The cooperation with Wal-Mart is unlikely to bring a quick and easy result.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds How Walmart plans to transform how we shop for food Sunday Oct 9, 2016 at 2:00 AM Oct 9, 2016 at 2:39 PM Sarah HalzackThe Washington Post FRANKLIN, Tennessee — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries.  But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America's largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school — and hardest to replicate — asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. The service has not yet made its debut in Erie or Crawford counties. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. "I physically have no room in the cart," said Brummel, 33. "It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over." Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. "They've historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon.  Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. Shopping teams At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they're selecting for customers. There's a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is "the trust fall," the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it's because "I like to select fresh products for myself," according to research by Morgan Stanley. Thousands of items In Wal-Mart's version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store's grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It's a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer's front door and have it stay fresh?  "That is the opportunity. They're redeploying an asset they already have," said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it's extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. "The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves," said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. "I have two little ones in the back," said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. "To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour."

(Sarah Halzack/The Washington Post) Published October 09. 2016 10:17AM  By Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post Franklin, Tenn. — On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this.

It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year.

And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders.

Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. In Wal-Mart’s version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items.

Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain — it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said.             Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed. Comment threads are monitored for 48 hours after publication and then closed.

Published Oct 8th, 2016 1:40 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas 2016 may be one of the most volatile in the past decade for investors. In a near-zero percent interest rate climate, investors are chasing yield in the equity market, which helped feed the bulls. But at the same time, recessions across Europe, slowing in China, deflation in oil and stronger U.S. dollar has financial markets on edge day-in and day-out. Many consumers have their retirement accounts invested in mutual funds, which had mostly had a rotten year until a rebound in the third quarter. Earlier this year Goldman Sachs reported just 16% of large-cap mutual funds had outperformed the basic market benchmarks in 2016. The investment firm said the 16% rate was approaching historically bad levels of performance. More recently Goldman said about 60% of mutual funds had beaten benchmarks in the third quarter. There are 7,671 mutual funds, including 4,783 which invest in stocks. There were more than $13.6 trillion invested equity-based mutual funds during the third quarter. BENCHMARKS Looking at the broad indices of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ gains have been made, lost and mostly recouped as the third quarter ended on Sept. 30. The S&P 500 opened the year at 2012.66, when markets closed on Friday (Sept. 30) the index stood at 2168.20, a gain of 7.72%. For the third quarter the S&P 500 gained 3.1%, below a 9.25% return for the NASDAQ over the same quarter. Seven of the 17 Arkansas-based stocks outperformed the NASDAQ results in the third quarter – P.A.M. Transport, ArcBest, America’s Car-Mart, Simmons First National Bank, Tyson Foods, Acxiom and Windstream Holdings. About 41% of the Arkansas-based companies beat the NASDAQ benchmark in the third quarter. Home Bancshares and Bank of the Ozarks beat the S&P benchmark in the third quarter, but didn’t quite hit the 9.25% level of the NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 17,148.94 on Jan 4, and closed at 18,308.15 to end the third quarter for a nine-month gain of 6.76%. The Dow Jones Index began the third quarter at 17,949.97, rising 2% through the quarter. Wal-Mart Stores is a component of the Dow and over-performed the index for the nine-month period, but underperformed for the third quarter. • Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) Wal-Mart shares opened the year at $59.96, closing Sept. 30 at $72.12 for a nine-month growth rate of 20.28%. Third quarter results were flat for the retail giant’s stock. Shares opened the quarter at $72.31 on July 1, peaking in mid August at $75.19 before closing the quarter at $72.12. Wal-Mart will report earnings Nov. 17. Wall Street expects lower profits from a year ago at 96 cents per share on revenue growth of 1%. Wal-Mart has disclosed lower profits this year in light of the $2.7 billion it has invested in higher wages and training as well as $2 billion in e-commerce infrastructure. • Dillards (NYSE: DDS) Little-Rock-Based retailer Dillards has not had a good year. The stock opened the year at $65.74. Shares peaked in late March at $87.53 before plunging to $54.21 in mid-May. Dillard’s stock closed Sept. 30 at $63.01. Year-to-date, Dillards shareholders saw their value drop 4.15%. To start the third quarter shares opened at $60.79.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Oct 8th 2016 10:34AM Target charges about 15% more than Walmart for groceries, according to a recent price check. Business Insider compared prices on 31 identical items at Walmart and Target stores in Richmond, Virginia, to find out which store was cheaper. The total basket at Walmart cost $95.98, compared to $110.25 at Target.

Groceries Photo credit: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – A price gap existed across all food categories, from fresh produce to packaged goods. Walmart was at least 20% cheaper than Target on the following items: eggs, milk, peanut butter, meat, olive oil, grapes, pasta, quinoa, tall kitchen bags, got cheese, and pineapple. Target had cheaper prices on a few items, however, including grapefruit, coconut oil, and canola oil. The retailer offered the biggest discount over Walmart on almond butter. Target's price was $5.08 cheaper than the same brand of almond butter at Walmart. For the price check, we compared the lowest prices available for each item. We also accounted for varying package sizes in our calculations. Our findings support a recent Moody's research note declaring that "The gulf is widening between Walmart and Target," and particularly when it comes to the retailers' grocery departments. "Overall, Target's grocery business is around 15% the size of Walmart's," the Moody's analysts noted. "Target's food business is disadvantaged because, among other factors, it lacks a Supercenter format with full-line grocery stores in tandem with a full-line general merchandise store." There were some stark differences between the Target and Walmart grocery departments we visited. The most obvious difference was size: Target store's fresh produce department was a tiny fraction of the size of Walmart's and the assortment was very limited in comparison. Additionally, the Target fresh produce department featured a lot of empty shelf space that we didn't see at Walmart. At Walmart, which is the biggest grocery store in the US, the produce department was fully stocked and about the same size as the produce department in a traditional full-sized supermarket like Kroger. We also counted about 30 store employees present in Walmart's grocery section during our visit. By comparison, we counted only one store employee in Target's grocery section. Target recently announced it would be ramping up staffing in the grocery department to try and grow its food sales. But based on our visit, it has a long way to go before it catches up to Walmart.

(REUTERS/Rick Wilking) Reuters Oct 6, 2016 at 11:23 am | Print View Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday tempered its profit forecast for the next two fiscal years and said it would slow new store openings as it spends heavily on a long-term plan to transform itself into an e-commerce company. Shares of Wal-Mart, which backed this year’s earnings outlook, were down 2.3 percent in midday trading. The company said it expected online sales, which now account for about 3 percent of its total, to show a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in the second half of this year and rise even faster in the next few years. “This company over time will look like an e-commerce company,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. New e-commerce chief Marc Lore said the company was relying on its logistics and supply chain network to win in online sales. Reuters reported Wal-Mart would double its number of large warehouses in 2016 and could ship to most of the United States in one day. Wal-Mart said it expected flat earnings for the year that ends on Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenditures at about $11 billion, similar to this year. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. The company will moderate the rollout of its Neighborhood Market grocery stores, he said. Wal-Mart has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital efforts from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. The company also spent more than $3 billion to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com. Wal-Mart said it expected fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent.

How Wal-Mart plans to transform the way we buy groceries Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post 7:03 a.m. EDT October 8, 2016 April Styers, a personal shopper for the Walmart pickup program, selects fresh produce for customers' orders. Wal-Mart's aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping. (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post.) On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America's largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school - and hardest to replicate - asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. DELAWAREONLINE Ice cream, fasteners, diversity: 5 interesting gov contracts DELAWAREONLINE Study: DE Turf Sports Complex will boost Delaware economy Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. "I physically have no room in the cart," said Brummel, 33. "It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over." Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. "They've historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Ashley Green, 31, talks to a Wal-Mart personal shopper as she retrieves her online grocery-pickup order. The company will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business.  (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post) Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. "We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good," Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable's brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they're selecting for customers. There's a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is "the trust fall," the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it's because "I like to select fresh products for myself," according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn't quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. "If I'm not going to eat it," Styers said, "then I'm not going to give it to anybody else." In Wal-Mart's version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store's grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Walmart has allocated parking spaces for online grocery-pickup customers so that they may get in and out of the lot quickly. Shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from.  (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post) Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It's a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer's front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn't have to reinvent its supply chain - it is already getting these goods to its stores. "That is the opportunity. They're redeploying an asset they already have," said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it's extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. "The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves," said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. DELAWAREONLINE Cars, and gear, roll in for Delaware Auto Show DELAWAREONLINE Ellen Kullman, Fred Sears among Hall of Fame inductees The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, "being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible." At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. "I have two little ones in the back," said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. "To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour." The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren't buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. "That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers," said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. "Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I'm on my way," Mishev said.

But academic research suggests that 70 percent to 90 percent of mergers don’t succeed, owing to a wide variety of factors. Buyers overvalue the synergies they’ll derive, or they underestimate the impact of the associated costs, or they rely too heavily on assumptions about where a market is heading. Of course, another reason acquisitions don’t always go as planned is that founders often leave a year or two after their company has been gobbled up. That’s changing in today’s challenging market for exits, where a growing number of well-funded companies and their investors are hoping that if an IPO isn’t in the cards, an acquisition might be. And in addition to other changing deal terms, acquiring companies are seemingly thinking long and hard about locking up talent longer than they have in the recent past. You saw it happen when the e-commerce company Jet sold to Walmart for a whopping $3.3 billion in August. According to Recode, cofounder and CEO Marc Lore agreed to stay on with Walmart for an atypically long five years as part of the acquisition agreement. In fact, according to that same August report, if Lore leaves before the summer of 2021, he’ll forfeit a sizable amount of both cash and stock that could otherwise earn him up to an estimated $1 billion. Lore may be exceptional in many ways, including his understanding of e-commerce and how to compete specifically with Amazon, which acquired his previous company. It’s easy to understand why Walmart wants him around. He probably won’t be alone, though. Steve Fletcher, a managing director at the global investment bank GCA, notes that it’s “hard to say” whether it’s universally the case that management teams are getting locked into longer contracts with acquirers in this market. “I don’t think anyone has a large enough sample size to say that,” he notes. But he adds that of the deals he is seeing, there is a move to sign on incoming talent for a longer period, sometimes “three or four years as opposed to [the previous standard of] 18 to 24 months.” Vas Natarajan — an investor at the venture firm Accel Partners who focuses on products and services that target developers, designers and media creators — makes a similar observation. “In the last four or five years, there’s been a rash of these acquir-hires, where the founders have left after 18 to 24 months,” Natarajan says. “But I know from talking with heads of product and corp dev teams [that they are now asking], ‘How can we do it in a way that’s much more retentive than in the past?’ M&A teams are starting to think more about structuring things in a way that you retain what you buy.” How big a trend this becomes is far from clear. As a baseline, SRS Acquiom, a San Francisco-based outfit that provides M&A post-closing services to companies, says that 21 percent of the 735 private M&A transactions it saw between 2012 and 2015 featured an earn-out period of four to five years. Meanwhile, 47 percent of those deals featured earn-out periods of 1 to 2 years. Founders who are more driven to start companies than reap their full reward from an acquirer will surely leave no matter the earn-out period anyway. Still, there’s reason for corporates to believe that longer agreements make sense. In 2013, PayPal, then a division of eBay, acquired the Chicago-based payments gateway Braintree in an all-cash deal worth $800 million. As part of that deal, the incentives of Braintree CEO Bill Ready were structured over a long period of time. In retrospect, that decision looks to be paying off for Ready and PayPal — which spun off into its own public company last year. As of September of last year, Ready was already running all product and engineering at PayPal. Just this week, he became the first person since it became an independent concern to be named to the role of chief operating officer. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Slice is an app that's all about pizza VIDEO | 1:08 Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election 11 hours ago | Lora Kolodny How Facebook can escape the echo chamber 15 hours ago | Anna Escher Secret is coming back yesterday | Sarah Buhr I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back yesterday | Matthew Panzarino Latest From TechCrunch WTF is computer vision? 3 hours ago | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Is Netflix Disney’s next big buy and is Reed Hastings its next CEO? 3 hours ago | Peter Csathy Naver to launch $43M fund to seek out investments for its Snow and Webtoon services 4 hours ago | Jon Russell How President Trump could abuse big data and the surveillance state 4 hours ago | Jon Stokes Comment moderation powered by Up Next Toppling democracy one byte at a time Posted Oct 6, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Developer Events Content Manager (Contract Role) at Google (Mountain View, CA, United States) Director of Marketing and Communications (Position #4782) at Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL, United States) Digital Marketing Analyst at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, United States) Advanced TV Product Manager - Media at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (New York, NY, United States) Technical Product Manager @ PANTHEON at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Wal-Mart told investors Thursday it would pull back on the number of new stores it was opening and instead invest some of that money into online operations. It's a key milestone: For the first time, the company expects e-commerce gains to contribute more toward its growth than expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. Analysts and investors are skeptical that Wal-Mart can pull it off. Consumers are rapidly getting ingrained in the habit of turning to Amazon for everything from toilet paper to a new dress. Among U.S. online consumers, 55 percent say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product and about half of American households have a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. U.S. shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com's website, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I get that you have to be in e-commerce, but you are chasing the 800-pound gorilla," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. "You aren't going to out-Amazon Amazon." Yarbrough worries that Wal-Mart's growth online will mostly be coming from its existing customers -- and as a result will cannibalize its stores, which are more profitable and where customers are more likely to make an impulse buy. At the same time, Amazon has been increasing its reach into Wal-Mart's customer base. Forty-two percent of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20 percent in 2013, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. And there are no signs Amazon is slowing down. It is set to add 12 million Prime members this year, on top of the 10 million it added in 2015, Blackledge estimates. With at least 17 times as many items for sale as Walmart.com, Amazon is increasingly expanding its reach into areas once dominated by traditional retailers. This year, Amazon is set to sell more apparel than Wal-Mart, and by 2018 it will be the second-largest seller of consumables, such as cleaning suppliers, paper towels and diapers, Blackledge said. Then there is Amazon's ever-increasing delivery speed. While Wal-Mart is in the early stages of offering a membership program where customers can get free two-day shipping -- rather than waiting the standard five to seven days -- Amazon is offering free same-day delivery in 27 major cities. In some markets, the e-commerce company delivers millions of products within an hour. "To compete, Wal-Mart would have to replicate the value proposition of Prime," Blackledge said. "If they could do that at scale, then they would have something, but Amazon has been singularly focused at this for 20 years." None of that should be news to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. He knows the company has a lofty goal in front of it, but since paying about $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com, McMillon seemed to have a bit more spring in his step when talking to investors about the company's online strategy. "A lot of the foundational elements that we've been telling you for years that we needed to grow the e-commerce business are now in place," McMillon said. "It's time to invest more money. It's time to really get this going and start growing our e-commerce business in a different way." That new way will be led by tech-industry darling Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Wal-Mart following the acquisition. McMillon sees him as key to the company's future. The CEO half-jokingly recalled walking down the street with Lore and instinctively stepping out in front of an oncoming car to protect him. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, great things are going to happen," McMillon said. Wal-Mart expects online sales to grow 20 percent to 30 percent over the next three years with the addition of Jet. That would be a major acceleration: Online sales grew 7 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the second. But even 20 percent growth on a base of about $13 billion does little to move the needle at a company with nearly $500 billion in annual revenue. In the meantime, the investments are taking a toll on Wal-Mart's bottom line. The company said profit would be flat next year in part because of the heavy spending online. Wal-Mart shares fell 3.2 percent Thursday when the retailer's executives made their case to investors, and the stock was down an additional 1.2 percent on Friday. The question is whether Wal-Mart can change the shopping behavior of the tens of millions of Americans already entrenched in Amazon. Is Wal-Mart the retail equivalent of Microsoft's Bing, which tried and failed to convince Americans to break their habit of going to Google? Or can Wal-Mart -- with Jet.com -- be a disruptive force in the industry? "If someone is locked into Prime, the chance of you bringing their business over is slim," Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart's main selling point has been its physical stores, which let shoppers buy items online and pick them up on the premises. That includes having employees deliver groceries to customers' cars in the parking lot. Wal-Mart also can use its stores as a shipping point, helping it lower delivery costs. » Next page...

The WWE-style hardcore scuffle also featured foreign objects such as canned food and a shopping cart. A wardrobe malfunction also occurred. See partially NSFW footage which was originally posted to Facebook embedded below. Bottled water seems to be one of the first items that shoppers buy under the stressful circumstances of an impending natural disaster, leaving stores throughout Florida with empty or near-empty shelves. “The two woman yank on each others hair, scream and punch. At one point, one woman rams another woman with her shopping cart so hard, the victim’s breasts fell out of her dress.In response, she started hurling cans of food at the other woman,” the Miami Herald reported. Although the South Florida fight was supposedly over the last case of bottled water in the store, it may actually have been prompted by someone cutting in line, the Herald added. Fortunately there were no injuries, and evidently it was determined that it was unnecessary to summon cops to the scene. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U8Ax5Tol1c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> With all the media coverage of the hurricane, plus the many warnings from government officials, this type of panic buying may be understandable in general, BizPacReview noted. “The two women, one clearly with a size and power advantage, began mixing it up over the water as shocked onlookers gathered around them…It is unclear who threw the first punch, but clearly the taller woman is getting the best of the one in the print dress. The the scrappy smaller woman refuses to be put off and repeatedly jumps back into the fray even when the bigger woman walks away two times. The video is a shocking example of the high anxiety people were feeling as Hurricane Matthew was bearing down on them.” According to Reuters, Walmart decided to temporarily close a number of its Florida retail outlets ahead of the storm. “A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes.” Hurricane Matthew has weakened from a Category 4 to a Category 2 storm at this time as it moves up the coast of northeast Florida and heads for Georgia and South Carolina, ABC News reported. About 1 million Florida residents have lost power, and three deaths have been reported in the state so far. Hundreds have tragically died in Haiti and in the Caribbean as a result of Hurricane Matthew.

Cops apparently weren’t going to do anything until a social media post by a witness went viral. In July, a 30-person brawl that included parents and kids broke out at Walmart, according to authorities, and was captured on cell phone video. The incident occurred at a store in Gates, New York, located in the Rochester area. Apparently, the massive melee started when two teens allegedly ridiculed a dress worn by a 24-year-old woman in the store, and then things escalated into a WWE-style rumble. About a year ago, a co-ed punching-and-kicking melee erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, when two Walmart loss prevention officers (i.e. store security) reportedly tried to stop a teen from shoplifting a $7 T-shirt, and others jumped in. Walmart is usually one of the venues where brawls between and among bargain hunters unfortunately erupt on the day after Thanksgiving.

Can it avoid the fate of Wal-Mart Express? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 7, 2016 at 7:08PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  With a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com growing faster than ever, Target (NYSE:TGT) is getting squeezed in the middle. Comparable sales turned negative in its most recent quarter, falling 1.1%, reflecting a trend throughout retail as department store chains struggle across the board.  E-commerce sales growth is also losing steam. Though digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, that was down from 23% in the previous quarter, and, more importantly, the company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year. It now sees comps from flat to down 2% in the third and fourth quarters, which includes the key holiday season.   Thinking small The discount retailer is turning to a familiar strategy to stem sliding sales. It's looking to open smaller-footprint locations in densely packed cities and college towns. Other retailers, including Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Macy's, and Wal-Mart, have looked to smaller stores to expand their footprint and beef up sales. Target is opening up a slate of smaller stores in big cities and college towns in order to cater to the millennials that make up one of its core constituencies. This week it opened a 45,000 square-foot store in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, about a third of the size of the average Target. Near the University of Minnesota campus, a store 15% the size of a regular Target stocks items intended for college students like mini ironing boards and twin sheets. CEO Brian Cornell told The Wall Street Journal, "We could see hundreds of these. It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time."  In many ways, the small-footprint strategy fits well with Cornell's emphasis on signature categories, including health and wellness, baby and kids, stylish apparel and home goods. Those are all categories that millennials care about, and as young people have flocked to cities it makes sense for Target to follow them. Currently, those customers are driving Amazon's growth, as no major brick-and-mortar chain has made a play for them.  Avoiding Wal-Mart's fate At the beginning of the year, Wal-Mart announced it would shut down all 102 of its Walmart Express stores, a small-footprint concept scattered across the rural south, just a few years after launching the miniaturized chain. The Express stores faced several challenges. Wal-Mart struggled to get the product mix right, as operating small stores entails more than simply shrinking the Supercenters. It also opened many of them near existing Wal-Marts, obviating much of the need for a smaller version.   But Target's more upscale brand should give it an advantage, as should its focus on cities and college towns, places where shoppers may not have cars and therefore need convenient options close to home. Many of those cities are also devoid of Wal-Mart, as the retail giant has found it difficult to penetrate many of the nation's largest cities and is still without a store in New York. Instead of imitating Wal-Mart, Target may be better off following the lead of drugstores chain like Walgreen's and CVS, its new pharmacy partner, as that category has seen steady growth, with sales at health and personal care stores up 7.7% this year according to the Census Bureau. Sales at those stores have not only benefited from their selling more prescriptions, but they have also stocked more groceries, and consumers have turned to them for convenient "fill-in" trips. Target has to do more than just be a drugstore to make the small-store experiment work, but with its "cheap chic" brand it should be able to find the right mix between its signature categories and everyday staples like groceries and household items. While small stores could provide a valuable new revenue stream, it won't flip Target's sales slide overnight, as the company's most pressing problem is reinvigorating performance at 1,800 big-box stores. Grocery sales have been a problem, as the company has seen more spoilage than its competitors, and accelerating e-commerce growth would also be a promising sign. Still, with comparable sales headed negative for the rest of the year, the retailer could use some good news in the form of successful small stores to tout to investors.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year – still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) – World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials “see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few.” Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) – Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) – The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 percent from a year ago. Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 percent WASHINGTON (AP) – Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The popular 15-year fixed-rate mortgage stayed at 2.72 percent. US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) – A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) – Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug’s maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government’s complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) – The United Nations’ aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines’ carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) – Norway says it plans to spend $28 billion of its oil fund – the largest in the world – to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the country’s GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 percent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund.

Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) – Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centers and lay off more than 40 percent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years. Theranos is appealing the ban, which stems from an investigation of the California facility. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.53 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,268.50.

   Main Contact us hitechchronicle.com Navigation Business Culture Technology Science Sport Worldwide Medicine National Technology Chromecast Ultra is still value for money despite the twofold price increase Oct 09 2016 After weeks of rumors and leaks about its specs and appearance, Google's new Chromecast Ultra has finally gotten its reveal, and right on the date suggested. Google Home is set to arrive in stores in November and is now up for pre-orders at $129 via the Google Store, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. At a press event today, Google introduced a higher-end Chromecast video streaming device, adding 4K and HDR support to the offering. A Wi-Fi router will pretty much do the job decently, but keep in mind that Chromecast Ultra boasts 4K video streaming, a much heavier stream than Full HD. The new Chromecast Ultra generation of devices will be able to stream 4k content - which is the latest available resolution on the market - from media services such as Netflix, Vudu, and Youtube. That makes it a really important device in the bigger picture of Google's aspirations. The new Chromecast is 1.8 times faster than the 1080P model, it includes better WiFi connectivity and there is an ethernet port in the power adapter if you need a wired connection to stream your 4K content. Interestingly, Google Chromecast Ultra is nearly twice as fast at streaming content compared to the company's first generation Chromecast. Unlike Google, however, the company's newest devices only support the HDR10 format, and the same goes for Nvidia's Shield TV, Microsoft new Xbox One S, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 Pro and the recent PS4 firmware update. The leading name in this segment of 4K-capable products is Google's very own Chromecast. Google has announced that Google Play Movies will stream 4K content from November. Users can still mirror content to their TV from their Android smartphone or from their laptop's Chrome browser. This new device allows premium media streaming if you're willing to pay a little extra. Every since the Chromecast was released, it's been hailed as a good device because of its pricing and its features. Chance are that if you use a 4K tv, then your internet connection would also be top-speed. Instead of casting a Spotify playlist from the app on your iPhone (which drains your phone's battery) you can instead say "OK Google, play Beyoncé on my Chromecast", and let Google's Assistant do the rest.

(Photo: Getty Images) A sample of opinions from readers about the presidential election: The simplest way to have a debate where each candidate gets a fair and equal chance to answer a question and make their point is to only have one microphone functioning at a time. The moderator asks one person a question and then only that person has a working microphone for two minutes then it stops working. Same for the next person. This stops the childish and aggravating interruptions of the other debater and listeners get to hear an understandable answer. This also gives equal time to each person and lets the moderator do their job without being a referee. Tom Tallon Wyandotte The time has come for Donald Trump to resign his candidacy for President of the United States. The latest example, caught in a 2005 excerpt from “Access Hollywood,” which he describes as “locker room banter,” clearly demonstrates his lack of respect for women and the institution of marriage. With Trump at the helm, our country’s stature as leader of the free world would suffer irreparable harm. The leadership of the Republican Party has to take quick and decisive action to stave off the total destruction of the GOP. David Levy Farmington Hills It boggles my mind how some of the folks in Creston, Iowa, seem to be blaming Washington/Obama/Democrats for the fading away of their downtown businesses. Really? They haven’t figured out that it’s the Walmart Supercenter on the southwest edge of Creston that caused it? This has happened in hundreds of small towns across our country, and somehow, Democrats are to blame. Perhaps if Creston area residents had fought to keep Walmart out, their downtown might still be thriving. How can they possibly believe that “businessman” Donald Trump will be their savior? Larry A. Peplin Grosse Pointe Park A recent Free Press editorial goes on about Trump not paying taxes. The Democratic candidate is yelling about him not “paying his fair share.” How do you anti-Trumpers define “Paying my fair share?” I think it is most adequately defined by the United States code. When have you heard of someone paying more taxes than their returns require? Is there a checkbox to pay more? Why don’t you editorialize about the Clinton Foundation? Dave Yezback Northville Much talk and debate between presidential contenders Trump and Clinton regarding the cost of higher education and resultant debt. The discussion caused me to break into a cold sweat. I’m a grandpa of three, ages 12, 10, and 8. If they all attend the University of Michigan and graduate in four years, and assuming cost increases of 5% per year, all three will incur almost $500,000 of higher education debt. That’s a half a million dollars, folks! While the grandkids and their parents will incur most of this debt this will certainly cause my wife and I (and similarly situated baby boomers) to reevaluate not only our current life style but our retirement plans as well.

Turns out Trump has quite the paper trail. Audio clip after clip after video footage after quote have surfaced painting the presidential hopeful to be even more reprehensible than we thought he was. A shining example is the way he talked about his wife, Melania, when she was pregnant with their now 10-year-old son, Barron. The disparaging remarks come courtesy of a Howard Stern Show appearance from Dec. 2005. Proving he probably doesn’t fuck as much as he claims and that he has literally no knowledge of how pregnancy works, the Donald told Howard Stern that it’s common knowledge that women turn into bloated monsters as soon as they’re knocked up. “You know, they just blow up, right? Like a blimp,” Trump explains. “In the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster.” Thank god Melania’s weight was distributed in an aesthetically pleasing manner for the Donald. It certainly makes no difference whether she or her child are healthy, so long as Trump can still pop a boner to the thought of his engorged wife. Not that it matters. Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” comments were made just eight months after he’d married Melania. His sexist slams against his wife occurred three months after that. For those of you playing along at home, Donald Trump tried to fuck a married woman while also being married, explicitly stated he couldn’t control himself when it comes to sexual assault, and called his pregnant wife a monster—and that’s in 2005 alone. Imagine the other terrible shit he’s said between then and… oh, wait. You don’t have to because the flood gates have opened and we’re drowning in the cess pool that is Donald Trump. Our national nightmare has only gotten worse.

Bloomberg Wal-Mart Stores's increasing reliance on e-commerce to fuel sales comes at a time when Amazon.com is tightening its grip on the American consumer, making it a risky gambit.   Wal-Mart told investors Thursday it would pull back on the number of new stores it was opening and instead invest some of that money into online operations. It's a key milestone: For the first time, the company expects e-commerce gains to contribute more toward its growth than expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. Analysts and investors are skeptical that Wal-Mart can pull it off. Consumers are rapidly getting ingrained in the habit of turning to Amazon for everything from toilet paper to a new dress. Among U.S. online consumers, 55 percent say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product and about half of American households have a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. U.S. shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com's website, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. "I get that you have to be in e-commerce, but you are chasing the 800-pound gorilla," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. "You aren't going to out-Amazon Amazon." Yarbrough worries that Wal-Mart's growth online will mostly be coming from its existing customers -- and as a result will cannibalize its stores, which are more profitable and where customers are more likely to make an impulse buy. At the same time, Amazon has been increasing its reach into Wal-Mart's customer base. Forty-two percent of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20 percent in 2013, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. And there are no signs Amazon is slowing down. It is set to add 12 million Prime members this year, on top of the 10 million it added in 2015, Blackledge estimates. With at least 17 times as many items for sale as Walmart.com, Amazon is increasingly expanding its reach into areas once dominated by traditional retailers. This year, Amazon is set to sell more apparel than Wal-Mart, and by 2018 it will be the second-largest seller of consumables, such as cleaning suppliers, paper towels and diapers, Blackledge said. Then there is Amazon's ever-increasing delivery speed. While Wal-Mart is in the early stages of offering a membership program where customers can get free two-day shipping -- rather than waiting the standard five to seven days -- Amazon is offering free same-day delivery in 27 major cities. In some markets, the e-commerce company delivers millions of products within an hour. "To compete, Wal-Mart would have to replicate the value proposition of Prime," Blackledge said. "If they could do that at scale, then they would have something, but Amazon has been singularly focused at this for 20 years." None of that should be news to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. He knows the company has a lofty goal in front of it, but since paying about $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com, McMillon seemed to have a bit more spring in his step when talking to investors about the company's online strategy. "A lot of the foundational elements that we've been telling you for years that we needed to grow the e-commerce business are now in place," McMillon said. "It's time to invest more money. It's time to really get this going and start growing our e-commerce business in a different way." That new way will be led by tech-industry darling Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Wal-Mart following the acquisition. McMillon sees him as key to the company's future. The CEO half-jokingly recalled walking down the street with Lore and instinctively stepping out in front of an oncoming car to protect him. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, great things are going to happen," McMillon said. Wal-Mart expects online sales to grow 20 percent to 30 percent over the next three years with the addition of Jet. That would be a major acceleration: Online sales grew 7 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the second. But even 20 percent growth on a base of about $13 billion does little to move the needle at a company with nearly $500 billion in annual revenue. In the meantime, the investments are taking a toll on Wal-Mart's bottom line. The company said profit would be flat next year in part because of the heavy spending online. Wal-Mart shares fell 3.2 percent Thursday when the retailer's executives made their case to investors, and the stock was down an additional 1.2 percent on Friday. The question is whether Wal-Mart can change the shopping behavior of the tens of millions of Americans already entrenched in Amazon. Is Wal-Mart the retail equivalent of Microsoft's Bing, which tried and failed to convince Americans to break their habit of going to Google? Or can Wal-Mart -- with Jet.com -- be a disruptive force in the industry? "If someone is locked into Prime, the chance of you bringing their business over is slim," Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart's main selling point has been its physical stores, which let shoppers buy items online and pick them up on the premises. That includes having employees deliver groceries to customers' cars in the parking lot. Wal-Mart also can use its stores as a shipping point, helping it lower delivery costs. Jet.com may help give it an advantage on price. The startup has developed a system where customers pay less if they are ordering items from the same location or if they opt out of services, like the option to return the item. Lore also said using store pickup could help cut shipping costs. But adapting to the internet isn't really a choice -- it's an imperative. And that's something Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton would recognize, McMillon said on Thursday. "The Internet and technology are changing the world, they are changing industries, and they're changing retail," he said. "Sometimes people ask me what would Sam think about what Wal-Mart is going today, and I don't know. But the one thing I know for sure is we would be changing and we'd be changing quickly." <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 블룸버그 다른기사 보기 이메일 웹출판 :   2016-10-09 06:36   김동균 기자 입력.편집 :   2016-10-09 06:35   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 2017년 부동산시장이 궁금하다 플랜트건설노조 울산지부, 임단협 잠정합의…조합원 시큰둥 투쟁 강도 대비 임금인상폭 적어…집행부 불신임 고조 현대청운고, ‘現重 임직원 자녀 전형’ 폐지 [제728회 로또 당첨번호] 3 6 10 30 34 37 + 36 양산시의회, 집행부에 중학생 학교급식비 증액 촉구 2017년 부동산시장이 궁금하다 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

TrendsViral Juan Martinez and his wife Guadalupe Martinez were 73 and 69, respectively, when they were both arrested at their local Wal-Mart on October 3, 2014, in an incident which escalated to a physical altercation with a local officer. The incident was filmed on the cop’s bodycam. The couple, who both use mobility scooters, were shopping at the Old San Antonio Road store when they became separated, and the woman exited the store with unpurchased items still in her scooter’s basket. Wal-Mart security then detained her on suspicion of shoplifting, leading her into an office for questioning. The newly released bodycam footage shows Buda police officer Demerriel Young ask Juan to leave the office while his wife is being questioned. However, he refused, saying: "No sir, I'm not going to do that." “I've done nothing wrong,” he added. “Okay either you're gonna step outside or I'm going to place you outside or I'm going to place you under arrest for interfering," Young warned, to which Juan replied: “Go ahead.” The video shows Young proceed to place his hands on the older man, who falls to the ground and lies there, apparently screaming in pain. Young then stops Guadalupe from helping her prone husband and she accuses the officer of pushing him. "Have a seat, ma'am. I did not do anything," says Young. "You pushed him," she responds. Guadalupe was subsequently charged with theft while Juan was charged with interfering with the duties of a public servant. They are both reportedly due in court on October 17.

News • Obituaries • Sports • Arts & Living • Opinion • Contact • e-Edition • Classifieds Funny, thankful Tracy Morgan entertains casino crowd Most Read Recent Comments Many local voters flipped for Trump DATABASE: Luzerne County Real Estate Strike will close Dallas schools tomorrow Hospital shopping can pay off Man struck by van in Wilkes-Barre Obituaries By Patrick Abdalla / Published: October 8, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     PLAINS TWP. — Tracy Morgan saw the light. He said he ran from it, thinking it was the police. The Emmy-nominated star didn’t shy away from talking about his 2014 crash during a set at Mohegan Sun Pocono on Friday night. The audience didn’t mind hearing about it through Morgan’s colorful and outrageous language. Morgan was nearly killed in 2014 when a Wal-Mart truck struck the vehicle he was riding in. He said every bone in his face had been broken, his femur had been pulverized. The six vehicle crash killed one of Morgan’s friends, James McNair. “After that settlement, the prices went up a penny,” he said. While he made light of the crash, he also impressed on the crowd how tragic it was. He pointed out how thankful he was for his family, even though many of the members were the butts of several of his funniest jokes. He also said how thankful he was for the doctors, who put him back together. “It could have been worse,” Morgan said. “It could have been Bob’s Discount Furniture Truck.” “When I was in that wheelchair, I still shopped at Wal-Mart,” he added. Morgan first caught the nation’s eye with his energetic and brash performances as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live” from 1996 to 2003. He gained more fans when he moved to primetime in a starring role as the chaotic, impetuous and childlike Tracy Jordan in “30 Rock” opposite Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. His character once told a booing audience, “Your boos are not scaring me. I know most of you are not ghosts.” During his act on Friday, he joked that he met several people during his short stay in heaven, like Biggie Smalls and Elvis. “Michael Jackson told me what really happened,” Jordan said, claiming Jackson died during the filming of a Pepsi commercial and was replaced by a stand-in. Morgan’s show, which couldn’t be completely reviewed because of deadline constraints, included openers Marc Theobald and Tracey Ashley. Audience members had to have their phones placed in locked pouches during the show. Theobald referenced the procedure saying it kept people from videotaping the whole show. “Some of ya’all are going through cellphone withdrawal,” he joked. But the star of the night was Morgan, who seemed touched by the loud applause he got when he took the stage. He waved his right arm in circles and smiled at the crowd. Midway through his set, he talked about how his grandmother, who had marched in the Civil Rights movement, told him he had to do something with his second chance. He told the crowd she wanted him to get his GED. Judging by the smiles and laughter he caused Friday, he was doing something right. pabdalla@citizensvoice.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Satellite technology tells us exactly how well a business performs Retailers suffer week from hell JCPenney, taking a page from Walmart, Home Depot and other big-box retailers, has started stationing greeters at the entrances of stores, The Post has learned. Penney’s greeters are already full-time employees who are being redeployed to front-of-the-store duty for just two hours of their shift, according to one employee who is serving in such a capacity. The use of greeters is said to be a test and is being deployed just in the Northeast region, the employees said. It rolled out this past summer. The greeters at Walmart and Home Depot are full-time jobs and are used throughout the day. The Penney greeters will be on duty from noon to 2 p.m., the employee said. The retailer, in a memo to employees explaining the new duty, called the time spent as greeters as “power hours.” “We don’t know why it’s from 12 to 2, but we were told it would increase sales,” said the employee, adding that management is also focused on increasing the number of customers who open JCPenney credit-card accounts. The “power hours” are not sitting well with some staffers who, the employee said, feel they come at the price of longer lines at cash registers. “Even the crew that unloads merchandise from trucks had to be on the floor greeting,” the employee said. A check on Friday showed that not every Penney store had greeters. At the Manhattan Mall store, only security guards were manning the entrances — though they greeted customers as well. JCPenney did not return a call for comment.

Seems like we’re easy to stereotype.” In exchange for Oliver’s insights, I agree to be e-introduced to her friend, Daniel Justus, who would show me another side of things. “Not everyone in Buchanan is going to hell,” she says. “Some people are making something of their lives.” I quickly forget about our deal as Oliver tells me about her travails. But that evening, an email arrives from Daniel. He calls himself “the boy who escaped”. It piques my interest. What, I wonder, was Daniel escaping from? The drive to Daniel’s family home takes me across rugged mountains, through mist-shrouded valleys and past churches. Lots of churches. I counted about one a mile. A few hundred yards from Daniel’s valley, there is a Church of Jesus Christ with a large billboard you cannot miss. “When life gives you more than you can stand, just kneel,” it says. Daniel clearly wasn’t paying attention. Since childhood he has been kicking against the fate that everybody around him--barring his mother, Karen--seemed to have preordained. When Daniel was in eighth grade (aged 14), he argued in front of the school board for his right to be taught extracurricular courses that would let him apply to college. The school principal had repeatedly turned him down. He won. “Nobody could understand why I would want to do that,” he says. “I convinced them it was my right.” Then he insisted on learning Spanish, even though there was just one qualified teacher in the county. They set up interactive television classes so he could learn remotely. He is now a Spanish interpreter for the state of Virginia. Then he wanted to learn Chinese. Today he speaks and writes fluent Mandarin. Last summer, he spent three months working for a Chinese law firm in Shanghai, dealing in intellectual property rights. Last weekend, he graduated with distinction from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Next stop is a postgraduate degree at an Ivy League university or Oxford. “I’m still thinking about where to apply,” he says. Most of Daniel’s peers from high school found jobs at the hulking local Walmart, telemarketing from home or as welders on construction sites. One or two found work in the coalfields, or what is left of them. Others have fallen prey to the heroin epidemic. Many of the girls, including Oliver, got pregnant in their teens. “I knew one girl who got pregnant at 14,” says Daniel, now 22. Like most others I saw in Buchanan, he has good teeth, though he has purged all trace of his Appalachian accent. To put it mildly, he has defied the odds. Daniel was also the first person I met in Buchanan County who had not voted for Trump. In November, he will vote for Clinton--though without much enthusiasm. “Trump is just another drug,” Daniel says. “People round here are addicted to escapism.” The first thing that strikes you about Daniel’s home is its serenity. From the covered porch with its lazy ceiling fans, you gaze up verdant slopes to wooded hilltops. In the garden, there is a weeping willow and cherry trees. As dusk falls, the air comes alive with the sound of tree frogs and cicadas. You can hear the occasional braying of the family donkey, Jackson. The second thing that strikes you is the garish cliff-face carving of the Confederate flag on the other side of their narrow valley. It overlooks the large, floodlit football field of Hurley High School, whose principal Daniel outfoxed when he was a student. The Hurley Rebels team colour is the old Confederate flag. “Heritage not hate,” is what the flag’s apologists say it represents. To Daniel the slave state flag evokes something more visceral--a culture that prizes sport to the exclusion of all else. It is not just the school. In place of petrol prices, the signs outside the local gas stations proclaim, “Good luck Rebels!” When the team win, it makes the front page of The Mountaineer, the county’s main newspaper, next to stories about suicides, local beauty pageants and elk poaching. “Faith, Family, Football,” says a banner in the school’s main hallway. “We bleed red and blue,” says another. The sign outside the girls’ bathroom reads, “Lady Rebels”. The only other school banner I could see said: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The school has no science laboratory. Its library consists of two half-empty rows of shelves. A few months ago, Hurley High tipped most of its library’s contents into a nearby dumpster. “I found Oliver Twist in there,” says Joshua, Daniel’s middle brother. The family salvaged a bookshelf’s worth of discarded titles. Daniel is not just an exception in Buchanan County. I am tempted to think of him as the canary in the coal mine--except this one managed to fly to its freedom. His mother Karen, a chain-smoking force of nature, puts his success down to being strangely different. “When he was 18 months old he knew his alphabet backwards,” she says. “He still doesn’t have a clue how to change the engine oil.” When Daniel’s father, Danny Justus, a coal salesman and Baptist preacher, and his two younger brothers went deer hunting, Daniel would tag along with a book. While the others stalked deer with their rifles and crossbows, Daniel would sit under a tree reading. He refused to eat the venison. The book that influenced him most was Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage. It tells the life of a clubfoot boy who could never fit in. Karen knew this about her son and nurtured it. When Daniel felt down and ostracised, she would egg him on. “I told him, ‘Buchanan isn’t even a piece of the jigsaw--it’s barely a speck on a piece of the jigsaw in that large world out there,’” she says. “None of this will matter if you escape.” When the Rebels won a game, the principal would broadcast it triumphantly over the public address system. If Daniel won a spelling bee contest, or a debate competition--as he did on every occasion — it would pass unmentioned. Karen would head down to the principal’s office and demand that his feat be broadcast. Anyone who meets Karen, a robust woman with a mischievous glint in her eyes, would think twice about taking her on. “Think about that,” Karen says, waving a smouldering Marlboro Light: The teachers didn’t care if you could spell or argue. They think too much ‘learnin’ is bad for you. That’s the teachers! Can you imagine what everyone else thinks? Her words reminded me of Trump’s praise for the kids who don’t turn out like Daniel. “I love the poorly educated,” he said. The other trait that separated Daniel from others was his dislike of coal. In Buchanan County, that is tantamount to atheism. Many in his family had fallen victim to the hazards of working underground--the dreaded black lung disease, the sleep apnea, split tendons, slipped discs and orthopaedic ailments that come from a half-bent myopic existence in the dust-ridden bowels of Appalachia. Others, including relatives of Daniel, have fallen prey to the prescription drug culture that supposedly exists to ease their pain. One close relative, whom Karen asked me not to name, was caught distributing pills. Tamara Neo, the attorney who co-chairs Trump’s regional campaign, put him away for 10 years. “Neo was ruthless with poorer addicts who couldn’t afford lawyers,” says Karen. “There was no forgiveness.” The closest Daniel came to a fight at school was when he argued the benefits of renewable energy. A football jock wanted to punch him. Parents demanded that a sympathetic teacher be disciplined for making a case against coal. What angers Daniel is that his people are clinging to a way of life that has crippled them--often literally. “It’s as if they have Stockholm syndrome [where a prisoner falls in love with his captor],” he says. Dana Oliver, Daniel’s school friend who introduced us, puts it another way. In the absence of coal, half the county now subsists on federal handouts--Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security disability payments and other “entitlements”. Alone in the Republican field, Trump vowed to protect them. Whatever else you can say about the New York property magnate, he knows his market. Call it big-government conservatism for white people. Says Oliver: Coal is not coming back--it costs too much to open a flooded mine. In their heart of hearts, most people know that. Trump just gives them a little bit of hope. But there is another way of looking at Trump’s wild popularity in the region. Before the start of each shift, a preacher calls for God’s blessing on the miners. In this part of the world, the church is almost as ubiquitous underground as it is above. In the wake of the mine closures have come bad habits. People sell food stamps for opioid pills, says Oliver. Church attendance has fallen. God is missing in action. “If you think about it, what Donald Trump wants to do is bring God back into their lives,” she says. “That’s the way a lot of people see it.” Tamara Neo, Trump’s main cheerleader for the region, certainly sees it that way. Every morning she puts her three children into her Range Rover for the 45-minute drive to a private Christian school across the state border in West Virginia. There is too much godlessness in today’s public schools, she believes. As we drive, Tamara tests her children on the Bible. “John 1, verses 16-18,” she barks into her iPhone’s Siri app. The verses appear on screen. “Now say the verse, Axella,” she says to her daughter, who’s in fifth grade. Axella stumbles over it then yawns. “Again,” says Tamara, until she gets it right. She moves on to Io, her eldest: “Exodus 20, Verse 12,” she says. “Go Io.” Next comes Flux. Then she makes them recite Lincoln’s Gettysburg address--all 278 words of it. She does not stop until they get it right. With children called Io, Axella and Flux, Tamara betrays her western origins. People in Virginia are conservative with names. Tamara and her husband Flux, also a lawyer, moved here from Colorado 10 years ago because they loved the beauty of the Great Smokies. She ran as commonwealth attorney for Buchanan County--an elected position as chief prosecutor for the area. She lost her re-election in 2010 but not before putting scores of people away for prescription drug-dealing. “In a close-knit community like this, a prosecutor quickly prosecutes herself out of a job,” says Tamara. “You know too many people.” Almost never in her four years on the job did she come across cocaine or even meth. “The epidemic is in prescription pills,” she says. “People will do anything to get hold of them.” Like many of Trump’s evangelical supporters, Tamara does not mind the thrice-married candidate’s lurid tabloid past. After all, Ronald Reagan had been divorced. “Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future,” she says. What most appeals to her about Trump is that he talks without a trace of political correctness. He calls things the way he sees them. Gaffes that would have felled a lesser man--calling illegal Hispanic immigrants “murderers” and “rapists”, for example, or obsessing over supposed slights about the size of his penis--have left Trump unscathed. “He just keeps walking through one fire after another and coming out the other side untouched,” says Tamara. “I take this as a sign.” In spite of having Mexican ethnicity on his father’s side, Tamara’s husband Flux, with whom she shares a private legal practice, is if anything even more Trumpian than his wife. He was raised by foster families in Tucson, Arizona, before “emancipating” himself in his teens. He dropped his Hispanic name for an invented one, Flux Neo, to symbolise a new beginning. Flux also found God. He still bears traces of his tough street childhood, which seems to come straight out of television drama Breaking Bad. His tongue is pierced and a tattoo in Sanskrit encircles his neck. It translates: “There is no higher religion than truth.” On his wall hangs a framed tableau of a dead tarantula and a dead scorpion. It reminds him of his past. Nobody supports building Trump’s wall with Mexico more than Flux does. “I’ve seen the Mexican drugs cartels close up,” he says. “I know what they can do.” A few weeks ago, Tamara introduced Trump at a rally in Radford, Virginia. Flux took a video of it. The whole family was there. It was the performance of her life and the largest crowd she had ever addressed. In court she would occasionally suffer from stage fright. But on this occasion she felt no trace of nervousness. Shortly before Tamara went on, Trump had put her at ease. He was so humble and gentle, she says. No cussing or cursing. He asked about her home town. Then she walked up to the microphone. Her short speech focused on Trump’s promise to “make America great again”. Tamara said: For all those trolls and haters out there, let me be clear. I am no longer OK with charming, smooth politicians speaking kindly to me as they destroy my children’s future. I don’t need someone to never use a foul word. I don’t need my president to have polished, perfect teeth: I want action! I don’t need a president to have perfect hair, I need him to have balls! Tamara had done what she was asked to do. She made the crowd roar. Then the big man came on. A few days later, Trump broke the barriers with his massive victory in Buchanan and surrounding counties. Tamara believes he will do it again in November: For the first time in my life, I believe we can get America back again. I have been waiting a long time for Trump to come along. Joshua Justus has a better idea than most of America’s past. Now almost 80, Daniel’s grandfather became a miner when he was just 15. Harry S Truman was still president. Joshua could barely read or write. He earned 70 cents an hour. He can vividly recall childhood scenes of the Depression, when people queued for hours for a slice of bacon. I sit on his porch in the fading light listening to him reminisce. Something about this toothless old miner, dressed in 1950s trousers and braces, sucking intermittently on his oxygen mask, reminds me of Daniel’s mother Karen--Joshua’s daughter. Perhaps it is his outspokenness. Joshua says he hated working in the mines. “I wouldn’t wish that on a dog,” he says. I ask him what he thinks of his grandson, flying off to Shanghai again in a couple of weeks for further work experience, this time taking his father, who has never set foot outside of the US. Could he imagine one of his own would one day speak Chinese? The grandfather chortles. “Book learning is no good if you don’t have common sense,” he says. After a pause, he adds: “Daniel has plenty of both.” The only smart way to go nowadays is to get educated and get out, he adds. What he cannot understand is why “people round here” cling to the mines: When a crook like Trump comes along, promising this and promising that, they are ready to believe anything. Some people round here aren’t so smart.” Trump is a “disrespectful and very ill-mannered” man, he adds. He doesn’t have a good word to say about anybody. Daniel, on the other hand...  Our conversation turns to Daniel’s latest bugbear--stopping Buchanan from wasting its meagre budget on a new Bible studies class. The curriculum was approved by the Southern Baptist Convention, which embraces creationism. The young scholar wrote a letter to The Voice, the regional paper, which goes to the heart of the area’s future. Between the lines, it also tells us about the boy who escaped--and how, in spite of everything, he wants to return home to help it through its collapsing morale. Daniel wrote: I was fortunate enough to have been raised by parents who taught me to be a critical and independent thinker. Not all students in Buchanan County are quite so fortunate. Rather than challenged and encouraged, our children are stymied and restrained--their eyes blinded and their feet bound by a lack of curricular diversity and an overabundance of empty justifications for their plight. The world outside south-west Virginia demanded “fungible soft skills” and “critical thinking”, he wrote. It was unlikely a Bible studies class would do that. It was a bold letter--perhaps a little arrogant but sharply relevant. Beneath Daniel’s words there was a reply from Earl Cole, the paper’s proprietor, and one of the region’s leading opinion formers. He is also a Trump supporter and a friend of Tamara Neo: It is not a good thing, totally, to be trained to be a critical thinker. As for the Bible, it is the Holy Book. There is no better manual for preparing for life in the real world. But it was the proprietor’s closing paragraph that made me catch my breath. I had to reread it to feel its edge: Mr Justus does not say whether he is a believer or not. But in reading his letter, I can see that he has a lot to learn. J.

Seems like we’re easy to stereotype.” In exchange for Oliver’s insights, I agree to be e-introduced to her friend, Daniel Justus, who would show me another side of things. “Not everyone in Buchanan is going to hell,” she says. “Some people are making something of their lives.” I quickly forget about our deal as Oliver tells me about her travails.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon It’s a testament to the radical changes happening in shopping malls that one of downtown Toronto’s chicest cocktail lounges opened in mid-September inside a Nordstrom department store. Habitant, the visually striking four-sided bar that sits in the heart of the men’s department on Nordstrom’s second floor, serves up Negronis and snacks to those who want to escape the Eaton Centre’s din on a busy day or need some liquid inspiration to open up their wallets. The bar is only one of a dizzying array of services Nordstrom has incorporated into its format to inject some zing into the 115-year-old department store chain. In addition to another café and a full-service restaurant to round out its food offerings, the company’s fourth Canadian store features a 24-hour concierge service for late-night fashion emergencies; a “men’s clubhouse” lounge and changing area with flatscreen TVs tuned to sports; an extra-spacious “girlfriend” fitting room to accommodate groups of women who shop together; and a children’s shoe department that hosts monthly shoe tying classes. The service-heavy philosophy, coupled with a dose of theatre, is a fitting example of how stores and the malls they inhabit across North America are adapting during an unprecedented period of change for the industry. Gone are the days when you could build ubiquitous, commodity-based retail spaces with ugly front doors “Gone are the days when you could build ubiquitous, commodity-based retail spaces with ugly front doors,” Finley McEwen, senior vice-president of development at Canadian mall developer Cadillac Fairview Corp. Ltd., told an industry audience last month at the International Council of Shopping Centres convention in Toronto. “The customer has way better things to do than fight through traffic to get to spaces like that.” The future of shopping malls, a prevailing theme at this year’s conference, hinges on service-heavy “experiential” retail stores, restaurants, and services, experts say. Mall developers and retailers are all keenly aware how much the Internet is influencing and potentially eroding the classic bricks-and-mortar business model. Both have to contend with a growing cohort of consumers who might still like stores, but visit them less frequently in favour of shopping from the comforts of the couch. Canadian retail sales will grow 1.7 per cent this year to $522.6 billion, a rate vastly outpaced by an expected 15-per-cent increase in e-commerce sales, according to estimates by market research firm eMarketer. Online sales account for only 6.5 per cent of retail sales in Canada, though Forrester Research projects that will rise to 10 per cent by 2019. In the meantime, retail leasing in Canada is expected to become “increasingly polarized” as retailers focus on trying to secure urban locations and space in higher-end malls, “while lingering vacancy can be expected in second and third-tier malls,” according to the 2016 Canadian Market Outlook from commercial real estate firm CBRE. These trends are happening elsewhere as well. In the U.S., Kohl’s Corp., J.C. Penney Co., Sears Holding Corp. and Kmart have collectively closed hundreds of stores in recent years, and this year Macy’s Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Office Depot Inc. have announced hundreds more closures to come. Retailers and mall developers in Canada, still smarting from the void Target Corp. left behind, have been anxious about bankruptcies, traffic declines and store closures among veteran retail chains such as Reitmans Ltd. and Le Chateau Inc. Still, CBRE reported sales at Canadian shopping centres in June were $29.4 billion, a 3.9-per-cent increase from the $28.3 billion reported for June 2015. A key reason for the increase, experts say, is the increasing number of food options at neighbourhood shopping centres, from luxe food halls such as Pusateri inside Saks Fifth Avenue stores to sit-down restaurants like Beaumont Kitchen in west Toronto’s Sherway Gardens mall. Eataly, an Italian fresh food phenomenon with emporiums in the U.S., Dubai and Japan, among others, announced it will open its first Canadian location in Toronto’s Manulife Centre in 2019. “There has to be something innovative that is happening in the shopping centre industry to attract the customers away from their screens and into the malls,” Debbie Kalisky, associate in retail development at Montreal-based retail design firm GH&A, said at the ICSC conference. “It’s about offering them something unique and innovative, a place where they can socialize and have experiences with people in the same community, which is something that you can’t do when you are shopping online.” Food and beverage is a “core component” of the reinvention of the mall, she said. “The shopping centre is now a place to wine and dine, and it’s a place where we never had full-service restaurants before and where we now have full-service restaurants.” Food and entertainment now account for 22.1 per cent of the space leased in U.S. malls, compared with 19.2 per cent in 2012, according to recent data from CoStar Group Inc. and cited in the Wall Street Journal. “It’s really a paradigm shift from what was a commodity-based retail world to a more experiential one,” Kalisky said. Retailers whose categories are vulnerable to commodification by the Internet — such as footwear and books — have also made big efforts in recent years to engage their customers. For example, Indigo Books & Music Inc. has been opening up American Girl doll boutiques in its stores across Canada that host doll dress-up events and storytelling parties. “What we find with millennials is they are not as connected to things as we are — they are connected to experiences,” said Fab Stanghieri, senior vice-president of real estate and construction at Cineplex Digital Media. “Even when we design spaces for people to interact in groups, there has to be seating for six, eight, 10 people to share the experience.” Developers look to innovative theatre chains for cues as to what might work well in retail, because theatres continue to perform well in North America and remain key mall tenants despite decades of encroachment on their traditional turf by at-home viewing technologies. Cineplex has made the movie-going experience increasingly entertaining over the past five years by incorporating interactive trivia games, seats that shake in tandem with the on-screen action, 3-D and licensed VIP theatres where patrons can order restaurant food and alcohol to their plush, reclining seats. “It’s all about competing with your couch,” Stanghieri said. “We compete with being able to watch Netflix at home. Our biggest year attendance-wise, ever, was last year, so movies aren’t dead.” Cineplex’s latest venture is Rec Room, an entertainment complex that debuted its first location in mid-September at the South Edmonton Common mall. Half of the 60,000-square-foot venue consists of dining and live entertainment; the other half is filled with attractions and games, including axe throwing, a racecar simulator, luxury bowling, ping pong, pool tables and air hockey. There are also performance spaces for live music and programmed entertainment, and app-based gamification allows guests to play interactive digital games with others at the complex. There has to be something innovative that is happening in the shopping centre industry to attract the customers away from their screens Cineplex aims to open 10 to 15 Rec Room locations across Canada over the next few years. “As developers and as property managers, we need to look at our business as a whole and think about how we make it more compelling for people to come in,” said Sheila Jennings, general manager at Cadillac Fairview’s Toronto Eaton Centre. “If we can’t speak passionately to (our customers), then we don’t deserve to win. And we are in this to win.” There are signs, despite disruption and turmoil in the world of traditional retail, that all the initiatives aimed at attracting people to the mall could be working, even among the youngest crop of consumers who embrace online shopping with gusto. A recent survey by Chicago-based wealth management firm William Blair & Co. LLC found that more teens said they were visiting malls in 2016 than they did in 2015, the first rise in teen mall visits since 2013. The survey said 41 per cent of respondents had visited malls more often in 2016, while only 37 percent report visiting malls less frequently. All the changes at the mall are positive for consumers, said Cadillac Fairview’s McEwen. “[Three decades ago], the majority of the time was spent developing shopping centres that were not very nice places,” he said. Now, “the customer is far better off buying that shirt online and getting it delivered to their door than going through that type of experience. So we have to deliver a pleasant, inspirational experience and make sure they have got a reason to come to the shopping centre.” hshaw@nationalpost.com Twitter.com/HollieKShaw Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Seems like we’re easy to stereotype.” In exchange for Oliver’s insights, I agree to be e-introduced to her friend, Daniel Justus, who would show me another side of things. “Not everyone in Buchanan is going to hell,” she says. “Some people are making something of their lives.” I quickly forget about our deal as Oliver tells me about her travails. But that evening, an email arrives from Daniel. He calls himself “the boy who escaped”. It piques my interest. What, I wonder, was Daniel escaping from? The drive to Daniel’s family home takes me across rugged mountains, through mist-shrouded valleys and past churches. Lots of churches. I counted about one a mile. A few hundred yards from Daniel’s valley, there is a Church of Jesus Christ with a large billboard you cannot miss. “When life gives you more than you can stand, just kneel,” it says. Daniel clearly wasn’t paying attention. Since childhood he has been kicking against the fate that everybody around him--barring his mother, Karen--seemed to have preordained. When Daniel was in eighth grade (aged 14), he argued in front of the school board for his right to be taught extracurricular courses that would let him apply to college. The school principal had repeatedly turned him down. He won. “Nobody could understand why I would want to do that,” he says. “I convinced them it was my right.” Then he insisted on learning Spanish, even though there was just one qualified teacher in the county. They set up interactive television classes so he could learn remotely. He is now a Spanish interpreter for the state of Virginia. Then he wanted to learn Chinese. Today he speaks and writes fluent Mandarin. Last summer, he spent three months working for a Chinese law firm in Shanghai, dealing in intellectual property rights. Last weekend, he graduated with distinction from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Next stop is a postgraduate degree at an Ivy League university or Oxford. “I’m still thinking about where to apply,” he says. Most of Daniel’s peers from high school found jobs at the hulking local Walmart, telemarketing from home or as welders on construction sites. One or two found work in the coalfields, or what is left of them. Others have fallen prey to the heroin epidemic. Many of the girls, including Oliver, got pregnant in their teens. “I knew one girl who got pregnant at 14,” says Daniel, now 22. Like most others I saw in Buchanan, he has good teeth, though he has purged all trace of his Appalachian accent. To put it mildly, he has defied the odds. Daniel was also the first person I met in Buchanan County who had not voted for Trump. In November, he will vote for Clinton--though without much enthusiasm. “Trump is just another drug,” Daniel says. “People round here are addicted to escapism.” The first thing that strikes you about Daniel’s home is its serenity. From the covered porch with its lazy ceiling fans, you gaze up verdant slopes to wooded hilltops. In the garden, there is a weeping willow and cherry trees. As dusk falls, the air comes alive with the sound of tree frogs and cicadas. You can hear the occasional braying of the family donkey, Jackson. The second thing that strikes you is the garish cliff-face carving of the Confederate flag on the other side of their narrow valley. It overlooks the large, floodlit football field of Hurley High School, whose principal Daniel outfoxed when he was a student. The Hurley Rebels team colour is the old Confederate flag. “Heritage not hate,” is what the flag’s apologists say it represents. To Daniel the slave state flag evokes something more visceral--a culture that prizes sport to the exclusion of all else. It is not just the school. In place of petrol prices, the signs outside the local gas stations proclaim, “Good luck Rebels!” When the team win, it makes the front page of The Mountaineer, the county’s main newspaper, next to stories about suicides, local beauty pageants and elk poaching. “Faith, Family, Football,” says a banner in the school’s main hallway. “We bleed red and blue,” says another. The sign outside the girls’ bathroom reads, “Lady Rebels”. The only other school banner I could see said: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The school has no science laboratory. Its library consists of two half-empty rows of shelves. A few months ago, Hurley High tipped most of its library’s contents into a nearby dumpster. “I found Oliver Twist in there,” says Joshua, Daniel’s middle brother. The family salvaged a bookshelf’s worth of discarded titles. Daniel is not just an exception in Buchanan County. I am tempted to think of him as the canary in the coal mine--except this one managed to fly to its freedom. His mother Karen, a chain-smoking force of nature, puts his success down to being strangely different. “When he was 18 months old he knew his alphabet backwards,” she says. “He still doesn’t have a clue how to change the engine oil.” When Daniel’s father, Danny Justus, a coal salesman and Baptist preacher, and his two younger brothers went deer hunting, Daniel would tag along with a book. While the others stalked deer with their rifles and crossbows, Daniel would sit under a tree reading. He refused to eat the venison. The book that influenced him most was Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage. It tells the life of a clubfoot boy who could never fit in. Karen knew this about her son and nurtured it. When Daniel felt down and ostracised, she would egg him on. “I told him, ‘Buchanan isn’t even a piece of the jigsaw--it’s barely a speck on a piece of the jigsaw in that large world out there,’” she says. “None of this will matter if you escape.” When the Rebels won a game, the principal would broadcast it triumphantly over the public address system. If Daniel won a spelling bee contest, or a debate competition--as he did on every occasion — it would pass unmentioned. Karen would head down to the principal’s office and demand that his feat be broadcast. Anyone who meets Karen, a robust woman with a mischievous glint in her eyes, would think twice about taking her on. “Think about that,” Karen says, waving a smouldering Marlboro Light: The teachers didn’t care if you could spell or argue. They think too much ‘learnin’ is bad for you. That’s the teachers! Can you imagine what everyone else thinks? Her words reminded me of Trump’s praise for the kids who don’t turn out like Daniel. “I love the poorly educated,” he said. The other trait that separated Daniel from others was his dislike of coal. In Buchanan County, that is tantamount to atheism. Many in his family had fallen victim to the hazards of working underground--the dreaded black lung disease, the sleep apnea, split tendons, slipped discs and orthopaedic ailments that come from a half-bent myopic existence in the dust-ridden bowels of Appalachia. Others, including relatives of Daniel, have fallen prey to the prescription drug culture that supposedly exists to ease their pain. One close relative, whom Karen asked me not to name, was caught distributing pills. Tamara Neo, the attorney who co-chairs Trump’s regional campaign, put him away for 10 years. “Neo was ruthless with poorer addicts who couldn’t afford lawyers,” says Karen. “There was no forgiveness.” The closest Daniel came to a fight at school was when he argued the benefits of renewable energy. A football jock wanted to punch him. Parents demanded that a sympathetic teacher be disciplined for making a case against coal. What angers Daniel is that his people are clinging to a way of life that has crippled them--often literally. “It’s as if they have Stockholm syndrome [where a prisoner falls in love with his captor],” he says. Dana Oliver, Daniel’s school friend who introduced us, puts it another way. In the absence of coal, half the county now subsists on federal handouts--Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security disability payments and other “entitlements”. Alone in the Republican field, Trump vowed to protect them. Whatever else you can say about the New York property magnate, he knows his market. Call it big-government conservatism for white people. Says Oliver: Coal is not coming back--it costs too much to open a flooded mine. In their heart of hearts, most people know that. Trump just gives them a little bit of hope. But there is another way of looking at Trump’s wild popularity in the region. Before the start of each shift, a preacher calls for God’s blessing on the miners. In this part of the world, the church is almost as ubiquitous underground as it is above. In the wake of the mine closures have come bad habits. People sell food stamps for opioid pills, says Oliver. Church attendance has fallen. God is missing in action. “If you think about it, what Donald Trump wants to do is bring God back into their lives,” she says. “That’s the way a lot of people see it.” Tamara Neo, Trump’s main cheerleader for the region, certainly sees it that way. Every morning she puts her three children into her Range Rover for the 45-minute drive to a private Christian school across the state border in West Virginia. There is too much godlessness in today’s public schools, she believes. As we drive, Tamara tests her children on the Bible. “John 1, verses 16-18,” she barks into her iPhone’s Siri app. The verses appear on screen. “Now say the verse, Axella,” she says to her daughter, who’s in fifth grade. Axella stumbles over it then yawns. “Again,” says Tamara, until she gets it right. She moves on to Io, her eldest: “Exodus 20, Verse 12,” she says. “Go Io.” Next comes Flux. Then she makes them recite Lincoln’s Gettysburg address--all 278 words of it. She does not stop until they get it right. With children called Io, Axella and Flux, Tamara betrays her western origins. People in Virginia are conservative with names. Tamara and her husband Flux, also a lawyer, moved here from Colorado 10 years ago because they loved the beauty of the Great Smokies. She ran as commonwealth attorney for Buchanan County--an elected position as chief prosecutor for the area. She lost her re-election in 2010 but not before putting scores of people away for prescription drug-dealing. “In a close-knit community like this, a prosecutor quickly prosecutes herself out of a job,” says Tamara. “You know too many people.” Almost never in her four years on the job did she come across cocaine or even meth. “The epidemic is in prescription pills,” she says. “People will do anything to get hold of them.” Like many of Trump’s evangelical supporters, Tamara does not mind the thrice-married candidate’s lurid tabloid past. After all, Ronald Reagan had been divorced. “Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future,” she says. What most appeals to her about Trump is that he talks without a trace of political correctness. He calls things the way he sees them. Gaffes that would have felled a lesser man--calling illegal Hispanic immigrants “murderers” and “rapists”, for example, or obsessing over supposed slights about the size of his penis--have left Trump unscathed. “He just keeps walking through one fire after another and coming out the other side untouched,” says Tamara. “I take this as a sign.” In spite of having Mexican ethnicity on his father’s side, Tamara’s husband Flux, with whom she shares a private legal practice, is if anything even more Trumpian than his wife. He was raised by foster families in Tucson, Arizona, before “emancipating” himself in his teens. He dropped his Hispanic name for an invented one, Flux Neo, to symbolise a new beginning. Flux also found God. He still bears traces of his tough street childhood, which seems to come straight out of television drama Breaking Bad. His tongue is pierced and a tattoo in Sanskrit encircles his neck. It translates: “There is no higher religion than truth.” On his wall hangs a framed tableau of a dead tarantula and a dead scorpion. It reminds him of his past. Nobody supports building Trump’s wall with Mexico more than Flux does. “I’ve seen the Mexican drugs cartels close up,” he says. “I know what they can do.” A few weeks ago, Tamara introduced Trump at a rally in Radford, Virginia. Flux took a video of it. The whole family was there. It was the performance of her life and the largest crowd she had ever addressed. In court she would occasionally suffer from stage fright. But on this occasion she felt no trace of nervousness. Shortly before Tamara went on, Trump had put her at ease. He was so humble and gentle, she says. No cussing or cursing. He asked about her home town. Then she walked up to the microphone. Her short speech focused on Trump’s promise to “make America great again”. Tamara said: For all those trolls and haters out there, let me be clear. I am no longer OK with charming, smooth politicians speaking kindly to me as they destroy my children’s future. I don’t need someone to never use a foul word. I don’t need my president to have polished, perfect teeth: I want action! I don’t need a president to have perfect hair, I need him to have balls! Tamara had done what she was asked to do. She made the crowd roar. Then the big man came on. A few days later, Trump broke the barriers with his massive victory in Buchanan and surrounding counties. Tamara believes he will do it again in November: For the first time in my life, I believe we can get America back again. I have been waiting a long time for Trump to come along. Joshua Justus has a better idea than most of America’s past. Now almost 80, Daniel’s grandfather became a miner when he was just 15. Harry S Truman was still president. Joshua could barely read or write. He earned 70 cents an hour. He can vividly recall childhood scenes of the Depression, when people queued for hours for a slice of bacon. I sit on his porch in the fading light listening to him reminisce. Something about this toothless old miner, dressed in 1950s trousers and braces, sucking intermittently on his oxygen mask, reminds me of Daniel’s mother Karen--Joshua’s daughter. Perhaps it is his outspokenness. Joshua says he hated working in the mines. “I wouldn’t wish that on a dog,” he says. I ask him what he thinks of his grandson, flying off to Shanghai again in a couple of weeks for further work experience, this time taking his father, who has never set foot outside of the US. Could he imagine one of his own would one day speak Chinese? The grandfather chortles. “Book learning is no good if you don’t have common sense,” he says. After a pause, he adds: “Daniel has plenty of both.” The only smart way to go nowadays is to get educated and get out, he adds. What he cannot understand is why “people round here” cling to the mines: When a crook like Trump comes along, promising this and promising that, they are ready to believe anything. Some people round here aren’t so smart.” Trump is a “disrespectful and very ill-mannered” man, he adds. He doesn’t have a good word to say about anybody. Daniel, on the other hand...  Our conversation turns to Daniel’s latest bugbear--stopping Buchanan from wasting its meagre budget on a new Bible studies class. The curriculum was approved by the Southern Baptist Convention, which embraces creationism. The young scholar wrote a letter to The Voice, the regional paper, which goes to the heart of the area’s future. Between the lines, it also tells us about the boy who escaped--and how, in spite of everything, he wants to return home to help it through its collapsing morale. Daniel wrote: I was fortunate enough to have been raised by parents who taught me to be a critical and independent thinker. Not all students in Buchanan County are quite so fortunate. Rather than challenged and encouraged, our children are stymied and restrained--their eyes blinded and their feet bound by a lack of curricular diversity and an overabundance of empty justifications for their plight. The world outside south-west Virginia demanded “fungible soft skills” and “critical thinking”, he wrote. It was unlikely a Bible studies class would do that. It was a bold letter--perhaps a little arrogant but sharply relevant. Beneath Daniel’s words there was a reply from Earl Cole, the paper’s proprietor, and one of the region’s leading opinion formers. He is also a Trump supporter and a friend of Tamara Neo: It is not a good thing, totally, to be trained to be a critical thinker. As for the Bible, it is the Holy Book. There is no better manual for preparing for life in the real world. But it was the proprietor’s closing paragraph that made me catch my breath. I had to reread it to feel its edge: Mr Justus does not say whether he is a believer or not. But in reading his letter, I can see that he has a lot to learn. J.

No one is allowed in the county until the evacuation is lifted. Caitlin Turner 1 of 6 i By Caitlin Turner cturner@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Cars lined up for what appeared to be miles on U.S. 278 near the Beaufort and Jasper County line on Sunday morning as drivers attempted to re-enter after evacuating for Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Highway Patrol troopers at the scene said only those with a re-entry pass would be able to pass the barricade just past the Walmart. Those passes, they said, are mainly for emergency personnel and utility workers. One trooper said she did not know when the roadway would be open for all drivers. Officers from the SC Law Enforcement Division were also at the scene. A Bluffton Police Department release this morning said no decision had been made on when residents would be allowed back in. The department also said the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew would be in place tonight. Capt. Bob Bromage of the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office said the county would have a meeting today at noon to announce new re-entry information. That was little comfort to those on the highway Sunday morning. "I went to get a cup of coffee from Bluffton and now they won't let me back through," Dave Angelino, a Bluffton resident, said as he stood outside his parked car. Angelino said he has a son with special needs and that even then he was unable to pass through the barricade. The road was also blocked Saturday evening. Troopers on Saturday received a “few calls,” but rumors of miles-long backups in the area were “blown out of proportion,” said S.C. Highway Patrol Lance Cpl. Gary Miller. The call to shut down the major thoroughfare came from local emergency management officials who decided conditions were not safe enough for travel. “Collectively we (the Sheriff, myself, the power utilities, in consultation with SC Emergency Management Department and the Governor’s Office) made the decision that this was the best course of action. Currently there are 92,000 customers without power in Beaufort County. There is no functioning hospital. There are no functioning traffic control devices,” Lt. Colonel Neil Baxley sent in a text message to local officials.

(Eric Risberg/Associated Press) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Published: October 9, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. A ‘Journey’ Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

Thomas Suddes writes that Clinton's in-depth knowledge of the nation's security challenges and grasp of economic realities compared to Donald Trump's narrow skill set make her the clear choice for president. (Andrew Harnik, Associated Press) Print Email Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com By Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 09, 2016 at 5:30 AM, updated October 09, 2016 at 8:55 AM comments There's not much Trump doesn't know about real-estate speculation and sweet tax breaks. This election isn't to decide whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be the lesser evil. Nor is it a contest to judge whether Trump or Clinton is the more likable. Trump's words have proven him despicable. And even on a good day, Clinton's controlling personality appears brittle. The real question is which is prepared to lead the United States. Our country's changing ethnically, racially, religiously. A voter can fear that, lament that, or welcome that. But one thing she or he can't do, no matter who becomes president, is reverse it. Clinton understands that. Trump clearly doesn't. Then there's free trade. Trump has said, correctly, that for many Ohioans, free trade is a plus for Wall Street, a minus for Main Street. Cheap Walmart prices don't offset stagnant wages. But Trump, like King Canute, thinks he can order back the tide. Free trade isn't going away, however; too many big shots want it. Meanwhile, it's worth recalling that, as PolitiFact reported, "Trump is right that Clinton once supported NAFTA and [the Trans-Pacific Partnership]." That's why Clinton must stop word-parsing and triangulation. As president, she must ensure that free trade is fair trade. That's all working Ohioans want – fairness. With that, they can succeed. Another fact of life is the rise of China, Russia's machinations and the quicksand that is the Middle East. Clinton's experience as a U.S. senator and secretary of state qualify her to address those realities. There's not much Trump doesn't know about real-estate speculation and sweet tax breaks. But what Trump doesn't know about foreign policy would fill a big public library. Those factors demonstrate why this election must pivot on qualifications. Clinton's qualified. Trump's not. And if Clinton's candidacy is a referendum on Barack Obama's stewardship, she's earned Ohioans' votes. When Obama became president in 2009, Ohio's unemployment rate was 8.9 percent; in August, it was 4.7 percent. The day Obama was inaugurated, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7,949.09; on Wednesday, it closed at 18,281.03. Freddie Mac reports that for the week that ended Thursday, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages it surveyed averaged 3.42 percent; the annual average in 2008, the year before Obama was sworn in, was 6.03 percent. And in constant dollars, 2008's average pump price for regular unleaded gas was $3.61 a gallon; it was $2.45 last year, the Energy Information Administration reports. You don't have to like Hillary Clinton or for that matter to loathe Donald Trump to consider Clinton the better presidential prospect. She is. Demonstrably.

We stopped at the car wash on Main across from Walmart, and as I leaned out to pay for the car wash, my wallet must have fell out of my pocket. Here we were hundreds of miles from home and no wallet. The next morning Tom from the Elks Lodge called and said he found the wallet in the parking lot. All the money was gone, but everything else was there. He in turn mailed it to me.

Yard Sales Want to know where the yard/garage sales are this week? (read more) By Kara Zoeller, Citizens' Voice columnist / Published: October 9, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     I know we’re just getting into the full swing of fall, but Christmas isn’t far behind! If you already have your money saved for the holidays and are ready to check off the items on your gift lists, that’s great! If you haven’t even started putting money aside, no worries ... here are a few ways to quickly bulk up your Christmas budget. Although you may feel it’s a little late to start a savings account for your holiday shopping, luckily, there are still 11 weeks until Christmas. If you could manage to put just $50 away each of those weeks, you’ll end up with more than $500 for your shopping. That’s a good chunk of change, especially when you purchase gifts on sale. Now I’m not suggesting that you wait until the last week to shop ... this would be more of a working fund that you would pull money from as you find deals on the gifts you need. Another great way to rack up some Christmas cash is with Swagbucks. Swagbucks is a site where you earn points (called SB) for things you’re probably doing online already like searching, watching videos, discovering deals, and taking surveys. Then, you take those points (one SB is worth one penny) and exchange them for gift cards to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Target, or even for PayPal cash. Unlike a lot of other rewards sites, you can cash out at any time, and they have gift cards for as little as 300 SB (The $3 Amazon gift card — every little bit helps). I can’t even tell you how many Amazon gift cards I’ve gotten using this program. I’m sure a stack of those would come in handy this holiday season, and right now, you can even get a 400 SB bonus! You can find out more about that at SavingByDesign.com/SBbonus. One way to stay within your budget or grab some gifts while you’re still working on your holiday savings is to take advantage of layaway programs. This is a great way to get the big ticket items on your holiday gift list. When you find a deal at a store with layaway, you can take advantage of paying for it over time. Local stores offering layaway include Walmart, Kmart, Sears, Toys R Us, Burlington Coat Factory, and more. Sometimes you’ll also find special financing options available online. For example, last year I got my kids Kindles with a special 6-month interest free financing promotion that Amazon was offering. As you can see, even if you’re a little behind, there’s still plenty of time to save for the holidays using one (or all) of these methods. Happy saving!

How to describe Pence There are three words to describe Mike Pence: Self righteous liar. Great job! I would like to take the time to thank the city of Ocean Springs employees who come around every Friday morning like clockwork in the big city truck picking up debris and household trash. They do a wonderful job and even take time to rake up anything that was missed. Thank you so much for your hard work. Y’all know Cruisers, I am happy you visit my hometown on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. By the enjoyment in y’all’s faces, y’all know how to vacation. Thanks for letting me be a part. Watching your beautiful antiques puts a sparkle in my eyes. Wildflowers Regarding the section of I-10 in Jackson County that had the median stripped of its trees, I wish MDOT would spread native wildflower seeds in this section. No phones Driving has become a nightmare during the daytime. Driving to Wal-Mart, I had to use my horn five times to warn other drivers who were crossing over into my traffic lane without their knowledge because they were occupied with their cellphones. They were looking at their phones and drifting over into my lane. Had I not sounded my horn, they would have hit me. Cellphone use while driving is in epidemic proportions. Stop looking at your phone while driving. Missed it I must have missed your Sound Off about Trump constantly interrupting Clinton during their debate. Oh, there wasn’t one, was there? President’s pick You are right that the president can’t take away your guns, and it takes the Supreme Court to end a constitutional amendment. But who do you think appoints the Supreme Court justices? You bet, it’s the president, and if Hillary gets in, all the justices will be liberal. Praying for you To all in Melbourne, Florida, from your sister city of Melbourne, Australia: You and all your entire coastline are in our prayers. We’ll be back We have been staying in your lovely town and went to the parade for us Cruisers.

Kohl’s rolls out its own mobile payments platform, Kohl’s Pay Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Volvo cars will start talking to each other by the end of 2016 Larger retailers are beginning to offer their own alternatives to emerging mobile payment systems, like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Today the latest to launch its own, independent mobile payment platform is department store chain Kohl’s, which has now integrated “Kohl’s Pay,” along with its loyalty and rewards programs, into the company’s mobile app. As of this morning, Kohl’s Pay is available nationwide, the company says. The retailer had previously announced the arrival of Kohl’s Pay as an expansion to its existing mobile wallet capabilities, which had allowed consumers to save their payment information and collect promotions and rewards. Kohl’s mobile payments launch follows other recent moves from Walmart and CVS, which also now have their own mobile payment solutions bundled in their smartphone applications. However, Kohl’s initiative is different in that it doesn’t allow consumers to add their own payment cards — instead, the solution is entirely focused on Kohl’s Charge, its private label card. That will make it less appealing for shoppers who are simply looking for an easier and quicker way to check out at the register, while also tapping into offers and rewards, like Kohl’s Cash and Yes2You Rewards. kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-simplicity_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-savings_screen_2x-image kohls_pay-lp-frame-20161010-transaction_screen_2x-image  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit That being said, the retailer has more than 25 million active cardholders across the U.S., so there is a sizable market that may be interested in using Kohl’s Pay at the point-of-sale. And these are Kohl’s most active and loyal customers — 60 percent of its in-store sales are done through its store cards, the retailer has said. What makes the solution better than traditional methods (e.g. cash, credit cards) is that it allows shoppers to automatically redeem the rewards they’ve collected in the app’s mobile wallet, at the same time as they check out — that is, it all takes place within one transaction. Plus, because transaction histories are stored in the app, returns and exchanges become easier, as consumers won’t have to dig up their paper receipts. One area where Kohl’s did mimic other retailers is in how the mobile payment service works. Unlike with Apple Pay or Android Pay, Kohl’s Pay does not support NFC (tap to pay) transactions. Instead, consumers launch the app, choose Kohl’s Pay from the menu, then scan the QR code that appears on the customer display at point-of-sale. This code is scanned once to both pay for the transaction and apply the savings. Then you tap to approve and complete the transaction. The app, which has been downloaded 14 million times, also lets shoppers save Kohl’s gift cards in their mobile wallet, browse products, scan items in store, receive sale alerts, check out in the store then get the item shipped for free and more. What’s interesting about the launch of Kohl’s Pay is that Kohl’s was also an earlier adopter of Apple Pay, having been the first retailer to add its private label card and rewards program to Apple’s payment service. But with Apple Pay and other solutions, retailers don’t have such easy access to shopping data as when they use their own platform. With Kohl’s Pay, the company will be able to gain more insight about its sales and promotions, among other things. Kohl’s Pay is available in the retailer’s mobile app, found here. The app is available on both iOS and Android. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Kohl’s Founded 1988 Overview Kohl’s Corporation (Kohl’s) operate family-oriented department stores that sell apparel, footwear and accessories for women, men and children; soft home products, such as sheets and pillows, and housewares.

I have been thinking about CFB now for a couple of days. As you know, I keep the introduction pretty brief. We are going to look at prospects in this draft that, in my opinion, should be very good building blocks for our team. I am going to be using the Walterfootball.com draft positioning and draft board. Round 1 Pick 18 Options: Corners, Safeties, Defensive Ends, and Linebackers Our Pick: DE Derek Barnett from Tennessee He is basically another Olivier Vernon, and we would love these types of players. Also, note that he can help the rotation out massively and basically keep guys fresh and ever sack hungry. Some of you will be surprised at the ridiculous production boost we can get from simply drafting more defensive ends. To put is simply, this defense is d- line oriented. Round 2 Pick 41 Options: Corners, Safeties, Defensive Ends, and Linebackers Our Pick: OLB Marquis Haynes from Ole Miss I am strongly against drafting linebackers that only serve one purpose out on the field. This is why I advocate drafting Marquis Haynes, a very athletic prospect. He has made a name for himself with his situational pass- rushing prowess. Think Anthony Barr when you think of Haynes. He should be as good, if not better, than our current linebackers at coverage. He is a very good multipurpose player who fits the mold of a Steve Spagnuolo gadget. And NO, Devon Kennard, while a very good run stuffer and decent pass rusher himself, should not be at this position. Also, I am not high at all on Reeves-Maybin. He is basically a safety turned linebacker. We can get players like that later on in the draft. Picking him right now is like buying a laptop from Walmart: It is effective, but you know there are gonna be cheaper options that are more effective. Round 3 Our Pick: S/LB Kai Nacua from BYU|| Height: 6'2 Weight: 215 Here is our discount JRMB player. I have seen some tape on this dude and he looks pretty much like a linebacker as good as JRMB. You can't argue when we bring this beast into discussion. Here is his description. Nacua has had a fabulous start to his senior season. He had a pick in the season opener and followed it up the next week with two first-half interceptions, including a critical pick in the end zone to rob points from the Utes. In the third quarter against the Utes, Nacua lit up a receiver coming across the middle and causing an incompletion. He led with his shoulder but was still called for targeting and ejected. It was a bad call, and Nacua made a good play. He has eight tackles and three picks thus far. This isn't an anomaly as Nacua showed excellent instincts as a junior. He was ballhawk in 2015 with six interceptions, and surprisingly he's on pace to pass that total this season after only two games. If Nacua continues this level of play, his stock is going to really rise as senior. He should step right in as a linebacker for us. See, these are the benefits of being patient: both in shopping, and in drafting. Round 4 Our Pick: DE Lewis Neal, LSU || Height: 6'2 Weight: 264 He is very athletic. He is described as a "dangerous edge rusher who looks like he has the upside to develop." He should be our speed-to-power guy who beats linemen with speed and has a very high ceiling. Round 5 Our Pick: OT/G Casey Tucker from Stanford He is a good run blocker, primarily because he blocks for Christian McCaffrey. He plays right tacke, but can slide in to guard for us and be a high-ceiling guy who also has athletic upside. He should be a well-rounded player to step up for John Jerry after he leaves or gets hurt. Round 6: These are the rounds where championship teams distinguish themselves from non-championship team We have gone hard the entire draft. Here, we go harder. Our Pick: FB Sam Rogers from Virginia Tech. He can be a sneaky good player, who already has a reputation as a blocker, and has had his games catching passes and running the ball. Round 7: We go even harder here. Our Pick: Kicker Daniel Carlson from Auburn. He has been incredible this year, and we need someone to replace Josh Brown's elite level after he is gone. No, we will not resign him and waste precious cap space. Alright guys, this has been a long run for a draft. Comment your thoughts down below. Obviously, we are way too early here, but what do you feel about our chances with this draft. FanPosts are written by community members.

The dead were alive and wandering the city core. Women with white eyes, men with bloodied clothes and gashed faces, and children with graying, veiny skin took to the streets Saturday, Oct. 8, for what has become an annual Halloween-season event, the Zombie Walk, started in about 2008 by a "very disturbed group of friends." "What is there to say, we're dead. They've probably already recycled our (Social Security) numbers," reads the event Facebook page. The outfits were ugly. The faces deliberately mutilated. "This is our month," said Laurie Harwood of Jackson who was wearing curlers in her hair and a bloodied housecoat with sneakers. "Any opportunity to dress up, get out, and have fun." She and her husband, Robert, in a blond mullet, coined themselves zombie Wal-Mart shoppers. They were participating for the third time and had trashed clothing they found at consignment stores. Wal-Mart bags filled with body parts served as accessories. There were also Star Wars characters and two men dressed in elaborate handcrafted getups as members of the grotesquely dressed metal band Gwar. Andy McCrory, a local tattooist and artist, created the frightening, but impressive costumes with foam, molds and other materials. Wayne Palmer came all the way from Columbus, Ohio, not to show off his costume, but his ride, a 2007 Dodge Durango outfitted as a zombie-mobile. It drips blood, imprisons a dead child and has plastic spikes on its front. Palmer likes October and gore and has been driving his SUV to various shows, conventions and other events for years, even before the AMC show "The Walking Dead" brought zombies to the mainstream. Sometimes he just parks in at a grocery store and watches the curious crowd form. He is a truck driver, so the miles to Michigan did not bother him, and he enjoys the reaction he draws on the highway. "You don't do this if you don't want attention."

The woman used a credit card to pay for the gift card, but the credit card was declined. The offender distracted the clerk, who had started the transaction on the cash register but had not completed it because the credit card was denied. The clerk turned her back and the offender hit the cash button on the register. This triggered the computer system to believe the offender had given the cashier the money for the gift card. The offender hid the gift card, now with the $487 added, in her pocket and presented a new gift card to the cashier. The clerk was not aware that this was a new gift card and that it had no money on it.

Earleywine told reporters Friday that he essentially was given his walking papers by then-athletic director Mack Rhoades early into an investigation of alleged verbal abuse of players. File photo by Daniel Brenner The Associated Press i By Tod Palmer tpalmer@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Missouri softball coach Ehren Earleywine essentially was given his walking papers by then-athletic director Mack Rhoades early into an investigation of alleged verbal abuse of players. “It was probably mid-March and Mack called a meeting with me,” Earleywine said. “No pleasantries, he basically looked at me and said, ‘You need to start looking for another job.’ That was pretty much the end of the conversation.” Two months later, the investigation went public after a group of players announced they were playing in protest of the investigation. The Star learned in late May that he was under a Title IX investigation as well. Earleywine spoke with reporters for the first time since the end of last season after the first game of the fall slate Friday at University Field in Columbia. “The rest of the second half of the season was extremely difficult, knowing that I wasn’t going to be the coach here and trying to be invested while at the same time knowing I was being booted,” he said. “It was a difficult thing, but I managed.” The investigation continued into August before Missouri announced Earleywine had been cleared of wrongdoing in the Office for Civil Rights and Title IX’s investigation. Two weeks later, Mizzou announced Earleywine would be retained for the 2016-17 season after a meeting with executive associate athletic directors Tim Hickman, who is the administrator in charge of softball, and Sarah Reesman, who was the department’s interim athletic director. New athletic director Jim Sterk signed off on the decision and “has been in my corner since he got here,” Earleywine said. Still, the months-long investigation had an impact on Earleywine. “It makes me cautious of what I say and what I do,” he said of the fallout from the investigation. “ … The days of coaching on instinct and passion may be a thing of the past. I’m a little bit more cautious, and you have to pick your words a little more carefully, because we’re in a place in our country that I don’t like. “I think everybody’s so politically correct now that people get their feelings hurt and kids have more power than they should have. The inmates run the prison a lot of times. It’s a shame, but it’s where we’re at and I either need to adapt to it or ring a bell at Walmart of something, because those are my two options right now.” Sterk said last month that Earleywine wasn’t placed on a social contract that outlined expected behavior moving forward, but Earleywine said Friday he’s agreed to a “list of conditions” that he must adhere to or risk discipline, up to and including dismissal, in the wake of the investigation. “Quite honestly, I feel 110 percent confident that I’ll be able to meet all those expectations,” Earleywine said. “ … I think I’m just being watched a little bit closer on those things, and that’s fine. I’ve proved people wrong my entire life. I think there’s a lot of people that don’t think I could adhere to something like that, but I will and those people motivate me to do that.” Part of Earleywine’s confidence also stems from a better rapport with Sterk. “I’m super-excited about his leadership and the direction that he’s taking our athletic department,” Earleywine said. “I think he’s headed us in a different direction than we were in and I think it was important that we got that. I’m really excited about his leadership, his temperament, his experience. Everything I’ve seen so far, I’m a fan.” When Rhoades resigned in mid-July to accept a job as Baylor’s athletic director, Earleywine — a native of Jefferson City and lifelong Mizzou fan — had renewed hope he might keep his job. “I knew from the minute I heard that he was leaving for Baylor that things were going to be different and I was just hoping and praying for a great guy, a great leader and I couldn’t be more happy than I am with Jim,” Earleywine said. Does he think the investigation became personal with Rhoades? “Maybe, I can’t say for certain, because I’m not in Mack’s head, but I think that behind closed doors I’m probably not his favorite person in the world,” Earleywine said. “But I don’t know how much of that weighed into his decision to analyze whether or not I should be coming back or not. You’d have to ask him that.” Asked if he felt he was treated fairly, Earleywine — after a pause — said, “I probably shouldn’t answer that.” He believes the investigation should have been dropped “the first day and moved along with things, but that’s just me,” Earleywine said. If he has a regret about the situation, it’s that it prolonged an already tumultuous and difficult year for Mizzou, which also endured a football boycott in November amid protests sparked by a series of racist episodes. Earleywine said his “educated guess” as to why he wasn’t fired in midseason — after that meeting with Rhoades — was an effort to avoid disrupting the season for the team “and probably was hoping that I would fade calmly into the sunset.” That, of course, didn’t happen. “Obviously, it didn’t turn out like that, and it ended up being quite a black eye for all of us,” Earleywine said. “That’s the thing I regret more than anything. Before being a softball coach at Missouri, I’m a Missouri fan, and it’s bothered me what’s happened — not just with that incident, but, over the last year or two, some of the things that have gone down. None of us like it, and I didn’t want to be a contributor to that. I felt like that situation was just another nick and, to be a part of that, made me sick. I wish it wouldn’t have gone down like that, but I’m not the one who started it.” Earleywine is 453-154 in 10 seasons at Mizzou, including an NCAA regional appearance each season and eight trips to the super regionals. The Tigers reached the Women’s College World Series three straight years during 2009-11. “I’ve had days that were really hard, that equaled the pain that we felt last year, but nothing over that amount of time,” Earleywine said. “It just wore on me. It wore on our team. It wore on our fans. It was a burden for all of us to bear.” Earleywine sought counseling to address some of the issues central to the investigation, including adjustments to the language he uses with the team, and has a new mentality after the ordeal. “It gave me a new appreciation for the reason that I got into this in the first place was to teach softball,” he said. “I love this game. Last year, when I was carrying this burden around, I couldn’t really think about that, because there was the weight of everything else.” More from Earleywine: ▪ There has been substantial turnover during the last season. That’s in terms of players — with pitchers Paige Lowary transferring to Oklahoma and Tori Finucane leaving for Minnesota among seven defections since the start of the 2016 season — and staff. Longtime pitching coach and ace recruiter Pete D’Amour also left, becoming head coach at Kennesaw State. He took MU volunteer assistant Doug Gillis with him as the Owls’ new pitching coach. “I’m going to miss Pete as a friend more than anything,” Earleywine said. “We’ve been through a lot together. He’s a great friend and he’s a great person.” Earleywine said he has identified D’Amour’s replacement, but some paperwork still needs to be signed before a formal announcement. ▪ Earleywine said the investigation hasn’t impacted recruiting. Of the 25 players in eighth through 12th grades who were committed to the Tigers, none de-committed — a fact he attributes to personal relationships. According to Earleywine, the 2017 recruiting class is the third-ranked collection of prospects in the country. “I don’t think this is going to be the best team I’ve ever had, but we’re going to be competitive once again and we’re going to be competitive at the national level,” Earleywine said. “That’s saying something after the year we’ve been through.” ▪ There’s ample reason for excitement for Earleywine and his team, which should move into a new stadium in March. “Our first home game will be Oregon on a Friday night on March 3, and they’re saying that the timeline is March 1 for the completion of the stadium,” Earleywine said. “I would think that would be awesome night to start against a great team like that on a Friday night and that place would be full.” Tod Palmer: 816-234-4389, @todpalmer Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story University of Missouri Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:37 Chiefs use pair of turnovers to top Panthers in 17-point comeback Pause 55:59 Chiefs 20, Panthers 17: Postgame analysis from The Star's sportswriters 2:30 Marcus Peters on forced fumble: 'I took it from him' 2:33 Arabia Steamboat Museum Celebrates 25 Years With A New Paddlewheel 1:56 AFC West: Best division in the conference? 0:34 Dee Ford got his sack, Chris Jones wanted his 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:28 Dee Ford on his sack psychology Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 8 days ago Mizzou Minute: Tod Palmer breaks down the loss at South Carolina 5:16 8 days ago Mizzou Minute: Tod Palmer breaks down the loss at South Carolina 8:23 8 days ago Barry Odom reacts to Mizzou's loss at South Carolina 6:30 11 days ago Mizzou defensive coordinator DeMontie Cross on changes to the defense View more video University of Missouri Senior Russell Woods has career night in Missouri’s season-opening win Missouri blasts Alabama A&M 99-44 in season opener KU beats MU 1-0 in sudden death in NCAA women’s soccer tourney Mizzou lands commitment from Louisiana defensive end Missouri’s Kevin Pendleton emerges as anchor despite adversity back home Sports Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

At least 10 people were killed across the Southeastern U.S. as the devastating storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and lumbered toward landfall just north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville. The winds dropped to 75 mph, down from a recorded 145 mph at the height of the storm’s severity when it ripped across Haiti, killing nearly 900. Matthew whipped the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds as its storm center blew ashore.

As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was one of relief — that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. “We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. “We are blessed that we didn’t have a direct hit.” The powerful hurricane killed at least four people in Florida and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity. (PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS) At least five deaths in Florida and two in Georgia were attributed to the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said three people were killed in his state. Death tolls rises to over 800 in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew The Florida fatalities included an elderly couple in St. Lucie and two women killed in separate incidents as trees crushed their homes. “Now is the time for prayer,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the storm approached. Matthew was approaching Charleston early Saturday, where a curfew was in place between midnight and 6 a.m. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) More than a million people were under evacuation orders in north Florida and Georgia’s coastal regions as roughly 300,000 people fled their homes in South Carolina. “We have been very fortunate that Matthews’s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,” the Hurricane Center said in a forecast statement.

The ravaging storm — the worst to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than 10 years — killed at least 877 people in Haiti and left tens of thousands homeless.

(NICOLAS GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images) Many of the island nation’'s impoverished areas reported that cholera outbreaks were already claiming lives as the storm made its way north. Northern Floridan, Georgia and the Carolinas were still dealing with flood waters in many areas. St. Augustine, Fla., the nation’s oldest European settlement, was experiencing severe flooding that authorities said could exceed 8 feet Saturday. A 17th century Spanish fortress and other historic structures were in the water’s path. The massive storm was expected to severely flood several historic cities across the East Coast of the U.S. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) “It’s a really serious devastating situation,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said. “The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.” Steve Todd, who defied the mayor’s evacuation orders and stayed at his home in Tybee Island — one of the Georgia’s most eastern points — described seeing bushes fly by the windows of his third-story condo, where he hunkered down with friends. “I’m not regretting staying,” he said over the phone. “But I’m not going to lie: There’s a little bit of nervous tension right now.” Stacks of sandbags clogged the streets of Charleston, another historic town lined with colonial homes. Stores and shops in the downtown area had boarded up their windows with plywood and the usually bustling area was eerily quiet as the city announced a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew.

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman Bloomberg     Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lindsey Bever October 8 Follow @lindseybever (York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office) Authorities in eastern Virginia who were responding to a car crash earlier this week inadvertently stumbled upon a mobile meth lab. The York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office said deputies discovered a meth lab inside a minivan Thursday morning when the deputies smelled odors “consistent with the production and manufacturing of methamphetamines” spilling from the vehicle along U.S. Route 17 in York County. Authorities secured the area and rerouted traffic for several hours while lab personnel in Hazmat suits searched the mobile meth lab, police said. They uncovered “items and chemicals used to produce methamphetamines, containers actively cooking methamphetamines, methamphetamine, a syringe and small amount of marijuana,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Sheriff’s office spokesman Lt. Dennis Ivey told The Washington Post “there was stuff mixing up” inside the van when deputies found it. Police said the driver, Robert C. Copley Jr., was charged with manufacturing methamphetamine, conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of marijuana; a 27-year-old woman, Jennifer D. Kendrick, was charged with possession of methamphetamine. Police said Copley is 37 years old, but online booking records indicate that he is 38. The suspects are in custody at Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail, according to booking records. Court-appointed attorneys for Copley and Kendrick were not immediately available for comment. [A suspected meth lab beneath a Walmart parking lot has officials ‘completely astounded’] The Justice Department’s former National Drug Intelligence Center once released warnings about methamphetamine laboratories. It stated: Methamphetamine laboratories may be located virtually anywhere. Laboratories have been found in secluded rural areas as well as in residential, commercial, and industrial districts. Law enforcement officers have seized laboratories at private residences, commercial properties, hotels and motels, and outdoor locations. Mobile laboratories have been discovered in automobiles, boats, and luggage. The agency said that the chemicals used to cook methamphetamine are “extremely hazardous.” Some are highly volatile and may ignite or explode if mixed or stored improperly. Fire and explosion pose risks not only to the individuals producing the drug but also to anyone in the surrounding area, including children, neighbors, and passersby. Even when fire or explosion does not occur, methamphetamine production is dangerous. Simply being exposed to the toxic chemicals used to produce the drug poses a variety of health risks, including intoxication, dizziness, nausea, disorientation, lack of coordination, pulmonary edema, serious respiratory problems, severe chemical burns, and damage to internal organs. One York-Poquoson Sheriff’s deputy at the scene Thursday morning was taken to a hospital and treated for exposure to chemical fumes, though his condition was not life-threatening, police said. Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration shows that there are no other known clandestine meth laboratories in Poquoson or York counties. However, James City County police spokeswoman Stephanie Williams told the Daily Press that law enforcement officers were asked to search a home Thursday afternoon that was connected to the case involving the mobile meth lab. Local and state authorities as well as Tri-Rivers Drug Task Force assisted in the search in Toano, according to the newspaper. Williams did not confirm who lived there, but the York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office said Copley, who was driving the van, lived on the same street. Williams told the Daily Press that authorities did not find any evidence at the residence. Authorities said that the investigation is ongoing and that additional arrests are pending.

At least 10 people were killed across the Southeastern U.S. as the devastating storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and lumbered toward landfall just north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville. The winds dropped to 75 mph, down from a recorded 145 mph at the height of the storm’s severity when it ripped across Haiti, killing nearly 900. Matthew whipped the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds as its storm center blew ashore.

As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was one of relief — that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. “We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. “We are blessed that we didn’t have a direct hit.” The powerful hurricane killed at least four people in Florida and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity. (PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS) At least five deaths in Florida and two in Georgia were attributed to the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said three people were killed in his state. Death tolls rises to over 800 in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew The Florida fatalities included an elderly couple in St. Lucie and two women killed in separate incidents as trees crushed their homes. “Now is the time for prayer,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the storm approached. Matthew was approaching Charleston early Saturday, where a curfew was in place between midnight and 6 a.m. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) More than a million people were under evacuation orders in north Florida and Georgia’s coastal regions as roughly 300,000 people fled their homes in South Carolina. “We have been very fortunate that Matthews’s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,” the Hurricane Center said in a forecast statement.

A disabled woman and her family were some of the many Savannah residents evacuated to Augusta before the deadly storm struck. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) And the power began coming back on for the 1 million people in Florida who were in the dark for roughly 24 hours. Not eveyone was spared. The ravaging storm — the worst to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than 10 years — killed at least 877 people in Haiti and left tens of thousands homeless. LIVE HURRICANE RADAR: 3 dead as Matthew lashes Florida Matthew killed at least 877 people and leveled entire villages in Haiti. (NICOLAS GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images) Many of the island nation’'s impoverished areas reported that cholera outbreaks were already claiming lives as the storm made its way north. Northern Floridan, Georgia and the Carolinas were still dealing with flood waters in many areas. St. Augustine, Fla., the nation’s oldest European settlement, was experiencing severe flooding that authorities said could exceed 8 feet Saturday. A 17th century Spanish fortress and other historic structures were in the water’s path. The massive storm was expected to severely flood several historic cities across the East Coast of the U.S. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) “It’s a really serious devastating situation,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said. “The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.” Steve Todd, who defied the mayor’s evacuation orders and stayed at his home in Tybee Island — one of the Georgia’s most eastern points — described seeing bushes fly by the windows of his third-story condo, where he hunkered down with friends. “I’m not regretting staying,” he said over the phone. “But I’m not going to lie: There’s a little bit of nervous tension right now.” Stacks of sandbags clogged the streets of Charleston, another historic town lined with colonial homes. Stores and shops in the downtown area had boarded up their windows with plywood and the usually bustling area was eerily quiet as the city announced a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew.

Corner Brook champs at chowing down on Chicken McNuggets With several fitness centres and endless hiking trails, Corner Brook could very well be the fittest place in the province — depending on who you ask. Chris Neal has been a personal trainer for 20 years in Corner Brook. (Colleen Connors/CBC) Forever Young Fitness Center is one of three gyms in a city of less than 20,000 people. Chris Neal has been a personal trainer there for almost 20 years. "I think considering the climate [and] the opportunities in Corner Brook, we could well vye for the fittest city in Newfoundland and Labrador," said Neal.  Is Corner Brook the fittest place in the province?0:59 Corner Brook also has a kickboxing studio, several yoga studios, a new CrossFit gym, aerobics classes, a running club and a biking club.  "But the options from indoors to outdoors stuff, we seem to have almost everything covered." - Heather Buckle If residents haven't joined a fitness club, there's also the Corner Brook Stream Trail, which is a popular spot for walkers year-round.  Stephan Mentore was one of many people who woke up before the crack of dawn to line up for a gym membership at 5 Wing Goose Bay. (Jacob Barker/CBC)   But is it fair to say Corner Brook is the fittest city, or does it just have a high concentration of athletic people who are into everything? And, is being fit enough? "I still see a lot of obesity when I am out and about. Especially at the malls. I don't think walking from Dominion to Walmart counts as going for a walk. I think the dietary aspects of healthy living are the biggest challenge for a lot of people in Corner Brook right now," Neal explained.  Happy Valley-Goose Bay only has one gym, with spots for 150 people, for a town of over 7,500. Richelle Weeks is the coach of the Trapper’s Running Club, which takes its training outdoors. (Jacob Barker/CBC) But Heather Buckle disagrees. Buckle opened a fitness studio and teaches pilates. She said the town has caught the fitness bug — and it's only growing. "Its a camaraderie thing. Everyone here uses it as a social thing," she said. "I love that it is that way. It's a beautiful, contagious bug." 1 gym, 1 line And if Corner Brook has an overabundance of gym options, Happy Valley-Goose Bay is most certainly on the opposite end of the spectrum — with just one gym for the entire town. Located on 5 Wing Goose Bay, the town's only gym offers just 150 memberships every three months. Otherwise, it costs $10 per visit. The Trapper's Running Club get outdoors in Happy Valley-Goose Bay to get some exercise. (Jacob Barker/CBC) Some arrive as early as 3:30 a.m. to ensure they snag a three-month membership. Long lines wrap out the door and around the building, long before the gym opens at 6 a.m. "We're all nuts to be here this early in the morning. It's the only way to get a membership b'y," Leo Drake said. "This is a good gym, the staff and everything is great, but just having to do this every three months is a little bit ludicrous, honestly." Gotta get up early to get a gym membership in Happy Valley Goose Bay1:10 "I came to Goose Bay for work and in my spare time work out," said Stephan Mentore, who's from Toronto. "I'm grateful that my employer doesn't mind me coming in a little late today — because I start early — and this gets in the way of work." Walk, run, ride Despite the lack of facilities, people in Goose Bay do find ways to stay fit. Walk Run Ride is an initiative put on by the town, challenging people to travel down every street between now and April.  "The busier people get, the less they get out and do physical activity, so this might just be a goal that will help people stay on course or get on course," said Dean Simon, who put the program together. People can track their progress by tracing the town's streets with a marker as they go.​ Wellness centre According to the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay, there is an overwhelming need for a modern health facility, and said it does have a plan to build a wellness centre. The first phase of that project is to build fitness and aquatic sections, and eventually add an area for ice sports.  It expects the first phase will cost more than $20 million, and the province has committed $11 million toward it. The town said it is working to get funding from the federal government as well.   Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: St. John's Mostly Cloudy 5°C Gander Mostly Cloudy 4°C Deer Lake Mainly Clear 4°C Channel-Port aux Basques 7°C Happy Valley-Goose Bay Light Snowshower -3°C More Weather Latest Nfld. & Labrador News Headlines Got sewer gas?

KG: By Email RSS Feeds: Smartphone Users Are Dialing in Mobile Payments for Convenience and Speed, According to yStats.com Report Germany-based research firm yStats.com has released a new report on the drivers and barriers to mobile payments. The publication Global Mobile Payment Methods: First Half 2016 also provides information on recent mobile payment innovations throughout the globe. Hamburg, Germany, October 08, 2016 --(PR.com)-- The highest value and numbers of usage of mobile payments is for online shopping, but the use of mobile payment in-store is growing; over a billion proximity mobile payment customers are expected globally in the next 3 years. Expansions and product launches leading this trend include Samsung Pay in Brazil, Android Pay in the UK and Walmart Pay in the USA. Still, surveys cited in the yStats.com report show that many shoppers are reluctant to use mobile payments because of concerns about security or simply not seeing an advantage to their use. The convenience and quickness of mobile payments seem to be the main positive features enjoyed by those who have made the move to their use, according to the yStats.com report.

He also served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean conflict. LeRoy worked for Carter Footwear all the way up until his retirement. He was also a very devoted cab driver to his wife, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. You could usually find him at the dance studio or waiting in school parking lots. If he wasn't busy carting his family around, you would probably find him shopping with his wife at Wal-Mart. He was a great help to one and all. He recently celebrated 56 years of marriage to his wife, the former Gloria Krysiewski of Plains Township, whom he married Sept. 3, 1960. LeRoy is survived by his wife, Gloria; his daughter, Brenda Dawsey and her husband, John Dawsey, Shavertown; his grandchildren, Todd, Lauren, Katelyn, Jay and Ian Dawsey; great-grandsons, Colin and Parker; and his sister, Alberta Robinson, Tennessee. He was preceded in death by his mother, Hilda, and his brothers, Ellsworth and Steven. Leroy's Mass of Christian Burial is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Monday in Ss. Peter and Paul Church, Hudson Road, Plains Township, with the Rev. Michael Kloton as celebrant. Interment will be held in Chapel Lawn Burial Park, Dallas, with military honors. Friends and family may call at the church from 8:30 a.m. until the time of Mass on Monday. A special thank you to Hospice of the Sacred Heart, Dr. Paulino, Dr. Belakova and her nurse Kay, the third-floor nursing staff at CLC, the nursing staff on 4 East, and the many other VA and hospice employees who were so caring and kind.

But a few retailers have really missed the mark and gone too far with their getups this season. Walmart and Amazon just pulled costumes, insultingly dubbed "Tranny Granny," from their online stores after being called out for peddling these transphobic ensembles. Just when you think some progress is being made, right? Last week a transgender child actor was featured in an episode of Modern Family, but this week it seems the world has gone backwards again with this poorly conceived costume.  If you're asking yourself, "What could these retailers possibly have been thinking?" You're not alone.   Walmart and Amazon pull #trannygranny costume. You think?! Marginalized identities aren&#39;t for you amusement.&mdash; Sarcastic Misathrope (@beeludwig) October 5, 2016 More from CafeMom: 10 Totally Inappropriate Halloween Costumes for Moms (PHOTOS) On what planet did @Walmart think it was a good idea to do a tranny granny costume? #thehighcost #oflowwages #fuckers #elistists #1percent&mdash; Joseph Aufenthie (@JAufenthie) October 5, 2016 In a statement made to LGBTQNation, Ravi Jariwala of Walmart Media Relations explained that the offensive costume came through a third party marketplace vendor.  "While it's listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified," Jariwala told LGBTQNation. "We're appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with.” More from CafeMom: 25 Best Pregnancy Halloween Costumes The third party vendor, Rasta Imposta, has decided to rename the   costume -- which comes complete with dress, boob and butt pads, and a babushka -- "Manny Granny." A throwback name for an outfit that is far from novel ... and really just as awful. We love seeing original costumes and having a laugh at someone's genuine creativity. Halloween is meant to be a fun holiday -- especially for kids -- and bigotry really has no place in any of it.   Image via Walmart Read More controversial, in the news, halloween Share this Story Share Tweet Pin 2 comments Related Articles Good News Here's Some Good News From 2016 to Remind Us That It Wasn't All...

 Western Union is expanding its presence in Mexico BI Intelligence Oct. 7, 2016, 11:30 PM 881 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Here are the credit card networks you need to know Here's how third-party integration could lift Stripe Exploring the present and future of credit card processing This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Legacy remittance provider Western Union will nearly double the size of its retail locations in Mexico through a new partnership that will bring Western Union services to many locations of OXXO, the country’s largest convenience store chain. Now, OXXO customers will be able to receive funds via a national hotline, in-store phones, or kiosks. As a result of the partnership, which could satisfy digital-savvy customers looking for technology-oriented ways to complete their transfers, Western Union’s network in Mexico will nearly double to 26,200 locations. This is part of what seems like an ongoing Western Union push to expand in Mexico.Western Union recently partnered with Walmart in Mexico to expand its retail pickup locations. This further expansion, which could help the company better reach a wider variety of customers in harder-to-access regions of the country, could bolster the remittance provider’s presence there. Mexico is the fourth-largest remittance recipient worldwide and the most popular destination from the US.  That means that growing its presence there could help Western Union increase its consumer-to-consumer revenue in the Latin America region, thereby growing a key segment of its business. In addition, a bolstered, digital-oriented presence in Mexico could help the remittance market leader remain its stronghold as digital-first providers like Remitly, Transferwise, and Xoom become bigger players in the Mexico space.  Every year, migrants send hundreds of billions of dollars worth of remittances back to friends and family in their home country. And there's a massive industry that facilitates these payments — and has for more than a century. The legacy remittance industry has been long dominated by cash, which requires physical locations where customers can hand over or pick up money. Building out those retail networks is a huge investment. It's left just a few players, called Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), controlling a bulk of the industry. But these companies' comfortable hold on the industry is now being challenged by digital remittance startups. Digital-first remittance companies are competing on fees and usability, and capitalizing on the way people's expectations have changed with the advent of digital and mobile channels. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on digital remittance that sizes the total remittance market, company-specific market share, digital's market share, and digital's growth at major remittance firms. It also assesses how disruptive digital startups have been by comparing their fees with market leaders, and by juxtaposing their business models with those of legacy companies. Here are some of the key takeaways: Digital's share of the global remittance industry is still fairly small at 6% — but growth is extremely fast at digital-first startups and legacy companies. Fourteen year-old Xoom makes more revenue from electronic channels than 75 year-old MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. Startups are undercutting incumbents' fees in certain corridors; however, legacy firms have matched prices in many major corridors. Legacy firms' businesses are already responding to the threats posed by digital by lowering fees and adjusting business strategies. However, they face lower margins if they continue to compete with startups on pricing. In full, the report: Sizes the remittance market and calculates major remittance companies' market share. Estimates digital's share of the market vs. cash. Quantifies digital's impact at remittance startups and legacy firms. Breaks down the business models employed by each type of remittance company, and determines which ones are in a better position for growth. Compares transfer fees in various corridors to assess the competitiveness of each firm. Explores other platforms that could completely upend the industry from the outside.

Daily Edition Login to download John Oliver Takes on Donald Trump's Treatment of Alicia Machado 9:15 AM PDT 10/3/2016 by THR Staff FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of POLITICAL HUMOR The 'Last Week Tonight' host said the presidential candidate had an "online meltdown" with his overnight Twitter spree on Friday. John Oliver devoted a few minutes of Sunday's Last Week Tonight to criticizing Donald Trump for his behavior in the wake of Monday's presidential debate, discussing how Trump was using online surveys to determine he won the debate against Hillary Clinton and highlighting his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Oliver said that Trump really displayed his "winning temperament" by insisting he won when he didn't. “The clear problem with online polls is that you can vote anonymously as many times as you want,” said the Last Week Tonight host. He pointed out that it's how "Boaty McBoatface" won in a British "Name Our Ship" poll and how Pitbull ended up performing at an Alaskan Walmart. “Yet, Trump kept citing these nonsense polls," Oliver added. The host then turned to Trump's treatment of Machado, who he has continued to attack since Clinton brought her up at the debate. He characterized the flurry of tweets Trump sent early Friday morning, including calling for people to look at an alleged sex tape of Machado's, as an "online meltdown." "That is a candidate for President of the United States urging America to check out a sex tape,” said Oliver. “Just do me a favor, look up into the sky right now. Higher, no, higher still. Do you see that? Way up there? Way up above the clouds? That’s rock bottom. And we are currently way down here,” he said. Oliver then aired old footage of Trump and Machado doing an interview at the end of her reign, in which Trump asked people to vote on an online poll on whether a beauty pageant winner should be required to stay the same weight. "It seems you have a choice," said Oliver, addressing Trump. "Either admit unscientific polling is bullshit or that your views on women’s bodies are horrifying."

Fox 54 visited the shelters designated for self-evacuees to see how well they were holding up. Tybee Island resident Hope Barton said, "Being in a hurricane is not on your bucket list." That's an understatement. Barton and her husband drove down to Augusta and spent the night in a Walmart parking lot before making it to a warm shower and a place to lay their heads. Barton said, "The thought of living out of our car for a couple of days was challenging." Challenging for Barton, but ideal for Lyndon Hector. He decided that his car would be the perfect escape from the bustling activity in the Brigham Center as folks filtered in throughout the night. "I couldn't sleep in there because it was too loud," said Hector. Hector and his family had quite the journey from their Savannah home. He said, "We mainly spent our time at Butler High School. Since it was filled with so many people we were sleeping in the car. Then, we went to Trinity on the Hill. Around that time, they were filled with people. So, when we came here, there was plenty of room for us." Hector said noise and all, he's grateful for the experience and the hospitality that the volunteers have shown. Barton said, she couldn't agree more. "You just realize how everybody is the same. We all want to be safe. We all want to return to our homes, our families are all important to us. It just kind of hits you pretty strong when you're in this situation," said Barton. Augusta officials say shelters are still in need of the following items: -Board Games -Toys -Toiletries -Feminine Hygiene Products -Disposable Diapers -Premixed Baby Formula -Baby Wipes -Baby Food -Gallon Sized Ziploc Bags -Blankets If you would like to donate, you can drop the unopened items off at the Old Fire Station #7 located at 2163 Central Avenue in Augusta.

Published Oct 7th, 2016 5:39 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas One of the state’s biggest cheerleaders did his best to convince techies from around the country that Arkansas is a great place to grow a technology company. Gov. Asa Hutchinson spoke at the Northwest Arkansas Technology Summit in Rogers on Friday (Oct. 7). About 1,500 tech professionals attended the summit, more than double the number from last year. Hutchinson said Arkansas’ 3.9% unemployment rate and having the top GDP growth rate in the country in the first quarter of this year are two good reasons tech companies can locate and grow in the Natural State. He said Northwest Arkansas has become a technology center in part because Wal-Mart Stores and Tyson Foods couldn’t have become global companies without employing technology throughout their operations. Sam Dean, executive director for the Scott Family Amazeum, issued some challenges to the local community to focus on growing the local technology sector. Dean said Northwest Arkansas should become the densest, most concentrated STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) community in the country. Incorporating tomorrow’s workforce into the summit, more than 200 local high school students attended the summit from grants made by the Northwest Arkansas Council. Dean followed up asking the Northwest Arkansas business community to be supportive of STEM education and be willing to take calculated risks. Hutchinson said requiring coding be taught in every Arkansas high school had some risks. But two years into the program the biggest increase in students taking computer coding is among females and minorities, Hutchinson shared to a round of applause. Of the 65 speakers at this year’s Technology Summit, just 16.9% were women and 10% were minorities. ‘DIGITAL DISRUPTIONS’ The theme of this year’s conference was “digital disruptions” and Dr. John Cohn, an IBM Fellow, who is also known as the Mad Scientist, gave the crowd a sobering look at what life might look like in 2020 in a connected world run by the Internet of Things (IoT). Dr. John Cohn, IBM Fellow and “Mad Scientist,” spoke on the Internet of Things at the NWA Technology Summit in Rogers on Friday (Oct. 7). Cohn said as chips continue to get smaller and less expensive they will likely help hasten the IoT world. He said IBM is now working on a chip the width of two human hairs, is connected to the cloud and a fully functional computer, encripted with security and privacy and a radio. The cost is just 2 cents. Cohn said the applications for that are huge. “You are not going to be to able to buy a package of food at the store that is not chipped. As the price on this drops this technology is going to be incorporated into many more things. By 2020 scientist are predicting there will be 30 billion of these connected devices that relate to one another, right now there’s about 9 billion. This growth will represent $1.7 trillion in business values and tremendous opportunities,” Cohn said. By 2020 Cohn said there will be as many connected things gathered data together equal to the stars in the known galaxies. Cohn ran through what life might look like with IoT becomes more mainstream. He said imagine lying in bed with your wearables that check your comfort levels and track your health stats to ensure you have a good night’s sleep. The wearables tell the mattress to firm up for more support and you are awaken with a personal and calming message to great the new day. In the bathroom the toilet paper has been replenished because Kimberly Clark knows when you’re running low and automatically reorders. As you look into the mirror it checks your vital signs. As you go to the refrigerator, its notes that you chose the chocolate cake for breakfast, instead of the eggs. Knowing your health status, Cohn said, the refrigerator talks to your doctor who then cues up a prescription at the local pharmacy. “Think about your home watching over you. That is possible today. Next your self-driving car or shared ride through Uber picks you up for work, it knows you have prescription on file so it goes by the pharmacy first. You drive through, pay with your phone, never getting out of the car,” Cohn said. At work Cohn describes an office where robots work side-by-side with humans and he says the robot is starting to connect with his emotions. “After work my ride senses that I need to visit with my mom whose apartment is automated with IoT. Data collected by the IoT in her home have diagnosed symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease – technology available today. And oh by the way it also tells you that she’s dating again, something you might not want to know,” Cohn said. He said IoT will give consumer back time they spend doing some things. Shopping lists can be predicted by refrigerators or recorded by Amazon Echo. Shopping can be done online with scheduled delivery or picked up. He said Walmart’s Scan and Go and WalmartPay mean you don’t have to carry wallet in the stores today. Cohn said the connected world is happening and there’s no putting the genie back in the bottle. The challenge for businesses he said is to know when connectedness is too invasive and creepy. CREEPY OR CONVENIENT? Bill Akins, senior vice president of business innovation at Rockfish, quoting Karen Ann Terrell, Chief Technology Officer at Walmart, said “One person’s creepiness is another person’s convenience.” A frequent traveler, Akins said he signed up for the TSA automatic check-in option. He said it required a grueling background search and he had to give up some privacy to get that option, but it was worth it because he travels often and it’s a time saver. Earlier this year Akins was in Michigan when he contracted the flu. He went to the hospital there to seek a diagnosis. A couple of days later he opted to fly home early and tried to check in via the TSA automatic system. “I was denied check in because they told me I had the flu. I had to wait two more days before I could fly home. On the one hand as a passenger it’s a good thing that sick people can’t fly, but for me I realized quickly that I had given up a lot of my privacy in exchange for the automatic check-in privilege,” he shared. It was evident at the conference how technology is intertwined into every segment of life. sectors presenting at this year’s conference included: State government, health care, retail, supply chain, logistics, small businesses, hospitality, education and finance.

USPS, FedEx, UPS Open October 10? Business 48 0 0 October 9, 2016 Columbus Day Post Office Hours: Is There Mail Delivery Monday? USPS, FedEx, UPS Open October 10? Cheryl P Is the mail delivery on Columbus Day 2016 and will the USPS, FedEx, and UPS deliver packages on Monday, October 10? Many retail stores, and even some banks, will be open on the federal holiday, leaving many people to wonder if it’s business as usual for the U.S. Post Office and other package delivery companies. It's going to take more than unruly weather to stop us from delivering. pic.twitter.com/l6TxMJX6kC — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) October 7, 2016 Columbus Day weekend is typically a big weekend for retailers who offer holiday sales, so that means many people across the U.S. will be working at retail stores and restaurants on the holiday. However, most — but not all — federal employees will have the day off. So, what does that mean for mail and delivery services? Here’s the scoop on what to expect when it comes to Columbus Day mail and package deliveries from the USPS, FedEx, and UPS. Check out the list of 2016/2017 federal holiday below as well. #DidYouKnow our handy satchels have been helping deliver your mail since 1868? #USPS pic.twitter.com/PsczGVF3eV — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) September 29, 2016 It’s business as usual during the holiday weekend leading up to Columbus Day, with letter carriers delivering mail according to their normal schedule on Saturday, October 8 and, according to the USPS, making scheduled Amazon deliveries on Sunday. However, on Monday, October 11, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that most postal employees will have the day off, so that means no mail delivery to homes and businesses until normal operations resume on Tuesday, October 12. Please note — a thread within the Amazon forum indicates that some customers have received packages via the USPS on other federal holidays, so there is a possibility that postal workers will be delivering scheduled Amazon packages on Monday. Check your tracking information for the most accurate information. With the exception of Amazon deliveries that may take place on Monday, regular mail won’t be delivered, and all post office branches will be closed on Monday, so you won’t have access to your post office box on Columbus Day and mail and packages dropped in USPS boxes won’t go out until the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday. What about UPS and FedEx? Will they be delivering packages, and will you be able to drop packages off at one of their local offices on Monday? .@UPS Is Conducting A Vast Rolling Lab Experiment To Create The Clean Truck Of The Future via @forbes https://t.co/JnRaij1FWg pic.twitter.com/EpqejgcNr8 — UPS News (@UPS_News) September 30, 2016 Although the USPS shuts down their branches and regular mail delivery operations on Columbus Day, that’s not the case for both the United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx). On most federal holidays, UPS and FedEx shut down for the day, but deliveries and package drop-off won’t stop Columbus Day. FedEx trucks will be out on the road delivering packages and you can ship a package out (or pick one up that’s being held) from most local Federal Express offices. According to Federal Express, the company provides normal pickup and delivery service on four federal holidays — Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Presidents Day. The same goes for the United Parcel Service. According to the UPS holiday calendar, all packages will be delivered on Monday, October 11 and most UPS stores will be open (call ahead to be sure). It’s business as usual on the next holiday — Veterans Day — as well. According to a previous report from the Inquisitr, several banks will be open on Monday, and malls, restaurants, movie theaters, and big box stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy will be open for business on Columbus Day. Wondering when the next federal holiday just in case you’re lucky enough to have the day off? Here is a list of government holidays coming up for the remainder of 2016 as well as for 2017.

She attacked those same women' Published: 10/09/2016 at 3:35 PM. Updated: 10/10/2016 at 9:08 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton at the second presidential debate By Chelsea Schilling and Garth Kant At the onset of the fiery presidential debate Sunday, GOP nominee Donald Trump dropped the rape bomb on Democrat Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. With “October surprises” sparking fireworks at every turn in the race for the White House – and Americans in more than a dozen states already voting – Trump and Hillary faced off in a second presidential debate, this time held at Washington University in St. Louis. The event was moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News and CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Bill Clinton sits stone-faced as Trump discusses rape accusations during second presidential debate (Photo: Twitter) “It was locker-room talk,” Trump said of a leaked 11-year-old video recording of himself making sexually charged comments about women. “If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was, what he’s done to women, there’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women.” As a seemingly mortified Hillary glared at him, Trump continued: “So, you can say anyway you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women. Attacked them viciously. Four of them are here tonight. “One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client, she represented, got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. “But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight, and I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it’s disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you really want to know the truth.” Hillary declined to address Trump’s specific accusations, instead firing back: “So much of what he said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.” Oddly, a fly landed on her face just as she was responding. Hillary echoed the words of Michelle Obama: “When they go low, you go high.” At the opening of the debate, Cooper accused Trump of “sexual assault” based on the leaked video. “You bragged that you sexually assaulted women, do you understand that?” he asked. Trump said he has “tremendous respect for women” and insisted he has not “done those things.” Hillary told the crowd she has never questioned previous Republican presidential contenders’ fitness to serve. “With Donald Trump, I do,” she said. “We are great because we are good,” Hillary continued. “This is not who we are.” Trump’s guests included Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick along with Clinton accusers Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey. They joined Kathy Shelton, a woman whose alleged rapist was defended by Hillary in 1975. What do YOU think? Who won the second debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Sound off in today’s WND poll Emailgate: ‘You’d be put in jail’ Trump says: If Hillary were a private citizen, this is exactly where she’d be Trump also demand that Hillary apologize for deleting 33,000 emails from her private, unsecured server. And he even vowed he will prosecute her if he wins the presidency. “When you talk about apologies, I think the thing you should really be apologizing for are the 33,000 emails that you deleted. And that you acid washed. And then the two boxes of emails and other things, last week, that were taken from an office and are now missing. And, I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it. And I hate to say it. “But, if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it. And we’re going to have a special prosecutor. “When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails, and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails. “And then you acid wash them, or bleach them, as you would say, a very expensive process, so we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it. Because, you know what? People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And, honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.” Trump accused Hillary of lying. “You think it was fine to delete 33,00 emails? I don’t think so. She said the 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. … “And, more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn’t before; that was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I’ll be honest. I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general, days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. “But, for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 (sic) emails – again, you should be ashamed of yourself, of what you did. Now this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. “If you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail.” In fact, that’s exactly where Trump says he would put Hillary if he were president. Hillary told the crowd, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the laws in our country …” “Because you’d be in jail,” Trump fired back, eliciting wild cheers from the audience. Watch the comment:  Paid speeches? Hillary throws Honest Abe under the bus Asked a question about Wikileaks’ release of Hillary’s paid speeches, and whether politicians should be “two-faced” by have differing positions in public and private, the Democrat candidate appeared to blame America’s 16th president for her shifting statements. “As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steve Spielberg movie called ‘Lincoln.’ It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do. “You have to keep working at it and, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people. He used some arguments. Convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great, I thought, a great display of presidential leadership.” Then Hillary diverted to Russia’s alleged hacking attacks “to influence our election.” “We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence an election. Hillary claimed Russia wants Trump elected and said, “We deserve answers.” She called on Trump to release his tax returns so America will know more about his associations. Trump shot back: “So ridiculous. Now she’s blaming. She got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman-Sachs and everybody else, and she said something that Wikileaks, just came out, and she lied. “She lied and now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln,” Trump said, prompting laughter from the crowd. He pointed at Hillary, “OK, Honest Abe. Honest Abe never lied. And that’s the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.” What do YOU think? Who won the second debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Sound off in today’s WND poll Trump on Muslim immigration and ‘extreme vetting’ Trump received a question from Radditz about his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration: “Mr. Trump in December you said this: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice, we have no choice. Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religions test?” “The Muslim ban is something that, in some form, has morphed into extreme vetting,” Trump explained. Radditz interrupted, “And why did it morph into that? Answer the question. …” “Why do you side with her?” Trump asked the purportedly unbiased moderator. “You interrupt me all the time. Why don’t you interrupt her?” Radditz replied, “Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?” “It’s called extreme vetting,” Trump said. “We are going to areas like Syria, where they are coming in by the tens of thousands, because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like … we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about are country is (sic), and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan Horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. “I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them. As an example, the Gulf States, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money. And take care of people. But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has, and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values. We know nothing about their love for our country.” ‘Criminal illegal aliens’ Trump pledged that he would force the home countries of “criminal illegal aliens” to take their offenders back. “Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don’t want them. In some cases, they’re murders, drug lords, [they have] drug problems, and they don’t want ’em. “And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that’s OK, we can’t force [them] into their county. Let me tell you, I’m going to force them right back into their country. “They’re murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you, very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen. “We’re also letting drugs pour through our border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn’t be allowed to happen.” What do YOU think? Who won the second debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Sound off in today’s WND poll Hillary ‘has tremendous hate in her heart’ At one point in the debate, a black man asked Trump, “My question is, ‘Do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?'” Trump replied, “Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable. A large group. And irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I will be a president that will turn our inner cities around.” Trump said he will improve the economy for Americans and bring jobs back to the U.S. “And we’ll bring jobs back. Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster, trade deal, in the history of the world. It stripped us on manufacturing jobs. “And now she wants to sign TPP. Even though she says now [she’s against] it. She called it the gold standard. And, by the way, at the last debate she lied, because it turns out that she did say the gold standard. And she said she didn’t say that. “They actually said she lied. OK? And she lied. She’s lied about a lot of things.” Trump walked over to Hillary and looked directly at her. “I would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what’s happening to our inner cities. She’s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it nothing happens. “She doesn’t get it done. Same with the Latino Americans. The Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk. They don’t get it done. “We have a divided nation because of people like her. And, believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And, when she said deplorables, she meant it.” Hillary’s jaw dropped, then she smiled nervously. “And when she said irredeemable, irredeemable, you (moderator) didn’t mention that, but when she said they’re irredeemable, to me, that might have been even worse,” Trump said. Cooper interjected: “She said some of them are irredeemable.” Trump continued, “She’s got tremendous hatred. And this country can not take another four years of Barack Obama, and that’s what you’re getting with her.” Closing question: What do you respect about each other? At the end of the debate, a man asked Trump and Hillary: “Regardless of the current rhetoric, would each of you say one positive thing that you respect in one another?” “I think that is a very fair and important question,” Hillary replied. “Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that, as a mother and a grandmother, is very important to me.” After Hillary’s answer, it was Trump’s turn. “I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment. But it is. I’m very proud of my children. They’ve done a wonderful job and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. “I will say this about Hillary: She doesn’t quit. She doesn’t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She’s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. “I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard and she doesn’t quit and she doesn’t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.” What do YOU think? Who won the second debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? Sound off in today’s WND poll ‘Rapist’ Clinton: Women say they’re ‘terrified’ of Hillary As WND reported, two explosive videos were released on Sunday from several women who say they were victims of sexual assault and rape at the hands of Bill Clinton. The first was from Arkansas registered nurse Juanita Broaddrick, who recounted what she described as her brutal rapes by then-state Attorney General Bill Clinton. “He grabs me, and turns me to him. And that was a shock. And I tried to push him away. And I only weighed about 120 pounds at that time. He was a very large man. And I kept telling him, ‘No. I don’t want this at all. And he grabbed me again, very forcefully. And started biting on my top lip. And this was extremely painful. I thought he was going to bite my lip off. And that’s when he pushed me back onto the bed.” “You are still afraid of him?” asked Breitbart News’ Aaron Klein. “Yes,” she said. “That I am still afraid. Especially if she becomes president. And I know it’s looking that way. So it’s frightening, Aaron. It’s frightening.” Juanita Broaddrick says she was raped by Bill Clinton (courtesy Breitbart video) Also Sunday came a separate video of Broaddrick along with Clinton accusers Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones, describing their “terrified” feelings about the Clintons. The Broaddrick accusation has begun to catch fire with the public. Several times, recently, hecklers at Clinton rallies have shouted remarks about Bill Clinton being a rapist. It happened again Saturday and Clinton’s reaction was caught on video. “Nobody can dispute the fact …” Clinton started to say to the audience, at which point the heckler jumped in to finish the sentence, “… that you are a rapist!” “Oh, yeah?” Clinton said quietly. He told the crowd not to worry about the outburst, while repeatedly thanking them for defending his honor. “You gotta feel sorry for him – they had a bad day yesterday, so they’re trying to make it up,” Clinton joked. “This is what is the matter with politics. When other people pour poison down your throat, don’t drink it.” Bill Clinton reacts to being called a “rapist” while campaigning for his wife Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016. Trump’s sexually charged comments in 2005 WND also reported this weekend that the Washington Post published a leaked 11-year-old video recording of Trump Friday making sexually charged comments about women and talking about his failed attempt to bed a married woman. “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women – I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet,” Trump said in the 2005 video, which was covertly recorded. “Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the (expletive).” After the video aired, Trump reportedly holed up Saturday in his Manhattan tower for debate prep as a parade of Republicans denounced his comments – and some called on him to step aside as the GOP presidential nominee. The response followed a statement and video apology from Trump: “I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize. “I have traveled the country talking about change for America, but my travels have also changed me. I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. “Let’s be honest, we’re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we’re facing today. “We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.” A Politico/Morning Consult poll released after the Trump video was leaked showed 74 percent of Republicans say GOP leaders should continue to back Trump.

Hillary’s transcripts: Lies, ‘open borders,’ Blackberries As WND reported, while the Big Media focused on the covert audio conversation by Trump from a decade ago, Wikileaks emails, mostly pertaining to her campaign manager John Podesta, released late Friday provided insight into Clinton’s highly paid insider speeches to bankers. Clinton campaign manager John Podesta told Fox News the documents are bogus. Among the revelations: She said it’s necessary for politicians to hold public positions that are actually different from their private ones – those presumably held for actual governance. Clinton supports North American Union – a merger between the U.S., Mexico and Canada – similar to the European Union. Clinton relished the fact that she had graduated from the middle class, is “far removed” from it, and now enjoys “fortunes” with her husband, Bill. Clinton spoke openly about her need to raise money from Wall Street for her political campaigns, ignoring issues of whether or not that compromised her as a candidate necessarily beholding to serve the corporate interests of multi-national corporations. The speeches show Clinton was aware Blackberries were not secure communication devices, though she used them routinely as secretary of state, including on foreign trips. Clinton blamed Moammar Gadhafi and foreign mercenaries for the terrorism that plagues Libya after she sided radical jihadi militia aligned with al-Qaida to topple Gadhafi from power – even though he had expressed a willingness to step aside peacefully. Clinton admitted backing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Clinton claimed to have threatened China to surround it with missile defenses if China continued to allow North Korea to develop nuclear weapons and inter-continental ballistic missile systems – a bluff not kept. Clinton admitted the inevitability of Saudi Arabia getting nuclear weapons. The Clinton Foundation held a meeting at Goldman Sachs headquarters June 6, 2014. What do YOU think?

USPS, FedEx, UPS Open October 10? Business 48 0 0 October 9, 2016 Columbus Day Post Office Hours: Is There Mail Delivery Monday? USPS, FedEx, UPS Open October 10? Cheryl P Is the mail delivery on Columbus Day 2016 and will the USPS, FedEx, and UPS deliver packages on Monday, October 10? Many retail stores, and even some banks, will be open on the federal holiday, leaving many people to wonder if it’s business as usual for the U.S. Post Office and other package delivery companies. It's going to take more than unruly weather to stop us from delivering. pic.twitter.com/l6TxMJX6kC — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) October 7, 2016 Columbus Day weekend is typically a big weekend for retailers who offer holiday sales, so that means many people across the U.S. will be working at retail stores and restaurants on the holiday. However, most — but not all — federal employees will have the day off. So, what does that mean for mail and delivery services? Here’s the scoop on what to expect when it comes to Columbus Day mail and package deliveries from the USPS, FedEx, and UPS. Check out the list of 2016/2017 federal holiday below as well. #DidYouKnow our handy satchels have been helping deliver your mail since 1868? #USPS pic.twitter.com/PsczGVF3eV — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) September 29, 2016 It’s business as usual during the holiday weekend leading up to Columbus Day, with letter carriers delivering mail according to their normal schedule on Saturday, October 8 and, according to the USPS, making scheduled Amazon deliveries on Sunday. However, on Monday, October 11, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that most postal employees will have the day off, so that means no mail delivery to homes and businesses until normal operations resume on Tuesday, October 12. Please note — a thread within the Amazon forum indicates that some customers have received packages via the USPS on other federal holidays, so there is a possibility that postal workers will be delivering scheduled Amazon packages on Monday. Check your tracking information for the most accurate information. With the exception of Amazon deliveries that may take place on Monday, regular mail won’t be delivered, and all post office branches will be closed on Monday, so you won’t have access to your post office box on Columbus Day and mail and packages dropped in USPS boxes won’t go out until the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday. What about UPS and FedEx? Will they be delivering packages, and will you be able to drop packages off at one of their local offices on Monday? .@UPS Is Conducting A Vast Rolling Lab Experiment To Create The Clean Truck Of The Future via @forbes https://t.co/JnRaij1FWg pic.twitter.com/EpqejgcNr8 — UPS News (@UPS_News) September 30, 2016 Although the USPS shuts down their branches and regular mail delivery operations on Columbus Day, that’s not the case for both the United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx). On most federal holidays, UPS and FedEx shut down for the day, but deliveries and package drop-off won’t stop Columbus Day. FedEx trucks will be out on the road delivering packages and you can ship a package out (or pick one up that’s being held) from most local Federal Express offices. According to Federal Express, the company provides normal pickup and delivery service on four federal holidays — Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Presidents Day. The same goes for the United Parcel Service. According to the UPS holiday calendar, all packages will be delivered on Monday, October 11 and most UPS stores will be open (call ahead to be sure). It’s business as usual on the next holiday — Veterans Day — as well. According to a previous report from the Inquisitr, several banks will be open on Monday, and malls, restaurants, movie theaters, and big box stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy will be open for business on Columbus Day. Wondering when the next federal holiday just in case you’re lucky enough to have the day off? Here is a list of government holidays coming up for the remainder of 2016 as well as for 2017. Columbus Day – October 10, 2016 Veterans Day – November 11, 2016 Thanksgiving Day – November 24, 2016 Christmas Day – December 25, 2016 (observed Monday, December 26) New Year’s Day – January 1, 2017 (observed Monday, January 2) Martin Luther King, Jr. Day – January 16, 2017 George Washington’s Birthday – February 20, 2017 Memorial Day – May 29, 2017 Independence Day – July 4, 2017 Labor Day -September 4, 2017 Columbus Day – October 9, 2017 Veterans Day – November 11, 2016 (observed November 10) Thanksgiving Day – November 23, 2017 Christmas Day – December 24, 2017 [Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Amazon Launches First Ever Branded Cargo Plane Now Read This: Apple, iPhone, And iOS Mastermind Steve Jobs Is Still Making An Impact: Learn About His Legacy Share 48 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Cheryl P Tags: columbus day, fedex, UPS, usps Comments LATEST HEADLINES Song Hye-Kyo Shares A Romantic Moment With Song Joong-Ki During Her Fan Meet; Actress Gets Emotional New Zealand Hit By Magnitude 6.2 Aftershock Hours After String Of Powerful Earthquakes Kill 2 ‘Overwatch’ Strike: Crispin Freeman Talks Negotiation With Activision, EA, & More Catelynn Lowell Talks Mental Illness On ‘The Doctors,’ Discusses Divorce Rumors Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Strong Contenders To Host Oscars 2017 2016 College Football Playoff Rankings: Predicting Top 4 Teams After Week 11 Action Reince Priebus Named Chief Of Staff By Donald Trump In Controversial Move NBA Trade Rumors: Shaquille O’Neal Hints Demarcus Cousins on Trading Block ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date Stahl-Trump Interview: Up To Three Million Deportations, Special Prosecutor For Clinton Possible [Video] Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Delivered To Your INBOX Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Email Address Or follow us online Facebook Twitter Google-plus Rss Follow Inquisitr Trending Stories Barron Trump, America’s First Son In The White House Since John F.

And it turns out those companies spending big bucks investing in Washington see huge rewards. That's all at the expense of the American taxpayer… but we'll get to that next. First, we'll show you how nothing beats — or even comes close — to gains wrought from corporate welfare… Political Spending Yields the Biggest Returns by Far In 2014, the Sunlight Foundation, a non-partisan nonprofit a group that wants government transparency, conducted a study of political spending over the 2007 to 2012 period. It looked at the lobbying expenditures and campaign donations of the 200 companies most politically active in the United States- and in particular, what each got in return. Results showed the political spending of the 200 companies it identified was about $5.8 billion over the six years. In return, those companies got an astounding $4.4 trillion in corporate welfare. Put another way, every dollar of political spending generated a return on investment of $760 for these private companies. That's a gain of 76,000% over just six years. These figures may seem incredulous, but changes in government policy can have a tremendous impact on a company's profits. Companies that land government contracts are doing business with the most lucrative client in the world. And because the period of the study encompassed the 2008 financial crisis, generous bailouts also were part of the mix. "As middle-class Americans lost ground, the 'Fixed Fortune 200' got what they needed. What they needed included loans that helped automakers and banks survive the recent recession while many homeowners went under," the Sunlight Foundation study said. "It included budget busting emergency measures that funneled extra dollars to everything from defense contractors to public utility companies to financial industry giants."

Read more… Over the six-year period, the 200 companies in the study won a third of the money doled out in $3 billion worth of government contracts. And they got 73% of the $410 billion distributed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Sunlight Foundation study also found that the corporate welfare firehose flowed just as generously when Democrats were in power as it did when Republicans were in power. Likewise, the political spending favored neither party, as the companies are less interested in influencing who gets elected than having influence over the winners. The 200 companies in the study include most major industries, including energy, banking, technology, healthcare, entertainment, and consumer goods. Many are household names, such as Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD), United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). And several of these iconic companies received king-sized amounts of corporate welfare, much more than the average for the 200 in the study. But here's the real kicker: Over the same period in the Foundation's study (2007 to 2012), individual taxpayers contributed $6.5 trillion to the U.S. Treasury. That means this corporate welfare swallowed up about two-thirds of that. You see, the bulk of the hundreds of billions of dollars bestowed on these mega-corporations comes from the taxes drawn from the average working American. This is where your tax dollars are really going… Companies Receiving the Most Corporate Welfare Join the conversation.

Waynesboro man caught after 7 months on the run Laura Peters , lpeters@newsleader.com 11:34 a.m. EDT October 9, 2016 David Allen Underwood II (Photo: Submitted/Waynesboro Police Department) WAYNESBORO - A Waynesboro man is now in jail after seven months on the run. The Waynesboro Police Department arrested David Allen Underwood II, 33, on several charges early Saturday morning staying at his girlfriend’s house on 2nd Street in Waynesboro. An anonymous tipster gave officers his whereabouts so officers were able to find him, a release said. Since late February, officers had tracked Underwood to West Virginia but were unable to arrest him. At some point he returned to Waynesboro and had been hiding in residences in the city’s Philippines neighborhood for several weeks, a release said. THE NEWS LEADER Man found dead at Skyline Motel Around 3 a.m. Saturday officers arrested him without incident. Underwood was arrested on the following charges: Burglary (felony) Grand Larceny (felony) Obtain Money by False Pretenses (misdemeanor) Shoplifting (misdemeanor)  Capias/Failure to Appear for Trial (misdemeanor) Capias/Probation Violations (felony) The burglary and felony theft charges stem from a stolen power tools case in April 2016, a release said.  Underwood was also wanted for shoplifting from Walmart in February 2016. Underwood is being held at Middle River Regional Jail without bond. THE NEWS LEADER Claudius Crozet Blue Ridge Tunnel Tour Follow Laura Peters @peterslaura and @peterpants.

Sunday brought the sound of chainsaws as crews and residents continued to clear roadways and yards of trees. Utility crews worked on power lines in Beaufort, Port Royal and the Sea Islands. A 7 p.m. curfew remained in place Sunday evening throughout Beaufort County. State transportation officials cleared all of northern Beaufort County’s bridges for travel except Harbor River Bridge. Government offices and Beaufort County schools will be closed through at least Tuesday. Beaufort’s City Council meeting scheduled Tuesday was canceled. Beaufort Memorial Hospital’s emergency room reopened at noon Sunday. Opening the facility and restoring power to essential areas were among the issues Beaufort County emergency personnel addressed ahead of re-entry. Power crews worked throughout northern Beaufort County to clear trees from power lines and restore the power grid. Beaufort Memorial Hospital experienced some leaking due to rain, but the issues have been repaired, hospital spokeswoman Courtney McDermott said Sunday. The hospital is running on full power, and outpatient medical services could reopen by Tuesday, president and CEO Russell Baxley said. Gov. Nikki Haley at a news conference Sunday said the hospital sustained structural and flooding damage. Beaufort-Port Royal firefighters went door-to-door assessing damages to homes and businesses, keeping a log at their Ribaut Road headquarters. The city’s building code contractor will follow up on the list and arrived Sunday morning to begin looking at flood damage in problem areas like Mossy Oaks and the Point neighborhood downtown. Port Royal’s building inspector will conduct a similar process, but there is less damage than in the city, Town Manager Van Willis said. The highest water mark they had found as of lunchtime Sunday was 2  1/2 feet in a garage on Battery Creek Road. The Port Royal Public Works Department worked with the Greenery to clear about 30 locations where trees are blocking roads, Willis said. In most cases, there is access to homes and businesses, he said. Greenery employees picked up debris in Naval Heritage Park and throughout Old Village on Sunday. The town remains under a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. Meanwhile, some businesses began showing signs of life. The Shell gas station at First Boulevard and Ribaut Road began pumping Sunday, and some gas was reported on Boundary Street. Lady’s Island Publix was open Sunday, restricting the number of customers initially. Lowe’s, Walmart and Golden Corral on Robert Smalls Parkway were working to reopen Sunday. Beaufort Pharmacy and Compounding across from Beaufort Memorial Hospital is open. Emergency officials expect medical calls to begin once people return and begin working around their homes or living near trees weakened by the storm. “Beware you might come back to a home you can’t stay in,” Beaufort-Port Royal Fire Chief Reece Bertholf said.

So my complaint would not be that the minimum wage is too high or too low, but that all of this bother and bluster negotiating a minimum wage level is time and effort ill-spent The practical reality is that neither are right, and they would probably further their respective causes more effectively if they pressed more credible claims. Why is neither right? Countering the labour claims, the great majority of people in our workforce earn incomes that are multiples higher than the minimum wage. Whatever the outcome of the minimum wage negotiation, there will be no impact on their lives. The great majority of Hong Kong’s poor struggle not because of a low minimum wage but because they are elderly, retired and infirm, or because they have part time or irregular employment. Out of the total of 2.5 million households in Hong Kong, just 370,000 are not “economically active” (that is, they contain retired, infirm or unemployed people) and it is here that poverty is concentrated. Of the poorest households earning HK$6,000 a month or less more than three quarters are concentrated on the elderly or unemployed – 290,000 of the 370,000. The reality is that whatever the minimum wage level, it will do nothing to help these people struggling at the bottom of Hong Kong society. Since the introduction of the minimum wage at HK$28 in 2011, the new rate of HK$34.5 from May next year will mean the minimum has risen by 23 per cent over the past five years. If the minimum wage were in any way materially important to our workforce, a 23 per cent improvement would imply massive real improvements in livelihoods. This clearly has not been the case. Inequality and severe hardship among Hong Kong’s poorest is as acute today as it has ever been. The causes of our poverty problems sit elsewhere, and haggling over minimum wage levels will contribute little. As for the threats and warnings of our employers, the evidence of the five years since May 2011 when a HK$28 an hour minimum wage was first set, has shown their forebodings to be preposterously hollow. Rather than see redundancies and higher unemployment since 2011, joblessness has fallen steadily over the past decade – from a peak of 307,000 during SARS in 2003, down to 141,000 in August this year. Bankruptcies peaked in Hong Kong in 2003 at 25,000 and despite a blip up to 16,000 in 2009 after the global financial crash they have never since risen above 10,000 a year. It is true that profits have been under pressure over the past five years for many companies in Hong Kong, but that has more to do with the poor state of the global trading economy since the 2008 financial sector crash than any influence from minimum wage. And Hong Kong continues to be regarded as one of the most ferociously competitive economies in the world. So my complaint would not be that the minimum wage is too high or too low, but that all of this bother and bluster negotiating a minimum wage level is time and effort ill-spent. Instead we need to recognise that Hong Kong is a highly specialised and high cost economy where average wages must inevitably be high in order to enable families financially to survive here. In general terms, if a company’s competitiveness rests on such low wage levels then it should probably not be operating in Hong Kong in the first place. For any employer seriously reliant on such immiserating salary levels, he or she should take careful note of developments occurring elsewhere. At the end of last year, Shenzhen’s minimum wage was equivalent to HK$20, and in Shanghai it was HK$24. This may be lower than Hong Kong’s minimum, but nowadays not by very much. Beijing has been deliberately lifting the wage minimum nationwide since 2000 by between 12 per cent and 18 per cent a year – in the teeth of protests from employers – with the specific aim of giving workers more spending power to build a stronger national consumer base. In the US, where the Federal minimum wage is US$7.50, a number of fiercely competitive retailers have raised minimum wages significantly. For example, Walmart imposed its own wage minimum of US$10 an hour, with the aim of raising this quickly to US$13. This has added US$1 billion to its annual wage bill. But set against revenues of US$486 billion last year, the company says this is a small price to pay for more loyal and committed staff, lower job turnover, and reduced spending on training for new recruits. In truth, there are few major economies worldwide that are not currently wringing their hands over the challenges facing their communities’ poorly paid, and how most appropriately to respond. In Switzerland, this took the form of a formal referendum on whether to introduce a national basic wage to all citizens, regardless of whether they work or not (voters firmly rejected the idea). In the UK and the US where the travails of the blue-collar middle – who have seen so few improvements in their livelihoods over the past three decades – have poisoned local politics, the arguments have moved on from minimum wages and welfare measures to job-protection and barriers against foreign workers. So we have to acknowledge that persistent poverty, and gaping inequality in communities like Hong Kong, are realities that have to be addressed, not blocked or ignored. This means acknowledging that minimum wages need to rise. But more important, it means recognising that minimum wages – set at any level you like – do virtually nothing to address the fundamental problems facing our struggling poor.

Writer-director Andrea Arnold (left) found cast member Sasha Lane at the beach. Photo: Chris Pizzello, Associated Press ‘American Honey’ from spring break to screen 1 / 2 Back to Gallery It’s commonplace to hear an actor describe a movie role as “life-changing,” but there’s not a hint of cliche in Sasha Lane’s description of the unlikely journey that began with her spring break trip with friends in 2015, when she was a college freshman with no acting experience, and culminated a year later with her walking the red carpet in Cannes as the breakout star of British director Andrea Arnold’s road-odyssey movie, “American Honey.” “My life is completely different now than it was before Andrea found me,” Lane, a Dallas native, said during a recent visit to San Francisco a day before her 21st birthday. “I have hope now as a person, and I didn’t have any before. Now it feels like everything was meant to happen, but there’s no way I could have seen all this coming my way. It’s ... wow.” Retelling a story that may go down in Hollywood lore as the Millennial version of Lana Turner’s discovery at a Los Angeles lunch counter, Lane says she was “just hanging out with some friends on the beach” in Panama City, Fla., when Arnold (“Fish Tank,” “Wuthering Heights”) and her casting agent approached the 19-year-old Lane about their new movie. “Andrea said she saw something in me, my spirit, how I was with my friends, my look,” says Lane. She has long dreadlocks piled into a neat bun, and small tattoos on every finger of one hand. “It was definitely weird, but something in me said, ‘Just listen. Follow it.’ And the really bizarre thing is that I had told a friend right before the trip that I thought something amazing was going to happen to me. I was putting that out into the universe, so it made me more open to listening to Andrea instead of saying, ‘Get out of my face.’ Also, since I had never wanted to pursue acting, I wasn’t thinking about the fact that I don’t even like attention on me, or cameras.” Little did Lane know when she showed up a few weeks later to begin the shoot in Muskogee, Okla., that she wasn’t only embarking on a new three-month-long adventure, but that her character, a runaway teen named Star, would appear in almost every scene of the nearly three-hour movie, often in luminous close-ups. A pop- and hip-hop-filled portrait of marginalized American youth, “American Honey” was inspired by a 2007 New York Times article about “mag crews” of itinerant down-and-out teens. They drive cross-country peddling magazine subscriptions door-to-door to make ends meet, working long hours during the day and partying hard together in cheap motels at night. Lane’s character, Star, is first seen digging through a trash bin for food for her two younger siblings. She jumps at the chance to leave her troubled home life behind and run off with the ragtag group of teens she meets outside a Kmart. Their enigmatic drifter-leader, Jake, played by Shia LaBeouf, flirts and tells her, “We’ll see America.” Arnold, who won her third Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize for “American Honey,” cast 11 of the film’s 15 main roles with non-actors. She found them, as she has for all her films, doing what she calls “street casting” in Walmart parking lots, truck stops and county fairs. Lane says the entire cast, all ages 18-23, “quickly got comfortable with each other. We didn’t feel any difference” between the amateur actors and veterans like Riley Keough (“The Girlfriend Experience”), Elvis Presley’s granddaughter, who plays the sales team’s hardened boss, Krystal, and LaBeouf, Lane’s on-screen love interest. Much of the movie is shot (almost documentary-style, by cinematographer Robbie Ryan) inside the teens’ traveling van, as they sing, drink, smoke, nap and flirt their way across the heartland. (They drove 11,500 miles while shooting.) Those confined shots alternate with broad American vistas of sun-drenched rural beauty as well as grim poverty and 21st century economic decline. Co-producer Julia Oh, who lived on the road with the actors during the entire production, said at a California Film Institute screening in San Rafael that the film’s unusual 4:33 aspect ratio was used because “Andrea had seen too many beautified, romanticized, Terrence Malick-style versions of America onscreen. She’s trying to ground us instead into the version of the country which isn’t polished in that way.” “I am very much of this world the film shows,” says Lane. Her father, a truck driver, is African American. Her mother is from New Zealand. “I didn’t have many opportunities, and I wasn’t told, ‘You can do anything.’ What I heard was, ‘The way you look, you can only go so far.’ That’s why I connected to this so deeply and was able to be vulnerable, perform the way I did.” Jessica Zack is a freelance writer who frequently covers art and film for The San Francisco Chronicle.

Probably Not, Because Most of the Media Have Ignored It The prison strike didn’t merit a single mention in NYT, Washington Post, NPR, CNN or MSNBC. Thousands of prisoners in over 24 states began a labor strike on September 9, the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising, to demand better conditions and healthcare, the right to unionize and what one organizing group calls an “end to slavery in America.” But one would hardly know it watching major U.S. media, which has mostly ignored the largest prison labor strike in history. One week on, the New York Times, Washington Post, NBC News, ABC News, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, and NPR have not covered the prison strikes at all. In the same time period since the strike began, CNN has run stories on Clinton’s “body double,” the New York Times ran a piece on women getting buzzcuts and ABC News had an “exclusive trailer” for its parent corporation Disney’s upcoming film. There was certainly enough airtime and column inches to mention that workers had coordinated a national strike of unprecedented scale, but for these outlets the coverage has been nonexistent. A handful of national outlets have covered the strike: The Nation, City Lab,Engadget, Money Watch, Buzzfeed, and as of Thursday, the Wall Street Journal, but every other major publication, network news and cable network has thus far been silent. When we spoke by phone, Azzurra Crispino, media co-chair of Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, one of the strike organizers, was hesitant to be too hard on the press out of hope the strikes would lose coverage in the future. But after some prompting, the four-year prison abolitionist veteran listed a few measured grievances at the media. Her most consistent theme was that to the extent the strikes were being covered, the focus was on spectacle over substance, and in doing so the media was making nonviolent resistance all but impossible. “I’m a pacifist, I would like to see the strikes remain nonviolent,” Crispino told AlterNet. “Yet in terms of the mainstream press coverage when there’s blood on the ground the prisons have to fill out reports that guards were hurt so then they can’t deny strikes occurred,” she said in reference to the stonewalling of prison officials. The few reporters Crispino had spoken to said most prison spokespeople denied any strikes were taking place. “Between prisoners and TDCJ [Texas Department of Criminal Justice], who do you think reporters are going to believe?” she asked. The power asymmetry and the media’s default position of siding with government officials over those seen as criminals creates just one more barrier to coverage. At its core, coverage of the prison strikes, as with any protest action, has an inherently perverse incentive structure that puts a premium on acts of violence and property damage and overlooks non-telegenic peaceful activity, such as hunger strikes and labor stoppages. This dynamic was seen in the Standing Rock incident on September 3, when private security sicced dogs on Native American activists protesting an oil pipeline, and pictures of injured protesters went viral on social media. At the time, only Democracy Now, a relatively small left-wing news show, and AP and UPI filed original reports on the incident. Days after what the media called “clashes,” articles appeared with far greater frequency, including in major outlets like New York Times, CNN and NBC. This warped incentive structure is even more pronounced in prisons, which are by definition cut off from society. The only time anyone bothers to notice prisons is when demonstrably violent action takes place. “Which of the strikes are getting the most attention? Florida because they’re violent,” Crispino says, in reference to the September 7 uprising at Homes Correctional facility in the Florida panhandle. “They can’t deny in Florida because prisoners are setting things on fire and there’s been so much structural damage they can’t deny strikes are occurring.” A similar dynamic is at work when prisoners are in solitary confinement or engage in body mutilation or destruction of property, often by flooding their cells or covering them with feces or blood. Similarly, Crispino contends, each time the media ignores peaceful activities, it tips the scales further in the direction of fires, property damage and rioting. But this reason doesn’t fully explain the lack of mainstream coverage. A few outlets, as noted, have covered the strike to the extent they could, especially in the buildup to the protest, so it’s not as if there wasn’t enough information to compile a story. One possible reason is that some of corporate media’s biggest advertisers use prison labor, so the disincentive to shine a light on the problem is high. AT&T, Bank of America, Chevron, Eli Lilly, GEICO, McDonald’s, and Walmart all use prison labor and all are sponsors of corporate media so much we can recite their commercials by heart. One corporation that uses prison labor, Verizon, even owns major media outlets Yahoo and Huffington Post. Russia Today, a Moscow-funded media outlet, was the only cable news network to speak with Crispino, and to the best of her knowledge, the only one to cover the strikes. When Donald Trump appeared on RT last week, there was a frenzy of outrage by mainstream pundits, with some questioning why Trump would give credence to “Russian government-controlled propaganda.” RT’s position has always been that it covers stories the mainstream press doesn’t, and while some may see this as a cynical marketing ploy, in the case of the prison strikes it also happens to be true. Another issue for IWOC is that all the coverage thus far, even in sympathetic outlets, has ignored their broader political aims, which is prison abolition, not reform. “The IWOC is an abolitionist organization,” Crispino said. “Abolition is pretty much completely ignored. It’s interesting because people ask questions about that and they ask what would you do instead, but no one wants to hear that and they never write about it.” That the media is allergic to ideology, to having deeper discussions about our society’s core axioms and why the U.S. has 25% of the world’s prison population but 5% of the total population, is perhaps too knotty for a 800-word writeup but for those working in the trenches it can be frustrating. As the strike enters its second week, perhaps major media outlets and cable news will take a cue from activist media and the Wall Street Journal (whose report is worth reading) and shine a light, if only briefly, on the largest prison strike in history. If not, Crispino feels other tactics will eventually become more commonplace. “I almost want to say, the mainstream media is complicit if there’s violence. The message they are sending to striking workers is, we will only give you coverage if things turn ugly.” ( Article by: Danny F.

That means it's time for another. Yes, starting tomorrow, all Toysrus stores in canada, as well as their online store, will have a 25% discount on all Transformers toys of $14.99 and up. But this excludes Fortress Maximus (no!) and all Playschool products (noooo!). Wave 2 of Titans Return has been trickling ever so slowly across the nation so it might be time to check out your stores and get rainchecks in case you don't see the toys you want. Also, this deal is still not as great as Walmart's recent price drop on Titans Return deluxes. UPDATE: Fortress maximus is actually part of the sale as well and he can be purchased online for $172.47.

Well, Walmart has finally decided to sell them online with all four wave 2 deluxes (Wolfwire, Highbrow, Chromedome and Mindwipe) currently available on walmart.ca. While Toysrus.ca does not have them yet, they have a big 25% off sale on all Transformers in store (including Playskool for once, but not toys already on liquidation). Maybe this will help sell the ton of Combiner Wars boxsets that haven't moved yet.

This was learnt first hand as I walked into Toysrus today, seeking a raincheck for the deal they had on Titans Return leader toys (at $35 CAD), and was told that corporate has decided that rainchecks will no longer be given for Transformers items. There has allegedly been some foul play involving rainchecks and it got bad enough that Toysrus Canada has decided to stop this practice entirely. This was discovered in Quebec so let us know if you hear the same at your local Canadian Toysrus. UPDATE It seems it is only select Toysrus stores in the Quebec area. There is no widespread change in the policy, as confirmed by Ontario managers. This seems more like a case of managers passing their own rules as corporate mandate when it isn't the case.

Martha McKee and "St. Francis" (Rick Mellerup) at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Episcopal in Tuckerton. (Photo: Marianne Ross) 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE St. Francis of Assisi is known as the patron saint of animals, which is why, during the Feast of St. Francis each year many area churches hold a blessing of the animals ceremony. Among them this past weekend was the Church of the Holy Spirit, Episcopal in Tuckerton, The church also had an Indoor picnic Saturday to celebrate the 10 year Anniversary of their Church Building, which was formerly St. Theresa’s Catholic Church, which now is located in Little Egg Harbor. After the picnic the drizzle subsided and families and their pets gathered for blessings by the Rev. Richard Wisniewski, the Rev. Martha McKee and parishioner Richard Mellerup, dressed to portray St Francis himself.:ellerup). The Church also celebrated the ‘Feast Day of Francis of Assisi’ an Italian Friar and a beloved Saint. He founded the Franciscan Order for men, the Order of Saint Clare for women and widely known for his love of nature and animals. Representing Southern Ocean County Animal Shelter Manahawkin, NJ was Donna Wagner looking for a special home for shelter animals Maverick and Boots. She also brought along photos of many other pets ready to be adopted. See : www.fosocas.org . Shirley Gordon brought her Silkie chicken she raised with 16 other breeds on her one acre property. Her family enjoys the green eggs they lay. Penny Hughes of Little Egg Harbor brought her bees to be blessed. She said “I was an avid gardener and when there was a crisis with bees I took a course at Rutgers University and then started baneekeeping.” Foster Family ‘Mama’s-gona Rescue’ Amanda and Ron Wilkens brought their five dogs and three cats: Diva, Simba , Wesley , Jesli , Joda, Buddy, Temik and Mudsey. They said they foster cats and dogs then once they become part of their family they seem to stay. To make sure that all the animals were blessed St Francis (Richard Mellerup) said that when he was in the new Walmart a group of 10 people came in and said to reconnect one would call “Marco” and if close respond with “Polo”. He told them that as St Francis during the blessing, he would call “Marco: and if a person’s pet had not yet been blessed, the person was to respond with “Polo”. No animal was missed. Owners of all critters blessed were given a prayer card and a medallion for their collars which were inscribed: God Bless the Animals Psalm 104. 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/2ee4DpM TOP VIDEOS A Dance for Kindness 0:40 Conor McGregor not surprised by UFC 205 win 1:03 Red Zone Game of the Week: Manasquan defeats Johnson Crusaders 3:56 Manasquan rallies for win 0:48 Toms River North rallies for win 0:58 WATCH Freehold Township vs South Brunswick football playoffs 0:39 TR North trails Atlantic City 6-0 0:53 Raw video: Seton Hall unveils banners 0:28 WATCH: Wall wins CJ3 title over Steinert 0:44 Grandchildren share Veterans' Day in Holmdel 1:32 More Stories Trump on Twitter taking on protesters Nov. 11, 2016, 9:26 a.m. After Trump's win, fear, hurt and worry for minorities, LGBT people Nov. 9, 2016, 8:27 p.m. Chris Christie says Trump won't 'lock her up' Nov. 10, 2016, 4:57 p.m. Nissan'ts strange Juke SUV gets a little stranger Nov. 14, 2016, 2 a.m.

At least 10 people were killed across the Southeastern U.S. as the devastating storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and lumbered toward landfall just north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville. The winds dropped to 75 mph, down from a recorded 145 mph at the height of the storm’s severity when it ripped across Haiti, killing nearly 900. Matthew whipped the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds as its storm center blew ashore. NYC workers can donate to Hurricane Matthew relief from paycheck 177 photos view gallery Hurricane Matthew lashes Southeast U.S. The hurricane’s eye mercifully remained just far enough out at sea that coastal communities didn’t feel the full force of Matthew’s winds. As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was one of relief — that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. “We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. “We are blessed that we didn’t have a direct hit.” The powerful hurricane killed at least four people in Florida and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity. (PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS) At least five deaths in Florida and two in Georgia were attributed to the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said three people were killed in his state. Death tolls rises to over 800 in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew The Florida fatalities included an elderly couple in St. Lucie and two women killed in separate incidents as trees crushed their homes. “Now is the time for prayer,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the storm approached. Matthew was approaching Charleston early Saturday, where a curfew was in place between midnight and 6 a.m. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) More than a million people were under evacuation orders in north Florida and Georgia’s coastal regions as roughly 300,000 people fled their homes in South Carolina. “We have been very fortunate that Matthews’s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,” the Hurricane Center said in a forecast statement. Brawl breaks out at Florida Walmart ahead of hurricane (GRAPHIC) Well south of the storm, things began returning to normal Saturday, with all three of Orlando’s main theme parks — Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld — reopening in the morning. A disabled woman and her family were some of the many Savannah residents evacuated to Augusta before the deadly storm struck. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) And the power began coming back on for the 1 million people in Florida who were in the dark for roughly 24 hours. Not eveyone was spared. The ravaging storm — the worst to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than 10 years — killed at least 877 people in Haiti and left tens of thousands homeless. LIVE HURRICANE RADAR: 3 dead as Matthew lashes Florida Matthew killed at least 877 people and leveled entire villages in Haiti. (NICOLAS GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images) Many of the island nation’'s impoverished areas reported that cholera outbreaks were already claiming lives as the storm made its way north. Northern Floridan, Georgia and the Carolinas were still dealing with flood waters in many areas. St. Augustine, Fla., the nation’s oldest European settlement, was experiencing severe flooding that authorities said could exceed 8 feet Saturday. A 17th century Spanish fortress and other historic structures were in the water’s path. The massive storm was expected to severely flood several historic cities across the East Coast of the U.S. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) “It’s a really serious devastating situation,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said. “The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.” Steve Todd, who defied the mayor’s evacuation orders and stayed at his home in Tybee Island — one of the Georgia’s most eastern points — described seeing bushes fly by the windows of his third-story condo, where he hunkered down with friends. “I’m not regretting staying,” he said over the phone. “But I’m not going to lie: There’s a little bit of nervous tension right now.” Stacks of sandbags clogged the streets of Charleston, another historic town lined with colonial homes. Stores and shops in the downtown area had boarded up their windows with plywood and the usually bustling area was eerily quiet as the city announced a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew.

Cineplex announced this week that ticket prices are going up and they’re blaming minimum wage increases. The media has been giving this story a lot of coverage, but most reports read like a press release from Cineplex. The CBC’s coverage, for instance, repeats the company’s line without doing basic research, talking to workers, or even fact-checking the claims of Cineplex. The truth is Cineplex dominates Canada’s movie theatre market. They have 78 percent of the movie theatre market and 93% of the Canadian box office. With their monopoly control of the theatre industry, it’s no surprise Cineplex raked in a record $1.4 billion in revenues last year. And this year they’ve already set a record for first quarter profits. In fact, they’re making so much money, on the same day they blamed ticket price increases on the minimum wage, they paid their shareholders yet another monthly dividend at 13.5 cents per share. While making record profits last year, Cineplex’s CEO Ellis Jacob pulled in $5.5 million in total compensation. Low Wages Meanwhile, almost 90 percent of Cineplex’s workforce is paid minimum wage. Yes, you heard right. Ninety percent of its 13,000 employees are earning minimum wage. This includes the hundreds of under-18 workers being paid Ontario’s “student” minimum wage of $10.70/hour – seventy cents below the general minimum wage of $11.40. I asked economist Michal Rozworski what he made of the company’s claims. He replied: “A quick look into Cineplex’s annual reports shows that wages are a small fraction of their total costs. Even with minimum wages going up slowly across the country, ticket prices needed to increase on average by 3 to 5 cents per year to keep up.” But Cineplex is raising ticket prices anywhere from 22 to 51 cents. Michal observed that “the company could have accepted lower profits. Instead it’s chosen to share its rising profits solely with its stockholders rather than its workers or moviegoers.” Some Cineplex workers set up this Twitter account skewering management. @CineplexTheatre In short, this hugely profitable monopoly is spewing corporate propaganda. It’s an ideological campaign to make sure profits stay in a few wealthy hands instead of being spread out to the workforce. It’s divide and conquer. They’re trying to pit customers against minimum wage workers: “Don’t you dare increase wages or we’ll bleed you at the cash register!” Busting Unions We shouldn’t expect anything less from Cineplex. In the mid-1990s they made a big cash grab by waging a war on their projectionists so they could boost profits even more. During the early Harris years, Cineplex locked out Ontario projectionists for five months in 1996/1997 to smash the union and cut wages in half. They made outrageous claims like projectionists were earning $80,000/year when it was really between $30,000 and $40,000. When Cineplex said they couldn’t afford high wages anymore, projectionists pointed out the company was making 560% profit on their concessions. When you’re paying $8 for popcorn and $5 for soda, it’s not hard to believe the profit margins are that high. A snapshot of the 5 month Ontario strike. Globe & Mail coverage on December 28 1996. In the end, the Ontario projectionists were starved into submission, forced to accept an awful deal they had already rejected midway through the lockout. Across the province, 40 percent of the projectionists’ jobs were slashed, and wages driven down to $15/hour from about $21/hour. Following the Ontario deal, Cineplex and Famous Players (bought by Cineplex in 2005) instigated a long strike against BC’s unionized projectionists in late 1998. After a year and a half, the BC projectionists were forced to take a massive wage cut, from $34 to $14.50 for a seven screen theatre, or $38 to $15 for more screens. The projectionists union was decisively defeated and many projectionists quit after the lockout to find work elsewhere. A handful of Cineplex theatres are unionized. One of the unionized Cineplex workers told Rankandfile.ca that management has told the union that they can’t afford wage increases because of the higher minimum wage in Alberta – at the same time Cineplex was making record profits because of blockbusters like Deadpool and the new Star Wars. Cineplex is just a dedicated poverty-producing, union-busting employer. Employers vs. the Fight for $15 Cineplex’s propaganda is just the start of a wider ideological offensive by employers against the emerging $15 campaigns in Canada. It’s going to be different than the usual employer whining we hear when the minimum wage goes up a few cents. This is because we now have $15 campaigns in at least eight provinces, with the Ontario campaign expanding and deepening its support among workers, and the Quebec campaign already producing strikes for $15 at the Port of Montreal and private nursing homes. And in Alberta, the NDP government is pushing ahead with their $15 minimum wage despite hysterical opposition from the usual quarters. Employers, corporate-backed think tanks, and right-wing media hacks and politicians are going to start pushing back more often. The same thing has already happened in the United States. The corporate media, politicians, and major employers like McDonald’s and Wal-Mart have all said the same thing as Cineplex: that the minimum wage is going to lead to huge price increases. They’ve also said we’d see big job losses. The American Fight for $15 movement pressed ahead, fending off these arguments through worker-to-worker organizing. The Fight for $15 is also supported by new research disproving bogus and flawed studies saying the minimum wage leads to job losses. By keeping its eyes on the prize, the American Fight for $15 has seen McDonald’s and Walmart increase their wages, and $15 minimum wage laws have been won in Seattle, New York state and California. An estimated 17 million workers in the US have benefited from the movement’s minimum wage victories in recent years. That’s helping combat poverty and actually improve local economies through more consumer spending power. We can also look to Halifax where the same arguments were launched against the baristas who organized three different coffee shops. Union wages and benefits were going to lead to $9 coffees and job losses. None of that happened. We have the power We know Cineplex’s claims are bogus. Employers have always kicked and screamed every time workers have organized to demand something: an end to poverty wages, paid sick leave, shorter work hours, equal pay for equal work, maternity leave, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, anti-discrimination laws. The list is a long one and the battle is never over. They don’t want to give up their profits – but they’ve adapted to change before. What they truly fear is how we have won: by organizing and flexing our collective power to become a powerful political force capable of extracting concessions from the employing class and their friends in government. The minimum wage workers at Cineplex serve the popcorn, clean the theatres, run and repair the projectors, deal with the shitty customers, unload the trucks, and more. Like any other workforce, they can bring the whole damn thing to a standstill. This is the potential power employers fear. They’re already getting nervous about all this talk of $15 an hour.   Follow Share Previous Post: Solidarity, uncertainty and hope as Harvesting Freedom reaches Ottawa Next Post: Weekend Video: Battle of Cable Street 2 thoughts on “High Prices, Low Wages: In Cineplex Theatres Now” Paul Taylor October 7, 2016 at 8:26 am Reply The problem is corporate attitudes are solely profit driven, where employees are treated as a liability as opposed to a human asset. Watch the Micheal Moore movie where to invade next. In Germany they have at least two workers sitting on the board to ensure worker fairness. As a injured worker I am sick of corporate greed. I am also tired of how unions and workers are always appearing silent. It’s time to fight back in new ways! When the courts stop a strike, let individual members file appeals! When the company is crying poverty show the true profits the money wasted. The unions need strong PR people! My favourite was hydro employees in Oshawa went on strike years ago, the union took out a two page ad showing all the money the company was wasting.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend News Local News With Pennsylvania mental hospitals full, jails become way stations With state mental hospitals full, jails become way stations "I just want my son back," Keith Kutz, of Bangor, a 48-year-old truck driver, says. Travis Kutz, like hundreds of mentally ill defendants across the state, faces a long waiting list for the psychiatric help he needs to regain his grip on reality, a requirement for his case to proceed.   "I just want my son back," Keith Kutz, of Bangor, a 48-year-old truck driver, says. Travis Kutz, like hundreds of mentally ill defendants across the state, faces a long waiting list for the psychiatric help he needs to regain his grip on reality, a requirement for his case to proceed.   Riley YatesContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Across Pennsylvania, mentally ill defendants languish in jail waiting for psychiatric beds Travis J. Kutz believes tiny robots have been implanted under his skin to control him, according to a psychiatrist's report. He hears voices — people crying, his mother being raped. He claims he was once a Navy SEAL, and that he has met President Barack Obama and the secretary of defense. When Kutz, 24, was arrested last year, police said, he was homeless and caught climbing out the window of his father's house in Bangor, where he had helped himself to Powerade, ice cream and a can of ravioli. "I was only breaking in to get something to eat," he protested to police, an officer wrote in an arrest affidavit. Everyone involved in Kutz's case agrees he is severely mentally ill and in need of long-term treatment. Yet jail is where Kutz has languished since his arrest on May 29, 2015. Given the extent of Kutz's delusions, a Northampton County judge has declared him incompetent to stand trial and ordered that he be transferred to Norristown State Hospital, a psychiatric facility. But Kutz, like hundreds of mentally ill defendants across the state, faces a long waiting list for the psychiatric help he needs to regain his grip on reality, a requirement for his case to proceed. PHOTO GALLERY: Travis Kutz, like hundreds of mentally ill defendants across the state, faces a long waiting list for the psychiatric help he needs to regain his grip on reality, a requirement for his case to proceed. Jails were not intended to be way stations for the mentally ill, who often see their conditions deteriorate under the stresses of incarceration. But local prisons have increasingly become just that, as the population in need of services boomed after Pennsylvania closed most of its state mental hospitals without adequately investing in alternatives. "The system is failing because we don't have the beds that we need," said Kutz's public defender, Syzane Arifaj. "He really needs the highest level of care, but those beds are just so severely limited." The state has promised to do better in response to a federal civil rights lawsuit last year by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, which cited waits of a year or more for many mentally ill defendants ordered to be treated at a state mental hospital. The suit called the delays "an embarrassment to a civilized society" and highlighted one inmate in Philadelphia who took his own life, and another who was murdered while in jail waiting for a placement. Out of six remaining state mental hospitals, two have secure facilities in which defendants deemed incompetent can be sent for treatment: Norristown for the eastern part of the state, which has 136 forensic beds, and Torrance in the west, which has 100 beds. Under a January settlement with the ACLU, the state agreed to invest more resources into the mental health system, with an eye to reducing waits for those beds. But one thing the agreement didn't contain: any expansion of the two hospitals' capacities, which state officials maintain is unnecessary, despite a waiting list that continues to grow. When the settlement was signed, the list totaled 220 people, with the line for Norristown particularly jammed. The number had risen to 252 as of late last month, according to the ACLU, including five inmates jailed in Northampton County and four in Lehigh County. In the end, "very little" has changed since the agreement, said Witold Walczak, the ACLU's legal director. "What we haven't seen is a reduction in the number of people on the waiting list, or the amount of time they are waiting," Walczak said. That assessment fits with what the directors of the Lehigh Valley's two county jails are experiencing. "Unfortunately, I don't see any change in that direction," said Ed Sweeney, Lehigh County's corrections chief. "I don't see the state making the determination that they need more forensic beds." Dealing with mentally ill prisoners is the "new normal," said Daniel Keen, Sweeney's counterpart in Northampton County. "I don't see any relief button right now." In the settlement, the state acknowledged the long waits are a problem that "cannot be justified clinically or legally." It conceded they are unconstitutional and fail to comply with the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law. The Department of Human Services agreed to create 120 new treatment slots, though in the community, and not the mental hospitals. It provided $1 million for housing in Philadelphia to support the mentally ill, and said it would reexamine its waiting list for ways to cut delays. Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said that by adding outside resources, officials hope to reduce the amount of time inmates stay at Norristown or Torrance once they are sent there, shifting them as they get better to less burdensome forms of care such as supportive housing. What the state found, Dallas said, was that inmates were being kept too long at the forensic hospitals. That created a bottleneck for others waiting for beds to open, he said. By increasing the number of discharges and investing in community treatment, the state should ultimately be able to increase new admissions, he said. Since the 1960s, a philosophical shift has been underway in Pennsylvania and across the nation in how the mentally ill are treated. The new approach, espoused by many advocates for the mentally ill, is that it is better and more humane to treat patients in the least restrictive settings possible. The change has led to the widespread closure of mental hospitals that used to dot the landscape, but that are now often derided as antiquated throwbacks to a time when the mentally ill were written off and hidden from society. Dallas said the state continues to believe that adding forensic beds is not the solution, though he acknowledged the waiting list is an ongoing problem. "Our best judgment after doing the analyses was that [more beds] was not the thing that would help the forensic system get where it would need to be," Dallas said. Dallas said fixing the delays will take time. He said he flagged them for attention immediately after assuming his post in 2015. "It is something that shouldn't be acceptable to anyone and it is something we have been working hard to address," Dallas said. Dallas is the former human services director of Maryland, which has less than half of Pennsylvania's population but nearly four times as many forensic beds — 853 versus 236, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national nonprofit that supports adding capacity at state mental hospitals. Dallas said it was like "apples and oranges" to compare the two states. Walczak believes Pennsylvania's waits are one of — if not the — worst in the nation. He points to Oregon and Washington, where federal courts have found that delays of more than one week are unconstitutional, and he notes Pennsylvania is not "remotely close" to that treatment benchmark. Given the lack of progress, Walczak predicts the ACLU will be going back into court to force state officials to do more. "The question may come down to resources and the line in the sand that they drew of no new beds," Walczak said. Some of the inmates waiting for beds are accused of serious crimes that make their release unlikely regardless of whether they receive treatment. In Northampton County, the longest waiting is Emanuel Cotto, 27, who is charged with stabbing to death his roommate at a group home for the mentally ill in Bethlehem. He has been jailed since his arrest on Jan. 4, 2015, and was ordered transferred to Norristown in September of that year. But others like Kutz are imprisoned under charges that, but for their mental illness, would almost certainly see them freed. Of Northampton County's other incompetent inmates, two face misdemeanor charges of simple assault, court records show. One was homeless and allegedly punched a man in Easton's West Ward. The other is accused of slugging an emergency room nurse at Easton Hospital. Two weeks ago, a judge ordered another inmate — the county's sixth — added to the waiting list. She is charged with shoplifting: She allegedly stole a pair of sneakers and a gallon of soy milk in August from a Wal-Mart in Lower Nazareth Township. Those inmates cost Northampton County taxpayers nearly $108 a day while they remain jailed. Almost a year and a half after he was imprisoned, Kutz is No. 15 on the list for Norristown. Local officials calculate the line moves six to eight people a month on average, suggesting it will still be a few months before Kutz is transferred. In the meantime, Kutz's father just wants his son to get help, though he never imagined how long it would take. Pressing charges Keith Kutz Jr. faced a difficult choice the day his son allegedly broke into his Northampton Street house in Bangor. He knew Travis "doesn't even belong in jail," but he was at wits' end given his son's mental deterioration, he said. Keith was in Ocean City, Md., when he got a call from a neighbor, who had seen Travis climbing through the window. Travis had sneaked in once before and stolen money, his father said, and the family had installed a security system to prevent it from happening again. But the one window Travis tried that night wasn't wired. Mental illness had taken Keith's son, making him unrecognizable from the "smart as hell" child he had been before problems surfaced in his late teens. Months before the break-in, Keith said, he had been forced to kick his son out of the house, after Travis' rages became unbearable. Travis' stepmother and little sister were afraid of him. He'd punch holes in walls, or get in his dad's face and scream. Twice, Keith said, he called police and had his son involuntarily committed to local hospitals. But as soon as Travis could, he would sign himself out and return in no better shape than before. Travis had that right under the Mental Health Procedures Act, which limits the ability of family members to force mentally ill relatives into treatment. Generally, those presenting a "clear and present danger" to themselves or others can be held for at most five days at a psychiatric hospital, though extensions can be granted with court approval if a doctor believes it is necessary. Homeless, Travis bounced between his mother's place and a friend's, Keith said. Sometimes, he slept in a sleeping bag in the woods behind his father's home, even in the middle of winter. "There would be nights when I would go outside to have a cigarette and I could hear him screaming stuff at me from the top of the hill," Keith remembered. Travis was always resistant to taking medication, believing others would look differently toward him because of it, his father said. By the time of his arrest, Travis was delusional and would have conversations with the television, Keith said. Keith said he feared for his son's safety, that he might do something to harm himself. It was with that in mind that Keith said he decided to press burglary charges. "Hopefully him going to jail was going to get him some help, because I couldn't get him help any other way," Keith said. He figured his son would be gone for two or three months. The last time he saw Travis was in a district judge's courtroom shortly after the arrest. "You could tell he just had pure anger. You could see it in him," the father recalled. Keith, a 48-year-old truck driver, said he feels helpless over his inability to do anything for his son. He said he struggles with guilt and wonders whether he made the right decision. "It's hard to know that there is nothing I can do," Keith said. Jail hasn't been easy for Travis. Like other incompetent defendants in Northampton County, he is being held under heightened security, isolated in a cell by himself and kept under observation, according to the prison. In November, he was charged with spitting in the face of a guard who was escorting him back to his cell after taking him to shower. In a letter from jail to his family, Travis wrote about his wife and children — though he has neither, his father said. Authorities have told the family there's little point in visiting him. "They said he is nothing but getting worse, that he probably wouldn't even know who I was," the father said. 'Bizarre delusions' Jailing the mentally ill instead of getting them treatment is a losing proposition for everyone involved, said John Snook, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center. Mentally ill defendants are a greater danger to themselves, to other prisoners, and to guards, Snook said. They are likely to get sicker and, if left untreated long enough, may deteriorate to a point in which they cannot recover, he said. "A jail is the single worst place you could think of to provide someone mental health services," Snook said. "It just simply in every way is the wrong process." Rory Driscole, a Northampton County public defender who works closely with mental health cases, said he has witnessed that firsthand with clients. "The more they sit in prison, the more they digress," Driscole said. "I'll see them in the very beginning and I'll see them three months later, and they get worse." In some cases, community-based solutions can be found. Brian Watson, deputy administrator for the Northampton County mental health division, said his agency works closely with the prison to shift incompetent defendants into local treatment when possible. Watson estimated he has a half dozen cases in which that has proven successful. Initially, the prisoners are sent to local hospitals under temporary mental-health commitments, ensuring they get immediate treatment, he said. They are then connected with psychiatrists, nurses and case managers who can provide services at home. The approach gives the defendants an incentive to take their medications: their desire to stay out of jail. "We get a lot of buy-in from them because they realize they are going to get help, get treatment," Watson said. Arifaj, Travis Kutz's public defender, said that given the extent of his problems, her client would be unable to care for himself if he was released. Considering his state, she said, he couldn't comply with doctors' orders. Kutz has been evaluated at least three times by psychiatrists and each time they found he remains incompetent, Arifaj said. He was ordered transferred to Norristown on Oct. 2, 2015, by Judge Emil Giordano — exactly one year and one week ago. Alex Thomas, a doctor who examined him in jail, concluded Kutz was "paranoid, delusional and psychotic" and may suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. In the September 2015 report filed in the case, Thomas said Kutz was refusing medication in the prison, and denied anything was wrong with him. "He is exhibiting bizarre delusions about being controlled by 'nanobots,'" Thomas wrote. "He hears voices that scream at him. He is paranoid that his food might be poisoned." The case's prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney James Augustine, said he sympathizes with Kutz, whom he noted has already served more time in prison than he would likely receive if convicted of the burglary of which he is charged. "It's not good, but I can't let him out on the streets. At a minimum, he's a danger to himself," Augustine said. "He's a grown man and he believes in nanobots, so what do you do with the guy?" riley.yates@mcall.com Twitter @riley_yates 610-253-5751 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Morning Call Mental Health Research Hospitals and Clinics Mental Health Medical Research Theft Breaking Popular Election Obits Business Sports LV Craft Beer Video/Photos 37°

Sometimes when a stock has been discounted, it's a good time to scoop up shares, but sometimes there's a good reason for the discount. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:12AM The value of a brand is that just the name conveys strength, but sometimes things go awry that not even a top brand name can fix. Image source: Getty Images. What do a sneaker company, a maker of ATVs, and an organic grocer all have in common? They're all leading, well-known brands whose stocks are trading off their 52-week highs by double-digit percentages. If a stock falls hard, particularly one with a durable name in its industry, it could be an opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap. But sometimes a stock trades at a discount for a very good reason, so let's take a look at Skechers (NYSE:SKX), Polaris Industries (NYSE:PII), and Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) to see if they are good values at these lower prices -- or just value traps. PII data by YCharts. Skechers Shares of the second largest footwear company in the U.S. behind Nike (NYSE:NKE) have lost 53% of their value from this year's highs as a sudden deceleration in growth has turned negative. A year ago, Skechers saw sales in its domestic wholesale business begin to slow, and that has continued every quarter since, culminating in such sales turning negative in the second quarter. Although international sales had been rocketing higher at the same time the company was seeing domestic sales growth rates fall, thus offsetting some of the effects, last quarter, those growth rates also tumbled by more than half, suggesting Skechers' global expansion was taking a hit, too. All of this is not coming at a good time for the footwear company. It's still fighting Adidas for the second-place spot even though both companies remain well behind Nike, which has a massive 62% market share. Meanwhile, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) continues to increase its penetration into the footwear industry. In fact, with UA's 58% increase in footwear sales in the second quarter, it's clear where a lot of Skechers' business went. With Skechers' third-quarter earnings due out soon, investors probably shouldn't expect much difference in the results. Polaris Industries When Polaris introduced the RZR side-by-side in 2007, it immediately set the ATV industry on its ear and launched the powersports vehicle maker to the forefront, a position it hasn't relinquished since. The RZR was the first ATV to meet the 50-inch maximum vehicle width regulations to ride on trails on federal lands, but now there's plenty of competition in the market, and Arctic Cat (NASDAQ:ACAT) has seen success with its Wildcat side-by-side. This is why Polaris's own troubles, which have knocked its stock down 40%, come at an inopportune time. For over a year now, Polaris has suffered from a recurring series of product recalls due to a fire hazard that resulted in at least one death. Tens of thousands of its RZRs have been recalled, and while management initially said it had the problem under control, it turns out it didn't, and even more RZRs needed to be recalled. Fortunately (if that's how you want to look at it), the off-road vehicle market is in the midst of a severe slowdown, so there are fewer people looking to buy a vehicle at the moment, and hopefully Polaris Industries will get its "thermal hazard" fixed by the time people want to buy them again. In the meantime, though, investors might just want to garage the powersports vehicle maker's stock. Whole Foods Market The oft-maligned organic grocer has actually been the best performer of these three stocks, with shares down just 18% from its 52-week high. Yet it too suffers from competitive problems as rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and just about every corner bodega have expanded their organic fresh produce selections. Worse, the problems that dogged the supermarket throughout its existence, namely the high cost of organics, persist such that Whole Foods was forced to launch a discount chain, 365 by Whole Foods, to help counteract its image as "Whole Paycheck." Those new stores will allow it to more effectively compete against the discounters in the space, such as Trader Joe's. That's actually good news because it shows the company is finally learning to adapt to the forces that were arrayed against it for so long. And by pushing its higher-margin 365 house brand more, Whole Foods is also bolstering its bottom line. Its investment in grocery delivery service Instacart additionally indicates it understands there are more ways to reach potential grocery shoppers. Valued at just a fraction of its sales, Whole Foods Market is the one beaten-down big brand that could surprise the markets.

Skechers Shares of the second largest footwear company in the U.S. behind Nike (NYSE:NKE) have lost 53% of their value from this year's highs as a sudden deceleration in growth has turned negative. A year ago, Skechers saw sales in its domestic wholesale business begin to slow, and that has continued every quarter since, culminating in such sales turning negative in the second quarter. Although international sales had been rocketing higher at the same time the company was seeing domestic sales growth rates fall, thus offsetting some of the effects, last quarter, those growth rates also tumbled by more than half, suggesting Skechers' global expansion was taking a hit, too. All of this is not coming at a good time for the footwear company. It's still fighting Adidas for the second-place spot even though both companies remain well behind Nike, which has a massive 62% market share. Meanwhile, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) continues to increase its penetration into the footwear industry. In fact, with UA's 58% increase in footwear sales in the second quarter, it's clear where a lot of Skechers' business went. With Skechers' third-quarter earnings due out soon, investors probably shouldn't expect much difference in the results. Polaris Industries When Polaris introduced the RZR side-by-side in 2007, it immediately set the ATV industry on its ear and launched the powersports vehicle maker to the forefront, a position it hasn't relinquished since. The RZR was the first ATV to meet the 50-inch maximum vehicle width regulations to ride on trails on federal lands, but now there's plenty of competition in the market, and Arctic Cat (NASDAQ:ACAT) has seen success with its Wildcat side-by-side. This is why Polaris's own troubles, which have knocked its stock down 40%, come at an inopportune time. For over a year now, Polaris has suffered from a recurring series of product recalls due to a fire hazard that resulted in at least one death. Tens of thousands of its RZRs have been recalled, and while management initially said it had the problem under control, it turns out it didn't, and even more RZRs needed to be recalled. Fortunately (if that's how you want to look at it), the off-road vehicle market is in the midst of a severe slowdown, so there are fewer people looking to buy a vehicle at the moment, and hopefully Polaris Industries will get its "thermal hazard" fixed by the time people want to buy them again. In the meantime, though, investors might just want to garage the powersports vehicle maker's stock. Whole Foods Market The oft-maligned organic grocer has actually been the best performer of these three stocks, with shares down just 18% from its 52-week high. Yet it too suffers from competitive problems as rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and just about every corner bodega have expanded their organic fresh produce selections. Worse, the problems that dogged the supermarket throughout its existence, namely the high cost of organics, persist such that Whole Foods was forced to launch a discount chain, 365 by Whole Foods, to help counteract its image as "Whole Paycheck." Those new stores will allow it to more effectively compete against the discounters in the space, such as Trader Joe's. That's actually good news because it shows the company is finally learning to adapt to the forces that were arrayed against it for so long. And by pushing its higher-margin 365 house brand more, Whole Foods is also bolstering its bottom line. Its investment in grocery delivery service Instacart additionally indicates it understands there are more ways to reach potential grocery shoppers. Valued at just a fraction of its sales, Whole Foods Market is the one beaten-down big brand that could surprise the markets.

McIntyre October 8, 2016 9:10 am EST Print Email Tweet Among the most common comments about retailers that open on Thanksgiving is that they are unfair to employees who would like to be home with family members and that they cannot afford to be closed because they would lose holiday sales to competitors. At least 42 retailers have elected to stay closed for the holiday. They run the gamut from obscure firms to those among the most well-known in the industry. BestBlackFriday.com put the list together, and it is not anywhere near complete. The site summarized the scope of the list: While certain retailers are going to open even earlier on Thanksgiving this year, other stores are taking the day off entirely. Even more surprising, some stores will close their doors on Black Friday, opting to allow their employees and customers to enjoy the holiday weekend with their friends and families. The largest public company retailers on the list include AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), Barnes & Noble Inc. (NYSE: BKS), Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST), Dillard’s Inc. (NYSE: DDS), GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), Lowe’s Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW) and the Sam’s Club division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). The entire list, thanks to BestBlackFriday.com: A.C.

The day came following Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Wagner’s signing of an order that overturned the conviction and freeing the innocent man. It was Wagner who presided over the conviction in 1993 that put Holloway in prison for the crime. The decision to free Holloway came after the prosecutors in the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office agreed that the DNA results indicated that his 1992 conviction for the assault should be reversed, which was communicated in a news release from the Wisconsin Innocence Project. Daryl Dwayne Holloway has been exonerated by DNA after 24 years in prison: https://t.co/nywV8lgHi5 pic.twitter.com/pg2oqFDtgT — USA TODAY (@USATODAY) October 6, 2016 Keith Findley, co-director of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, spoke about the outcome, noting the flaws that are present in the justice system. “It’s another example of the way in which the criminal justice system, as a human system, can produce errors.” The organization gave credit to the district attorney’s office of the county for reviewing and reviving the case. The now-retired Assistant District Attorney, Norm Gahn, had reviewed the case file back in April of 2015 and found that the DNA reports in the case were conflicting from separate labs, which meant that there was an error in one lab analysis. The new report showed conclusively that Holloway was not the perpetrator of the crime as it identified that the male DNA present at the scene was from an unknown. Enough is enough! TODAY show your support for exonerees by using #CompensationNow or #WrongfulConvictionDay pic.twitter.com/3tHqWBwTeJ — Innocence Project FL (@FLA_Innocence) October 4, 2016 Findley, also a University of Wisconsin-Madison law professor, shares about the pattern often seen in these types of convictions. “It fits a typical pattern in which eyewitness evidence was used to obtain the conviction and as it turns out the eye witness evidence was pretty unreliable.” The professor spoke about the respect he had for prosecutors who took on the case to serve as “ministers of justice, not just advocate for convictions. ” He also met Holloway upon his release Wednesday morning, who shared his view about being released after so many years. “Make better choices before convicting people, make sure you’ve got the right evidence, because when you do this, people lose. Everybody loses — victims, me — I’ve been victimized. I’m trying to rebuild my life now.” The words from Holloway were streamed live over social media and it was clear that the wrongly convicted man noticed the improvement in technology since he was put in prison in 1993, as he was interviewed at the self-checkout lane at a Walmart where Findley brought Holloway to buy clothes. “It’s a whole new world for him, but he is marveling at what it feels like to be free again,” Findley said. As USA Today shares, Wisconsin law now provides those who are exonerated from a crime yet were sentenced for a time no more than $5,000 for each year spent behind bars, with a maximum pay out of $25,000. Although there are states that do not provide payment at all for the wrongfully convicted, Wisconsin has the lowest amount per year, and bipartisan efforts to raise the compensation to those wrongfully convicted for the years spent behind bars have stalled in the past couple of years. Findley, however, indicates that he expects the issue to come up again during the legislature’s next session, during which a conclusion that the amount paid should be increased may be reached. Such cases are not few and far between in the justice system of the United States. The wrongfully accused, especially in cases such as Holloway’s, upon release are then faced with a whole new world to adapt to, and are expected to carry on with life, despite having endured a grave injustice for decades.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Forbes & Company Ltd x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ NEW YORK: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is worth about $800 million less this year as compared to 2015, dropping 35 spots on Forbes list of richest Americans. Trump's net worth was pegged at $3.7 billion, an $800 million decline from last year, according to Forbes. The real estate developer and presidential candidate's ranking fell 35 spots to No. 156 on the gilded list, released Tuesday. Last October, Trump's net worth was $4.5 billion, putting him on the 121st rank on 'The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in America'. It said Trump and his father had appeared on the inaugural issue of the list in 1982 with a shared fortune valued at more than $200 million. "An avalanche of debt stemming from bad business deals knocked The Donald out of the ranks in 1990," it said. However six years later, riding robust real estate markets, Trump returned to the list with a fortune of $450 million. By 2015 Forbes estimated he was worth 10 times that much as property values continued to soar, especially in New York. At $4.5 billion he appeared alongside Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, ahead of New Balance owner Jim Davis and fellow Manhattan real estate tycoon Sheldon Solow. Forbes said all three of them are wealthier than Trump this year. The 70-year-old reality TV star shares his new spot at number 156 with 16 other billionaires, including filmmaker Steven Spielberg, FedEx founder Frederick Smith and five heirs to the SC Johnson fortune. While Trump fell, many others gained in the list. A total of 38 billionaires passed Trump on the 2016 list -- including one of Trump's most vocal critics, Reid Hoffman (No. 150). The LinkedIn cofounder, who added $100 million his fortune this year, has publicly offered $5 million to veterans groups if Trump releases his tax returns. Forbes said in recent years Trump largely moved away from real estate development in favour of "The Apprentice" and licensing his name globally to luxury properties he does not own. Still, 53 per cent of Trump's fortune lies in Manhattan properties -- though he is far from the richest developer in New York City. Trumps fall in wealth ranking comes amid many controversies he has been embroiled in, including the recent one in which he was caught in a 2005 video making lewd remarks about women.

The penultimate scene from the film "Miracle on 34th Street" provided proof there was, indeed, a Santa Claus. Ahead of this year's Christmas shopping season, advocates for clothing workers hope a similar picture plays out in real life as proof the buying public is ready for a fair trade option for their closets. The Human Thread, a Catholic advocacy group for garment workers, launched a national postcard campaign last month that asks Macy's and Kohl's to add a fair trade clothing item to their department store racks and shelves. The request is intentionally vague, preferring to allow the stores to decide what department -- men, women, children -- to target, and what article of clothing to add. "When we visit a grocery store, we can purchase organic and fair trade items. When we visit the auto dealer, we can buy a hybrid. When we visit Macy's, we want the option to buy clothing that is fair trade and sustainable," the postcard reads to Terry Lundgren, chairman and CEO of Macy's, Inc. The same message appears on the card addressed to Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, CEO and president. Rather than rebuke the companies -- two among many in the $250 billion U.S. fashion market that offers few fair trade options and none on a mass scale -- the cards instead reassure each retailer that adding fair trade clothing builds on existing commitments to corporate responsibility and sustainable practices.

"We want better choices in our clothing," the cards read, promising if one of the stores leads, "we will buy." Postcard from The Human Thread Trend of global indifference As of early October, The Human Thread has distributed more than 15,000 postcards to be mailed to each store. Its goal is for cards to arrive at each company from all 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam. Those interested in joining the campaign can have postcards shipped to them or can download them at the Human Thread website, which has seen a surge in traffic since the campaign went live Sept. 10. It runs through Nov. 25, aka "Black Friday," historically America's busiest shopping day. "Simply put, the campaign is exceeding our expectations," said Christopher Cox, the campaign manager. Capuchin Fr. Mike Crosby, founder of The Human Thread, told NCR the campaign has a threefold purpose: raise awareness among Catholics -- and all consumers -- of the connection between the clothing they wear daily and the exploited labor that produced it; create solidarity among them and the workers; and deliver action that improves their standard of living. "If you really look at it, there's probably not a piece of [clothing] that you are wearing at this moment, or anyone, that is not coming from a sweatshop. We live and breathe that reality of exploited labor," he said. Crosby and The Human Thread place the campaign in the context of the globalization of indifference that Pope Francis has repeatedly spoken against throughout his papacy. The priest, a four-plus decades vet of corporate responsibility advocacy, said the postcards represent a concrete effort "to put teeth" on the pope's call for a change of heart away from compassionless consumerism. Consumers themselves, though, offer the best channel for change, Crosby said, with past public movements, for example apartheid in South Africa, yielding greater success than strictly shareholder intervention. To this point, the postcard campaign has ridden on word of mouth and the organization's network and connections. Affiliates of The Human Thread include the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Coalition of Catholic Organizations Against Human Trafficking, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, Franciscan Action Network, Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Some are already active in the mailing. One sister in Philadelphia ordered 1,000 cards, and the Marianist Province of North America has pledged to spread word among its communities, colleges, parishes and retreat centers. LCWR plans to join the campaign more earnestly in mid-October. 'Reality of exploited labor' The timing of the campaign -- beginning shortly after Labor Day and running through Black Friday -- was meant to connect the struggle for workers' rights in this country with today's consumer culture that often sees goods produced by people elsewhere in the world lacking their own rights. Often, that means wages unable to support basic life needs. In Bangladesh, the world's second-largest apparel exporter employing more than 4 million people (80 percent women), workers earn $68 a month -- a 77-percent increase since 2013, but still well below the minimum $100 per month labor leaders argue is needed to cover basic necessities; some have pushed for a living wage as high as $332 per month. Beyond pay, the fashion industry is among the leading industries targeted for human trafficking, accounting for 20 percent of water pollution worldwide, and is the second-largest polluter behind oil, accounting for 10 percent of global carbon emissions. More: "Bangladesh counts the human cost of the garment industry" (April 20, 2016) When the eight-story Rana Plaza garment factory collapsed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 24, 2013, killing 1,136 people and injuring 2,000 more, Francis offered prayers and condolences for the families who lost loved ones, but also seized the moment to decry the working conditions inside it and other similar factories. "Living on 38 euros ($50) a month -- that was the pay of these people who died. That is called slave labor," he said in May 2013. "Slave labor," he continued, according to L'Osservatore Romano, exploits "the most beautiful gift which God gave man: the ability to create, to work, to discover our dignity. How many of our brothers and sisters in the world are in this situation at the hands of these economic, social and political attitudes!" From the tragedy at Rana Plaza emerged The Human Thread. "Our particular birth as an organization is keenly focused around the discussion of wages and sustainable practices," Cox said. That means in part taking a deeper look at the clothes we buy and the conditions that create them. Typically, fashion decisions are made by cost and how they make us look, he said. "But we'd like to propose that in fact there's an ethical content to the word 'good' and 'good buy,'" Cox said, later pointing to a line from Pope Benedict XVI's 2009 encyclical Caritas in Veritate, that "Purchasing is always a moral -- and not simply economic -- act." "A good buy also means that it has to take care for creation, it needs to pay a just wage for the workers who made it, that it's not enough to say it makes me look thin and it's cheap," he said. Inventory space requires buy-in The decision to target Macy's and Kohl's with the campaign was not meant to single the two retailers out for their practices -- "all [apparel] companies are involved in this type of exploitive labor," Crosby said -- but more a reflection of their prior advances in areas of safety and sustainability. At the same time, The Human Thread sought to leverage existing relationships and avoid stores typically serving customers at lower-income levels. Macy's, when asked about the postcard campaign, pointed to its Vendor & Supplier Code of Conduct, which since 1995 seeks to uphold fair and safe labor standards throughout its supply chain. The code prohibits forced labor, slavery, child labor and human trafficking by its vendors, and states employees should be paid at least the minimum wage required by law or the prevailing industry wage. Since 2012, Macy's has ended 77 contracts with noncompliant factories. Neither Macy's nor Kohl's, which did not respond to comment requests for this story, stated whether they had begun receiving the postcards. Both U.S. retailers are members of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition -- founded by Wal-Mart and Patagonia for the industry to collectively address labor and environmental challenges -- and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which formed after the Rana Plaza collapse. Twice-annual dialogue between Kohl's and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, of which Crosby is a longtime member, have led to improvements on safety issues. But when conversations shift to wages, they end abruptly, he said, as it did in August when The Human Thread informed the Wisconsin-based company about the upcoming postcard campaign. Crosby said they were met with anger, with a rep questioning not just their rationale but also their faith. Cox said he prefers the stores be angry with them, rather than "just yawn at this campaign." But both agreed that for fair trade to gain substantial inventory space it will require buy-in from one of the big boxes. Unlike the agriculture and auto industries -- where consumer interest in recent years has driven a rise in organic and sustainable food, and electric and hybrid vehicles -- fair trade has yet to make its mark in fashion. As it stands, no fair trade apparel company exists that's capable of developing a large-scale line. Alta Gracia Apparel, based in the Dominican Republic, is one of the larger fair trade brands and is sold primarily through college campus bookstores, including numerous Catholic universities. "In order to get something of the scale that we're talking about with Kohl's and or Macy's, you'd almost have to have them be involved in creating some entity that would do that," Crosby said. Enter the postcards. Like letters to Santa, The Human Thread envisions a mountain of cards piling up at the two retailers' corporate headquarters, at capacities even bottom-line-focused businessmen can't ignore. But the mailing is only part of it, the pledge to buy -- and to likely pay more -- has to come with it. "If they say yes, we have to mobilize our people that they put up for what they ask. Because it will be costing more money," Crosby said. Seeing fair trade apparel appear in Kohl's or Macy's stores would be a clear success, Cox said. So too, but at a lower level, would raising awareness among consumers or expanding corporate dialogue about the moral dimension of shopping. Crosby has hope the campaign will bear fruit for fair trade apparel, partly due to successes ICCR has had as a member of broad coalitions that targeted changes in the tobacco industry and sought increased wages in Wal-Mart's stores, though not at assembly sites. For Cox, he believes that one store making a move to fair trade could trigger a chain reaction among competitors, similar to those in other markets, like the auto industry, where a rise in consumer consciousness has led to new product lines. "Hummer even had a hybrid," he said. [Brian Roewe is an NCR staff writer. His email address is broewe@ncronline.org.

(AP Photo) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is worth about USD 800 million less this year as compared to 2015, dropping 35 spots on Forbes list of richest Americans. Trump’s net worth was pegged at USD 3.7 billion, an USD 800 million decline from last year, according to Forbes. The real estate developer and presidential candidate’s ranking fell 35 spots to No. 156 on the gilded list, released Tuesday. Last October, Trump’s net worth was USD 4.5 billion, putting him on the 121st rank on ‘The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in America’. It said Trump and his father had appeared on the inaugural issue of the list in 1982 with a shared fortune valued at more than USD 200 million. “An avalanche of debt stemming from bad business deals knocked The Donald out of the ranks in 1990,” it said. However six years later, riding robust real estate markets, Trump returned to the list with a fortune of USD 450 million. By 2015 Forbes estimated he was worth 10 times that much as property values continued to soar, especially in New York. At USD 4.5 billion he appeared alongside Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, ahead of New Balance owner Jim Davis and fellow Manhattan real estate tycoon Sheldon Solow.

The 70-year-old reality TV star shares his new spot at number 156 with 16 other billionaires, including filmmaker Steven Spielberg, FedEx founder Frederick Smith and five heirs to the SC Johnson fortune. While Trump fell, many others gained in the list. A total of 38 billionaires passed Trump on the 2016 list — including one of Trump’s most vocal critics, Reid Hoffman (No. 150). The LinkedIn cofounder, who added USD 100 million his fortune this year, has publicly offered USD 5 million to veterans groups if Trump releases his tax returns. Forbes said in recent years Trump largely moved away from real estate development in favour of “The Apprentice” and licensing his name globally to luxury properties he does not own. Still, 53 per cent of Trump’s fortune lies in Manhattan properties — though he is far from the richest developer in New York City. Trumps fall in wealth ranking comes amid many controversies he has been embroiled in, including the recent one in which he was caught in a 2005 video making lewd remarks about women.

Banks, Post Offices, Stores And Trains Observe Federal Holiday By Tim Marcin @TimMarcin On 10/08/16 AT 7:48 AM Close A fair share of Americans will soon relish a long weekend, since Columbus Day is Monday. But that also means a fair share of businesses and services will be shut down for the holiday, perhaps making life a bit more difficult.  We've long since entered fall, but the weekend does represent a last chance to have a barbecue or hang around outside in somewhat temperate weather. Here's a quick guide to how your travel might be hindered or which store to go to in order to find the last second ingredient. Transportation  You should be fine here. Traffic is an unpredictable beast, but if you're taking public transportation, most major cities should be running as usual. New York City, for instance, will run on a normal weekday schedule, with just a warning that "customers may experience longer wait times between buses on some routes."  Government offices It's a federal holiday, which means don't expect federal or state government offices to be open. Some county offices may remain open. Post offices If you're trying to some get snail mail out Columbus Day, well, best of luck. Your local post office is almost certainly closed. Just one post office in New York City, population more than 8 million, typically remains open on Columbus Day. Banks Most banks shut down for Columbus Day. But a few remain open, including Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank (outside of Chicago), TD Bank and Huntington Bank, via Time's Money website.  The list of banks that will close is lengthy, including Bank of America, Bank of the West, BBVA Compass Bank, BB&T, BMO Harris Bank, Capital One Bank, Citibank, Citizens Bank, Comerica Bank, First Niagara Bank, HSBC Bank, M&T Bank, People’s United Bank, Regions Bank, PNC Bank, Santander Bank, SunTrust Bank (locations in retail/grocery stores will remain open) and Union Bank. Related Stories Walmart Sells Chinese Online Store After 1 Year Is Twitter Up For Sale? Grocery and retail stores Most place remain open on Columbus Day. Just 14 percent of organizations close on Columbus Day, Time Magazine wrote last year. Nearly every major grocery store will operate normal hours. Trader Joe's, for instance, will be open, although some in the path of Hurricane Matthew will close on Saturday.  Most retail shops will operate normal hours as well, including Target and Walmart.   Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Mine openings often were high in cliff faces with no road access, said Steve Fluke, who runs Utah's program, requiring the state's contractor to use helicopters, all terrain vehicles pack horses and "a great deal of ingenuity," to get workers and equipment to the site. In addition, Fluke said crews had to maintain strict operating protocols to avoid radiation exposure, disturbing bighorn sheep during lambing season and complying with wilderness-area regulations.

Andrea M. Myers, 28, of 483 county Route 29, Scriba, was charged with DWI-Drugs (prescription medication), third-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, and felony first-degree endangering the welfare of an incompetent/physically disabled person. Andrea M. MyersNew York State Police  About 5:40 a.m. Friday troopers responded to county Route 29 and O'Connor Road in the town of Scriba for a report of a car crash in that area. Troopers arrived and found a 2016 Kia in a ditch, but with no driver. They found the driver, identified as Myers, walking on county Route 29 near county Route 51A. State police said she told troopers she had been in an accident and was walking home. State police said Myers was driving home from Wal-Mart when she went off the road, hit a stop sign and her car ended up in a ditch. She also admitted to leaving her physically disabled 6-year-old child home alone for several hours, state police said. Troopers rushed to her home and found the child in a bedroom. Myers was arraigned in Scriba Town Court and released on her own recognizance. She is scheduled to appear in court again on Thursday. State police said Oswego County Child Protective Services is assisting troopers with their investigation.

And a $5K check out of the blue. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery On September 26, I got an email about my swaggering old über-boss, Mike Lacey. His lawyers, Becker & House, wrote that their client, Lacey, was “attempting to develop a database of former employees of the New Times and/or Village Voice Media for communication purposes.” I wasn’t sure: Did he want to send us all Christmas cards? Or to hunt us down and wreak bloody havoc? He couldn’t sue us for anything, could he? Lacey could be great, and Lacey could be awful. Fifteen years before, at the Houston Press, and at all the newspapers in the chain of alternative weeklies where he was top editor, we spent a lot of time wondering what he was up to. Mostly from a distance, I followed his exploits: the muckraking stories, the bare-knuckled fights, the awards, the threats, the wild gouts of praise, the epic flights of profanity. Houston wasn’t Lacey’s main focus -- that was Phoenix, where he’d founded his empire; and San Francisco and Los Angeles, which were way more glamorous — but occasionally, he’d blow through like a hurricane. If he liked you that day, maybe you’d be invited to a big corporate dinner with bottle after bottle of expensive red wine. If he didn’t like you that day, maybe you’d be fired. I sent the law firm my address. A few days later, I got a $5,000 check in the mail. A gift from Michael Lacey, the lawyers’ letter said. Tax-free. No strings attached. They asked only that I mail back a form with my birthdate and signature. Photo: Screenshot, Lisa Gray On Facebook chat threads, a handful of Houston Press alumni and I obsessed over what had gotten into Lacey, why some of us but not others received that unexpected gift, and what, in general, was going on. Had he joined a 12-step group and was making amends? Was he dying? Was it an elaborate trick? The legal assistant who was handling the checks said that she couldn’t give me Lacey’s contact information, but that she could forward an email to him. “What the hell, Mike Lacey?” I wrote. No response. Thursday night, I found out that he’s on the lam. The print version: Houston Press Backpage ads. The print version: Houston Press Backpage ads. IN 1970, Mike Lacey was a Vietnam protester, an Irish kid from Jersey who’d dropped out of Arizona State. The counterculture was ascendant, and Lacey, who’d always had a problem with authority, was out front. As an alternative to the ultra-conservative Arizona Republic, he started the Phoenix New Times — a paper that would cover politics, culture and music for the sex-drugs-rock’n’roll generation. Soon after, Jim Larkin joined the paper. Lacey’n’Larkin, we called the editor-publisher duo who, over the decades, bought and started alternative weeklies across the country; at their empire’s peak, they’d amassed 17 newspapers, including the venerable Village Voice. The papers were uneven, but at their best, they were terrific. They won tons of awards — sometimes for writing, sometimes for investigative stories, sometimes for stories that Lacey had written or edited himself. They bought the cash-starved, four-year-old Houston Press in '93. I’d worked there when it launched in 1989, and even though I’d moved to Washington, D.C., still felt proprietary. When I heard that New Times had hired an editor, Jim Simmon, who’d previously worked for the big, dull Houston Chronicle, I was dismayed. I had a chance to complain soon after that. I was working for Washington City Paper, an alt weekly safely outside the New Times’ domain, and so at a Boston conference for the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, I felt perfectly comfortable walking up to Lacey and asking him who this editor was, whether he might be screwing up my old paper. He liked that. Or maybe he was just in a good mood, planning to raise a little hell of his own. Photo: Backpage.com Backpage is an international operation. Backpage is an international operation. A few minutes later, in a panel discussion about story-telling, he assured us that great stories are all around us, all the time — and to prove it, he told the story of a Washington Post reporter, Richard Leiby, who was covering our conference. Lacey said darkly that Leiby wasn’t really there as a reporter but as a talent scout, aiming to poach alt weeklies’ writers. And that, Lacey wouldn’t tolerate. He ended the session with a promise: He’d pay $100 to anyone who’d kick Richard Leiby’s butt. A few hours later, in a bar, my City Paper boss, Jack Shafer, administered the kick. On “for” line of the $100 check, Lacey wrote “hit.” Lacey was right: It was a great story. I've told it for years — though never to Lacey's point, to illustrate Richard Leiby's deviousness. To me, that story was about Lacey and Shafer's butt-kicking tendencies; and more generally, about the swaggering machismo of New Times, and of alternative newspapers in general. Eventually, both Shafer and I ended up working at New Times papers. If anyone at that conference was poaching talent, it was Mike Lacey.

Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer appears before a Harris County... THE  '90s were good to alt weeklies and their reporters. The papers reached those elusive young consumers in their twenties. At the Houston Press, ads poured in. The ad money made the journalism possible. Between the ads, there was plenty of room for long stories, and at New Times, a reporter could get the time to research and write them; a month was standard. I needn't have worried about about Jim Simmon: The Press's editor-in-chief wasn't boring. We wrote investigative stories, and profiles, and stories that were really about how it felt to be alive right there, right then -- at a karaoke bar, or a church Christmas play, or amid a knot of transgender activists. We groused about mismanagement and overwork. But now, looking back over a blasted media landscape, it seems like a golden age. Spicy classified ads were baked into the business model. Readers often started the paper at the back, so the New Times displayed the most prominent of those little ads on the tabloids’ last page. The Backpage, they called it. There were personal ads, of course: all sorts of people seeking all sorts of hookups. There were lawyers who’d help you beat a drunk driving charge; help-wanted ads for staff at clubs and restaurants; ads for sex-chat lines; ads for escort services, leather shops and egg donors. I wasn’t proud of them, but they paid the bills. Photo: Backpages Backpage's adult section. Backpage's adult section. AFTER I left the Press in 2001, I followed Lacey’n’Larkin’s exploits casually, the way you follow a hometown team long after you’ve moved away. In 2005, they bought the past-its-peak Village Voice, provoking screams from New York elitists who couldn’t stand to see their hometown paper taken over by outsiders, by cowboys, by owners who were “not Voice people.” I wasn’t sure who to root for. But a couple of years later, I tilted firmly into the Lacey’n’Larkin camp. In 2007, their long-time enemy, Phoenix’s famously flashy, anti-immigrant Sheriff Joe Arpaio, arranged to have them arrested on flimsy charges. Supposedly, a New Times story had violated a grand jury’s secrecy -- though, among other things, that grand jury had never convened. Deputies arrived at Lacey and Larkin’s houses in the dead of night, waking them up, and hauling them in for mug shots. In Lacey’s mugshot, he looks wearily at the camera, like a mob boss coolly calculating his revenge. When I saw that mugshot online, I almost felt sorry for Arpaio; he didn’t know what he’d unleashed. As details of the arrest came out, the sheriff looked ridiculous. Eventually Lacey and Larkin won a $3.75 million settlement from the sheriff’s office, and donated $2 million of it to Arizona State University’s journalism school -- specifically to increase coverage of Latino and border issues. (And, needless to say, to needle Arpaio.) Not all the news was so fun. I watched as the internet sucked away alt weeklies’ readers and display ads -- ads that the free newspapers depended on even more than did daily newspapers, which at least had subscriptions to fall back on. Photo: Seth Wenig, Associated Press First amendment lawyer Liz McDougall is general counsel for the company that runs the classified ad website Backpage.com. She says the website is actually one of the good guys, working with law enforcement behind the scenes to help save adult and child victims and put their traffickers behind bars. First amendment lawyer Liz McDougall is general counsel for the... But one corner of the business thrived. The Backpage grew into Backpage.com, a classified-ad space that seemed as wide-open as the internet itself. Its timing was good. In 2010, Craigslist stopped taking ads for escort services; attorneys general had called it “the Wal-Mart of child sex trafficking” and "the only player in the sex industry who is in a position to stop these ads." But of course the ads didn’t stop; they largely migrated to Backpage.com. The website became both wildly profitable and a legal hairball, the target of religious groups, state attorneys general and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. Now it was Backpage, not Craigslist, in the crosshairs. The controversy scared away a couple of the private equity firms that had helped Lacey’n’Larkin expand their empire. The days of growth and easy money were over. I wasn’t surprised, then, when Backpage.com split from the alt weeklies. What surprised me was that Lacey’n’Larkin went not with the papers, but with Backpage. Lacey, in an interview with the Phoenix New Times -- the paper he started in 1970 -- said that he and Larkin were selling their newspaper holdings to the management group so that the alt weeklies “could devote full energy to the business of journalism.” He stressed that Backpage was protected by the First Amendment. And he vowed to fight for Internet freedom. I wasn’t sure which mattered more to Lacey: that Backpage could make him richer than ever; or that running it would embroil him in a gigantic fight. Lacey always loved a fight. Photo: Andrew Harnik, Associated Press Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. On Sept. 6, Roberts temporarily blocked a congressional subpoena that seeks information on how the classified advertising website Backpage.com screens ads for possible sex trafficking.

THURSDAY, AUTHORITIES arrested Carl Ferrer, the CEO of Backpage.com, at Houston’s Bush Intercontinental Airport, and they raided Backpage’s Dallas headquarters. The arrest warrant, issued in California, accused Ferrer of pimping conspiracy, pimping a minor, and attempted pimping of a minor. (California uses a broad definition of “pimping”: Accepting an ad counts.) Investigators estimated that Backpage takes in $150 million a year. At a Dallas press conference, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton thundered:  “We cannot allow this evil to endure."

A warrant has been issued for the arrests of Lacey and Larkin -- though as of this writing, as far as I can tell, the law hasn’t found them. I understand now why Lacey’s lawyer wouldn’t tell me how to reach him. But what I don’t understand is this: Why did Mike Lacey send me, and God knows how many other former employees, a $5,000 check? Is it, as one friend asked, blood money? Did he expect something in return? Should I say thank you? or send the money back? Was he emptying his bank accounts, lest the money be seized? If so, why not give it all to charities -- say, the University of Arizona? Was he sending checks to people he’d secretly liked? (This might be very secretly: At least one stunned recipient I know had been sure that Lacey hated him.) Was he hoping to buy love from those of us who are still working journalists, and who might defend him in the press? That’s not clear either: Lots of people who seem to be on that list have either retired or aren’t working in media anymore. And as Lacey of all people would know, accepting a big, fat gift like that compromises us. We couldn’t write about him without disclosing it. Maybe, in the end, it’s his way of using Backpage money, one last time, to support “his” journalists -- even though we don’t work for his companies anymore, even though we haven’t for years. I don’t know. I still want to know. Mike Lacey, if you’re reading this, please get in touch.   Lisa Gray runs Gray Matters. Bookmark Gray Matters.

Photo: RNZ / YouTube Maja Skilling started [https://www.change.org/p/dave-chambers-managing-director-countdown-countdown-please-stop-selling-cage-eggs an online petition] this year, which has been backed by almost 18,000 people. Countdown launched a new programme in August to support free range and barn eggs. However, backed by animal rights organisation SAFE, Maja Skilling protested outside an Auckland Countdown this week saying it was not enough. "Their parent company Woolworths in Australia has pledged to be cage-free by 2018. So we thought it would be logical for Countdown in New Zealand to follow the lead of their parent company in Australia and also go cage-free." She said other major companies overseas such as Tesco, Walmart and ALBI had committed to phasing it out as well as all Austrian and Dutch supermarkets. Maja said she had plenty of support from around the country. She was not asking to go cage free overnight but was asking the company to set a target for when they would, she said. A Countdown spokesperson said the company had spoken to Maja directly about it and told her they were committed to increasing the amount of free range and barn eggs on its shelves. However, it said there were some challenges to stopping cage egg sales altogether, including from New Zealand's current suppliers.

Hey America! How would you like to send shockwaves of fear through the elite echelons of the oldest political party on Earth by setting the stage for the most significant political upheaval in human history? By voting for a brilliant but humble doctor from Massachusetts this year, you can help serve the warmongering, election-rigging, oligarch-coddling Democratic Party an eviction notice on the seat of power they’ve occupied for the last 188 years, making way for a radical upset of the careful alliance of power they’ve built with the crumbling Republican Party, transforming America and thereby the world. Oh. Is this not obvious to you? Sorry. Let me back up a bit. So, we’re clear that the primaries were a sham, yeah? Article 5, Section 4 of the DNC Charter, also known as the Impartiality Clause. I believe I’ve mentioned this once or 900 times in previous articles. “The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.” Compare the preceding sentence against a few of the conversations revealed in the DNC leaks, from this small compilation by Heavy if you like, and tell me you don’t see then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz being included in, and even participating in, unashamedly biased and even conspiratorial conversations supporting Clinton over Sanders. So that’s clearly undeniable; nobody loves debating Hillary supporters more than I do, and I’ve never met a single one who can deny or refute any part of the above. It’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s a conspiracy fact. The DNC violated their own rules, Clinton’s nomination is illicit, the only people responsible for regulating the presidential nominating process for their incredibly powerful party are now known to actively manipulate said process, yada yada yada. But that’s not what I’m pointing at right now. The "lesser evil" argument is losing its grip on the American people. Every day, I meet Americans who are sick of the status quo and who are unwilling to be intimidated into voting for the establishment parties. #ItsInOurHands #SteinBaraka #OpenDebates A photo posted by Jill Stein (@drjillstein) on Aug 26, 2016 at 11:17am PDT What I’m calling your attention to here, dear reader, is this: now that we have the luxury of a little time to take a breather and the clarity of hindsight, look how hellbent they all were on keeping Sanders out of the Oval Office. Why were they so freaked out by him? When you were younger, did you ever use to wonder why the world is so crazy? Why we have wars when it’s such a stupid, senseless thing to do, or why we’re killing our ecosystem when it’s the only one we’ve got? Well, Americans got the answer to those questions this year. Even better, if you want to get technical about things: they got to actually meet the answer to those questions. The Bernie Sanders campaign forced the hidden manipulations of American politics right out into the light, the first time the beast has ever been forced to extend itself so far out of the deep, dark comfort zone it had been hiding in up until that point. The elites of the Democratic Party, when faced with a showdown between a loyal insider who was certain to help further their neoliberal agendas and a rabble-rousing outsider who promised to oppose those agendas at every turn, figured they could count on their usual tactics like media blackouts and debate scheduling to minimize public exposure to the disruptive agitator and breeze through to the general election with their anointed queen. What they didn’t count on was social media. Sanders wouldn’t go away, because the public’s suddenly widespread ability to network and share information at an entirely unprecedented pace kept him in the public spotlight, even while network television cameras avoided him like the plague throughout most of his campaign. So the movers and shakers of the Democratic Party had to do a lot more moving and shaking behind the scenes than they were used to, and they got caught red-handed. They panicked, and they got caught. Naturally, they had to push so hard and take so many risks because allowing a true progressive to take the lead of the Democratic Party would be the end of the party in all but name. Democratic politicians have long been forced to walk a precarious line between stringing along their progressive base on one hand and keeping their corporate bosses happy on the other. Should those bosses stop funding the party, they’ll all lose their jobs and the Democratic Party as we know it would cease to exist. Should they lose their progressive base, they won’t have enough voter support to win elections. It’s a tricky balancing act. Well, in 2016 they stepped far to the east of that fine line as we all caught a head-on glimpse of the disgusting beast behind the curtain, and we’re not going to just forget what we saw. The casual, routine way the DNC brass are shown brazenly assaulting American democracy over and over and over again in those emails shows that none of this was in any way new or outside the normal way the Democratic Party conducts its internal affairs behind closed doors. And as I pointed out the other day, rank and file Dems are all acting as though this is perfectly normal and acceptable, which of course means that none of it is going to change. I literally had a Hillary supporter tell me today that the illicit primary isn’t a big deal because elections don’t matter, that it’s organization and activism that gets things done. He ran away (as they so often do) when I challenged him on this, so I’ll just share what I would have told him with you, dear reader: Organization and activism is not to sway politicians, it’s to sway the people. Get enough people looking at the issue your activism is calling attention to, and you get them talking to their friends and writing their congressman and getting journalists salivating over a hot story, and eventually it becomes a hot enough issue that the politicians say “Holy smokes I’d better appease the people or it’ll cost me the next election!” Notice how it comes right back to elections? No elections, no activism. The people do not have a voice if their election process is manipulated by the people responsible for ensuring their fairness. So I say the hell with them all. Let’s collapse their progressive base; should be easy enough to do, seeing as it’s us. Centrists will stay with the Democrats, Democrats will compensate for the loss of our support by absorbing votes from the crumbling Republican Party like they’re already doing now, and the Greens can take their place as the major party on the left. "The battle lines are being drawn; the only question that people must ask themselves is which side they'll be on." — my running mate, @ajamubaraka Which side are you on? Join our movement by clicking the link in my profile: jill2016.com/volunteerpositions #ItsInOurHands #SteinBaraka A photo posted by Jill Stein (@drjillstein) on Sep 29, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT They’ve stopped paying their rent on this slot of the political spectrum, so we serve them an eviction notice on it. They keep losing elections, we keep picking up steam, they consolidate with the Republican Party (if it survives) to pick up their 270 electoral votes for elections to the executive branch, and we become their powerful opposition. The Bernie Sanders campaign revealed that there are vastly more progressives in America than anyone had previously suspected, and as the word gets out about how sane we are compared to those raving lunatics, there will only become more of us. The Democrats have kept their beady eyes locked on the Greens as soon as they began the slow process of forming a cohesive party in the ’80s, and they jump at every possible opportunity to dismiss and diminish them while consistently pretending not to feel threatened. They’ve been aggressively pushing the narrative that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the election in 2000 (debunked in Disinfo here, for the record), even to this day as they hypocritically back a candidate who actively supported all of George W. Bush’s worst decisions (the Iraq invasion, the Patriot Act, and the bank bailouts, for whoever’s counting). This frantic smear campaign continues against Jill Stein today. Typing the words “Jill Stein anti science” into a Google search bar currently yields about 283,000 results, full of Correct the Record shill blogs and attack editorials by corporate journalists trying to get on the good side of what they hope will be the next administration. They persist with these baseless smears even though Stein is a medical doctor who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and taught medicine there for years, and she is published in many scientific journals. Even Snopes debunked the accusations that she was anti-vaccine months ago. That’s a low bar for journalistic integrity if you’re publishing smear that even Snopes debunks. Why do they attack her so frantically? Same reason they attacked Sanders. Democrats don’t fear the right, they fear the left. Please give yourself the gift of watching this impressively lucid five-minute video when you get a chance, which explains in detail how members of the major political parties are bought by corporate donations (which Green Party members are expressly forbidden from accepting) and shows clearly how those donations affect their decisions. Democrats have built themselves an enormous palace made from the mortar of corporatism and the bones of oil war victims, and if the progressives take control of, or worse, replace their party, it all comes crashing down, because progressives oppose the Wal-Mart economy, Wall Street cronyism, predatory trade agreements, and the propping up of the U.S. dollar with U.S. military might, all of which are intrinsic elements of neoliberalism, the predominant ideology of both the Democratic and Republican parties. #Corruption is #Legal in #America https://t.co/fGmUPNMAj6 #uspoli #Election #endcitizensunited #fightbigmoney @StopBigMoney @RepresentDotUs — Green Progressive (@GrnProgressive) October 4, 2016 If the Democrats lose power, they will no longer be the only thing pretending to keep the Republican Party in check by being somewhat slightly to the left of them. This left-foot, right-foot game of inching deeper and deeper into corporatist plutocracy via pretend compromise after pretend compromise between the two pretend-oppositional parties will come grinding to a halt and fall to pieces. All that needs to happen is for us progressives to cease feeding into that movement with our votes, and throw in a green foot that’s marching unequivocally in the other direction. This can’t happen if we write in Bernie. As much as we love him, the Democrats have no fear of the Bernie write-in; there’s even a rumor that the idea is being actively encouraged by Hillary super PACs. Bernie is in an abusive relationship with the Democratic Party, like a battered wife who keeps saying her bruises are from falling down the stairs. We can’t throw a monkey wrench in the plutocracy machine by writing Bernie in, nor by writing in Gary Johnson, since the New York Times reports that he’s taking votes from Trump and Clinton equally, effectively cancelling out the damage he does to the two-legged beast we’re fighting here. Anyone who’s ever made a study of muay thai knows that it’s much more efficient to chop down one of your opponent’s legs than to try and target them both equally, since they need both to move anyway. Pouring all our votes into an attack from the left is a vastly more efficient assault on the beast we’re trying to take down. If we refuse to go back to sleep and keep aggressively and uncompromisingly pushing the progressive revolution, the plutocracy machine will be shrugged off like a heavy coat on a warm summer day. If we take down the plutocracy machine, we save America. If we save America, we save the world. Keep assaulting the beast from the left and we’ll either replace it or take it over. And it all starts by filling out the box for a skinny Massachusetts doctor who eats berries instead of drinking coffee because she finds it more energizing. I met a wonderful new friend in Orlando! #SteinBaraka #ItsInOurHands #ItsInOurPaws #Orlando #Florida A photo posted by Jill Stein (@drjillstein) on Sep 29, 2016 at 3:27pm PDT The Democratic Party has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it has no interest in serving the people. It therefore deserves to die, just like the many, many other political parties all over the world that have died as a result of becoming too corrupt to serve the people. Turns out 188 years is too long. Here’s your eviction notice, donkey party. Get out.

Hammons Convention Center in Rogers. by Jennifer Joyner. Published Oct 7th, 2016 5:59 pm JJoyner@nwabj.com / @tbarkansas Kevin Turner, CEO of Citadel Securities and former chief operating officer of Microsoft Corp., spoke on the significance of artificial intelligence, including digital personal assistants and machines that can “outthink humans,” in addition to augmented reality, which he touted as the “holy grail.” Turner discussed such influential technologies during his keynote speech at the Northwest Arkansas Technology Summit on Friday (Oct. 7) at the John Q. Hammons Convention Center in Rogers. He spoke on cloud capability as the “great enabler” to modern technology, allowing for the “Internet of Things” (IoT) and “enabling mobility to explode.” However, the true influence of technology on people’s lives lies not in the innovations themselves, Turner said, but in the way those technologies are used. “When you think about all that technology, it’s really the application of it that I think is where the magic comes from,” said Turner, pointing to numerous companies, including Airbnb, Tesla, Uber, Bitcoin, SpaceX, Netflix and Amazon, that have used tech to disrupt their industries. Small companies are able to find equal footing to larger ones through technology, Turner said. “It’s the great equalizer,” he said. “It enables you to punch above your weight and gives you the ability to convey a business front that is much larger than your footprint.” And with mobile apps and other online platforms, “a small, local coffee shop can look and feel like a Starbucks,” Turner said. He also credited the world’s largest retailer for its innovativeness. “Walmart has been first on a lot of the technology fronts, because they truly got the ROI and the value of integrating them into the business,” said Turner, who worked 20 years at Wal-Mart, landing a leadership role at age 29 and subsequently serving as chief information officer and then CEO of Sam’s Club. The challenge for businesses in embracing technology, Turner said, is that the expectation is for them to do two things at once. While companies are expected to change with the times, they must also keep up earnings. “No one’s giving anyone a pass,” he said. That means businesses are expected to be “transforming while performing.” “It might seem counterintuitive, but it’s not hard if learning is at the heart of what you’re doing,” Turner said. “It’s important that companies move from being the know-it-all company, to aspiring to be the learn-it-all company.” Businesses also simultaneously innovate and perform well by striving for balance in regard to the time dedicated to each. “I have a thick line of separation between the two, and that’s helped me become better at both,” Turner said, adding that he lets his team know when he is shifting gears from focusing on innovation to tending to day-to-day business. Turner is vice chairman of Citadel, a global investment firm, in addition to serving as CEO of Citadel Securities, which “seeks to transform the way investors interact with global markets through predictive analytics and high-performance computing,” according to its website. He is based in Chicago. At Microsoft, Turner led the company’s worldwide sales, field marketing and services organization, managing more than 60,000 employees in more than 190 countries, according to a NWA Tech Summit press release.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 9, 2016 at 6:07PM The retail sector can be a tough one to navigate, due to fickle consumer tastes and economic pressures. With The Conference Board's consumer confidence index hitting a nine-year high in September, investors should consider adding a few dependable retail stocks to their portfolios, but before doing so, they should answer these eight questions about each stock. Image source: Getty Images. 1. How do its comparable-store sales measure up? Comparable-store sales make revenue comparisons based only on stores open for a pre-defined period (usually at least a year). If a retailer's "comps" have been growing over the past few quarters at a superior rate to those of its industry peers, it might be a worthy buy because that shows revenue growth is coming from increasing sales at existing locations rather than opening up new stores. Apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), for example, reported 3% comps growth last quarter. That figure doesn't sound impressive, but it's much better than Gap's (NYSE:GPS) and Abercrombie & Fitch's (NYSE:ANF) respective declines of 2% and 4% in their most recent quarters. 2. How many stores is the retailer opening and closing? If a retailer opens lots of stores while comps are declining, it's likely using new store openings to inflate reported revenue. If these new stores also fail to post year-over-year growth, they will eventually weigh down its comps and margins in the future. Meanwhile, shuttering lots of stores can indicate that a retailer is desperate to cut costs. Back in August, Macy's decided to close 100 of its department stores, or 15% of its bricks-and-mortar presence. While downsizing should improve Macy's margins and earnings, it also dramatically reduces its top-line growth. 3. Does it have a meaningful e-commerce presence? In the age of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), bricks-and-mortar retailers must have a strong online presence with easy-to-use websites and apps in order to sell to people where they are (online). A strong e-commerce presence also enables retailers to gradually reduce their store count to pivot toward higher-margin online sales. Investors should pay close attention to the percentage of a retailer's revenue that comes from digital channels, and how fast that figure is growing. American Eagle's mobile app. Image source: Google Play. 4. Are inventories rising too quickly? If a retailer's inventories are consistently rising every quarter, big discounts could be required to clear out older products before new ones are brought in. For example, American Eagle's inventories rose 3% annually last quarter, while Gap's declined 3% and A&F's dropped 5%. That might seem like Gap and A&F are selling their products faster than AE, but AE posted better comps growth than both companies. Therefore, AE's inventory growth was likely caused by the introduction of new products instead of the accumulation of old ones. 5. Are gross margins holding steady as revenue rises? Gross margins measure how much of total sales a company keeps. Reporting steady gross margins as revenue improves indicates that a steady flow of new consumers is willing to pay the retailer's listed prices. A look at American Eagle's gross margin and revenue growth over the past two years indicates that it probably won't need to slash prices anytime soon. Source: YCharts But if gross margins and revenue are both declining, a retailer could get stuck in a brutal cycle of slashing prices to prop up sales. That's precisely what happened to Gap over the past two years. Source: YCharts 6. Have you visited the stores? Before you invest in a retailer's stock, you should visit its stores. If you had visited JCPenney's stores during former CEO Ron Johnson's disastrous "turnaround" efforts in 2012, you'd likely have noticed a lot of empty stores. Investors should also beware of retailers that open too many outlet stores, which can cheapen their brand appeal and lower their pricing power. Selling goods through outlets boosts sales, but it can make it tougher to sell higher-margin products in the future. 7. Do you understand the competition? Competition is constantly changing in the retail sector. Apparel retailers face the threat of "cheap chic" players like Forever 21 and H&M, while big-box retailers, superstores, and department stores are losing ground to Amazon. Investors should understand how these retailers are responding to the competition. Gap, for example, hired H&M exec Stefan Larsson (now the CEO of Ralph Lauren) to turn around its low-end Old Navy brand in 2012. Wal-Mart is aggressively countering online competition with price matching, curbside pickups, and subscription-based delivery services. 8. Is the stock expensive relative to its industry peers? Lastly, investors should check if the stock is fairly valued relative to its industry peers. One way to do this is by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio. For example, American Eagle Outfitters trades at 14 times earnings, while the apparel stores industry has a P/E of 24. This means that it might be an undervalued play in the sector if it passes all the aforementioned tests. The bottom line The retail sector is complex, but many of these companies are easily accessible to mainstream investors. The next time you're out shopping, pay close attention to the popular stores -- they just might lead you to a great long-term investment.   Leo Sun owns shares of AMZN and AEO.

Sunday brought the sound of chainsaws as crews and residents continued to clear roadways and yards of trees. Utility crews worked on power lines in Beaufort, Port Royal and the Sea Islands. A 7 p.m. curfew remained in place Sunday evening throughout Beaufort County. A plan for limited re-entry was laid out by emergency officials and expected to be in place by Sunday night. When re-entry begins, those trying to get back into the county will be brought to Whale Branch Early College High School and Bluffton High School, where there will be restrooms and water. People will be asked for their address and purpose for coming back, and if their home is an area without power or is unsafe, they remain at the school. Beaufort City Manager Bill Prokop urged residents not to return until Tuesday afternoon or risk waiting at the school for hours. State transportation officials cleared all of northern Beaufort County’s bridges for travel except Harbor River Bridge. Government offices and Beaufort County schools will be closed through at least Tuesday. Beaufort’s City Council meeting scheduled Tuesday was canceled. Beaufort Memorial Hospital’s emergency room reopened at noon Sunday. Opening the facility and restoring power to essential areas were among the issues Beaufort County emergency personnel addressed ahead of re-entry. Beaufort County opened entry early Sunday to those who already possess primary, secondary or security re-entry passes. The passes only apply to individuals, the county emergency hotline said. Power crews worked throughout northern Beaufort County to clear trees from power lines and restore the power grid. Power has been restored to some areas. Beaufort Memorial Hospital experienced some leaking due to rain, but the issues have been repaired, hospital spokeswoman Courtney McDermott said Sunday. The hospital is running on full power and outpatient medical services could reopen by Tuesday, president and CEO Russell Baxley said. Gov. Nikki Haley at a news conference Sunday said the hospital sustained structural and flooding damage, though she didn’t provide specifics. Beaufort-Port Royal firefighters went door-to-door assessing damages to homes and businesses, keeping a log at their Ribaut Road headquarters. The city’s building code contractor will follow up on the list and arrived Sunday morning to begin looking at flood damage in problem areas like Mossy Oaks and the Point neighborhood downtown. Port Royal’s building inspector will conduct a similar process, but there is less damage than in the city, Town Manager Van Willis said. The highest water mark they had found as of lunchtime Sunday was 2  1/2 feet in a garage on Battery Creek Road. The Port Royal Public Works Department worked with the Greenery to clear about 30 locations where trees are blocking roads, Willis said. In most cases, there is access to homes and businesses, he said. Greenery employees picked up debris in Naval Heritage Park and throughout Old Village on Sunday. The town remains under a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. Meanwhile, some businesses began showing signs of life. The Shell gas station at First Boulevard and Ribaut Road began pumping Sunday, and some gas was reported on Boundary Street. Lady’s Island Publix was open Sunday, restricting the number of customers initially and later only accepting cash and credit cards. Lowe’s, Walmart and Golden Corral on Robert Smalls Parkway were working to reopen Sunday. Beaufort Pharmacy and Compounding across from Beaufort Memorial Hospital is open. Emergency officials are also working to establish local shelters for those whose homes are uninhabitable when they return. Residents who know their homes are damaged should have a plan in place. Emergency officials expect medical calls to begin once people return and begin working around their homes or living near trees weakened by the storm. “Beware you might come back to a home you can’t stay in,” Beaufort-Port Royal Fire Chief Reece Bertholf said. “Now what do you do?” Stephen Fastenau: 843-706-8182, @IPBG_Stephen Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:59 Missing S.C.

Parenting: Hurricanes and monsters PAMELA HAYFORD , PAMELA@SWFLPARENTCHILD.COM 10:58 p.m. EDT October 17, 2016 Storms teach us how to survive other emergencies, too Hurricanes can teach us about surviving other emergencies, too. (Photo: Thinkstock.com) 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Poll: Have you created a family emergency plan? All I could think about this week was that monster storm churning up the east coast. When my daughter pointed out a book she wanted at a school book fair Friday — a creepy-looking cover with the title “Monster Survival Guide” — I thought about Hurricane Matthew. Will the book help you survive a monster storm, I thought. Actually, maybe... Think about it. The advice that experts dole out to families at the start of every hurricane season could easily apply to any emergency situation or disruption in our ordinary routines. Be a model for your kids. A lot of experts bring this up first. Kids are more likely to do as you do than as you say. By the same token, they also take their emotional cues from us adults. If you freak out, they’ll freak out. This is true of Category 4 storms, a zombie apocalypse or a blown tire on your way to the school drop-off line the very day you have an important 8 a.m. meeting at work. Talk with your kids. Tell your children what can happen in a storm, the experts say. Don’t exaggerate but don’t make light of the situation. Explain that their routine will likely be disrupted for a few days. Ask them what their fears are, and if they have any, ask them what they think the family should do. This applies to any emergency we face. Even if the monster is cancer, talking with your children in this way empowers them and gives you insight into what they’re thinking. Let your child help prepare. For storms, Florida’s emergency management folks have a great website for creating an emergency plan: flgetaplan.com. My daughter sat down with me a few years ago when we made our first one. She helped me gather information and make lists of supplies we’d need. Not all emergencies give you a five-day cone of possibility, but talking out “what-if” scenarios can be helpful, just like a fire drill or active shooter drill at school. Family dinners are a great opportunity for these conversations. You could use a current event in the news as a starting point and ask “what would you do?” For example, “If you saw someone bullying another kid, what would you do?” Sometimes kids will come up with solutions you never would have imagined on your own. Give hugs, lots of hugs. When my dad died, one of my aunts, who is a nurse, kept hugging me and she’d tell me that studies show hugs make us feel better. So she doled them out like candy on Halloween. And you know what? She was right. The hugs might not have made the “storm” go away, but they certainly made them more bearable.

Downed power lines mangled in trees partially blocked the road in front of the Horry County Museum, and while traffic signals were mangled, many were still operational. In downtown neighborhoods, residents drove through a maze of back roads to maneuver around giant, uprooted trees that completely blocked roadways. Sections of the roof blew off Elissa Hollywood’s house during the storm, which she described as worse than Hurricane Hugo. “I thought I had lived through the worst. Apparently not,” Hollywood said. “I think actually we had numerous tornadoes come up through the hurricane as well, because I could hear them sounding like a train coming. It’s a very ominous and scary feeling,” Hollywood said. Restless neighbors walked their dogs and children, steering clear of the power lines that littered neighborhoods. A group of teenagers climbed across one enormous tree on Ninth Avenue that was uprooted Saturday by Hurricane Matthew, but jumped down after they were told the tree was resting on top of fallen power lines. “We were going stir crazy,” explained Amanda Rodermond. Robert Skaggs and a friend did their sightseeing by bicycle, stopping to rest at a picnic table beneath the Waccamaw River bridge, where rising flood waters had already cut off the walkway. “We haven’t seen the worst of it yet,” Skaggs said of the next disaster poised to strike Conway — major river flooding. I thought I had lived through the worst. Apparently not. Elissa Hollywood Skaggs lives along Highway 90 outside of Conway, which also was hammered by hurricane force gusts. That highway was declared closed by the county, but was dangerously passable. The only thing holding up dozens of trees uprooted by the storm were power lines, cutting the highway to one lane as motorists swerved to avoid driving underneath the sagging branches. Work trucks made their way down the highway, cutting away tree branches so the power company could restore electricity. Considering the massive damage — 54,000 customers of Horry Electric Cooperative without power Saturday evening — Sharon Muhl of Hillsborough wasn’t confident. “I don’t think we’re going to get power for quite some time,” Muhl said. “It’s a shame, but this is the area we live in and we have to expect it once in a while.” The power was restored along most of Highway 501, where fast food restaurants were packed with customers with no electricity to cook at home. Walmart in Conway was also crowded with shoppers stocking up on non-perishable food. At Lowe’s, employees loaded generators on handcarts, barely beating the demand of customers. Although Gov. Nikki Haley had not lifted the evacuation order for Horry County by Saturday afternoon, Highway 501 was already jammed with traffic, heading towards Myrtle Beach.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAmazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Amazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Not satisfied being the dominating force in the e-commerce industry, Amazon is now challenging Google in its own turf. October 9, 2016 WSP Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) exponential growth has been giving rivals sleepless nights but the e-commerce titan is not done dominating one industry after another. Next on the company’s hit list? Google. In a feature by The Wall Street Journal, Amazon has been slowly making a presence in the digital advertising business and though the move is in its infancy, the online retailer is using its 63 million strong Prime members as leverage to win over advertisers. According to news source, Amazon’s ad business is pretty basic, focusing more on driving online sales using sponsored ads anywhere online or through Amazon’s online store but it won’t be long before the e-commerce powerhouse will use its culled data to attract more marketers. For one thing, Amazon can make any partner brands look good to customers, scoring targeted sales. The Seattle-based company could also provide more exposure to its marketers’ products to boost sales. Market research firm eMarketer has predicted that in 2017, Amazon’s ad business will grow to an impressive 9.4%, generating about 1 billion in online revenue in the US alone. But with Amazon’s North American division’s 28% growth in the second quarter and a harder push for sponsored listings on its website and app, there’s the real possibility that Amazon’s ad campaign will exceed the market’s expectation. Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of the digital ad agency “Deep Focus” said Amazon culled so much data that it’s anyone’s guess how it will be used and for how long since the company implements strict rules on how its data is used outside of its shopping platform. Now the question is, will Amazon’s entry in the ad segment pose a threat to Google’s lead position? That will depend really on how hard Amazon wants to push in its ad rivalry against Google. That said, the e-commerce firm has yet to lay out a plan in terms of expanding its own digital marketing campaign. Additionally, there’s no way to say if Amazon will be in it for long-term since the company has a lot on its plate. Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains unfazed over Amazon’s entry into an industry the search giant  has dominated for years. The Alphabet Inc.-owned conglomerate is betting big on its own shopping platform, an e-commerce channel that will feature sponsored products with images linked within Google’s own search results and shopping site. These ads are the same ones that eBay, Wal-Mart, Target and other online retailers use, with the exemption of Amazon. This means there’s plenty of opportunity for Google to cement its leading position in the industry. Curiously, Amazon is keeping its new business under wraps and it’s hard to guess the company’s level of commitment to the initiative. Although the online retailer remains a minor player in the ad marketing segment, Amazon may give Google – along with the industry’s number 2. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) – a real competition as long as it plays its cards right. AMZN GOOGL Previous article Next article Related Articles Business How Does Amazon (AMZN) Get Such a High Valuation?

Komen Race for the Cure. Close to 1,000 people filled the streets to support those who are fighting, have fought, or survived breast cancer.  Many saw the race as a way of restoring hope and finding a cure.  “It is about honoring their complete healing,” said Shelli Rushing, who ran the race to honor two of her friends fighting breast cancer. “We see lots of tutus,” said Hannah Beaty, who works for Susan G. Komen of North Texas. “We see lots of lays and lots of pink.” It goes further than just wearing the pink.  More than 20 years ago Race for the Cure came to Wichita Falls for the first time, and every year it not only grows with decorations but racers. "Everything we did leading up to today made it all worthwhile,” said Rushing who did the race for the first time Saturday.  She and her daughter Hanna wanted to deliver hope. "It's okay, there are survivors if you catch it you can survive,” said Rushing.  “It's not a death sentence." Both mom and daughter will be back next year but with one more thing in mind. "Buy more tutu stuff,” said Rushing.   “We ran out last night we were crazy going to Walmart and Michaels trying to get everything finished.  So next year we know to buy more tutu stuff.”   There were 2 separate races on Saturday.  Runners were able to run or walk the traditional 5K, or do a 1 mile family race.  News HeadlinesNewsMore>> WF water line break expected to cause traffic delays WF water line break expected to cause traffic delays Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 12:23 AM EST2016-11-14 05:23:33 GMT A water line leak in Wichita Falls is expected to cause traffic delays Monday morning.  A water line leak in Wichita Falls is expected to cause traffic delays Monday morning.  Trial set to begin in Thrasher murder Trial set to begin in Thrasher murder Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 12:09 AM EST2016-11-14 05:09:39 GMT (Source:RNN) Jury selection is scheduled to begin tomorrow in the trial of a man accused of killing 21-year-old Domanic Thrasher last June in Wichita falls.  Jury selection is scheduled to begin tomorrow in the trial of a man accused of killing 21-year-old Domanic Thrasher last June in Wichita falls.  California deputy shot twice in the head, suspect arrested California deputy shot twice in the head, suspect arrested Posted: Sunday, November 13 2016 10:57 PM EST2016-11-14 03:57:05 GMT Updated: Sunday, November 13 2016 10:57 PM EST2016-11-14 03:57:05 GMT Officials say a Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputy was killed while responding to a call about a suspicious car and person.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Blood centers issue urgent pleas Saturday Oct 8, 2016 at 2:51 PM Oct 9, 2016 at 8:52 AM Hurricane caused shutdowns, and supplies are low Staff report The blood centers that serve this region need immediate help in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. OneBlood, which provides to Marion County hospitals, was shut down for several days in various locations because of the storm. It's important to note that OneBlood operates not just in Florida but also Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The latter states, like Florida, have felt the effects of Matthew. LifeSouth Community Blood Centers, which provides to Gainesville hospitals including the VA (there are always some Marion patients at those locations) was shut down Friday. LifeSouth also supplies hospitals in Alabama and Georgia. Both blood centers issued urgent appeals on Saturday. OneBlood said: "While all blood types are needed, there is an urgent need for platelets and plasma as well as O negative and O positive blood." LifeSouth said: "Type O negative donors and apheresis platelet donors are especially needed, but donors of all blood types can help." LifeSouth only uses the word "emergency" when reserve levels drop to less than a two-day supply. That is the case here. The OneBlood center in Ocala is at 1051 SW First Ave. but is not open on Sundays. OneBlood has two mobile drives scheduled for Sunday: + 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., Christ Lutheran Church, Orange Blossom Hills Community Center, Summerfield.      + 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Walmart, 17861 S. U.S. 441, Summerfield The LifeSouth center in Ocala is at 1607 E. Silver Springs Blvd. It will be open 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday. A mobile blood drive, including a cookout, will be from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Sunday in the Quail Hollow subdivision at 2816 SE 25th Terrace, Ocala.
