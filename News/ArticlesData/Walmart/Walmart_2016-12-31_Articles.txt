Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 1, 2017 at 4:59PM In fiscal 1972, just after Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) went public, the retailer booked a respectable $78 million of revenue across its 51 stores. Today, it generates almost $500 billion of sales through 11,500 locations and a large online presence. More than 260 million customers passed through Wal-Mart's retailing doors last year. Image source: Wal-Mart. The company founded by Sam Walton credits its extreme focus on low prices for helping it grow from a tiny regional player into a global retailing titan. The entire half-century trip -- with the exception of the most recent past -- has been enormously rewarding for shareholders. I'll touch on that slowdown in a moment, but first here's a look at how well early investors made out with a Wal-Mart stock purchase. Wal-Mart stock and dividend history Wal-Mart stock started trading on Oct. 1, 1970, when the company offered 300,000 shares to the public at a price of $16.50 per share. That $5 million initial market capitalization translates into about $31 million in today's dollars. Considering the company is now worth over $200 billion, it's fair to say that a Wal-Mart investment has outpaced both inflation and the broader stock market. WMT long-term stock history data by YCharts, Wal-Mart has had 11 two-for-one stock splits since its initial public offering, so that 100 shares purchased at the IPO price of $16.50 (for a total investment of $16,500) would today amount to over 200,000 shares and $14 million of equity. As that math suggests, the stock-price run has produced many millionaires over the decades. The biggest winners have been Waltons, who, for the last three years, have topped Forbes' listing of the richest families in America. But there's much more to the total-return picture than just capital appreciation. Wal-Mart has paid -- and boosted -- its dividend each year since 1974. The annual dividend most recently hit $2 per share, or just under half of the company's annual earnings. Recent performance Wal-Mart's newest shareholders haven't enjoyed blockbuster returns. In fact, the stock has trailed the market over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods, but adding dividends into the picture makes the stock a winner over the last decade. Investors turned especially bearish over the last two years as Wal-Mart suffered from a period of customer traffic declines that it responded to by boosting spending on the shopping experience through initiatives like raising wages and stocking more products on shelves. These changes helped traffic levels begin inching higher again -- at the expense of profit growth. Operating income last quarter slumped by 11%. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart still routinely lags rival Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which is enjoying about twice the retailing-titan's sales-expansion pace. The warehouse giant also focuses on offering the lowest possible price to customers, and its traffic growth only recently slowed after six-straight years of 4% or better gains.  WMT 5-year stock history data by YCharts. While it fends off market-share threats from Costco and other discount retailers, Wal-Mart also must face major challenges from online competitors. Over the last decade, e-commerce has surged from accounting for 3% of the retailing industry to more than 8%. Much of that growth has come at the expense of traditional retailers like Wal-Mart. In response, the company is plowing investments into its online infrastructure, with $1 billion of spending slated for 2017. However, it's far from clear whether that spending will deliver long-term returns. E-commerce accounted for just 0.2 percentage points of Wal-Mart's 1% sales uptick in its most recent fiscal year. A winning approach Investors considering a Wal-Mart purchase today are looking at a much different business than the one that went public 46 years ago. Most importantly, its growth options are limited by its massive size and by unfavorable retailing trends. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's scale gives it considerable benefits, too, including massive resources that it can devote toward improving its position with shoppers both in its stores and on the internet. The next half-century will no doubt involve vast changes to the retailing industry, but it's likely that Wal-Mart's approach of price leadership will still be resonating with customers decades from now.

Run DMC Sues Walmart And Amazon For Over $50 Million Home News Sudipti Khatry January 1st, 2017 - 9:08 AM Buy music on this topic at | Amazon Run-D.M.C, after reuniting temporarily at Fun Fun Fun Fest in 2012, has sued Walmart, Amazon, Jet.com and others for trademark infringement. According to Pitchfork, in addition to Walmart, Amazon and Jet.com, Run-D.M.C has also created a lawsuit against Vision World, Inc., Infinity Fashion, Inc., SW Global Corp., and 20 anonymous companies, who are partners with the three major retailers. The band, specifically Darryl McDaniels, filed for a lawsuit on Thursday in the Southern District of New York. With this he has claimed that these retailers are attempting to confuse the public by “advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products claiming to be Run-D.M.C. styled products” These products include  include glasses, hats, t-shirts, patches, and wallets. CBS News had reported that this lawsuit also claimed that retailers have harmed the brand that has created more than $100 million in revenue since its beginning. In response to this, the brand is asking for $50 million with interest and “any other relief this Court deems just and equitable.” According to Billboard, these other reliefs will include attorney’s fees, accounting of all sales of the defendants’ products that were advertised as being related to Run-D.M.C. or directly use its trademark and an injunction and restraining order against sales and promotion of these products. Currently there has been no comment made from these three major retailers about the situation.

That’s the generation, said Walmart exec Mike Hulett, who drive a lot of marketing decisions by many of the nation’s Fortune 500 companies, including mega-retailer Walmart. Fruit marketers, he said, should take note. Hulett, who grew up in Chelan and is now based in Walmart’s home city of Bentonville, Arkansas, discovers and helps market fresh foods for the global corporation. On Dec. 5, he talked on “Mega-Trends for Fresh Produce Retail” at the Washington State Tree Fruit Association’s 112th Annual Meeting & NW Expo in Wenatchee. Hulett said Millennials, ages 16 to 35, are worth watching because they’re the largest generation in numbers (80 million in the U.S.) with the largest percentage of the nation’s workforce. Ninety-five percent of them are connected online, which makes them a powerful buying force. Most importantly, said, Hulett, as a group their highest value is direct experience rather than hearsay or second-hand knowledge. “They show status,” he said, “through the things they do.” So when it comes to apples, said Hulett, Millennials will prize its texture (crispness, crunchiness) and taste (flavor, freshness) and relate those qualities — good or bad — to their peers, either in person or through social media. Apples, pears and cherries also fit the Millennials’ idea of eating “clean and clear” foods that promote good health and enhance human performance, he said. Fruit also meets Millennials’ demand for convenient foods and “responsible snacking.” Among Millennials, “fresh” is the most sought-after food trend, with 87 percent of them currently seeking and buying fresh foods. “They seek fresh because they want to trust the foods they eat and the companies who provide it,” Hulett said. When marketing to Millennials, he said, “a lot of people in the grocery industry are betting on fresh as the key trend towards customer satisfaction.    Monthly ‘Shop Talks’ is all business WENATCHEE — The Wenatchee Downtown Association has launched a series of information meetings where merchants and employees can learn from fellow business folks. The hour-long monthly sessions — called “Shop Talks” — are set for 8:30 a.m. on the first Wednesday of each month. To begin, the sessions will be held in the meeting room of Merriment Party Goods, 23 S. Wenatchee Ave. Each session “will feature downtown merchants or members of the community and organizations who will connect us — teach us and inform us,” said Linda Haglund, the WDA’s executive director. The sessions are free and will include coffee and morning snacks. Presentations scheduled for coming months include social media, the historic relevance of downtown, insurance and benefits, succession planning, attracting new customers and more. Those planning to attend upcoming Shop Talks should RSVP Haglund at 662-0059 or linda@wendowntown.org.   Express Employment honored for hiring of veterans WENATCHEE — A local job placement company has been recognized as one of a dozen businesses around the state for its hiring of veterans in 2016. Express Employment Professionals of Wenatchee placed nine veterans in jobs in 2016 and participated in numerous veteran-focused job projects, including the Wenatchee Veterans Hiring Event in September. The state Employment Security Department announced award recipients in November in support of a Hire-A-Veteran proclamation by Gov. Jay Inslee. Other award recipients included businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Yakima, Richland, Spokane, Olympia, Ferndale, Everett, Seattle and Woodland. From July 2015 through June 2016, WorkSource — the job and career arm of Employment Security — placed nearly 7,500 veterans into jobs, said an agency press release. About 85 percent were still employed after six months at an average wage of $17.60 per hour, the release said.   Goodwill is gravy at cafe’s 20th free Thanksgiving meal CHELAN — The Apple Cup Cafe in Chelan celebrated 20 years of serving up its free — yes, free — Community Thanksgiving Dinner on Nov. 24. Owner Ryan Peterson says around 900 people gobble-gobbled 44 huge turkeys and pans full of yams, corn, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy. And also hundreds of slices of pumpkin and apple pie. Much of the food is donated by the restaurant’s vendors and is prepared and served by scores of volunteers. Peterson’s mom, Dian Prentice, started the meal two decades ago after buying the restaurant, now in business for nearly 60 years. “This Thanksgiving Dinner has been a tradition for me since I was 9 years old,” said Peterson. “It started out as a way for us (Apple Cup Cafe) to give back to the community. But now it’s evolved into the community giving back to the community, sharing what we have with neighbors friends and family.”   Famous Footwear kicks off new store in East Wenatchee EAST WENATCHEE — Here’s some news to lift your soles: Buying shoes here just got a whole lot easier. Famous Footwear, the national chain with scores of shoe brands at more than 1,200 stores, opened its second area location Nov. 23 at Wenatchee Valley Mall.  “We’re in a prime spot next to Macy’s,” said manager Michael Imperato, a 9-year veteran of Wenatchee Valley retail. “It should be easy for customers to find us.” He and co-worker Silvia De Jesus, also a longtime retail pro, have transferred from Famous Footwear at Valley North Center in Wenatchee to open the new store across the river. De Jesus, who’s worked four years at the Wenatchee location, will serve as assistant manager. The new Famous Footwear will have 5,498 square feet of shopping and storage space and around 10 employees. The store opening in East Wenatchee coincides with another location that recently opened in Seattle. “Our decision to open two new stores was based on a recognized consumer need,” said Rick Ausick, president of Famous Footwear. The East Wenatchee store’s grand opening Dec. 10 featured a giveaway of 100 pairs of shoes to the first 100 customers.    Fruit magazine says ‘hola’ YAKIMA — One of the fruit industry’s primary publications, “Good Fruit Grower” magazine, has launched a Spanish-language website to serve the growing number of Latinos working in tree fruit and wine grape businesses.  The site features articles and essays by researchers published in the magazine, plus videos on best horticultural practices.  “Our new site is one more way we serve the grower community, and Spanish speakers are a vital part of that community,” said BJ Thurlby, president of the Washington State Fruit Commission, which owns the magazine.  Info: goodfruit.com/es.   Carl Campbell an unassuming success WENATCHEE — Carl Campbell lives in a 12,000-square-foot Wenatchee penthouse, loves his two big houses on Lake Chelan, has owned and piloted multiple private jets and until recently ran one of the nation’s largest companies of retirement and assisted-living communities. And — just ask anybody — he’s one of the nicest, most modest and quiet-spoken multi-millionaires you’d ever want to meet. “Carl’s a man of high moral character and extremely fair in business transactions, which in my opinion is the root of his success,” said Tom Leonard, an accountant who’s worked with Campbell for more than a decade. “He is a true gentleman,” said Sharon Tompkins, Campbell’s administrative assistant for the past 26 years. “Honest and humble.” Campbell, who at 95 stands at the edge of retirement, recently recapped his life of accomplishment — in health care, aviation, retail development and philanthropy — as he begins downsizing his living quarters and reducing his business responsibilities while expanding his commitment to family, church and community. “It’s time to retire, time for a younger generation to take over it all,” said the still sharp and energetic nonagenarian. “I’ve got other things on my plate.” And a crowded plate it is. In coming months and years, Campbell plans to: Help oversee the sale, announced in September, of the last four properties in his senior living empire to Vancouver-based Prestige Care, Inc., a family-run company which owns 70 senior communities in eight western states. Campbell’s company, Triple-C Convalescent Centers, once had more than 180 properties in 21 states. Step back from day-to-day operations but still be involved in the running of the Carl and Betty Campbell Foundation of Caring Fund, which has donated millions of dollars to local charities, churches and causes, including $1 million to the Central Washington Hospital Foundation in 2011. Resize and remodel his 12,000-square-foot penthouse apartment on the fifth floor of Colonial Vista Care Center down to a 1,200-square-foot living space. He’ll then portion off the rest for additional apartments for tenants. He’ll also continue to occupy his business office behind the Colonial Vista tower. Spend more time with family at his Lake Chelan properties and continue his involvement with the Wenatchee Seventh-day Adventist Church. Maybe even take a few cruises. Retirement, sure. But leisure? That may not come so easily for Campbell. “He’s a man who understands hard work,” said Leonard. “He and wife Betty started in the senior housing industry by performing all the services — administrative, assisting the residents, cooking, cleaning … all the hard work.” Even now when Campbell walks through the halls of Colonial Vista, he takes time to chat with employees and ask about their tasks. “He has great appreciation for the work they are performing,” said Leonard. “He was once in their shoes.” Beginnings Born in Yakima, Campbell grew up during the lean years of the Great Depression, a time that instilled in him a love of family, skills for saving and investing and an early understanding of the healthy diet advocated by the Seventh-day Adventists. Post high-school, Campbell studied to become a certified public accountant and then joined his brother Willis to work in the Alaskan lumber and building trades. He married Betty in 1942, and they were together — romantically and in business — for 68 years. The couple has two children — Kathy Ball, who with husband Marc runs The Guilded Lily in downtown Wenatchee, and Danny Campbell, who with his family lives in California — six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. In 1953, while working construction in Seattle, Campbell fell on a saw and cut off the four fingers of his right hand. Miraculously, a surgeon successfully sewed them back, although their mobility has been limited. “I can still type,” chuckled Campbell, “but only with one digit.” The trauma of losing and regaining his fingers spurred him, he said, “to pray to God, to promise him that if he saw me through this (tragedy), I would serve him the rest of my life.” Campbells pauses for a beat. “He did. I have. And my life has been full of his gifts.” One gift, he said, was a nursing home project in Union Gap that he completed with his brother — an old three-story house converted into a 7-bed nursing home facility. It was Campbell’s first senior living project, and in the next 40 years he’d build or operate around 180 more. Health care pioneers Carl and Betty Campbell moved to Wenatchee in 1953 — “we wanted to live away from the rainy side,” said Carl — and together began the design and construction of Parkside Sanitarium, one of the first full-service nursing homes in Eastern Washington. Carl handled finances and construction; Betty tackled interior design and office administration. It was a division of labor that would last until her death in 2010. “I was the boss,” he laughed, “but she didn’t always think I was.” The Campbells built more senior facilities — some of them assisted living homes, which were revolutionary for the time — in Cashmere, Chelan, Moses Lake, Spokane, Idaho and Oregon. “We were pioneers when it came to assisted living,” said Campbell. “Hardly anyone was doing it. But we saw the need and decided it was a concept we should try.” Their success in senior housing eventually grew to become Triple C Convalescent Centers, a company offering senior options from retirement to assisted living to skilled nursing facilities. Up in the air After Betty, Campbell’s second love was aviation. His office walls are packed with framed photos of airplanes and private jets — Learjets, Cessnas, Beechcraft — many of which he owned. Early in life, he became a pilot and by the time he stepped away from the cockpit (just over a decade ago) had clocked more than 6,000 hours in the air. Eventually, Campbell figured out how to combine his love of winged machines with business. In 1982 at Pangborn Memorial Airport, he opened Executive Flight, an air ambulance and charter business that grew to have 14 jets and more than 100 employees, including 50 pilots and 23 mechanics. The business thrived for 30 years, but the recession of 2008-09 took its toll on charter flights. Campbell and his staff ended charter services in 2012, sold all the planes but one, and now run the Executive Flight facility at Pangborn as an FBO (fixed base operation) service. That means fueling, maintenance and hangar rentals. “Over the years, it became more than a business to me,” said Campbell. “Yes, I’ve always loved aviation, but the air ambulance service touched many lives, helped so many residents here. People still tell me stories how the service helped them or a loved one.” Giving back As the Campbells prospered, they contributed millions. Donations helped fund the Central Washington Hospital Foundation, financed a new home for the East Wenatchee Seventh-day Adventist Spanish Church, built an expansion of the Cascade Christian Academy, funded medical research at various facilities and have helped back charitable efforts for dozens of local nonprofits and civic groups. “There are so many good causes out there, particularly in this area, that deserve support,” said Campbell. So what’s the secret of Campbell’s long and active life? “Oh, I suppose a mostly vegetarian diet, which is followed by many Seventh-day Adventists, has helped me stay healthy,” he said. “But I’m optimistic, too. I look forward to every day, to see what God has in store.” Tourism Summit now free OLYMPIA — Pack your bags. All fees to attend the 2017 Washington Tourism Summit are being covered by a handful of corporate and civic sponsors, including Boeing, Port of Seattle, Visit Seattle, a couple of tribal casinos and others.  Hosted by the Washington Tourism Alliance, the free summit kicks off at 8 a.m. Jan. 24 at the Washington Center for Performing Arts in Olympia. Keynote speaker will be Roger Dow, president of the U.S. Travel Association.  Info: watourismalliance.com/tourismsummit.   Native nonprofit to receive Wells Fargo grant NESPELEM — A Native American lending and business education group will receive a $240,000 grant from Wells Fargo bank. The Northwest Native Development Fund, based in Nespelem, is one of 12 institutions this year to receive such an award, called the “Wells Fargo Works for Small Business: Diverse Community Capitol” grants. Wells Fargo announced in November it will provide $11.2 million in lending capital and grant monies to minority-owned small businesses. All grant recipients are Community Development Financial Institutions, which are private, nonprofit groups that assist underserved populations. The NNDF will use the grant money to provide loans to small business owners who may not qualify for traditional financing and to also upgrade technology and increase technical assistance and coaching to borrowers.   Chelan Seaplanes loses lease, glides to a halt CHELAN — Lake Chelan’s only commercial seaplane service has suspended operations between Chelan and Stehekin following termination of the lease on a portion of its longtime lakeside location. Shane Carlson, owner of Chelan Seaplanes, said Dec. 1 he received a lease termination notice from the property’s new occupants — developers of the planned Sunset Marina LLC and condos — and has been unable to find a new, suitable lakeside location for the 71-year-old flight service. But he’s still looking. In 2009, Chelan Seaplanes took over operations of Chelan Airways, which had been flying the route to Stehekin and other Lake Chelan locations since 1945. The service has operated for more than 30 years on property next to the Lady of the Lake boat facility on Lake Chelan’s south shore. “This is a very sad day for Chelan Seaplanes, and we deeply regret the situation we are in,” Carlson said in a press release. “Most importantly, it’s a sad day for Stehekin and the Chelan Valley. The historic seaplane service has come to an end for now.” Scott McKellar, spokesman for the partnership building the marina and condos, confirmed his company had terminated the flight service’s lease, but said Carlson had known about the change since March. The terminated lease covers parking spaces used by Chelan Seaplane’s customers and an access area to an adjacent property where the planes dock, he said. Docking floats for the seaplanes are connected to a third party’s lakefront property. “We suggested other options to Mr. Carlson,” said McKellar, “but it’s up to him to act on them.” McKellar said Sunset Marina, in partnership with property owners Goodfellow Bros. Inc., will begin construction of the marina-condo development sometime this winter. Developers hope to build the foundation of a lakeside clubhouse while seasonal lake levels are at their lowest. Additional construction of the marina, condos and amenities will launch in the spring. Chelan Seaplanes operated each year between mid-May and mid-October, and in 2016 flew more than 5,000 passengers on scheduled flights between Chelan and Stehekin. The company, one of three Northwest flight services run by Carlson, usually kept one plane — a six-seat DeHavilland Beaver float plane — stationed in Lake Chelan with one full-time and three part-time pilots available. The company flew three scheduled flights daily, but charter runs sometimes pushed that number up to seven flights daily. In addition to Chelan Seaplanes, Carlson operates Friday Harbor Seaplanes, which is based in Renton, and Northwest Seaplanes, which runs scheduled and charter flights to British Columbia destinations. Carlson said he’s hopeful that the air company can resume service soon. He said he’s considered other lakeside locations as a seaplane base, but high costs or poor siting has eliminated most locations. Ideally, a new base would be a location protected from prevailing winds, not far from downtown Chelan and situated near the Lady of the Lake boat facility. Carlson estimated that between 30 and 45 percent of his seaplane customers use a boat-plane combination to visit Stehekin. Carlson said one option to save the air service would be a collaboration among Chelan Seaplanes, the City of Chelan and the Port of Chelan County to build a seaplane base. “We are confident that with the support of the Stehekin businesses and residents, along with those in the Chelan Valley that have valued the service, we will come together with a solution to restore the service and find a permanent home for the seaplane service,” said Carlson. “The service has been on the lake far too long to see it go away permanently,” he said.   Marson and Marson to merge with Tum-A-Lum LEAVENWORTH — Local building supply retailer Marson and Marson Lumber has announced it will merge its four-store chain with a similar-sized lumber and supply company located in Oregon. The 61-year-old Marson and Marson company — with stores in Leavenworth, Wenatchee, Chelan and Cle Elum — begins operating as part of the Tum-A-Lum Lumber company on Jan. 3. The local stores will continue to operate under the Marson and Marson name. “This move is part of our families’ long-term strategy for the growth of the company as well as providing future opportunities for our employees,” said Marson and Marson President Ken Marson. “Tum-A-Lum is a family-owned company with business values not unlike our company’s founders.” Marson said he will continue in company management for at least the next two years. He’s been with the business for 41 years and is the last founding-family member working for the company. The 70-employee Marson and Marson, which operates full-service lumber yards and building supply centers, was founded in 1955 by Gordon and Marydell Marson and Kenneth and Marie Marson. The merger includes the company’s four stores, a truss plant, design center and drywall distribution facility. Closing of the deal means Marson and Marson will become a division of TAL Holdings LLC, the parent company of Tum-A-Lum. “Our company was founded on the same basic business principles as Tum-A-Lum — building honest, fair and ethical relationships with our customers,” said Marson. “I see our ongoing operations as business as usual.” The 110-year-old Tum-A-Lum has three building supply centers in Oregon — Hood River, The Dalles and Pendleton.   Fruit industry experts talk tech, labor, marketing at annual Hort convention WENATCHEE — Change is the new normal, said fruit expert Jim McFerson. And that’s not likely to change soon. Growers, shippers and marketers at the Washington State Tree Fruit Association’s annual convention gave knowing nods here Dec. 5 to presentations — including McFerson’s keynote speech — highlighting dramatic change in the fruit industry over the last 20 years. Technology, research, orchard practices, labor challenges, marketing and packaging — nearly all industry sectors have evolved to meet shifting consumer tastes and the rise of global markets, said experts at the WSTFA’s 112th Annual Meeting and NW Hort Expo. With a theme of “The New Normal: Continuous Change,” the gathering ran through Dec. 7 at the Wenatchee Convention Center. “Advances in science and the digital revolution have brought widespread innovation to the industry,” said McFerson, director of Washington State University Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee. “They’ve changed our industry in fundamental ways.” McFerson delivered the association’s 37th Batjer Address — titled “Technology Road Map 2.0” — to a ballroom packed with hundreds of industry insiders. More than 1,600 people were expected to attend the three-day expo. The WSU professor’s wide-ranging presentation emphasized some of the last two decades’ key innovations and provided a taste of lecture topics: Advances in fruit storage, including the post-harvest application of SmartFresh, a solution that slows the ripening of apples and other fruits. The redesign of packing sheds into “beautiful, sparkling food-handling facilities” with stainless steel installation that are easily cleaned and sanitized. The computerization of sorting lines that can now find defects — “magic!” — in fruit and improve pack-outs for size and quality. The research, development and breeding of the popular (but difficult to grow) Honeycrisp variety which, said McFerson, is “a lousy apple for a lot of reasons, and a great apple for a lot of reasons.” Innovations in orchard systems — poles, trellises, wires — that promote high-density crops and ease pruning, thinning and harvesting. Development of new rootstocks resistant to pests and diseases that are tolerant to replanting. New cherry varieties that spread harvests from June through September. McFerson said innovations now underway include crop-load management practices that have introduced post-bloom thinning to standard pruning and thinning techniques; growing use of orchard netting for protection from sun and hail; development of mechanical-assisted harvesters — moving platforms and robotic pickers — to aid orchard workers; and installation of reflective fabric (called DayBright) in orchard rows, which has boosted test yields by 23 percent. “It’s all about meeting and exceeding customers’ expectations,” said McFerson. “To do it, we build on research, we build on science.” Related Articles Editor's Note | 2017 certain to be a fascinating year Eye On | Buddy La Fleur's &#8212; Diners get what they like and expect Keeping successes while discarding those disappointments Eye On | Parker Manufacturing &#8212; Built from the family mold Ridge plan raises concern for elk, habitat Retailers agree to stop employee on-call scheduling Advertisements   SOCIAL Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram APPS Apple iOS Google Play SERVICES Subscribe Make a Payment Digital Edition E-mail Newsletters Newspaper in Education Special Publications Commercial Print Advertise With Us CALENDAR NCW Calendar Add an Event CONTACT US Paper Delivery Issue World of Savings Anniversaries Engagements Weddings Vacation Stop Letter to the Editor Staff Directory Contact Us MULTIMEDIA Videos Photos Photo Galleries Webcams CLASSIFIEDS Homes Jobs Business Classifieds PARTNERS The Art of Community NCW Foothills Magazine Lake Chelan This Week NCW Medical Directory Quincy Valley Post-Register The Washington Post National Weekly Wenatchee Mom Blog Wenatchee Valley Business World © The Wenatchee World 2017 Terms of Use Forum Standards Privacy Policy

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Can You Buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart? Posted on December 31, 2016 by admin There are a few things that pretty much everyone knows about Walmart: 1. They sell a lot of stuff! 2. They have great prices! 3. You can spend a lot of money in their stores! But, while there are many reasons to do a good deal of your shopping in this type of large-scale retail environment, there are still some products that are better bought online, and Garcinia Cambogia seems to be one of them. So, before you head out to buy your Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, here is some information that might help you decide. What Is Garcinia Cambogia? This is a natural weight loss product that is made from the extract of the tamarind fruit, which is a small pumpkin-looking fruit that is grown in certain parts of India. This fruit is extremely high in anti-oxidants, which we all know are great for your body, help to slow down the aging process, fight disease, and even inhibit the storage of fat. How Does This Supplement Work? This is one of the few natural products that actually attacks your weight problem on two fronts – it deals with hunger and it deals with stored fat. First and foremost, the extract from the tamarind fruit is known as an appetite suppressant, which means that you will feel less hungry throughout the day and you will eat less at each meal. That is obviously a big selling point. The other benefit of taking this product is that it helps to burn off the fat you already have while also preventing more fat from forming. So, you should see a weight loss in addition to a drop in size, especially around the middle of your body. Where Can You Buy Garcinia Cambogia? This is perhaps the trickiest aspect of the product, because it is extremely new and everyone is jumping onto the Garcinia Cambogia bandwagon. This product was initially only sold in health food stores, but when the story launched on a recent television program about how successful this product was, everyone sold out of it. A lot of people wanted to know if they could buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, but because this is an enormous chain of stores, they are unable to act quickly enough to satisfy their buyers. It can take months for a new product to make it into Walmart stores. So, if you were able to buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart, then you were one of the few who did. The good news is that you can now buy this supplement for weight loss online, where it is not only cheaper than it is at Walmart, but you will get a money back guarantee. What Kind of Guarantee Will You Get? There aren’t a lot of retail stores that will give you a guarantee on the effectiveness of a diet pill, and that is why you don’t want to buy Garcinia Cambogia at Walmart. When you buy it online, you will have a full 30 days to try it out and if it doesn’t work for you (or you don’t like it for any reason), you can return it. This is obviously reason enough to buy this product other than at the large superstores, and when you go to one of the Garcinia Cambogia retailers, you will be able to learn more about what this powerful anti-oxidant, appetite suppressant, and fat burner can do for you, too.

The company's shares have plunged by more than 64 percent in 2016 as foot traffic fell at its more than 4,400 U.S. stores and customers cut down on buying vitamins and nutritional supplements. Once a Wall Street darling, GNC's market value has dropped by about $5 billion since its peak in 2013 as it battled slumping sales and aggressive competition from online sellers and Wal-Mart Stores. Even after the decline, only one of the 10 analysts who follow the stock recommend buying it. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Moran, a board member who took the helm in July, is trying to turn around the operation. He's unifying GNC's pricing system to make it less confusing, rolling out promotions and boosting loyalty programs in an attempt to relaunch the brand. The chain will also run its first-ever commercial during the Super Bowl in February, a bold but costly gambit. "I'm very skeptical about what they are trying to do right now," said Seema Shah, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "There're no new innovative products, and there's more competitive pricing across the board. None of what they are doing changes that." In October, Moran said the company's third-quarter financial results "continued to be unacceptable" and that it has a "badly broken business model in need of a change." GNC revenue has dropped for three straight quarters. The retailer has also held discussions with several Chinese suitors about a possible sale, but those talks have stalled following disagreements over the structure of a deal, people with knowledge of the matter said this month. GNC's troubles come as other retailers are also suffering from declining mall traffic and heavy discounting. Macy's Inc. is closing 100 stores, and J.C. Penney cut its sales forecast. Weak tourism traffic prompted fashion houses Michael Kors Holdings and Kate Spade & Co. to lower their full-year earnings forecasts and reduce inventory at department stores to rein in promotions. GNC has been battered by Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp., which lured away customers by offering cheaper prices and devoting more space to vitamins and supplements, said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. "There's stiff competition out there, and lower prices are always better if you're spending a lot on vitamins, especially because some of the niche supplements can be pricey," Feinseth said. GNC was a much different company when it went public in 2011, and shares more than doubled in the first year of trading. Several innovative products brought in new consumers, including diet pill Garcinia Cambogia, which was developed by Mehmet Oz, the television personality known as Dr. Oz. GNC hasn't introduced products that have caught fire with shoppers in the past few years, said Shah. With annual sales of about $2.6 billion and 9,000 locations across the globe, Pittsburgh-based GNC is the largest specialty retailer of health, wellness and performance products. Yet its size doesn't translate into market dominance: GNC controls less than 8 percent of the $35 billion supplement business, said Shah. "They have to figure out a way to get people interested in going to them," she said. "If you sell a commodity product, you would have to be the lowest price or you have to have some amazing experience." To that end, GNC is spending $8 million to $10 million on employee training and other marketing strategies to help in-store customers shop with tablets. It's also introduced a new loyalty program to entice shoppers with incentives and a new mobile app to draw online consumers. Earlier this week, the company closed its U.S. stores for a day to overhaul its pricing. "The New GNC leaves the old, broken model behind," Moran said in a statement this month. "We're confident it will have a positive impact on the business, but it will take time for the changes to take hold and translate to improved financial results." GNC's next major campaign will be the Super Bowl commercial, which it hopes will raise awareness and drive interest in the brand, Moran said. CBS Corp. last year charged a reported $5 million for a 30-second spot. That would represent 8 percent of GNC's ad budget last year, said Sean Naughton, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. He called the buy a "risky marketing decision." Feinseth of Tigress was also skeptical about the big game. "The Super Bowl is probably one event that people eat the most unhealthy food possible," he said. "I don't think advertising for GNC during the Super Bowl would be for the right people. They are not going to be in the right frame of mind. I don't know why a vitamin retailer would do that."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Garrison Keillor: Done. Over. He's here. Goodbye.

Times Community News Burbank Leader News Year in Review: Media City had a busy 2016 New Walmart in Burbank Raul Roa / Staff Photographer The new Walmart Supercenter on N. Victory Place in Burbank held its grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. The new Walmart Supercenter on N. Victory Place in Burbank held its grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (Raul Roa / Staff Photographer) Burbank Leader staff Changes at Hollywood Burbank Airport A lot has happened, and many things are in the works, at Hollywood Burbank Airport. Since 1978, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has been trying to replace the 14-gate terminal, which was originally built in 1930. After years of litigation, pushback from residents and persistence, 2016 saw a shift for airport officials. In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank residents approved Measure B, allowing the airport authority to construct a 355,000-square-foot, 14-gate terminal on a plot of land at the airfield known as the B-6 parcel in the northeast quadrant of the airfield. Once the construction on the new facility is completed, the other terminal will be demolished. Join the conversation on Facebook >> Bob Hope Airport File photo In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank voters approved Measure B with 69% of the vote, allowing airport officials to move forward with plans to build a 14-gate replacement terminal at Hollywood Burbank Airport. In the Nov. 8 election, Burbank voters approved Measure B with 69% of the vote, allowing airport officials to move forward with plans to build a 14-gate replacement terminal at Hollywood Burbank Airport. (File photo) On election night, 29,587 voters, or 69.7% of those who voted, supported Measure B and gave the airport authority the green light to move forward with its terminal project. Burbank's airport saw a few more changes during the year, such as getting a new name. In 2003, the airport authority legally changed and marketed the facility as Bob Hope Airport as a tribute to iconic comedian Bob Hope. Officials were looking to attract more travelers east of the Colorado Rockies and decided that a new name was needed. Working with South Pasadena branding firm Anyone Collective, the airport authority selected Hollywood Burbank Airport as the new brand name. However, the airport will legally remain Bob Hope Airport. Along with a new moniker, Anyone Collective helped create a new logo for the airport, which is a two-toned chevron with an image of an airplane in the middle.

(Courtesy of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority) With or without the new name and logo, the airport has already seen a bump in passengers this year. The airfield had a rough start at the beginning of 2016, but the number of passengers grew each month from May through October compared to last year. Also, the tallies were higher, in most cases, than airport officials had projected. Walmart opens at the Empire Center The Walmart Supercenter in the Burbank Empire Center finally opened its doors to the public after being delayed for several years due to pushback from some residents and litigation. The 143,000-square-foot remodeled retail facility, which used to be a Great Indoors store, employs about 400 people, many of whom are Burbank residents or live in the surrounding area. The Burbank Walmart was one of the first stores in Southern California to introduce large black overhead signs with a picture and description of each store section. It also was the first to set up its produce and bakery sections to mimic the feel of a farmer's market.

Victory Place in Burbank for the location's grand opening on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (Raul Roa / Staff Photographer) The store was set to open in 2013, but a lawsuit between three residents and the city made the retail chain pump its brakes. The residents claimed that construction on the store should not start until street improvements are made to address the additional traffic. After a few years in court, the 2nd District Court of Appeal sided with Walmart, saying that the city should not have stopped the retailer from getting its building permits. However, the city did need to address the traffic in that area, according to the ruling. In April, the City Council approved a supplemental environmental impact report that stated that traffic improvements did not need to be made currently. Low police morale impacting department Current and former officers with the Burbank Police Department expressed low morale and dissatisfaction within the organization, according to police union survey administered earlier this year. Approximately 75% of the officers who answered the survey felt morale was low, and one officer wrote that working at the department is "depressing." About 60% surveyed indicated they wouldn't recommend working for the organization to their relatives or friends. Officials with the Burbank Police Officers' Assn. said the survey was meant as a way to identify problems within the department and work with leadership to fix and improve conditions.

Lundigan Park, in Burbank on Thursday, Feb. 4, 2016. (Tim Berger / Staff Photographer) Survey respondents offered several suggestions for changes that could be made, including the hiring of more officers, increasing special assignments and work on improving overall leadership. They also suggested the department should end its use of predictive-policing technology, which utilizes crime reports to predict potential problems areas. Officers are then required to spend 15 minutes in each of three identified areas. Critics said the system would sometimes come up with obvious areas to patrol, such as the Empire Center, where shoplifting is known to occur, and even the police station, where people come to report crimes. The department suspended its use of the technology in October after receiving pushback from officers. Bicycles banned on Mariposa Street Bridge After several months of arguing and pleading their case with the Burbank City Council, equestrians persuaded members to ban bicycles from the Mariposa Street Bridge, which connects Burbank to Griffith Park. Many horse-owning residents in Burbank and elsewhere complained that bicyclists were making the bridge unsafe and that bikes easily startle horses, possibly leading to injuries for the rider. In December 2015, council members approved an ordinance that allowed bicyclists to walk or carry their bikes across the bridge but barred them from riding across it. However, many equestrians did not like the compromise and asked the City Council to outright ban bikes from the 140-foot-long bridge. In February, the City Council approved the bicycle ban on the bridge, which rubbed one Burbank resident the wrong way. Doug Weiskopf claimed that the ban was unenforceable and decided to test the city's new ordinance throughout the summer . During an afternoon in May, Weiskopf attempted to get a citation or be arrested by Burbank Police. He even called the police on himself, but all he received was a warning. Police department establishes new unit In response to growing community concerns over a rise in gang activity, the Burbank Police Department established a new hybrid gang-enforcement unit in June. Made up of four officers who are overseen by two patrol sergeants, the unit is tasked with contacting gang members and gathering intelligence while also handling regular service calls. The department had been without gang officers for the last two years because of staffing shortages. During that two-year period, a single detective from the agency's vice/narcotics unit handled gang-related crimes. The lack of gang officers drew criticism from residents as the city experienced an increased number of violent, gang-related crimes this year including several shootings and stabbings. Eighty-nine gang-related crimes were reported by police last year, and almost half of them involved graffiti. Juniors refuse to take state exam Nearly 300 juniors refused to take the state's standardized exam in April after Burbank High student Sam Gorman initiated a school-wide opt-out movement, alerting them how to get out of the test with a parent's signature.

Junior Sam Gorman initiated an effort that led to nearly 270 students opting out of the state standardized exam at Burbank High School. (Courtesy of Sam Gorman) Gorman stood against taking an exam based on "big data and redundant standards instead of the acquisition of long-lasting knowledge," he said. In all, about 350 Burbank High juniors out of about 640 took the test. Burbank Unified Supt. Matt Hill said he heard from both students and parents about juniors' desires to take and prepare for other exams, such as the SAT, ACT and AP tests, to determine if they are ready for college. "I'd encourage the state to continue to look into the value of administering the test to our juniors," Hill said. Investigation leads to change Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights closed its investigation into Burbank Unified several months after a Burbank parent alleged discrimination against her son based on his disability. Kelly Duenckel filed a complaint after her son, Robert, who has learning disabilities, was told he would not participate in a popular cow-eye dissection lab, which he ultimately did after Duenckel pressed school officials to include her son and fellow special-education students in the lab. The complaint alleged that special-education students were denied an opportunity to participate in science labs that were provided to general-education students. The investigators found that general-education students completed 45 science labs compared to the 26 labs that special-education students completed during the 2015-16 school year. Investigators closed the case after learning Burbank school officials took immediate steps to resolve the allegations. As part of the changes, Burbank special-education students at all three middle schools have access to the same curriculum, labs, equipment and trained teachers as general-education students. Burbank parents influence National PTA convention When the National PTA passed four resolutions in July during a convention in Orlando, Fla., two of the four had been introduced by Burbank parents or students and already adopted by the California PTA. The first one, called "Homework: Quality over Quantity," pushes for more meaningful homework instead of a lot of it. It was drafted initially by John Burroughs High School parents Suzanne Weerts and Tina McDermott, who surveyed fellow parents and found that homework caused stress and tension in many homes. The second resolution passed at the National PTA convention was "Recognition of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) Individuals as a Protected Class." PTA members, including Steve Frintner and Barbara Miller, along with students, helped draft the resolution after former John Burroughs High student Brian Kaplun advocated for sexual-health-education curriculum acknowledging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students and those who are exploring their sexual identity. Equine herpesvirus appears A section of the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had to be put under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture last month after several horses at the facility tested positive for equine herpesvirus, which resulted in one horse being euthanized because of the disease. The disease appeared at the equestrian center after eight horses returned from a horse show in Las Vegas on Oct. 27 through 29. One of the horses, a 5-year-old saddlebred, showed signs of severe neurological symptoms and had to be put to sleep for humane reasons. Another horse, a 10-year-old saddlebred, showed moderate signs of neurological symptoms and was put into quarantine, where it eventually recovered. The Department of Food and Agriculture becomes involved if the disease is found to be equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, a rare neurological form of the illness. Equine herpesvirus typically causes a respiratory infection for horses. As it stands, there were a total of 228 horses under quarantine and 15 cases of equine herpesvirus — eight of which were the rare neurological form and seven that were not. Officials with the state agency had to extend the quarantine at the equestrian center after they discovered that a horse owner took their horse back to their house while the facility was still under quarantine. To make matters worse for the equestrian center, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses canceled the annual Equestfest horse show at the facility because of the outbreak. Burbank on Parade expands event Burbank on Parade turned into an all-day affair to mark the 35th year of the annual celebration. In addition to the marching bands and dance groups that grace the parade each year, the April 23 event expanded to include a run/walk, a bicycle ride and a post-parade festival. While past parades included post-event activities, organizers said this year's festivities were a way to put the attractions surrounding the parade "into the limelight" and garner more participation. An estimated 10,000 people attended this year's parade. Burbank on Parade originally had its start in 1945 as a celebration for the end of World War II and went on for 12 years. It was revived in 1981 by a group of Burbank residents who wanted to a hold a spring festival celebrating life in the city.

The family builds electrical systems that help make commercial trucks more efficient. Comments aAFont Size When Bruce Purkey, then a regional service engineer for a subsidiary of General Motors, landed an account with J.B. Hunt, there wasn't a suitable distributor for the starters, alternators and batteries the transportation company had ordered. So, in 1990, he quit his job, moved to Arkansas and became that distributor himself. The company he started -- Purkeys -- has become an industry expert in a quiet but necessary niche in the heavy-duty trucking world: electrical charging systems. As his son Justin, the current CEO, said, "We make systems that make electrical systems more efficient." As to why it's a relatively under-the-radar niche, Justin Purkey said, "The industry just thought going through lots of batteries was the cost of doing business. "We can help them manage that so that at the end of the day they spend a lot less by making good decisions early on. I always say fleets have a whole truck to worry about. Electricity for us is everything, but for them, it's a very small part of it," he said. "The other thing is, you can see tires, oil and headlights. You can't see electricity. And today that's still one of the toughest parts of the vehicle for technicians to troubleshoot." Nearly 27 years ago, Bruce Purkey, his wife, Veronica, and their three children moved to Arkansas to open what has always been a family company. His 19-year-old daughter Robyn worked with him from day one. His wife put in some time as well, and his two other children worked summers in high school. Since then, the company has grown and shifted its identity dramatically, but it has remained a family operation. Justin Purkey swore he would never come back to the family business, but after a career in software implementation consulting on the East Coast, in 2010 he accepted his father's offer to take the helm of the Lowell company. The company has more than tripled its revenue since then, from $4.6 million to $14 million and grown from 12 employees to more than 60. From the beginning, Bruce Purkey has always solved problems for his growing list of clients like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and American Freightways, problems beyond just delivering batteries, alternators and starters. Drawing on a mostly self-taught engineering background and familiarity with the industry, Bruce Purkey was able to do things like build a product to alert the driver when he hasn't set a parking brake and create a split battery system that would allow drivers to have some electricity in their cabs for "creature comforts" without running the engine. Back then, Bruce Purkey and his daughter Robyn Wassman, who is now executive director of finance and administration, built and assembled systems for J.B. Hunt. His other daughter, India, designed the label, and within years, the product became an industry standard that nearly all manufacturers build into their trucks. "Bruce probably knows more about electrical systems on a vehicle than anybody that I know," said Bob Ralston, former executive vice president for equipment and properties at J.B. Hunt. "He knows a lot. He helped our fleet a lot. He is very innovative and is widely respected in the industry." As Bruce Purkey put it, "When we first started working with them, J.B. Hunt had 3,000 trucks. Now they have over 11,000, and today they use one-fourth of the starters they did before." "They're all great companies in their own right," Bruce Purkey said of his customers. "All we did was try to make the electrical system on their truck work better and be more efficient, so that they were more reliable and electrical would not be a problem for the fleet." "Someone once said Bruce Purkey has made a career of doing what the original equipment manufacturers should have done," Justin Purkey said. Another product they developed was a way to keep trucks' lift gates properly charged. "Long story short, now we work with all the lift-gate manufacturers," Justin Purkey said. Purkeys also sells inverters to provide charging docks for drivers in berths powered by the truck battery, which feature a timer or voltage control to ensure the truck will still start. They make solar charging products and auxiliary power systems to keep the lights on in a trailer. Bruce Purkey has more than 10 patents and counting in his name. "We didn't provide products, we provided fixes," Justin Purkey said. "We never said, 'Look at this new product we're going to take to market.' J.B. Hunt had a problem? We fixed it." Justin Purkey has leveraged his business experience and his business degree to help Purkeys organize and establish efficient procedures and systems. When he arrived, inventory was still tracked on a white board. "I suffer from shiny object syndrome," Bruce Purkey explained. "I'm not sure I really like to sell stuff, I just like to fix stuff." The business administration was left up to Wassman, who learned everything as she went, beginning as a teenager. "I was just constantly putting out fires all the time. I didn't have a moment to step back and think about things," she said. "When we got Wal-Mart's business, I thought we were going to go out of business," Bruce Purkey recalled. "You buy products a month ahead of time, you sell them, and then you wait a month to get your money. Those were tremendous hits we took." He and Wassman went without pay several times in order to keep the rest of their employees paid. More than a year ago, signifying a big shift in company identity, Purkeys stopped distributing to focus on its own products. To Justin Purkey, it was simple: "Margins. We lost a third of our business when we stopped distributing, but that third of volume didn't make any money. It was just legacy business we did because we thought we had to. But when we really looked at the numbers it didn't make any sense. We add value because we develop solutions. You can buy batteries at any dealer or any distributor." Bruce Purkey said it was a difficult decision to accept. "When he showed me the numbers, my wallet said, 'You're absolutely right.' My heart said, 'But, that's what we do.'" After leading the company through the adjustment, Justin Purkey said the changes "allowed our team to focus on our own products. How do we make our own products? How do we make our own products better and not get distracted by other people's products? It has really been successful because it's allowing our team to focus on what we do best. "Purkeys wasn't really a company," he said. "It was Bruce Purkey, and he had this company that helped Bruce Purkey. And I think it's fantastic that he built this. But if there's going to be any legacy, any longevity, we needed to make sure it's not Bruce, it's Purkeys. We need to make sure without Bruce, we do have a Purkeys." Purkeys does not have a "true competitor," Justin Purkey said. "For a very long time I could say there were none because we were so small that we really flew under the radar." He said a few companies have started doing similar things, but Purkeys remains the "recognized industry expert in electrical systems for heavy-duty vehicles." As to the future of this business, he responded: "Purkeys adds value. It adds value to the industry, to our customers, to our employees, to our families. If we're not adding value, there's no sense in being here. So as long as we continue to add value, we will continue to exist."

By year’s end, the global giant had uprooted its 800 Fairfield employees, with most making their way south to Norwalk and several hundred going north to the company’s new home in Boston. The company’s sprawling Fairfield campus won’t stay empty for long, though, as Sacred Heart University announced in November that it had purchased the property, which sits less than a mile from the university’s own land, and would expand its program offerings there. In 2016, the town also worked to gauge the business community’s needs, concerns and ideas, a process that will result in a working plan that can be used to help Fairfield remain competitive, said Economic Development Director Mark Barnhart. The town also worked on its marketing efforts in 2016. “We unveiled a new town website and map and guide, which we are distributing throughout the region,” Barnhart said. “We’re looking to do more in 2017 to further enhance the Fairfield brand.” Derby Another community that experienced the departure of a large company was Derby, which saw Wal-Mart vacate its Route 34 location. That site remains vacant going into the new year. Adams Super Food Store also announced its closure in 2016, in the same plaza. The city was dealt another blow when the consultant hired to redevelop downtown criticized its long delayed Main Street widening project, calling it detrimental to Derby’s revitalization efforts. City officials are now trying to figure out how best to take those comments into account without negatively impacting nearly a decade’s work to widen Main Street. Not all news was bad news in 2016 for Derby, though. An AT&T store, a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and a Pet Valu pet store were announced as among the businesses planned for a new plaza next to the Aldi Supermarket on Pershing Drive. And on Division Street, the McDonald’s restaurant property was given a makeover with the construction of a brand-new building. Monroe Even as Wal-Mart was leaving Derby, the company was laying the groundwork for its new Supercenter on Victoria Drive in Monroe. Next door, along Main Street, the Kimball Group also plans to build a shopping center with enough space for 22 new stores. That work should be well under way in 2017. The construction had some small business owners in Monroe worried that the increased retail competition could hurt them. To deal with those concerns, the Monroe Chamber of Commerce scheduled a series of sessions on how to survive after the arrival of a big box store. The third session in the series will be held on Jan. 25. Trumbull In Trumbull, meanwhile, new shopping plazas built in 2016 at the Long Hill Green and on Madison Avenue meant more retail-space options for entrepreneurs looking to open small businesses. Openings in 2016 included Trumbull Pharmacy, Layla’s Falafel, Pure Poetry, Mex on Main, Upper Crust Bakery & Cafe and liquor store Ninety 9 Bottles, among many others. Rina Bakalar, Trumbull’s economic development director, said that in 2017 even more redevelopment of the Long Hill Green area is expected. The town has also identified the funds to move forward with its plans to extend the recreational trail to commercial areas, including Trumbull Center. And Bakalar said there’s been significant interest from businesses in properties that have been underutilized in town. “I think we’re going to have an even better year,” she said. Oxford Oxford also saw significant business investment in 2016 with the conclusion of initial work on a major Route 67 project. In the latter half of the year, Market 32 — a Price Chopper brand — Ace Hardware store, Dollar Tree, Goodwill and Newtown Savings Bank branch all opened in the $70 million Towne Center/Quarry Walk development. Once completed, the new town center will have more than 215,000 square feet of retail space and 150 residential units. Bridgeport The state’s largest city made significant progress in 2016 on its East Side and downtown revitalization projects. The opening of the apartments at the Security building in Downtown North marked the first successful project in that part of the neighborhood. The rest of the downtown had its ups and downs in 2016, with the opening and closing of several businesses. The Bijou Theatre got a new operator during the summer after initially announcing its closure just a few months after its neighbor, Two Boots, shut its doors for good in the spring. Two Boots’ Fairfield Avenue space wasn’t empty for long, as Milano Wine Bar & Pizzeria had opened there by summer. Can Tiin also closed downtown, while a few blocks away, 4 Corners Billiards opened its doors on Bank Street and Meatball Heaven opened in the Arcade. On the East Side, where Bridgeport officials have plans for a second train station, the city took ownership of the former Remington land on Barnum Avenue and construction on phase one of the Crescent Crossings apartments buildings was completed. Phase two is now under way. Shelton Like Bridgeport, Shelton saw visible progress in downtown revitalization in 2016, with the start of construction on Bridge Street Commons, a mixed-use building that will have space for a restaurant, retail shops and 38 apartments, and the approval of several of developer John Guedes’ projects along Canal Street. In 2017, Guedes said, he plans to begin work on turning the former Spongex building into 47 loft-style residential units, a commercial building at the former Rolfite property and a 68-apartment River Breeze Residential planned next to the existing Avalon apartments. Plans are also under way to build Phoenix Towers, a mixed-use building with storefronts, offices space and 24 one-bedroom apartments, on the land at 434-56 Howe Ave., which has been vacant since a fire destroyed the building there in 2014. Ansonia While new housing is a major downtown component for Shelton, Ansonia’s restaurants stole the spotlight in that city’s downtown progress. Rosa Mina’s restaurant, Lulu Pazzo Italiano and Warszawa Polish Restaurant were among the new offerings in 2016. The Copper City Bar & Grill also celebrated its first anniversary in the city. Downtown Ansonia also saw the start of its first construction in decades, as work began on Main Street for Massimino’s Pizzeria. Stratford Stratford’s new businesses, on the other hand, came in all shapes, sizes and industries. The year ended with the news that AMEC Carting, a construction and waste company based in Norwalk, would be expanding into Stratford, taking over the former Garbage Museum site. Also expanding in Stratford was Kubtec, a digital imaging company, that moved from Milford to a larger building on Research Drive. Several recreational facilities, including Jump Off and Jump Shot Range, also opened in town. The town welcomed FedEx, which opened its new 225,000-square-foot building on Lordship Boulevard in 2016. Jon Angel, of Angel Commercial in Southport, called it the largest single-tenant industrial building to come online in the third quarter of the year, locally. Milford The city also saw a mix of new small and big businesses opening in 2016, including REI Co-op, which opened in the new plaza at the former Smiles Entertainment Center location on the Boston Post Road. ShopRite also had its grand opening at another new plaza, this one on the former site of the Showcase Cinemas. The new store at 915 Boston Post Road is 20 percent larger than the Cherry Street location the grocer had occupied since the 1980s. Milford Mayor Benjamin Blake said that over the last two years the city has seen a 26 percent increase in new business openings. He said 2016 proved to be a good year for the city, with a jump in the grand list helping to keep property owners’ taxes down. “The best is yet to come,” Blake said. Easton The small town didn’t host a great deal of ribbon cuttings in 2016, but residents did celebrate a major victory when the legal battle over the proposed Saddle Ridge development on 124.7 acres of watershed land along Sport Hill Road ended after more than five years. Residents and town officials had for years argued that proposals to build roughly 100 housing units on the land were too intense. In 2016, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the town’s and residents’ positions and then the Appellate Court decided not to take up the case, essentially ending the debate. ktorres@hearstmediact.com; 203-330-6227 Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Fitness and Exercise Items at Walmart: Up to 60% off + free...

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988. From left, Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and the late Jason Mizell. MARK LENNIHAN / AP, file The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. It called the Run-DMC brand "extremely valuable," and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse Adidas sneakers from Adidas The lawsuit alleges defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group had officially disbanded. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and Jan. 2, 2017 holiday store hours, deals WalMart in under 3 minutes Print Email Matt Gray | For NJ.com By Matt Gray | For NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 31, 2016 at 5:33 AM, updated December 31, 2016 at 5:34 AM comments Walmart stores are open New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and Monday, Jan. 2, 2017, the first federal holiday of 2017 and the nightcap to our first three-day weekend of the new year. After closing two hours earlier than in previous years on Christmas Eve and then staying closed on Christmas Day as is their custom, most Walmarts are running business as usual this weekend as we get set to close the books on 2016 and welcome a new year. As for store hours, most of the Walmarts we checked were sticking to their 7 a.m. (EST) through midnight hours, even on New Year's Eve. The stores that normally are open 24 hours a day also are sticking to those hours, according to store websites. Still, it's always a good idea to call and check before heading out, especially if you're making a last-minute dash for party supplies Saturday night. (As always, you can get to customer service at the chain 24/7/365 online with this feedback menu. And if you need to find the Walmart store nearest you, use this store locator, which also lists hours specific to each location: Where's the Walmart nearest me?) The Walmart grocery circular this week (it runs through Jan. 7) is loaded with party specials, including $1 2-liter bottles of Coke & Pepsi, and hard-to-resist prices on everything from shrimp trays to pizza bites. On the other side of the store, there are still plenty of deals on everything Christmas, including toys and electronics. The chain's website is also touting several specials available for in-store pickup, including Keurig coffee makers for $76.49 and a Sky Viper drone for $88.   Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

Add to ... JOANNE ELVES Special to The Globe and Mail Published Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016 5:00AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016 12:32PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Rain-X and Tune It! anti-fog liquids Available at: Automotive-supply stores Price: 4.99 and up For the sake of science, we tested Rain-X and Tune It! anti-fog liquids from Wal-Mart on the bathroom mirror and the results were a little hazy. A mirror was sectioned into quarters for tests of both products, with a cleaned strip and a second section left untouched. Following the directions on the bottles, the remaining quarters were cleaned and all lint removed. Then, the anti-fog products were applied and rubbed in until they dried. The mirror was also buffed with a clean cloth. We then ran a hot shower to build up enough fog on the mirror. The part that wasn’t cleaned was extremely foggy. The section that was cleaned with window cleaner was noticeably less foggy and the sections with the anti-fog applications were not foggy. But, for both, it was wet and blurry, so that if you were to drive, your vision would be impaired. After a second shower, the application wasn’t even apparent. Testing them on the backseat window in the car wasn’t a good idea. The window looked like it was covered in plastic wrap and little fingers saw that as a vertical puddle to play in. The best method is simple: Keep the window clean of haze to leave fewer particles for moisture to cling to and give your car a chance to warm up before hitting the road.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Linsey D. Owens, 83, allegedly hit Christian Robertson, 48, with his car and then whacked him in the head with a golf club, the Daily Mail reported. It all began when Owens drove to a Nissan sales event in Sarasota, Fla., with a mailer that promised up to $20,000. Owens presented his scratch-off ticket at a tent and was rewarded with a $5 Walmart gift card that he threw away. After missing out on the jackpot, began “yelling and screaming profanities” about the $5 gift card, Robertson, 48, told WFLA. (Note: Video contains NSFW language) This is the video of an 83 yo man attaching a car salesman in Sarasota last night pic.twitter.com/eMXbrjbMOd — John Rogers (@WFLAJohn) December 29, 2016 “He was pissed off he got a gift card,” Robertson told the Herald-Tribune. Owens argued with some other employees and left the sale, according to Robertson. He returned about 15 minutes later and drove his car down an aisle where Robertson was helping other customers and bumped him with the side mirror of his car. He then got out of the car, opened the trunk, and got his golf club, Robertson said. Robertson, who lives in Fort Myers, said he can’t work until his face heals and he might not be able to work in Florida for months because of a damaged reputation. “You can’t sell $30,000 cars with a black eye,” he added. Owens was charged with two counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office.

In 2016, Trump became president of the United States, we dealt with the Zika outbreak, lost many of our Hollywood favorites, healed after the attack on the Brussels airport, and even experienced the release of “Pokemon Go.” But we had some big news here in the Panhandle too. So, we rounded up the five biggest stories that have impacted our area the most. The Panhandle Train Crash On Tuesday, June 28, two BNSF freight trains met head-on just outside of Panhandle, TX, causing the trains to derail and scatter the cars in every direction. The National Transportation Safety Board said one of the trains failed to slow at a yellow warning sign and continued through a red signal before crashing into the other train. The crash caused a major fire that burned in the days to follow, but most tragic was the loss of three BNSF conductors. Cody Owens, of Claude, Kenneth Smith and Lara Taylor, both of Amarillo, were all killed in the collision. The sole survivor of the crash, Derek Schilling, filed a lawsuit against BNSF in November for $1 million in damages. Walmart Hostage Situation Upset over a missed promotion, Walmart employee Mohammad Moghaddam entered the Walmart on Georgia Street the morning of June 14, fired a gunshot into the air, and then took the store manager and another employee hostage before he was fatally shot by the Amarillo Police Department’s SWAT team. The Amarillo Police Department cited the dispute between Moghaddam, 54, and the store manager as a strong motive. Surveillance video obtained by NewsChannel 10 shows panicked customers quickly escaping the store as Moghaddam forced the manager toward the office area while pointing a gun at his back. Shortly after the noon hour, tactical units found one hostage and later located Moghaddam and the store manager. Moghaddam was shot and killed. Neither hostage was injured. Creepy Clown Sightings A bizarre national fad made its way to the Panhandle in October as pranksters looking for a Halloween scare made nighttime appearances at parks, grocery stores, and even several neighborhoods. But a homeowner in Pampa made it clear to two clowns that he wasn’t joking around. He grabbed a pistol and fired a warning shot as soon as they entered his yard, according to police. Here’s to the clown trend not being part of 2017! The Death of Alexis Wartena In July, a widespread search effort for a 7-year-old girl with autism ended in tragedy when the Amarillo Police Department’s Dive Team recovered the body of Alexis Wartena in a playa lake behind a motel. The Wartena family was driving back home to California when they decided to stop in Amarillo for rest. Alexis disappeared from the family’s room in the late afternoon on July 18, beginning a 19-hour search effort by multiple area agencies. The Wartenas sat down with NewsChannel 10 for an in-depth interview about the tragedy. 11 Car Pile-up In June, around 11 p.m., six semi-trucks and five passenger cars were involved in a major crash which injured multiple people and claimed the life of one person. The deceased passenger was later identified by DPS as Tammy Page, of New York. The cause of the crash has been determined; however, some drivers reported strong winds and blowing dust which caused low visibility in that area during that time. Copyright 2016 KFDA.

Share Tweet Flipboard MGM L. Frank Baum set out to write a fairy tale with an American flavor. Today, that would consist of leprechauns with six packs of beer, ridiculously large belt buckles, and Walmart gift cards. But in 1900, it meant a story about a young girl being whisked away to a land of magic and fairies to fight witches, battle gnomes, and explore a world of whimsy and wonder. It's relatively well known that Baum really didn't have much intention to keep writing the Oz books, despite having written 15, (if you count the little wizard stories). He really wanted to write other children's books, but fans were so enamored they begged for more and more. What resulted from his continued writing was a series that to this day would ruffle the feathers of many conservative parents who picked the books up, instead of plopping their kids in front of the TV to watch Judy "I'm way too old to be playing an 11 year old" Garland sing her way through Hollywood's backlots.

The Mexican workers also purchase U.S.-made products/services at places in Mexico such as Home Depot, Walmart, McDonalds and Applebee’s.    Enter President-elect-Donald Trump. Without understanding the intertwined nature of the U.S. and Mexican economies, which depend heavily on each other for their own economic health, he cancels NAFTA or weakens it. With the help of Republicans in Congress, he also manages to slap tariffs on Chinese imports. The Mexican government retaliates against new U.S. tariffs on its manufactured products, as does the Chinese government. The Juarez company finds that it is not cost competitive to manufacture its products in Mexico because of new U.S. tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico. It does production cost calculations and concludes that in spite of tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S., the more economical labor in China is the best way to remain in business. It closes its plant in Juarez and gives the pink slip to 200 workers, who now do not have the money to buy U.S. products and shop in El Paso. Out of desperation, many of these workers will illegally cross into the U.S. to seek economic opportunities, thus increasing the flow of illegal immigration.   Mexico’s economy takes a hit because of the aggressive U.S. action, and the peso plunges. This makes U.S. goods sold in Mexico more expensive for Mexicans, who buy less of them. Conversely, it makes Mexican products sold in the U.S. cheaper for Americans, who gobble up more consumer electronics, furniture, medical products, and food. This causes the U.S. trade deficit to balloon.  Meanwhile, the El Paso company loses its major client in Mexico and decides to close its operation because it can’t compete against Chinese plastic injection operations. All 66 of its employees lose their jobs, and the economic multiplier effect of the company and its employees spending money to buy products and services in El Paso vanishes. The owner leasing the building to the plastic injection operation now has empty space. Maintenance costs and taxes accrue without good prospects to lease the space in the future, because what happened to the plastic injection company is happening to thousands of businesses on the U.S.-Mexico border that depend on a cross-border trade relationship free of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Oh, and by the way, the new automobile that you were planning to buy will cost several thousand dollars more.  Although simple in its explanation, this is not a far-fetched scenario. The point is that in today’s interconnected global economy, you cannot tinker with one element and not expect effects in other areas. Unraveling NAFTA is an example of how a trade relationship can be damaged when trying to institute political rhetoric into reality to appease supporters after you have made free trade, NAFTA, and Mexico a scapegoat in the presidential campaign. I would expect a struggling and possibly uneducated person, who has seen automation and globalization transform traditional industry in the U.S. to view trade as a scapegoat. I am surprised that Trump, a self-declared business genius, would not understand the complexities of world trade. Perhaps he does, and he was smart enough to know that this wedge issue would help him get elected.  By Trump’s campaign rhetoric, he claims he will bring back all of the jobs to the U.S. that were lost to globalization. As we can see from my simple scenario, it is not that easy. Ironically, many people with whom this part of the Trump message resonated, are the uneducated, unskilled workers that will not be able to benefit from increasingly technical production jobs. My biggest takeaway from the presidential election is the education component and how stratified the U.S. is becoming from an opportunity standpoint between those who have an education that allows them to get ahead in life, and those that don’t. This influences the ability of a person to understand complex world economics, while being in a position of having skills that can secure a good job and a promising economic future. Hopefully, the new administration and Congress will focus on bridging this education gap for the benefit of our country’s future, and stop demonizing trade, which will continue to create opportunities for U.S. companies in the future.     Jerry Pacheco's columns first appear in The Albuquerque Journal.

January 1, 2017 10:16 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Michael Nagle, Getty Images Returning Christmas gifts is always a PAIN in the butt. But, it’s fun to pick out what I want. There are some stores that (understandably) have strict return policies and some that are a bit nicer when it comes to taking back items. So, I wanted to give a shout out to the companies who demonstrated some really great customer service even under large amounts of traffic.  1. TARGET  I went over to the East side Target to return an item that I looked up online. The product could have come from anywhere really but Janet at Target East Side customer service was really nice about it and gave me full price. Some places give you the lowest price point that year. You know someone paid $29.99 for those jammies and you get the 99 cents in-store credit. I also have a Red Card (debit) that gives me 5% off all purchase, free shipping, and I don’t need to keep a receipt to return stuff. 2. Walmart Walmart’s return center is great (except for the lines). They are pretty much no questions asked. I bought an item that broke in the first couple minutes of buying it. I took it back – they apologized and gave me a full refund. I mean, you’d think that would be standard at any retailer, but it’s not. For instance, Coleman charges a 15% restocking fee even if you received a broken item! WHAT?! Ashley S 3. Melissa and Doug Toys Santa brought this cute little trace toy to my daughter for Christmas. My daughter has kind of grown out of the princesses and has moved on to big girl toys. I really like that this toy shows astronauts, firemen, and superheroes, but all the faces were boy faces. She likes these things but wanted a girl face, so I went to the website and inquired if they offered the toy for girls. A couple of days later, Lisa, from their corporate office called to let me know that the only similar toy they had was a princess/fashion themed one. She also took the time to explain what the company Melissa and Doug was planning for 2017. They’ll be offering more options for girls that highlight superheroes, medical professionals, police officers, and other stereotypical boy toys. Then, she offered to send me a similar product to try out. That’s awesome! 4. Chewy.com If you have a pet, you should just go ahead and check out this site now. Not only do they offer pet products at a very low price, they have a GREAT customer service department. Every time I’ve had a question, they call me and walk me through it. They are great about returns and even sent a hand-written thank you note to one of my friends who uses chewy also. 5. Old Navy I can’t keep up with receipts. I just can’t. Luckily, all you need at Old Navy is the card you paid with. They look it up and give you the full amount back. Rock on! So, did you have any great customer service experiences this holiday season? I’d love to hear them!   Category: What's New Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend! Print this page Pin it! Reddit This! Share on Tumblr!

(AP) — The state-sponsored New York Green Bank is lending $25 million to an Albany-area manufacturer to expand fuel cell use at distribution centers for clients such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot. The Green Bank is a division of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. It was created to foster development of clean energy and reduce emissions linked to climate change. NYSERDA says the loan to Latham-based Plug Power will support the deployment of 1,300 fuel cell systems to distribution centers over the next three years. Under the agreement, Plug Power is to create up to 100 new jobs in New York. Plug Power makes hydrogen fuel cells that replace less-efficient and dirtier lead acid batteries in forklifts and pallet jacks.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Local news What we want in 2017: Compassion, good eats, clear streets and more trees SUNDAY, JAN. 1, 2017, 5:45 A.M. (Spokesman-Review / FILE - Wishes for the new year are a time-honored tradition, and we asked a number of local people what they’d like to see in 2) From staff reports Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS `A year ago we asked movers and shakers in the Inland Northwest to name one thing they’d like to see happen in 2016. Some came true. In October, Washington State University announced its medical school in Spokane received preliminary accreditation, a goal of the school’s president, Lisa Brown, and Scott Morris, chief executive of Avista. Voters also approved a sales tax increase to fund additional Spokane Transit Authority services, fulfilling the wishes of state Rep. Marcus Riccelli and former Spokane City Councilman Jon Snyder. Other goals went unfulfilled. The Inland Northwest didn’t receive new Chick-fil-A or In-N-Out Burger franchises, to the chagrin of our bellies – and Eastern Washington men’s basketball coach Jim Hayford and Whitworth football coach Rod Sandberg. Gonzaga’s basketball team earned a Sweet 16 appearance but lost in a 63-60 nailbiter to Syracuse that dashed their Final Four hopes and the wishes of several respondents to our inquiries in December. We reached out again to folks in our community as the calendar neared 2017 and asked them to name one thing they’d like to see happen in the new year. Some answers were specific, while others broadly described ways to improve where we live. Here are the New Year’s resolutions for our community, from those who live in it. Kip Hill Holiday spirit all year ’round Kate Hansen, 34, co-owner of Sante Restaurant and Charcuterie, Common Crumb Artisan Bakery, Hogwash Whiskey Den and Inland Pacific Kitchen: “My wish for our community next year is the idea of grace. I define grace to be a combination of humility, patience and compassion for self and others … taking time to learn someone’s story or context before writing them off. The same can be applied to our fair city as it encounters stretches of slow growth, then growing pains, and then the naturally following, albeit unfamiliar, change.” Jim Hayford, 49, Eastern Washington men’s basketball coach: “My hope for the new year is kindness in our community, wins on the court and lots of laughs with all my friends.” Lacie Hull, 17, Central Valley girls basketball player (Lexie’s twin sister): “I think it’d be great to see our communities help the families in need. It seems sad that the only time of year we support families is Thanksgiving and Christmas. What if our community helped out on kids’ birthdays? It’s truly the one time of year that people are celebrated as an individual. It would be awesome if we could have giving trees at local stores like Walmart or Fred Meyer for kids under 18.” Rabbi Tamar Malino, 45, of Temple Beth Shalom: “In the new year, I would like to see an absence of hateful graffiti in Spokane, and further development of our community and interfaith collaborations.” Regina Malveaux, YWCA chief executive officer: “I do believe that we are experiencing a unique moment in history when those who believe in respect, safety and dignity for all have the opportunity to be a voice for those feeling attacked or vulnerable. I was so proud to see friends and neighbors in Spokane come together to stand up against hate when it reared its ugly head in our community. In the coming year I look forward to seeing our community continue to be a one which comes together in support of all of our citizens.” Scott Oakshott, 59, director of Spokane Valley Tech: “What I would like to see is all people taking responsibility for their portion of our society. A very small step but what if we all did that! Wow!” Freddie Rehkow, 47, Central Valley High School basketball coach: “My answer would have to be something that has become very personal to me, and that would be our ‘Kick Cancer’ game that we started this year in honor of Childhood Cancer Awareness month in September. … I would like to see our entire Spokane area participate, support and recognize a Kick Cancer game in the entire city of Spokane next September.”. Jennifer Schlenske, 40, director of Spokane Valley Partners: “I would like to see Spokane better understand the prevalence of mental illness and the possibility of recovery. People battling mental health illnesses are constantly contending for acceptance that their health disorder is every bit as serious, and treatable, as a physical ailment.” Hershel Zellman, 68, member of the the Spokane County Human Rights Task Force and a retired family practice physician: “I would like to see the people of our community, without hesitation, reaching out to one another with a helping hand and a respectful voice.” Tod Marshall, 49, Washington poet laureate and professor at Gonzaga University: “In Section 19 of ‘Song of Myself,’ Walt Whitman writes, ‘I will not have a single person slighted or left away.’ Practicing that openness, that hospitality, leads, I believe, to values that allow us to imagine radical acts of compassion. In 2017, I believe that this might be an important aspiration for myself, for my immediate communities, and for the larger communities of which I am a part.” Helping out our furry friends Mike Fagan, 56, Spokane City councilman: I want to have a community conversation about whether the City of Spokane should establish standards for service animals in public places, on top of federal and state regulations. Nancy Hill, 62, director of Spokane County Regional Animal Protection Services (SCRAPS): “I would like to see a world in which all cats and dogs are sterilized, vaccinated, microchipped and wearing a current SCRAPS pet license!” Lexie Hull, 17, Central Valley girls basketball player (Lacie’s twin sister): “I absolutely love animals, more specifically homeless/rescue animals. After volunteering at the Humane Society, I realized there is a significant need to find these animals a permanent home. It would be great to see our community take action to place these animals.” Promoting the community Lenny Bart, 55, artistic director of Spokane Civic Theatre: “I would love to see the downtown Spokane streets clear of renovations and repairs, so I can go downtown, park, see a show, meet with friends for a bite and not have to pretend I’m on a slalom course.” David Condon, 42, Spokane mayor: “My resolutions for 2017 include driving down crime, working to end homelessness in our community, increasing household income, and a collaborative approach to sustainable community development and growth.” Gynii Abracosa Gilliam, 57, president of Coeur d’Alene Area Economic Development Corp./Jobs Plus: “To see our community build a strong economy that includes research and development, information systems and other forward-thinking sectors. To plan proactively for a future where jobs and opportunities in health, aerospace and aviation, technology, advanced manufacturing, and all industries are plentiful.” Myles Kennedy, 47, rock musician, lead singer of Alter Bridge, co-founder of Future Song: “I would love to see a continued transformation and revitalization of downtown Spokane. It’s come a long way in the last few years, so I’m optimistic for 2017. Breathing new life into buildings like the former Ridpath Hotel, as well as seeing more growth of the residential core, would do wonders for the downtown area.” Cheryl Kilday, 55, president and CEO of Visit Spokane: “To continue my nudge to change the way Spokane sees itself and move the meter toward viewing Spokane as a regional destination known for being a vibrant, creative, hassle-free urban center of the Intermountain Northwest.” Ed Pace, 69, Spokane Valley City Councilman: “We become a community where the silent majority will come out and say, ‘Hey, this is my community, too.’ Where people of all ages and genders and professions and backgrounds participate. … And that we can discuss things openly – that we have a positive, deep, robust discussion about what we want our city to be.” Ben Stuckart, 45, Spokane City Council president: “It would be great by the end of the year to have a unified, economic development strategic plan for the city of Spokane, something the mayor and the council unanimously agree on. That will set the stage for success for years to come.” More food! Travis Tveit, 26, pastry chef at Wild Sage: “I would like to see our community continue to expand the specialty food scene. More charcuterie, more tapas, more pho! It’s headed in a good direction, and I hope the growth continues.” Focus on public safety Breean Beggs, 44, Spokane City councilman: “I want to see a significant reduction in property crime.” Sergio De Leon, 46, owner and manager, De Leon Foods: “We have a big drug abuse problem here locally, (and) this problem leads to other crimes. I would like to see more programs that help people with this deadly disease that affects all of us.” Lori Kinnear, 63, Spokane City councilwoman: “In my perfect world, we would need 40 more Spokane police officers. We need a police force commensurate with a city of our size.” Craig Meidl, 45, Spokane police chief: “I would like to see a comprehensive statewide plan to address the property crime issue in Washington state.” Putting a contentious election behind us Shawn Keough, Idaho state senator, R-Sandpoint, 57, who represents Bonner and Boundary counties in the Idaho Legislature: “All of the towns, the two counties and the people who reside with me there: Let’s find those things we share in common and work together on them – there are more things we agree on than not. The divisions within our community are detrimental to our future success and we should look for ways to bring our divergent interests together in civil and productive discussion for the betterment of our area.” Karen Stratton, 57, Spokane City councilwoman: “I want to see everyone get along. Whether that’s between the city and county, or the business community and government, or within City Hall. Things are way more partisan than they used to be.” Focus on students Jonathan Benecchi, 16, Lewis and Clark High School junior, president of Lil Guardians of the Children: “One of the big things I want to see changed is how our schools handle kids dealing with suicidal thoughts. Because right now our schools are not dealing with it that well.” Bob Nonini, 62, Idaho state senator, R-Couer d’Alene: “The continued growth and support coming from the local schools and higher education institutions along with the community in general related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) and career technical education. It will be great for the students, the economy and the younger generation’s future.” Shelley Redinger, 49, Spokane Public Schools superintendent: “My resolution for 2017 is to continue to engage students, families, staff and the community in conversations that build relationships, trust and understanding that will lead us to be better at all that we do.” Setting specific benchmarks Alisha Benson, 36, chief operating officer/vice president of education and workforce at Greater Spokane Inc.: “Next year GSI is officially launching a program to increase the proportion of residents in Spokane County with high-quality, high-demand degrees, or certificates, from 40 percent to 60 percent by 2025.” Rob McCann, 47, executive director, Catholic Charities: “I’d like to see every city, county government within 25 miles of Spokane commit that it’s going to give at least 2 percent of its annual budget to human services. If we do that, we can greatly reduce poverty by 2017.” Appreciating our beauty and talent Peggy Doering, 60, director of Valleyfest, 60: “In the windstorm of 2015, thousands of trees were lost across the region. I would like to see an effort to replace trees, a countywide reforest plan. We are the Evergreen State, after all.” Phil Hough, 58, Friends of Scotchman Peaks Wilderness, executive director and one of the founding board members: “My hope for the community is that we see the passage of successful legislation designating the Scotchman Peaks in Idaho as wilderness.” Karli Ingersoll, 30, co-owner of the Bartlett: “I would love to see at least twice the amount of local album releases. And I would love to see the audience for local music continue to grow in number. There’s a lot of unique talent in Spokane, and the artists here have a lot of important things to say to the community and on behalf of it.” Healthy community Elaine Couture, 61, CEO Providence Health Care: “My wish for 2017 is that we preserve the gains we have made in Washington state to ensure everyone has access to affordable health care coverage, and we are able to eliminate disparities in health so that our hospitals are not full; our friends, families and neighbors have access to medical care; and our communities are healthier as a result.” Personal goals Luke Falk, 22, Washington State football quarterback: “Put on more weight, that’s a big one. I’d like to get to 225 pounds. I just had some food poisoning so I don’t know what I am right now, but right around the 215 area.” Hope springs eternal Dan Dickau, 38, former Gonzaga basketball player, broadcaster, owns The Barbers and vice president/marketing director for ScoreBookLive: “The Zags to make their first Final 4.” Several others, including Mayor David Condon, mentioned a Final Four appearance for Gonzaga in addition to other resolutions.

Looking back on my New Year’s resolutions from last year, I had a spotty record of fulfilling them. Happily, I did not hit the fitness instructor with my car when she emerged from the gym. I was hoping I wouldn’t. Well, I didn’t hit her very hard. She’s expected to make a full recovery. And I did take down my Dick-Cheney-approved, petroleum-based Christmas tree before July. Or, rather, I made my teenagers take it down. We never quite put the bins of decorations away, they just stayed in a corner of the living room until December rolled around again. So, I will make that my goal this year. Put the decorations in the garage before spring. Sadly, I did not start cleaning my house on Sunday afternoons, as I had vowed to myself last year. But I had a revelation from above that I should continue to take naps instead. And, if you’re among my friends, you’re still waiting for me to send my 2015 Christmas cards. Take a number. They’re in a box, along with other detritus from that year, including calendars I bought and intended to give as gifts but never got around to. Anyone want a calendar that’s two years out of date? I did, however, buy an entire wardrobe of nice clothing from a plus-size store going out of business, so that I could stop feeling like I might find myself featured on that nasty website, People of Walmart. The bad news is, though, that right after I bought the entire new wardrobe, I went on a diet and lost so much weight that none of the clothes fit anymore. Well, I guess that’s not really bad news. Do you know a good inexpensive tailor? I need one. Desperately. I did not resolve to go on a diet in 2016, because I’ve been on 18,223 diets in my life, and they all resulted in an eventual weight gain after an initial loss. Which is why it’s interesting that I have lost quite a bit of weight this year, after I was diagnosed with diabetes in the spring. I took eight hours of deadly dull classes from Kaiser designed to teach me how to manage my diabetes, with a lot of wrong information about how to eat for optimal health. Fortunately, I happened to pick up a book at the library called “The End of Diabetes” by Dr. Joel Fuhrman, and was inspired to start following its new way of eating, which is based on plants instead of animals. Not only have I lost a ton of weight, but I feel fantastic too. No, if I told you how much, I’d have to kill you, but let’s just say it’s enough that my old pants have literally fallen off me in stores. I’m also off most of my meds, and my blood sugar and pressure have plummeted. It’s hard for a cattle rancher’s daughter to stop eating juicy delicious meat, so I cheat sometimes, but Carrie Fisher’s tragic heart attack just reminded me that I want to be around to annoy the crap out of my teenagers for decades to come. I’ve already informed Cheetah Boy, my son, that I’ll be moving in with him someday and, when I do, I will leave my socks and shoes all over the living room floor, never put new toilet paper on the rolls, use bathroom towels once and throw them on the floor and will be coming into the kitchen at midnight to trash it before going back to bed. I will also make him drive me places, only to announce when we get there that I forgot my glasses, so he has to take me home to get them. And, while he goes in the house to get my glasses, I’ll change the radio station to country music. That is a goal worth staying healthy for, don’t you agree? This year, I’m keeping my resolutions simple: I will finish my lessons to relearn how to ride a bike, which I started in November. I know, it’s easy. But, no, it’s not. Don’t judge me. I will find a good yoga class that we can all attend. I finally started doing yoga on vacation in Costa Rica and enjoyed it. Now that we’re home, I’ve been procrastinating about keeping it going. I’m going to start hiking the trails again that I couldn’t accomplish when I was too heavy. I’ve sorely missed those outings. And I’ll do one thing that scares me every month. That’s how you stay young, my friends. Stay scared. And let’s have a great 2017. I intend to.

Jon Fingas, @jonfingas 01.01.17 in Internet 533 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Lisa Lake/Getty Images It's not just tech giants like Apple that are taking online stores to task for allowing counterfeit goods on their virtual shelves. Run-DMC is suing Amazon, Walmart (including Jet.com) and partners for selling bogus shirts, hats and other goods that violate the legendary group's trademark. The internet retailers are allegedly "trading on the goodwill" of Run-DMC by either allowing third parties to sell counterfeits or, in Amazon's case, supposedly selling the fakes directly. We've asked Amazon and Walmart for comment and will let you know if they can respond. With that said, there's no question that stores like Amazon have taken at least some steps to crack down on counterfeits. The concern isn't really that they're knowingly profiting from knockoffs -- it's that they might not be doing enough to prevent these frauds from slipping through the cracks. These sorts of lawsuits may become more commonplace if artists and companies feel that their brands aren't getting adequate protection.

Millions of people are expected to take to the roads, rail and air to celebrate the season, which can cause fewer donors to be available and lead to a decline in blood and platelet donations. In addition, severe winter weather and seasonal illnesses can temporarily prevent some from giving. Donors with all blood types are needed now to help patients. As a special gift of thanks for taking the time to donate, people who come out to give Dec. 22 through Jan. 8 will receive a long-sleeved Red Cross T-shirt, while supplies last. “Many of us celebrate this time of year with loved ones, but patients may spend the holidays and ring in the New Year from a hospital room,” communications director for Red Cross Blood Services Nick Gehrig said. “Blood and platelet donors can bring joy to patients and their families by giving blood or platelets to help ensure patients receive the lifesaving treatments they need.” There are several upcoming blood donation opportunities in Riverside County over the holiday season. In Hemet, Jersey Mike’s, 719 Sanderson Ave., in Hemet will host a blood drive Jan. 3 starting at 10:30 a.m. In Murrieta, Wal-Mart, 41200 Murrieta Hot Springs Road, will host a blood drive Jan. 6 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Rancho Springs Medical Center, 25520 Medical Drive, will host a blood donation opportunity from noon until 6 p.m. Jan. 13. Temecula has three opportunities for giving blood. Wal-Mart, 32225 State Route 79 South, will be available for blood donations Dec. 30 and Jan. 15 starting at 10 a.m., and DCH Auto Group will host a blood drive Jan. 4 at 10 a.m. located at 26799 Ynez Road. Simply download the American Red Cross Blood Donor app, visit www.redcrossblood.org or call (800) 733-2767 to make an appointment or for more information. All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients. A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states or 16 years old with parental consent where allowed by state law, weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements. Blood donors can now save time at their next donation by using RapidPass to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online on the day of their donation and before arriving at the blood drive. To get started and learn more, visit www.redcrossblood.org/RapidPass and follow the instructions on the website. The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation’s blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a nonprofit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.

One of the largest Christmas outreach programs in the region — the Johnson City Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program — distributed gifts of new clothing and toys this year to 2,289 needy children in Washington, Carter and Unicoi counties. Of those children, all but 50 were adopted by shoppers at Angel Tree locations at The Mall at Johnson City and the Browns Mill Road and Elizabethton Walmart stores. Gifts were returned to the Salvation Army for all but 200 of the children. And in the final days before the gift distribution, a local company that wishes to remain anonymous stepped forward to provide gifts for each of the estimated 250 "forgotten angels.” “It’s the community that made this possible,” Capt. Michael Cox, commander of the Johnson City Salvation Army Corps, said Tuesday. “And it is because of their help that the Salvation Army can reach out and meet the need in the community. “Without them we could not do what we do, and we appreciate their love and their help for people.” According to Cox, contributions to the red kettle stations that support the army’s Center of Hope shelter and dining room and an array of other year-round social services for the homeless and poor totaled $163,000 this holiday season, or $3,000 more than the corps’ $160,000 goal. Numbers from Tom Krieger, who serves on the board of directors of both the Johnson City Salvation Army and the Johnson City Press Christmas Box that provides holiday food to the families of each of the Angel Tree children, were also heartening. According to Krieger, the Christmas Box distributed 1,062 holiday food boxes this year, each containing 47 nonperishable food items with 13 pounds of fresh potatoes and onions, a large frozen turkey and a canned ham on the side. The Christmas Box also purchased 750 grocery shopping gift certificates for low-income seniors and small households of one or two people. While a long list of contributors to the box has been compiled for a more complete statement of appreciation, Krieger sent “thanks to everybody who contributed their time, their finances and their prayers.” While a complete tally of the final number of children, seniors and families included in Good Samaritan Ministries’ Christmas food and gift outreach was not available Wednesday, the ministry reported last week the distribution would include a minimum of 750 low-income families from all over Upper East Tennessee. Good Samaritan Executive Director Aaron Murphy said the distribution included gifts for teens, the elderly and disabled adults throughout the community and Christmas food boxes for low-income families with hams, all the makings of a traditional holiday meal and staples to help the families after the holiday. Murphy also thanked the community for supporting the ministry through donations and sponsorships of many gift boxes. Home Instead Senior Care’s annual Be a Santa for a Senior project this year included 1,200 low-income seniors in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia — one of the largest gift distribution in the program’s 10-year history. Coordinator Sarah Faulk said every senior included the outreach was adopted by a shopper, and several groups in the Johnson City area hosted wrapping parties to ensure each of the seniors would receive a beautifully wrapped gift. Fault sent special thanks to Franklin Woods Community Hospital, United Health Care, Fresenius Health Care, Dominion Senior Living, the First Tennessee Area Agency on Aging and Disability and WJHL-TV for their special contributions to the project and to the community as a whole for its participation. And from Coalition for Kids, Executive Director Randy Hensley said the coalition was thankful to the “many people who gave the way they did to give a Christmas” to 151 of the program’s neediest children.

White U.S. President Barack Obama talks before signing a Presidential Memorandum on modernizing the overtime system to help insure workers are paid fairly for their work while in the East Room of the White House in Washington, March 13, 2014. REUTERS/Larry Downing Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement A new labor law rule - kicked back by a federal judge last month - that would have made almost four million Americans eligible for overtime pay may still have resulted in higher wages for the workers it was intended to help. The new legislation would have significantly raised the salary cap under which employees were eligible to earn overtime. In response, some large companies, such as Walmart, gave raises to workers whose pay fell just under the new threshold, making them ineligible for overtime pay. Other companies reclassified salaried overtime-exempt workers as hourly employees, which would make them eligible to earn overtime for workweeks longer than 40 hours. Related: Obama's Plan to Extend Overtime Pay Is Blocked by Federal Court "There's a whole set of companies that had already communicated to their employees that they were going to change their employment status or give them raises," said Brian Kropp, HR practice leader at CEB. Because the rule was halted only about a week before it was set to take effect, many companies had already made the switch. Raising Wages to Avoid Overtime Yanking back promised raises is a non-starter, especially with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly a decade, compensation experts say. "They're not going to adjust employees backwards," Kropp said. "To go back would be hugely damaging from an engagement and productivity perspective." "The choices you make around how you pay employees is so impactful to your business and is a big piece of your larger employer brand," said Lydia Frank, vice president at Compensation information and research company PayScale. PayScale analyzed 553 job titles that paid between the old and new thresholds for overtime eligibility ($23,661 and $47,476, respectively), and found that the number making in between those two numbers dropped sharply over the past two quarters. This indicates, the company said, that many businesses have been raising workers' wages to keep from having to pay overtime. For a typical position among those 553 analyzed, there was an 18 percentage point drop in the number earning below the new threshold. Out of the job titles it examined, PayScale found that the number of people making less than $47,476 fell in 539 of them. According to Mark Szypko, vice president of compensation strategy at Salary.com, roughly 40 percent of their corporate clients had implemented either raises or worker reclassification in anticipation of the FLSA update. Kropp estimated that about 5 percent of the workforce across retail, food service and hospitality and leisure — all sectors with large numbers of lower-wage workers — will be affected. Trump Likely Won't Fight It Those raises could have more staying power than the legislation itself. Ross Eisenbrey, vice president at the Economic Policy Institute, said it isn't clear yet whether or not the rule and the higher overtime threshold will survive after the inauguration. Donald Trump's stated opposition to corporate regulations makes him unlikely to support defending it in court, although Eisenbray said at least one organized labor group is positioning itself to continue defending it even if a Jeff Sessions-led Department of Justice declines to do so. This ambiguity around the legislation's fate could prompt companies to take a better-safe-than-sorry approach, Eisenbray said, since it would be hugely expensive to have to pay months of overtime retroactively. "The biggest takeaway for us is really it's interesting to see that a lot of companies took action before the law said they had to," Frank said. "There's no plans to repeal or roll back changes. I do think we'll see those wages stick," she said. "At the end of the day, employees will benefit," Kropp said. The low unemployment rate also makes it likely that even businesses who didn't give raises in anticipation of the higher threshold could be forced by market competition to match their rivals' pay increases. "If someone can get a $5,000 or $7,000 raise by going down the street, why wouldn't they?" Eisenbray said. "For companies that aren't paying as much as their competitors, they're going to see their best talent move," Kropp predicted. "In this segment of the market, people will move for 50 cents or a dollar an hour difference." Martha C.

Beware: Many Stores Have Tightened Their Rules by Herb Weisbaum Shoppers walk through the Rideau Centre, in Ottawa on Boxing Day on Dec. 26, 2016. Justin Tang / The Canadian Press via AP Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement Returning a gift? Beware: More than a few major stores have altered their previously generous open-ended return policies this year. Millions of Americans are heading back to the stores this week to cash in on sales and return those gifts that just didn't work out quite right. About 10 percent of all holiday merchandise winds up coming back, according to the National Retail Federation. And despite the financial hit - about $60 billion dollars - most stores offer special extended holiday return periods. However, a few prominent retailers have shortened their return policies this year, according to an annual survey by ConsumerWorld.org. Macy's now requires all returns in one year Kohl's has a new deadline for "premium electronics" of January 31 Costco reduced its return period for major appliances to 90 days Tightening Up the Returns "It's surprising to me that these three big retailers put an end to their unlimited return policy for some or all categories of items," said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org. "How strict or lenient return policies are seems to be cyclical. We seem to be in a period of some tightening." Drones were a popular gift item this year. If you got one and you want to take it back, you'd better get going. The return period for drones is just 14 days at Target, 15 days at Walmart and 30 days at Toys "R" Us. Shorter return periods are most likely a response to the serious and growing problem of return fraud. Retailers estimated that 3.5 percent of their holiday returns last year were fraudulent, according to the NRF's 2015 Return Fraud Survey. That fraud cost retailers $2.2 billion, up from approximately $1.9 billion in 2014. Even so, a few stores made their return rules more lenient this year. Two noteworthy changes: Sears started its holiday returns policy one week earlier (November 1) and now allows returns one week later (January 30) Toys"R"Us increased the return period for computer hardware from 15 to 30 days The Consumer World report noted that Toys "R" Us has a generous but "secret" holiday return policy that is not disclosed on its website, posted at stores checked, or known by store employees asked. That policy is: Most things - other than select electronics, such as video game hardware, cameras and computers - purchased on or after September 1 can be returned until January 28. "I simply can't understand why Toys "R" Us, which has one of the liberal holiday return policies in the industry, keeps it a secret," Dworsky told NBC News. When contacted about this, Toys "R" Us sent NBC News a link to a freshly released statement about post-Christmas sales. The news release is posted on the company's corporate site. The policy still does not appear on the return policy page where consumers would go. Better Have a Receipt Do yourself a favor and bring along the receipt or a gift receipt. Some retailers won't accept a return without a receipt. Others will only give you a store credit for the lowest price that item sold for recently, not what the gift-giver paid for it. "Receipts are critical," said Consumer Reports money editor Lauren Lyons Cole. "Merchants in the past have been fairly generous in taking back goods without a store or gift receipt, offering shoppers who can't produce documentation at least store credit for the lowest price the item sold for. Though it's rare for companies to have a blunt no-receipt, no-return rule, the lack of receipt puts you on shaky ground, especially for cash purchases because there's no way to look up the purchase." Don't be surprised if you're asked to show identification - your driver's license or other government-issued ID - even if you have the receipt. Some big chains now use computerized systems to detect return abuse. Consumer Reports say they use your ID to track your return history, including frequency, dollar amount and time between returns. For example, Walmart limits customers to three returns without a receipt within a 45 day period. Consumer Reports just published a Guide to Returning Gifts that includes a list of the "Best in the Business" and stores with strict policies. It's important to check the policy for any gifts purchased online. Some merchants cover the cost of the return shipping; others make you pay for it. Some stores with walk-in locations will let you return merchandise in person. It's important to remember that returns and exchanges are a courtesy. Except for damaged merchandise, a store is not required to take something back. And while many states require that return policy to be posted, the store gets to set the rules. "When you get in that long return line, check the store's policy while you're waiting," Consumer World's Dworsky told NBC News. "If you are asking for something outside the rules, recognize that and adjust your attitude accordingly. You can't demand something you're not entitled to. You can only ask politely for an accommodation." Herb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter or visit The ConsumerMan website.

(Mike Hall/Word of Mouth Media) Related Stories 4 workers at Halifax medical marijuana dispensary face drug charges Pot dispensaries need to take security risks seriously, says advocate Pot enforcement won't change until marijuana is legalized, says Regina police chief Defiant pot retailer vows to 'fight those fines' as Vancouver tries to clamp down A Halifax business shut down after a police raid on Friday has reopened its doors in the wake of drug charges against its employees, and is continuing to dispense medical and recreational marijuana. Shirley Martineau, owner of Auntie's Health and Wellness on Barrington Street, was arrested and charged with cultivating marijuana and two counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Three other men working at the store are charged with possession of cannabis resin and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.  Plans to restock store Speaking from her Dartmouth-area home, the 66 year old says she's aware of the legal implications of restocking her store after Halifax police raided it. But her business, she said, is filling a void left by a health care system that is difficult to navigate for people who want marijuana products. "I have to make a stand. I have to fight for the cancer patients," Martineau told CBC News on Saturday. "They have to go behind Walmart to buy their medicine? That doesn't make sense to me." 'I put everything I had into that store' Auntie's Health and Wellness was registered as a business in June. One week ago, Martineau said the store began to sell to anyone over the age of 19, with or without a medical marijuana licence. She said it was a business decision not driven by profits, but to improve accessibility for all patients.  "People were coming to me crying telling me they couldn't find a doctor," she said. "I put everything I had into that store." Martineau is also appealing the city's decision to deny Auntie's an occupancy permit application because of the sale of medical marijuana. The city says selling pot through storefronts is illegal and against bylaws.  Halifax police raid medical marijuana dispensary on Barrington Street0:19 Providing alternatives Staff Sgt. Andrew Matthews of the Halifax Regional Police said in an email Saturday that police are aware there is activity again and will continue to monitor it.  Martineau said volunteers are running the store for now because the conditions of her release prevent her from going near it. "What's the most devastating for me is the oil I had made just recently for a bunch of cancer patients. Now I can't get it," she said, fighting through tears. "It's not easy to make." 4 workers at Halifax medical marijuana dispensary face drug charges Due in court in 2017 Martineau also admits it hasn't been easy to keep the lights on. Revenue from recreational users pays for medical marijuana to be free for her customers, she said, but not for much more.  Despite the risks, she said she's answering the call to give patients alternatives to opiates for pain relief. "I opened the store today. And that's telling people not to give up," Martineau said.  Martineau and the three other men charged are scheduled to appear in Halifax provincial court at a later date.  With files from Steve Berry Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Fourchu Head North Mountain (Cape Breton) Parrsboro Halifax (Shearwater) New Glasgow Caribou Beaver Island Shelburne Baccaro Point Kejimkujik (National Park) North East Margaree Baddeck St. Peter's Hart Island Halifax Digby Brier Island Western Head Liverpool Grand Étang Chéticamp Ingonish Windsor Kentville Lunenburg Bridgewater Sheet Harbour Malay Falls Amherst Port Hawkesbury Tracadie Antigonish Cape George Guysborough Yarmouth Sydney Annapolis Royal Greenwood Bridgetown Tatamagouche Truro Economy Halifax Light Snow -5°C Sydney Light Snow -4°C Yarmouth Cloudy -3°C Annapolis Royal Cloudy -4°C Greenwood Cloudy -4°C More Weather | Latest Nova Scotia News Headlines When a lower property assessment doesn't mean lower taxes 3rd moose cull planned in national park to protect boreal forest Firm wants fresh start on controversial N.S. quarry project read comments 'We can't go back,' says doctor at hospital linked to veteran in murder-suicide Expect a snowy, windy weekend in Nova Scotia Top News Headlines Suspect arrested in Fort Lauderdale airport shooting that killed 5 video Got the flu?

A solar eclipse Next summer, a solar eclipse will darken southern cities like Charleston and Nashville for a few minutes. If you don’t live in the South, no worries! The natural blackout will be visible with less intensity in other major cities. If you want visit these spots, NASA has you covered. Just don’t forget to wear your sunglasses! 2. Moon adventures — for real! Humans continue their leap in space, and Google is leading a moonshot effort. The company is rewarding three privately-funded teams who reach Earth’s moon by 2017. The requirements: A team’s rover must travel 500 meters on lunar grounds and send back high-definition footage. You know, because pics or it didn’t happen. Oh, and besides lunar glory, there is a $20 million grand prize on the line. 3. The return of TV favs There’s important, big-dog TV coming down the pike. We’ll get Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” and, after a five-year hiatus, a Season 9 of “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Season 6 will be the last season for “Girls,” and in the streaming realm, Season 2 of “Stranger Things” will crawl out of the upside-down. In reality news, the former host of the “Celebrity Apprentice” is a little tied up with his new job, so new host Arnold Schwarzenegger will get to step into his shoes. 4. DeLoreans The future is back! The DeLorean Motor Company is letting buyers reserve their timeless vehicle online. The famous car was basically its own beloved character in the ‘Back to the Future’ saga. The manufacturer is running late on production but expects to crank out a car per month sometime in 2017. 5. Superfast trains Are super speedy trains in our near future? One company, Hyperloop One, envisions trains traveling as fast as planes, but without the turbulence. The company will test their fastest trains in 2017, with even bigger things to come. “The goal,” they say, is to move “cargo by 2020 and passengers by 2021.” 6. Drones EVERYWHERE Drones are going to BIG. They’ll be everywhere! No really, everywhere. Google could soon make it rain with beer and pizza as they prepare to drone-deliver food from the skies to your doorsteps through the developing ‘Project Wing.’ Amazon will expand on its nascent drone operation in the UK, and mega-retailer Wal-Mart wants to use them too, to help maintain inventory in its warehouses. 7. Attainable ‘Hamilton’ tickets Being one of the cool kids is about to get a whole lot easier. The record-setting Broadway sensation “Hamilton” is going national, which means you won’t have to travel to New York or Chicago, spend a million dollars, wait five years and barter your firstborn just to see it. Here is a list of stops. Good luck, they’ll still probably sell out in a matter of seconds. Oh well, there’s always 2018. 8. Sequels, sequels and more sequels Who says Hollywood needs fresh, original ideas when they can make bucketfuls of money trotting out old ones? Get set for new entries in durable movie franchises like Spiderman (“Homecoming”), the X-Men (“Logan”), Alien (“Covenant”), Thor (“Ragnarok”), Pirates of the Caribbean (“Dead Men Tell No Tales”), Transformers (“The Last Knight”) and The Fast and Furious (“The Fate of the Furious”). And of course we’ll all take yet another trip to a galaxy far, far away when “Star Wars Episode VIII” takes over theaters (and the world) at Christmas. There will be a touch of sadness with this one, however, due to the death of Carrie Fisher. She had finished shooting her scenes for this one, so it will at least give fans one last chance to say goodbye. 9. Dave Chappelle Netflix and chill is over. It’s about to be Netflix and laugh until you cry. After dropping his Comedy Central contract in 2005, the comedian is delivering a new stand-up comedy special on the streaming juggernaut. He’s also releasing two unseen shows from his personal vault. 10. New music and collabs Yes, 2016 took so many of our music legends. But some of your favs will still be putting out new music. The Arcade Fire says its new album will drop in the spring, and it’s about time. Eminem will also get a strange bedfellow in…Adele? Yes Slim Shady and the 10-time Grammy winning singer will reportedly team up on his new album, his first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. Oh, and and we’ll get “More Life” from Drake, which he considers more of a playlist than an album. Whatever, just give it to us! 11. The book everyone’s been waiting for The sixth book in George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series — which “Games of Thrones” is based on — could come out in March. It’s called “The Winds of Winter,” and Martin promises to open it with two big battle scenes.”The Winds of Winter” will also quickly resolve several cliffhangers left over from the end of the last book, “A Dance with Dragons.” We’re waiting, George! 12. A head transplant (?!) Yeah, you read that right. A not-so-mad scientist plans to conduct the first human head transplant. Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero says he has a volunteer — a man suffering from a muscle-wasting disease — so all he needs now is a body. The details of how the surgery will go down — like how they’ll get a body — are a little hazy, but Canavero says it’ll involve 150 people, 36 hours, really cold temperatures, bio-compatible glue and a diamond knife. Best. Craft project. Ever. 13. Nintendo’s next big thing Everybody seems hyped about the Nintendo Switch. It’s the first video gaming system that lets you, well, switch effortlessly between playing games on the big-screen TV in your living room or the tablet in your hand. The price for the Switch, due out in March, hasn’t been released yet, but all the cool kids on the internet are geeked up about it. Nintendo is, too: The company experienced lackluster sales of its Wii U back in 2012, so it’s really counting on the Switch to make a big splash. 14. The Kennedy assassination files For decades, endless conspiracy theories have swirled around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But some details could add context to the tragic events of November 22, 1963 when undisclosed files on the case go public. There’s a catch: The man presiding over the office Kennedy held, President-Elect Donald Trump, will have the power to order these files sealed, if he so chooses. 15. Weird milk Who needs cows? Not a California-based tech start-up called Perfect Day. It’s promising to put bottles of milk made without cows on store shelves by the end of the year. Perfect Day says making milk without the cow is a lot like crafting beer: It involves fermentation and yeast (and probably a little imagination). The company also says making milk this way is better for the environment, since the technique involves using less land, water and energy. 16. Surfin’ in The Eddie It’s the one sporting event in the world that usually gets canceled by the weather. The Eddie is an invite-only Hawaiian surfing contest that takes place off of Oahu’s famous North Shore. Organizers only run it when conditions are right — when the waves are at LEAST 20 feet high — so the contest has only happened nine times in 30 years. The waiting period for the current contest runs until February 28, so everybody’s got their fingers crossed that the big waves will come. 17. Virtual reality (just in case things get bad again) 2017 could be the year that virtual reality finally gets real and fulfill all those promises that were made to us back in the 90s. The Samsung Gear VR (which works with Galaxy phones) seemed to make the biggest splash with the masses this year, and that won’t change going into next year. But the Daydream View from Google will probably make big strides next year too, as it becomes available to work with most Android phones. And Microsoft will put out a number of Windows-10 compatible VR headsets in the next couple of months, so consumers will have a ton of good choices.

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Multiple bullet holes speckle the side of a VW in the far end of an American Fork Wal-Mart parking lot near 900 West and 300 South, where a woman was shot and killed on Dec. 4, 2016. The suspect was soon pursued to a nearby movie theater where he died in a confrontation with police. Tribune’s tally » Utah’s high number of fatal attacks by relatives or cohabitants may be partly attributed to culture, birth rate, some experts say. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) On the night of Dec. 4, Utah Valley dispatchers received a frantic 911 call from a woman begging for help in the last moments of her life. Sue Ann Sands screamed in terror from inside her lime green Volkswagen Beetle, which her ex-boyfriend had rammed with his SUV before coming at her with a gun in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in American Fork, according to police. James Dean Smith fired at least seven rounds into Sands' car — one of them fatally striking the 39-year-old woman in the head. Minutes later, Smith died during a shootout with police. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Two weeks earlier, Smith, 33, had been served with a protective order after giving Sands a beating that left bruises all over her face and body, her mother told KUTV. Of the 63 homicides in Utah in 2016, at least 20 — nearly 30 percent — were reportedly the result of domestic violence, or violence at the hands of a family member or cohabitant, according to The Salt Lake Tribune's unofficial tally, which is based on information from police and prosecutors. See the list of 2016 homicide victims While that number is on par with the national average of 30 percent, Jenn Oxborrow of the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition said domestic violence-related homicides in Utah have accounted for 42 percent of homicides statewide over the last 16 years. Utah has a "squeaky clean" reputation in a lot of things, she said, but domestic and sexual violence are not part of them. The UDVC is a private nonprofit group designated by the federal government to coordinate efforts to combat domestic violence in the state. Of the Utah deaths related to domestic violence this year, the youngest victim was an 8-week-old girl who allegedly was abused by her father. She was one of at least six Utah children who died as the result of domestic violence and abuse. Part of the reason so many children are victims of lethal domestic violence in Utah, Oxborrow said, is because the state has a high birth rate to begin with, and many mothers fear they will lose custody of their children if they report domestic violence because they have exposed their children to a dangerous environment. Also, the wage gap in Utah between women and men is bigger than in many other states, she said, and women are often afraid they won't be able to survive financially if they lose their household's main income, provided by their abusers. "It's just a really bad combination of factors," Oxborrow said. "People are staying in really dangerous relationships for a long time." While men and women can be perpetrators or victims of domestic violence, she said that 88 percent of offenders are male. Of the 20 deaths in 2016 resulting from domestic violence, 18 accused perpetrators were men, one was a woman and in one case a suspect has not yet been named by police. Of the 17 women and girls who were homicide victims, 11 died as the result of domestic violence. Nine domestic-violence victims were male. The oldest victim of domestic violence was a 73-year-old Logan woman believed to have been fatally shot by her husband who later killed himself. "I am astonished at how many really dangerous domestic-violence abusers are allowed to have guns in Utah," Oxborrow said. "It's stunning. ... Having a gun in a domestic-violence situation is like pouring gas on fire." A state study from 2010 to 2013 showed that of 86 domestic violence-related homicides, 59 percent were shootings, Oxborrow said. And, of those, 39 percent of the perpetrators had a prior criminal domestic-violence history. When a gun is present in a domestic-violence situation, it increases the risk of homicide by 500 percent for women, according to a 2014 study conducted by Everytown, a gun-safety advocacy group. Of the total number of Utah homicides in 2016, at least 35 were shootings. Nine of those were domestic-violence related, while other cases of lethal domestic violence involved starvation, drowning, physical beating, stabbing or strangulation. At least three of the domestic homicides reported were followed by the suicide of the perpetrator. "Utah has a lot of work to do when it comes to holding people accountable for perpetrated domestic violence," Oxborrow said. In other parts of the country, a standard response to domestic violence is a mandatory, court-ordered 26-week intervention program, she said, but the Utah court system does not mandate such offender programming. A 2016 amendment to the state's Cohabitant Abuse Procedures Act made domestic-violence treatment optional for those convicted of domestic abuse. Of those with a previous criminal domestic-violence history, Oxborrow said 12 percent are enrolled in such a program, which seeks to coordinate safety and hold people "accountable to the violence they've perpetrated." "In Utah, we've tethered this to our mental-health system, and it's one more way of watering down the accountability for a domestic violence perpetrator," said Oxborrow, a licensed clinical social worker. "If mental-health issues are a factor in it, then that should be assessed for sure," but domestic violence should be treated and prosecuted as a violent crime. She also believes victims throughout the state need more support and resources. Oxborrow said friends and family members are too often "incredulous" and skeptical when they are clued in about a case of domestic violence. Additionally, she said, data collected by the state show that 2 percent of female victims of lethal domestic violence in the last 16 years have had a protective order against their killers. "That tells me people don't know where to go," Oxborrow said. Even when they do find resources, she said, the programs frequently are overwhelmed. In Utah, she said, 17 programs partner with the UDVC to serve 29 counties. Part of the reason there are so few programs is because there is no dedicated state funding for the cause, Oxborrow added. Most states set aside between $1 million and $8 million, she said, but "in Utah, sometimes we get about $400,000 of state money."

BUSINESS Smart shopping in January: Buy TVs and fitness gear, skip smartphones and toys Black Friday Shoppers in Mesquite LARRY W. SMITH / EPA TV deals should abound as the Super Bowl approaches, just as they did around Thanksgiving, when these shoppers in Mesquite, Texas, took advantage of low prices. TV deals should abound as the Super Bowl approaches, just as they did around Thanksgiving, when these shoppers in Mesquite, Texas, took advantage of low prices. (LARRY W. SMITH / EPA) Courtney Jespersen If finding deals is your New Year’s resolution, January is a great time to start. For those who want to make saving money a priority in 2017, here are our recommendations for what to buy (and skip) this month based on NerdWallet’s analysis of historical sales cycles. Buy: Christmas decorations The period after Christmas has long been the best time to buy Christmas decorations. You may scoop up some post-Christmas deals on Dec. 26, but come Jan. 1, there will still be a handful of artificial trees, red ornaments and shiny wrapping paper spilling over in store clearance aisles. Stock up on holiday close-outs if you have space to hang onto extra tinsel until December. Skip: Smartphones You can’t always time your smartphone purchase. If your trusty iPhone has seen better days, it may be time for something new. But if you’re planning an upgrade in the not-so-imminent future, consider waiting a while longer. Prices on existing phone models tend to go down whenever a new phone is released. For Apple phones, the sweet spot is usually September after the company’s annual keynote product announcement. As for Samsung, tech enthusiasts speculate the Galaxy S8 could arrive around April. Buy: TVs The end of football season marks the beginning of television deals, as retailers help shoppers prep for viewing parties. The Super Bowl will air on Feb. 5, but we expect retailers will kick off sales at the end of January — making it an excellent time to score a bargain. In 2016, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Amazon and more discounted a wide variety of TVs in assorted brands and sizes ahead of the big game. Look for similar savings again in 2017. Skip: Toys Toys were hot during the holidays; if you haven’t heard of a Hatchimal, you’ve probably been living under a rock. But with Christmas over, January likely won’t see many worthwhile toy deals. The good news is your little ones are probably set for a while after all of their December gifts. Buy: Fitness gear January is a solid time to sign up for a gym at a discounted introductory rate, as many chains offer special New Year’s rates. But don’t spend that money unless you’re sure you’ll use the membership. All too often, new members lock themselves in for a full year, then stop showing up after a month or two. Skip: Mattresses Great deals on mattresses will come in February, when Presidents Day sales bring discounts. Presidents Day is Feb. 20, so hold off for another month if you’re in the market for a new mattress. Or if February is too soon for your budget, mattress deals will be back again in May over Memorial Day weekend and in September over Labor Day weekend. Buy: Bedding You might not want to buy a whole new mattress, but you can save on the sheets and blankets that go on your existing mattress. January is the month when department stores host “white sales” to clear out their existing inventory of sheets, towels, blankets and more. Expect savings to be especially deep on clearance items. Last year, we saw several stores offer 60%-70% off bedding basics. Bonus: Martin Luther King Jr. Day sales You may not associate Martin Luther King Jr. Day with shopping, but retailers certainly do. The holiday falls on Jan. 16 this year, and you can anticipate deals on clothing and home goods. Highlights from the holiday’s 2016 sales included 10% off select major appliance purchases of $396 or more at Lowe’s and an extra 40% off sale items at Anthropologie with a coupon code as part of the Winter Tag Sale. Sale shopping reminder As you’re searching for deals and end-of-season savings this month, keep in mind that waiting for low prices can be a trade-off, says Ozalp Ozer, a professor of management science at the Jindal School of Management at The University of Texas at Dallas. You’ll have to put time into the search. And buying at the time of a better deal may mean that inventory will already be picked over. But for the budget-conscious, the extra time and risk of regret is worth it. Courtney Jespersen is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: courtney@nerdwallet.com.

But there’s no denying that 2016 was a huge turning point, both socially and technologically. VR didn’t exactly soar this year — but it didn’t crash and burn, either. At the beginning of 2016, virtual reality was almost purely the province of developers, artists, and the lucky few who got to see their work. Concepts were usually more important than execution, and VR experiences didn’t have to be good, just novel. The only real options for most people to try it were the Samsung Gear VR, an interesting product with a lot of flaws, and the simple Google Cardboard. VR didn’t exactly soar this year — but it didn’t crash and burn, either The year didn’t get off to an auspicious start. The first high-end VR system launch, the Oculus Rift in March, was a bit of a mess. The headset had some great features but cost far more than people expected. It felt incomplete without motion controllers, and a component shortage made it almost impossible to find. The HTC Vive — which came soon after — felt more powerful, but it was barely a consumer device, and selling it as one laid bare how sparse experiences still were. At the same time, it proved that VR could stay entertaining for weeks or months instead of minutes. Outside the big commercial headset launches, super-ambitious VR entertainment company The Void launched its first experience in Times Square, to mixed reviews. The Chinese VR market got bigger and more interesting, focusing on compact, self-contained designs and special features. The Sundance and Tribeca film festivals made VR a big part of their lineup, and The Verge co-hosted a pop-up exhibit with the Toronto International Film Festival. Late fall saw a few highlights. Sony’s PlayStation VR showed how VR could fit with the typical console gaming experience, with uniquely trippy games like Thumper and Rez. Daydream, a mobile VR platform built into Android, put Google’s weight behind virtual reality. Then Oculus made up for its past stumbles by releasing the best VR controllers ever made, alongside clever games like Superhot and I Expect You To Die. These still don’t feel as full-featured as non-VR games, but they’re a far cry from anything we saw in 2015. VR is still too flawed to succeed Inside virtual reality, we’ve started figuring out its weak points — the potential for harassment, problems with embodiment, and confusion about how to fit it into the existing worlds of gaming and film. Also, nobody can make money developing for it. These could be signs that VR is still too flawed to succeed, or they could be the growing pains that let it flourish down the road. It’s frustrating to have yet another year of uncertainty ahead of us, but it’s also a good sign that VR has at least squeaked through one of its biggest transitions. — Adi Robertson Verge 2016 Report Card: VR B+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Lots of creative, genuinely good experiments Hardware that (eventually) lived up the hype Widespread interest in film and gaming Needs Improvement: Still inaccessible and expensive for most of the year Economic future is uncertain Interest hasn't translated into full-featured experiences TV and set-top boxes TV makers kept up the “4K!” cheerleading throughout 2016, and as we wrap up December, the years-long slog to Ultra HD still isn’t over — not even close. But we’re entering 2017 in a much better place. You can walk into a Best Buy or Walmart, or log onto Amazon and buy a nice 4K TV for under $700. Most of those will look pretty great when streaming Netflix or Amazon Video in 4K -- some even include HDR, which adds brighter and more vivid picture for a more theater-like experience. So the price barrier to entering the world of UHD is pretty much gone. Will a $2,000 TV still look better than a bargain set? Most always, but it’s (probably) easier than ever to find something affordable that looks great to your own eyes. The price barrier to entering the world of UHD is pretty much gone The software experience on those TVs hasn’t radically changed since we last left CES. It’s a mix of Tizen (Samsung), Android TV (Sony, etc.), webOS (LG), a very minimal Chromecast UI (Vizio), and Roku TV. Most sets ship with the must-have popular streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube built in, giving you an instant source of 4K video. Not everything’s great, but you can mostly navigate menus on your TV without pulling your hair out. Progress! Depending on your TV, a set-top box like an Apple TV or Roku might not be the automatic purchase it was a year ago. But if you still want one, they’ve made improvements this year too. Pretty much all the big ones except Apple’s now support 4K resolution. Most of them can also serve as a cable box replacement thanks to services like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, and PlayStation Vue. But there are still annoying problems and potential frustrations lingering. You’ve got competing standards for HDR: HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (The former has seen wider support across TV brands.) And when it comes to 4K content, you’ve got to pay attention to the HDMI ports when buying a new set. On many TVs, only one or two of several HDMI inputs might support HDMI 2.0, which is critical for streaming Ultra HD. Yet again, 2017 is going to be all about 4K The year ahead will likely be one of iteration. LG will keep leading the class in picture quality with its OLED TVs — though it’s rumored that Sony might be releasing some of its own. Samsung will put out some fantastic high-end sets, and yep, some will be curved. Vizio, a favorite of home theater nerds, is in the process of being acquired by LeEco, which may result in interesting changes. But yet again, 2017 is going to be all about 4K, 4K, 4K. — Chris Welch Verge 2016 Report Card: TVs B+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: 4K is more affordable than ever HDR makes your living room closer to a movie theater Several set-top boxes now do 4K Needs Improvement: A winning HDR format between HDR10 and Dolby Vision All TV makers need to keep current with HDMI and HDCP standards OLED, the TVs with best picture quality, are still expensive Apps Remember Peach? Remember Peach? It was the biggest new thing in social networks in January, but chances are you’ve probably forgotten it existed. That seems to be the general consensus around 2016 in apps. Occasionally, there are standouts, but most become temporarily popular only to get overshadowed or bought out by the big companies — mainly Facebook and Google. The biggest promise of the year was also the biggest disappointment: bots. Despite Facebook, Google, and Microsoft all committing to bots as the future of technology, 2016 was definitively not the year of the AI chatbot. Facebook added bots to its Messenger in the form of apps — yep, apps within apps — but rather than wave of new interactions within our smartphones, we got a bunch of text-based versions of things like weather and food ordering. Microsoft went big on bots as a platform, but none of those experiments have really broken through. And Allo, Google’s big bet to bring AI bots to messaging apps, landed with more of a whimper than a bang. 2016 was definitively not the year of the AI chatbot The other takeaway from apps this year is that everyone seems to be hastily looking across the aisle to see what they can take from others. Apple updated iMessage to have Snapchat’s self-destructing photos and LINE-style stickers. Snapchat’s Memories is basically cloud photo storage like that of Google Photos’ and GroupMe’s. Instagram flat out copied Snapchat’s stories down to its feature name. Finally, Facebook Messenger ripped off Snapchat’s live filters and vanishing messages. Instead of any real innovation, we just saw the same features in more places. Meanwhile, beloved apps like Vine and Sunrise left our phones for good. Despite the backing of major companies like Microsoft and Twitter, it seems that having a small but dedicated community that use your app is no longer enough. It’s also been a bad year to be an up and coming iOS game developer. There were some interesting new titles this year, but the F2P market has long since taken over the platform. Suffice to say, we haven’t seen something like Monument Valley take the mobile gaming space by storm. The biggest gaming apps of the year came in the form of Nintendo’s blockbuster franchises making their way to mobile platforms, but Pokemon Go has had little staying power since its summer success, and Super Mario Run faces an uncertain future while clinging to an app store pricing scheme that hasn’t succeeded since 2008. Prisma is a genuinely brilliant and fun photo editing app That said, it isn’t all doom and gloom for the future of apps. We did have some fun new players this year: Prisma is a genuinely brilliant and fun photo editing app that feels like a throwback to apps of years past. And Google’s Motion Stills app took Apple’s Live Photos and elevated them to an entirely new level of brilliant entertainment by turning them into GIFs. In the end, apps are still the way we interact with almost all of our technological devices, and probably will be for some time. People still buy apps, and despite the promise of bots to make individual applications unnecessary, that future is still ways to go. If that promise extends to next year — perhaps, with some new, more nimble competition to the entrenched players — 2017 could be quite exciting. At the very least, we have more ways than ever to get robots to order us pizza. — Chaim Gartenberg Verge 2016 Report Card: Apps C+ 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Some new, creative apps that remixed old smartphone features in new ways Email apps are back Needs Improvement: Bots need big improvements Messaging apps are unnecessarily complicated It’s tough for new, smaller developers to be found and make money In this Storystream The Verge 2016 tech report card The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Virtual reality, TV, and apps The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Headphones and streaming music View all 15 stories More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending This is Apple’s click wheel iPhone prototype Displays are the secret superstars of CES How much can police find out from a murderer’s Echo?

Two anonymous donors have paid for student lunch accounts in the district as a gift. Jim T. Ryan photo  By Jim T. Ryan Staff Writer Newport School District received a "secret Santa" gift of sorts just before Christmas. Two anonymous donors wrote checks totaling about $6,000 to pay for all outstanding student lunch accounts and to pay for reduced lunches for the remainder of the school year, according to school officials. "Wow. I was just shocked," Superintendent Ryan Neuhard said last week. "It was amazing." The community really values the district and provides for the students, he said. The district first received a Facebook message from a resident on Dec. 13 that the anonymous donor wanted to write a check to go toward student lunch accounts, elementary school Principal Michael Smith said. Two days later, a second donor stated a desire to give to student lunch accounts. "I was surprised, in a good way," Smith said.  The district receives support from the community, but it never expects large donations like this, he said. "They were inspired by the Walmart story," Smith said, referencing anonymous donors who paid the tab on lay-away accounts at Walmarts around the country. The money means that about 55 students who receive reduced lunches will not have to pay for the rest of this school year. Districts offer reduced lunches to families who may face financial difficulties. The district last week still was contacting families to let them know of the gifts that will mean more than 100 free lunches.  Smith said the only requests from donors was that they remain anonymous and that the district spread the news so that maybe other people would be inspired to give back to their communities in some way. "We would like to say thank you for the generous contributions," Neuhard said. Jim T.

Run-DMC accuses Amazon, Wal-Mart of trademark infringement in $50 million suit - Irish Sun Issue 07/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Run-DMC accuses Amazon, Wal-Mart of trademark infringement in $50 million suit Irish Sun Saturday 31st December, 2016 • Retails accused of selling clothing and accessories with rap group’s name without permission • Run-DMC founder Darryl McDaniels called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable” • McDaniels said it is the subject of several licensing agreements CALIFORNIA, U.S. - One of the Run-DMC founders has filed a legal case against Amazon, Wal-Mart amongst other retailers claiming they have been selling clothing and accessories with the prominent rap group’s name without permission. The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and has named more than 20 retailers. It alleges that these retailers have confused the public and diluted the group’s brand and their ability to “utilise, market, promote and sell products with its registered trademark.” Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC and the plaintiff in the lawsuit is claiming damages over the “alleged sale of glasses, hats, patches, T-shirts, wallets and other products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007.” He has said that the Run-DMC brand is “extremely valuable,” adding that it is subject of several licensing agreements. The $50 million infringement lawsuit has accused the retailers of using the group’s image for “advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products.” McDaniels further added that “the defendants are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws.” According to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements are stopped. Run-DMC was founded in New York City in the year 1981 by Joseph “Run” Simmons, Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell and Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, rising to fame as one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s. McDaniels and Simmons announced the group was disbanding after the third member Mizell was shot dead in 2002.

Featured Story Authorities claim 97 percent property-owners paid taxes last year DUBLIN, Ireland - According to Irish tax authorities, as many as 97 percent of all property owners paid taxes last year. The tax authorities have said they collected as much as 463 million euros from tax last year.  Astonishingly, a huge number of people have already paid the taxes for this year. However, this wasn’t without prompting owners to do so: The tax collection authorities had to send as many as 300,000 warning letters telling owners to pay up, or face consequences. Further, those who are yet to pay up their taxes can do so via an electronic cheque, also called an annual debit authority by the Revenue Department. Owners doing so must inform tax officials about the same by Wednesday. All the tax shall be hence withdrawn from their accounts in March. Michael Gladney, Collector General, has stated that since the Revenue Department took charge of tax collection in 2013, as much as 64 million dollars have been collected.  Moreover, as many as 360,000 properties have been taken over by the department following non-payment of taxes on the owner’s behalf. The collector general said in a statement, “The vast majority of property owners fully comply with their local property tax payment obligations, either in a single payment or with phased payments. As long as payment obligations are being met, Revenue will automatically roll over existing payment methods for property owners who pay by direct debit or by deduction at source from pay/pension.” Find Irish Sun on Facebook Latest Irish Sun news Huge surge in electrical goods sales help to boost retail figures DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Statistics office has released figures that show a rise of ...

A popular sledding spot along Senator Highway was a busy place this week. By Max Efrein Originally Published: December 31, 2016 6:02 a.m. Share Tweet mefrein As the remaining snow from Christmas Eve’s wintry storm creeps away, it leaves many Prescott area residents smiling with recent memories of quality snowmen, snowball fights and sledding. HOW RARE WAS IT? Prescott had the third most snow on the ground Christmas morning this year than it has had in the last 100 years, according to measurements taken by volunteer cooperative observers for the National Weather Service. Here are the top seven Prescott snow depth figures for Christmas Day dating back to 1916: 1967 = 24 inches on the ground 1916 = 7 inches on the ground 2016 = 5 inches on the ground 1987 = 3 inches on the ground 1968 = 3 inches on the ground 1941 = 2 inches on the ground 1939 = 2 inches on the ground Prescott doesn’t get much snow each year, but when it does, many in the quad-city area quickly capitalize on the occasional marvel. Good indicators of how much the community is engaging in winter recreation are local retail stores. Just two days after snow hit the ground — one of which was Christmas Day when most businesses were closed — nearly every retailer carrying sleds, tubes and toboggans for the season was completely sold out of such items. Large department stores such as Target and Walmart were some of the first to run out. Prescott Target’s store manager, Myrza Lamper, said they’ve had sleds stocked in their stores since October, but the plastic toys only really started selling when the snow started falling. “When I got here Monday morning (Dec. 26), there was only one left,” Lamper said. Prescott Home Depot’s operations manager, Tom Tuttle, reported a similar rush for the store’s limited stock of sleds. “When the snow came, everybody gobbled them up,” Tuttle said. That didn’t stop some shoppers from finding a way to hit the slopes. “One of the things that a lot of our guests were doing — and they did last year as well — was they were buying crates and using the lids to slide around with,” Lamper said. Both Lamper and Tuttle said they weren’t sure if and when their stores will receive another shipment of sleds this season, so it is recommended to call the stores to ask whether any have been restocked before trying to pick any up in person. Where to go sledding Acquiring a sled is one thing. Figuring out where to go sledding is another. Just about any snow-covered hillside will do the job. However, there are a few key spots that Quad Cities residents tend to favor. One is a picnic site along Highway 89A on Mingus Mountain. Another — and perhaps more popular — is a pull off along Senator Highway just a few miles south of Gurley Street. “This is probably the best spot,” said Mike Boeckner, a Chino Valley resident who was out sledding at the Senator Highway pull off with his family earlier this week. “I hear there are a few good areas along Walker Road too.” Children and their parents weren’t the only ones out enjoying the slippery slopes. Some grandparents were even giving it go, including 80-year-old Arline McKeever, a retired school nurse who has had both of her knees replaced in the last year. “She’s a wild one,” said Kathleen McKeever, Arline’s daughter. “She’s one of those people who likes to enjoy life.” “We’ve been doing this stuff for years,” said Arline, who has a cabin in Groom Creek. When it comes to sledding, it may be best to wait for the another snowstorm to roll through later this season. The one predicted for this weekend is forecast to be mainly rain below 6,300 feet.

I am all for people enjoying that spot if they have the recreational permit issued by the AZ State Land Dept. but very few do and many of the people that sled there leave behind a mountain of trash when they are done (broken sledding items, used diapers,beverage containers, etc.). A public safety issue also arises due to the limited parking that is available and the road conditions where vehicles often get stuck and have to have a tow truck get them out of their predicament. The overflow traffic into the Sweet Acres, Oak Knoll Village and Sherman Pines neighborhoods also creates considerable problems for residents there. That area often does not get plows going through as they are concentrating on Senator Hwy so those roads, even when they do get plowed are almost always icy and vehicles often slide off the roads into the culverts and also get stuck on the roadways themselves, blocking access for residents and emergency vehicles. If you want to sled, go to places that you are lawfully allowed to sled and where you do not create a public safety hazard. Or get the permit and tell YCSO you are permitted and clean up your trash. Unpermitted users should be cited with trespassing. The Courier should stop promoting this State Land area as a place to sled or enjoy the snow in their articles and video/photos each year. Damage occurs to the land there and to personal property of those going there and to the property of residents in the adjacent neighborhoods..

In the past, with piles of snow along the roads, cars have parked on the roads, blocking traffic.

If it is really illegal, let's hear it from authorities -- not trash-talk hearsay from a couple of anonymous posters who might just live up that way, and who might want to corner the market on the area's beauty. In other words, "bah humbug." Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Votey_McVoteface 5 days, 21 hours ago There is no bah humbug attitude from me. It really is illegal. State Trust Land is not public land. Check out the AZ State Land Dept. website. Nobody should have to hear it from authorities as they have an obligation to know where they can and can not recreate. There are signs there which say "No Trespassing" yet people ignore them. Call the State Fire office on Gail Gardner (it's been a while since I have talked to them but Russ and Chris are quite helpful and knowledgeable). No Trespassing! by Votey McVoteface Upvote 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Votey_McVoteface 5 days, 20 hours ago Folks risk personal injury and property damage to themselves and others while also requiring public safety employees to dedicate their time and risk injury themselves due to the unpreparedness and irresponsible actions of some of the people trying to recreate where they should not be. This incident had 2 YCSO vehicles at this site while at one of the two entrances to the neighborhood another vehicle was stuck in the roadway blocking access into and out of the neighborhood and had another YSCO vehicle there and that truck had to be towed out. Notice the icy conditions of the road in this pic. 4x4 vehicles often get stuck here and slide off the road as well and I have yet to see a person equipped with snow chains (other than myself), YCSO included. There are some steep streets in this neighborhood where serious injury and damage can occur. I would hate to see that happen to a family trying to have fun in the snow. Car meet culvert!

Southbound traffic did not stop while this was occurring (multiple cars, - I have pics of that too but I think you may realize at this point that I wouldn't lie to you about this stuff) and drove south in the northbound lanes even while the jeep was 1/4 - 1/3 of the way into the nb lane, creating the potential for an accident to occur. People seem to lose their ability to use common sense and disregard their own safety and the safety of others in less than optimal driving conditions just to play in the snow.

 A giant wave of store closures is about to hit the US Hayley Peterson Dec. 31, 2016, 8:09 AM 616,655 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rolling Acres Mall in Akron, Ohio. Nicholas Eckhart Retailers are bracing for a fresh wave of store closures at the start of the new year.  The industry is heading into 2017 with a glut of store space as shopping continues to shift online and foot traffic to malls declines, according to analysts. "I f you are weaker player, it's going to be a very tough 2017 for you, " said RJ Hottovy, a consumer equity strategist for Morningstar.  He said he's expecting a number of retailers to file for bankruptcy next year, in addition to mass store closures. Nearly every major department store, including Macy's, Kohl's, Walmart, and Sears, have collectively closed hundreds of stores over the last couple years to try and stem losses from unprofitable stores and the rise of ecommerce.  But the closures are far from over. Macy's has already said that it's planning to close 100 stores, or about 15% of its fleet, in 2017. Sears is shuttering at least 30 Sears and Kmart stores by April, and additional closures are expected to be announced soon. CVS also said this month that it's planning to shut down 70 locations. Mall stores like Aeropostale, which filed for bankruptcy in May, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men's Wearhouse, and The Children's Place are also in the midst of multi-year plans to close stores.  Many more announcements like these are expected in the coming months. The start of the year is a popular time to announce store closures. Nearly half of annual store closings announced since 2010 have occurred in the first quarter, CNBC reports. In addition to closing stores, retailers are also looking to shrink their existing locations.  "As leases come up, you're going to see a gradual rotation into smaller-footprint stores," Hottovy said. Despite recent closures, the US is still oversaturated with stores. The US has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia — the next two countries with the highest retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar report from October. "Across retail overall the US has too much space and too many shops," said Neil Saunders, CEO of the retail consulting firm Conlumino. "As shopping patterns have changed, some of those shops are also in the wrong place and are of the wrong size or configuration." As stores continue to close, many shopping malls will be forced to shut down as well. When an anchor store like Sears or Macy's closes, it often triggers a "downward spiral in performance" for shopping malls, Morningstar analysts wrote in the report from October. The malls don't only lose the income and shopper traffic from that store's business. The closure often triggers "co-tenancy clauses" that allow the remaining mall tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or renegotiate the terms, typically with a period of lower rents, until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor space.  To reduce losses, malls must quickly find a replacement tenant for the massive retail space that the anchor store occupied , which is  nearly impossible  — especially in malls that are already financially strapped — when every major department store is reducing its retail footprint. That can have "grave" consequences for shopping malls, especially in markets where it's harder to transform vacant mall space into non-retail space like apartments, according to the analysts. The Morningstar report supports another recent analysis from Credit Suisse that said about 200 shopping malls are at risk of shutting down if Sears continues to close stores.  SEE ALSO: Sears and Kmart are closing more stores — see if your store is on the list NOW WATCH: Sears and Kmart are closing more stores — see if your store is on the list Loading video...

Iconic hip-hop group Run DMC has filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Stores Inc., Jet.com and other retailers for utilizing their name without permission. According to TMZ, Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run DMC Brand LLC, is seeking at least $50 million of damages from the retailers and other defendants. According to the lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday, December 29, the infringing materials that have allegedly been marketed and sold by the mega retailers are "too numerous to properly list." The products include fedora hats and square-frame sunglasses that use the group's name in their titles or descriptions. Meanwhile, other products, such as T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items, use the group's famous logo. The group asserts that the giant retailers are "trading on the goodwill" of the band and confusing consumers by "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products with the logo." Thus, they make people believe that the band endorses their products. The lawsuit cites that the Run DMC brand is "extremely valuable," and it becomes the object of several licensing agreements, including a $1.6 million deal with Adidas AG. It also states that the brand has produced revenue in excess of $100 million from the intellectual property associated with "Run DMC" trademark since the band was founded in 1981. Both the companies and McDaniels' lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comments. © AceShowbiz.com More Run DMC News Run DMC to Be Honored With Lifetime Achievement Award at 2016 Grammys   Jan 14, 2016 Aerosmith and Run DMC Perform 'Walk This Way'   Jul 26, 2012 Run DMC to Reunite at Fun Fun Fun Fest in November   Jul 11, 2012 DMC Would Love to Be Lil Wayne's Opening Act   Apr 03, 2009 Metallica, Run DMC Made 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees   Jan 15, 2009 More Recent Articles Baby No. 3 on the Way?

Honest Ed’s, Toronto's discount landmark, closes Saturday.  (Marcus Oleniuk/Toronto Star / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Edward KeenanColumnist Sat., Dec. 31, 2016 Towards the very end of Honest Ed’s long goodbye — more than three years after the store closing was announced, and about two weeks before its final checkout — we took the kids on a pilgrimage, introducing them to the longtime Toronto institution just so they could bid it farewell. “The best part of it was the signs,” my 5-year old daughter said when it was all done and we had exited into Mirvish Village to shop for comic books. And if she wasn’t 100 per cent right, by the end, she wasn’t far off. The signs, starting with the instantly recognizable 1,000-points-of-light marquee spelling out the name across the width of an entire blinking city block, defining the vista of the Annex for generations. And in around those light bulbs, those eccentrically punctuated, terrible puns: “Honest Ed’s a monkey! ‘You can buy his bargains for peanuts!!’” And down beneath: “Don’t just stand there, ‘buy something’!!” By the end, if we’re being candid, if you were actually looking to buy something, there were better places to do it, and plenty of them. Once upon a time, in a city whose retail landscape was dominated by staid WASPy surnames like Simpson and Eaton, Ed Mirvish virtually invented the discount retail store in this place, and it was a lifeline to generations of students and immigrants and people in plain old hard times. This is a story we know well by now — through roughly 41 months of retrospectives anticipating the store’s closing, we’ve all had time to reflect on the generous turkey giveaways, the long lineups for the door crasher giveaway sales, the business that boomed from one tiny storefront to take over the block and anchor a theatre and restaurant empire. By now, Dollarama is cheaper, Wal-Mart typically offers better quality merchandise and more consistent selection, and both of those conglomerates have many locations much closer to where today’s immigrant and impoverished populations typically live. It’s hard to imagine anyone is going to miss Honest Ed’s because they cannot get what they used to buy there somewhere else, for as good a price. Article Continued Below But my goodness, those places are not Honest Ed’s. They have the stuff, mostly better stuff, and they have the prices, but they don’t have the signs: “Come in and get lost” they said over the door, and if you did, you would. We wandered around inside with the kids for about an hour, up and down dusty stairwells, through rooms and into other rooms, across the bridge over the alley, poking our heads into rooms closed now that stock had been liquidated and consolidated. Ladies wear, sporting goods, housewares, antique oddities, groceries — hey, a dentist, an optometrist, a pharmacy … why not? It was a maze of a store like nothing you find in a mall, improvised through successive renovations and additions to create a feeling more carnival funhouse than merchandising science, with jokes and old theatre posters scattered wherever they would fit. Other stores had better stuff, at better prices, but Ed's had the hand-painted signs.  (Rick Madonik)   Eventually we came again to the signs — the interior ones this time, for sale as souvenirs. “Christmas Tea Towels $1.19 ea.,” “Men’s / Ladies / Teens Velcro Closure Fashion Shoes $4.99,” “Ladies or Misses Fancy Panties 99¢” and so on. Each of them hand painted by an employee of the store in red, blue and yellow — as all the interior signage was, right up to the very end. Each a unique piece of individual labour. You don’t find that at Wal-Mart. You don’t find that anywhere. This, this is what many of us will feel is lost when the doors finally close for the last time on Dec. 31. A place, a landmark, that was one-of-a-kind and custom made, from its blockbusting construction right on down to its price tags. You can buy the same stuff anywhere. Yet this store that sold it here was an eccentric reflection of its founder’s personality and humour, it’s own gradual evolution, the care and effort of its staff. Maybe I’ve noted this before — of Ed’s, of the now scrapped Captain John’s Seafood ship, of Sam The Record Man — but it seems an inescapable feeling for some of us as we watch the city change and grow, often in good, healthy ways: Something is shifting, something essential about what Toronto was is being replaced by something else, what Toronto will be. Ed’s is an especially large and glaring example of a city that was cheap and sort of tacky and mostly tacked together haphazardly, but was unembarrassed by it, and was practical and audacious in its grand ambitions at the same time. And Ed’s was an especially on-the-nose holdover from a Toronto full of places that offered an experience unique in the world. We don’t necessarily just miss these places we haven’t patronized for years for what they were, but for what they weren’t: generic outposts of the great global blah that makes eating or shopping or strolling a homogenous experience in major cities spanning the continent and much of the world. The residential apartment and retail store complex slated to replace Honest Ed’s promises to be something different from the glass-wall condo template that dominates much of the city now. We’ll see. It’s hard to believe it will be as different from anything else as what it is replacing. “There’s no place like this place, anyplace!” the sign on the corner of the building says, and for 68 years it wasn’t quite true, because there was this one place, right here. And now there won’t be. We bought one of those hand-painted signs as a souvenir, “Ladies and Misses Fashion Dresses $35.” The signs weren’t exactly the very best part, but it’s a fitting symbol of something worth remembering: it’s bright and direct and there is not another one quite like it in the world.

She has worked as a producer, writer and reporter at CBC bureaus across Canada since 2008. Related Stories Take a final tour of Honest Ed's with David Mirvish Community hopeful black heritage will remain in Mirvish Village Don't just stand there! Last chance to visit Honest Ed's Why losing Mirvish Village is like losing a piece of Toronto By its own admission on a sign on its pulsing, lit-up facade, "there's no place" like Honest Ed's, "anyplace." Now, after 68 years in business, the Toronto discount store that boasted about price-cutting, decades before Walmart, is closing. The building, with its famously bright signage and aggressive marketing of rock-bottom prices, was sold by the family of former owner and theatre mogul Ed Mirvish in 2013 to developer Westbank, which plans to rebuild the area. 'It's kind of sad' to see the store go, says Dwayne Batchelor, who has been coming to Honest Ed's since he was a child. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) Today is the last chance for customers to hunt for bargains at Honest Ed's, which has long sold everything from white socks to canned tuna, and has maintained a timeless presence as Canada's biggest city has evolved in countless ways around it. After 68 years in business, Honest Ed's closes its doors on New Year's Eve. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) "You could certainly go so far as to say that this is an iconic Canadian business," says Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet. Like many Torontonians, Stephens' first experience in the store was as a child. "I remember it being some sort of fantastical emporium," he says. Stephens attributes its lasting success to the Mirvish family's involvement in the business as well as their sense of community, giving out free turkeys every Christmas to lineups of customers. "They had a really clear sense of who they were," he says. The store's prominent location at the midtown corner of Bloor and Bathurst streets also helped, he says. "You might argue that it bordered on garish, but it worked. Whether they intended it to or not, it became an iconic part of the city."  Torontonians capture photos of Honest Ed's famously garish sign as the retailer prepares to close. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) In its final 24 hours, the store's display tables are piled high with bits of its own history, as shoppers line up to purchase — or simply photograph — a piece of Honest Ed's. A big draw was the store's hand-painted sales signs advertising "Ed's bargains" such as ladies' "fashion tops" for a reasonable $2.99. Among the sparse bits of actual merchandise left, one woman found a coffee mug with the logo of another historic Toronto landmark, SkyDome, long since renamed Rogers Centre. The teller charged her 99 cents. Until now, it's been unlawful to remove these bags from Honest Ed's. Today, they're for sale. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) Now sifting through old store signs with his own young family, Dwayne Batchelor recalls how the store's commitment to bargains had a real impact on his childhood. "My parents were immigrants. They came from Jamaica, so this place allowed them to get things that they couldn't afford otherwise," he says. "It's kind of sad to see it being torn down, to be honest with you." To others, it was the glowing exterior of the building that has left its biggest mark. "It's going to be kind of sad that it's going to be dark," says shopper Michael Hopper. "In a way, it's like a theatre that's dimming its lights." The Toronto Transit Commission pays homage to Honest Ed's at its nearby Bathurst subway station with a display of the store's hand-painted signs. (Sarah Bridge/CBC) "People are so used to it being bright, and when you're driving from afar you know you're near Honest Ed's because it brightens up the corner," says Daiva Kryzanauskas. Having shopped at the store since she was a child in the 1960s, Kryzanauskas says she hopes the new development maintains some of the community feeling the store built in the neighbourhood. She says, "You won't have the big store to go to, but you can hang out where the icon was." 'It's going to be kind of sad that it's going to be dark,' says shopper Michael Hopper.

Print Email Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com By Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 31, 2016 at 4:33 AM comments Target stores will be busy all weekend, as the giant retailer hopes to go toe-to-toe with Walmart and snag everyone from last-minute party shoppers to those with a little extra holiday cash burning a hole in their pockets. Here's a closer look at hours for Target across the three-day weekend as we put 2016 in the books and start 2017 with a three-day weekend: New Year's Eve, Saturday, Dec. 31: Most Target stores will be closing at 9 p.m. EST on New Year's Eve.  New Year's Day, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017: Stores reopen Sunday morning at 8 and will be open until 9 p.m., giving everyone a nice window to get some shopping taken care of AND still feast on the final day of the NFL regular season. Monday, January 2, 2017 (federal holiday): Most Target stores will follow their regular hours on Monday, even though it is the first federal holiday of the year. So if you need to get your week started with a dash to Target, stores will be opening at 8 a.m. It's always smart to check hours before heading out and you can do that with the Target store locator. Find the Target store closest to you and search opening and closing hours at any Target store with this tool. If you need stores that are open 24/7 or later than Target on New Year's Eve, here's a guide to stores that have extended hours or will be open all night.   Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

McDaniels says in his lawsuit that the rap act’s brand is “extremely valuable.” Comments aAFont Size One of the founding members of Run-DMC filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Jet.com, Amazon.com and other retailers Thursday, claiming the companies are selling products bearing the rap group's name without permission. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York by Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, one of the founding members of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand. The complaint accuses the companies of trademark dilution by "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products claiming to be Run-DMC styled products," while other items being sold directly infringe on a trademark registered in 2007. The lawsuit said the products are too numerous to list, but include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches and wallets. "It looks like they're attacking everybody all at once," said Martin Thoma, a principal at Little Rock brand leadership firm Thoma Thoma and author of Branding Like the Big Boys. "They want to force Amazon and Wal-Mart and any of these other e-retailers to strip any nonauthorized logo wear or products out of their website." Run-DMC was founded by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell in New York City in 1981. The influential group produced hits like It's Tricky and My Adidas. In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. McDaniels said in the complaint the Run-DMC brand is "extremely valuable," producing more than $100 million in revenue based on music sales, publishing, concerts, merchandise and endorsement deals since the 1980s. Run-DMC has entered several licensing agreements for use of the trademark, including a $1.6 million endorsement deal with Adidas. The lawsuit claims the actions of the defendants have confused consumers into believing the group has endorsed their products and it also accuses the companies of diluting the Run-DMC brand. Mark Henry, a registered patent attorney with the Henry Law Firm in Fayetteville, said establishing that a mark is famous is key to qualifying for anti-dilution damages. "They're showing how famous it is, how distinctive it is, how it's recognizable and how it has value," Henry said after looking through the lawsuit. "They're meeting all the elements." [EMAIL UPDATES: Sign up for free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines] The lawsuit claims the retailers are "trading on the goodwill" of the group and have profited on the trademark for at least three years. Run-DMC will "suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage" if the companies do not stop selling the products because they're infringing on a trademark, causing confusion and continuing to utilize the mark in bad faith. In addition to Wal-Mart, Jet.com and Amazon, McDaniels identifies Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global. The lawsuit said all three are Amazon business partners. Twenty additional companies are simply referred to as "John Does." McDaniels provided 13 pages of exhibits showing Run-DMC-labeled products being sold on Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Jet.com in the complaint. Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com this year. The items listed on Walmart.com include a Run-DMC soccer T-shirt, hooded sweatshirt and logo T-shirt sold and shipped by Minnesota's Rockabilia. Other products that appear on Walmart.com and are included in the lawsuit's exhibits are shipped and sold by Old Glory and Gravity Trading Inc. Wal-Mart did not return a message seeking comment about the lawsuit Friday. Neither did Christopher Brown, a Boston attorney who filed the complaint. Thoma said it's no surprise to see McDaniels take legal action against the companies. "The position of Run-DMC has to be to defend its trademark," Thoma said. "Anybody who registers a trademark does it because they understand the value of that intellectual property. A lot of times the only way to defend it is in the courts."

Photo by Dan Henry /Times Free Press. You would think Erlanger would have learned some lessons by now about management bonuses and the timing of them. But apparently not. Once again, dozens of Erlanger Health System's managers will divide about $3.1 million in "incentive pay," according to hospital executives. Word of the bonuses came one week after Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke pledged $1 million in city taxpayer money for a new children's hospital — a decision he reached after watching Erlanger's response to the Nov. 21 Woodmore bus crash, when nearly three dozen schoolchildren were rushed to the Children's Hospital emergency room. Six children were killed in the accident. "We had first responders, doctors, nurses, and administrators who poured their hearts and souls into caring for these children and their families," Berke said. But the hospital ER's crowded conditions meant critically injured patients and their families were forced to share a large common space "only separated by a curtain, where families could hear what others are saying, what's going on with a child." No one doubts the need for improved facilities at the East Third Street hospital, and in fact Erlanger is already in the middle of a campaign to raise $40 million for just the initial phase of the new hospital — an outpatient facility, not a new Children's ER. (The stated thinking is that outpatient offices drive revenue to help fund a new ER.) But doesn't anyone question what $3.1 million in top manager bonuses says to City Council members who still have to approve Berke's pledge? Does anyone question what $3.1 million in top manager bonuses says to Joe and Jane Public who are now being actively solicited for donations to this clear need? What does it say to Walmart stores that raised $195,586 for Children's Hospital just this month — the same month that Erlanger CEO Kevin Spiegel, for example, will receive about a 34 percent bonus on his salary of $800,386, or about $272,130 extra dollars? To be sure, Spiegel and his managers deserve kudos. After all, Erlanger was in dire financial straits when Spiegel arrived nearly four years ago. The hospital lost $36 million between 2008 and 2013, then earned $11.3 million in 2014 and $37.3 million in 2015. But it's worth adding here, too, that no small portion of the increased revenue Erlanger earned came from the fact that more people now have access to health care insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2015, Erlanger officials said the hospital boosted patient admissions by 9.4 percent and reported an increase in the number of surgeries by more than 7 percent. Where do we think that came from? It came from the jump in Tennessee residents who gained insurance. Erlanger did well. And so did the ACA — better known as Obamacare. The uninsured rate in Tennessee has fallen by 28 percent since the ACA was enacted in 2010, according to state and federal reports. We mentioned lessons Erlanger might have learned by now. Take for instance the one trustees should have learned in 2014 when they voted to pay out $1.7 million to 99 top managers. That vote came as an unsettling surprise to our local legislative delegation that had gone to the mat in Nashville and Washington for Erlanger to get $19 million in federal funding to save the hospital system from disaster. Local lawmakers went into hyperventilation mode and forced trustees to vote on the bonuses again in May. Ultimately nothing changed, of course, except that the hospital lost out on some other legislation they'd hoped lawmakers would pass for them. Just a few months later, Erlanger board members voted to pay out another $2.1 million in incentive pay to its then-top 124 executives for 2015. If you're keeping count, that's an average top manager bonus of about $16,900 in 2014, $17,200 in 2015, and $19,200 in 2016. But, hey, a couple of million here, another couple there and $3 million in a third year — that's chump change. Chump change for what could have been $7 million toward that new Children's Hospital instead became bonuses — a business expense defended with talk about fending off talent "competition." In the corporate world's top management levels, that may hold water. But most people work for salaries, not five-figure yearly bonuses. And frankly far too many Hamilton County residents don't even make in a year what those bonuses average. We truly hope Erlanger does well with its fundraising effort to build a new Children's Hospital, and we share the concern that the Children's ER facility needs vast improvement. But perhaps next year, the reward for those truly dedicated and truly already high-paid managers might be a multimillion-dollar boost to that cause itself — not to them.

(Photo: Jerry Lemenu, Special to the Fre) What's in a name? For Detroit terrorism suspect Sebastian Gregerson, apparently a lot, if his recent court filing is any indication. The 29-year-old defendant in a case involving grenades and explosives is trying to get the alias name "Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl" deleted from his indictment, claiming he only used the name "on a whim" on  Facebook and that he uses his real name for everything else: his driver's license, paychecks, college courses, household bills and gun purchases. Not exactly, argues the federal government, which claims that Gregerson has used the alias "Abdurrahman" a lot more than he claims, and that the name connects him to the ISIL terrorist group and the crimes that he's charged with: having explosives and plotting to use them to kill people. Related stories: DETROIT FREE PRESS Indictment: Detroit man planned to kill with explosives DETROIT FREE PRESS FBI: CDs bearing radical cleric's name found in Detroit home "The defendant used this alias with social media and e-mail accounts that evidence his support of and identification with ISIL and which reveal communications with like-minded ISIL supporters," federal prosecutors wrote in a filing Friday, urging the court to let the alias stick on the indictment, which jurors will see. According to courtroom testimony, Gregerson converted to Islam more than a decade ago, after graduating from high school in Ann Arbor. He has worked at Target and Walmart, and taken courses at Henry Ford Community College. Gregerson, a gun enthusiast, military buff and married father of twins with no criminal history, has been jailed since July when authorities say he bought grenades from an undercover FBI agent at a Monroe gas station. The FBI started watching him after a tipster two years ago claimed that Gregerson had repeatedly expressed  support for ISIL, wanted to permanently move his family to ISIL-held territory and claimed to possess grenades. The tip triggered an investigation that led to an indictment, charging Gregerson with — among other things — obtaining  explosive materials with the intent of using them to kill and injure people. The indictment does not say who Gregerson allegedly intended to kill and injure and makes no mention of terrorism. But after Gregerson asked a judge to release him on bond and let him live with his family  pending the outcome of his trial — a request that is still pending  —  federal prosecutors started to disclose more details about his alleged ties to ISIL in an effort to keep him locked up. "The defendant is a supporter of the terrorist organization, Islamic State of Iraq and the levant (ISIL), and he acquired the explosives and other weapons to prepare to engage in violent acts aligned with ISIL," federal prosecutors wrote in a Dec. 22 filing. They also noted that Gregerson has been indicted in Virginia on charges that he bought two firearms in straw purchases. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors also are fighting to keep the alias "Abdurrahman" on the indictment, which jurors will see when the case goes to trial. According to the government's filing, Gregerson used the alias "Abdurrahman" in the following ways: * In numerous e-mail communications with ISIL supporters, Gregerson signed his e-mails, 'Abdurrahman,' " * He was known by friends and family as "Abdurrahman," including his wife, who called him "Abdurrahman" in text messages and had him listed in her telephone contact list as "Abdurrahman." * He created an e-mail account in the name of "Abdurrahman Gregerson" and sent several e-mails to ISIL supporters in which he praised ISIL actions and wrote in the subject heading of the e-mail "Allahu akbar" which means "God is great." In an e-mail sent March 19, Gregerson had the symbol of a smiling face in the subject line; the body of the e-mail was an article about an ISIL suicide bombing that killed 13 Egyptian policemen. "The defendant's Facebook posts also indicated the defendant's support for ISIL," prosecutors wrote. For example, prosecutors cited a Nov. 14, 2015 Facebook post — the day after the Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people — in which Gregerson "indicated ... that the attacks were legitimate and that the 'world is at war' " they wrote in court documents. According to court documents, Gregerson's public profile Facebook page in June 2015 used the name "Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl" and displayed men on horseback, armed and dressed for battle, carrying the black ISIL flag. His Facebook profile page as of May 3, 2016, showed a single horseman carrying the ISIL flag. Gregerson's attorney, David Tholen, has long argued that the government is "overstating its case" and hasn't produced evidence that his client was planning a violent attack. He has argued that his client is a gun enthusiast and hunter who lawfully purchased his weapons. "Defendant denies ever stating that he wanted to move to an ISIL-controlled country or that he ever had grenades or a bazooka," Tholen has argued in court documents. "Possession of any grenades or bazooka was disproved when the government searched (Gregerson's) residence and found neither." As for his Facebook profile name, Tholen wrote: "He created it on a whim and has never used that name in any formal or informal interactions between institutions or individuals. 'Bin Mikaayl' is homage to his father and translates to 'son of Michael.' " And as for any comments or e-mails that Gregerson allegedly made about the conflict in the Muslim world, "while inflammatory," it's protected speech, Tholen wrote. And the government's claim that he possessed "grenade components is accurate but very misleading," he wrote. "Clearly, (Gregerson) possessed ammunition and the ammunition contained components which could be utilized to make explosives. However, (he) never attempted to make any explosives from dismantling his ammunition nor did he possess any manuals on how to do such things," Tholen wrote.

For the first time, it can ship grain directly from Ohio to feed the pigs that Smithfield slaughters at its Tar Heel, North Carolina, packing plant - the world's largest, processing about 32,000 hogs daily.   Smithfield now buys 65 percent of its animal feed directly from farmers, up from the 10 percent of feed it directly bought in 2010. The direct buying strategy aims to lower feed costs and could provide a model for other large meat companies that still largely rely on commercial grain handlers, such as Chicago-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. Grain can account for up to 60 percent of Smithfield's costs. The company's expenses in 2015 totaled $4.67 billion.   In 2014, Smithfield canceled a grain handling contract with CHS Inc, the largest U.S. farmer-owned cooperative, which had previously supplied a Smithfield feed mill in Yuma, Colorado. Smithfield has canceled contracts with other smaller grain handlers since 2010.   "They take the Walmart approach and go right to the source," said a CHS Inc employee who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. A CHS spokeswoman declined to comment.   Smithfield also aims to work directly with farmers to influence farm management, from crop rotations to fertilizer and fungicide applications that could result in higher-quality grain that speeds weight gain in hogs. Smithfield could have a say in the seeds that are planted for the grain to feed the hogs it slaughters to produce the pork it sells.   "In a dirt-to-fork story, you have to start with the dirt," said Joe Kerns, president of animal agriculture consulting firm Kerns Associates. "This is the first foray."   Smithfield, purchased by China's WH Group in 2013 for $4.9 billion, plans to continue reducing reliance on grain handlers, said Robbie Montgomery, Smithfield's grain origination manager. "That's key to our strategy, our farmer relationships. It's not us buying from a dealer; it's us buying from a farmer," Montgomery said.   Smithfield's push to go directly to farmers comes as ADM, Cargill and other leading grain handlers are facing sharp drops in corn and soy prices following record-large U.S. harvests. Handlers make money buying, selling, storing, transporting and processing grains around the world, typically earning small profit margins on each bushel they trade.   Trading fees for commercial grain handling can run to 20 cents a bushel in tight-supply markets, but drop to just a few pennies when grain prices are low. Juan Luciano, chief executive officer for ADM in an August conference call said weak margins in grain handling contributed to a 26 percent fall in profits during the second quarter, before revenues improved in the third quarter.   He did not mention Smithfield in particular, and ADM declined comment on its relationship with Smithfield. Cargill did not respond to requests for comment on Smithfield's efforts to bypass grain handlers.   U.S. farmers built up their elevator storage to better control their harvest, and hold back supplies when prices are low, cutting in to profits for handlers. In the last quarter of 2016, ADM and others have tried to make up reduced returns on grain trading in the U.S. by selling grain overseas and making money on storage of abundant U.S. supplies.   The Smithfield move alone is probably not enough to hurt the big grain handlers immediately, said Kerns, the agriculture consultant. Smithfield is a long way from quitting the big grain handlers altogether, and still relies on ADM and Cargill to crush soybeans into soy meal, an animal feed.   But such companies could lose substantial business if other meat producers follow Smithfield's lead, and smaller grain handlers are already feeling the impact. Smithfield in 2015 exited a 20-year relationship with MaxYield Cooperative in Algona, in northern Iowa. MaxYield previously supplied a Smithfield-owned feed mill in Algona that can grind 50,000 bushels of corn per day.   "They want control from the ground up," said Karl Setzer, MaxYield's risk management team leader, who was told by Smithfield that the company was not renewing its contract. Setzer declined to comment on how the loss of the contract affected MaxYield's business.   Smithfield buys about 150 million bushels of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum per year to feed its 16 million hogs, according to a Smithfield spokeswomen. "Smithfield has always been uneasy about their dependence on feed," said Chris Hurt, an agriculture economist at Purdue University who has advised the hog industry.   The company also is using a port it helped build in 2002, in Wilmington, North Carolina, to import feed from South America and Europe. It has imported soy from Brazil and Argentina and feed wheat from Europe when it is cheaper than supplies shipped out of the Midwest, most recently with a bulk vessel of Brazilian corn that arrived in June.   Smithfield's vice president for business development, Joe Szaloky, said the company has become a savvy buyer. "We think we can buy from farmers just as well as anyone else can," he said.

Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Welcome back to Parental Advisory, where I answer all of your social media and IRL parenting etiquette questions. This week, let's acknowledge the tension that can arise when a friend has a new baby and seemingly falls off the planet. Here is one woman's example, but how many people have related to this feeling at some point in their adult lives? Question:  "I don't have kids, so I'm curious what the 'normal' or 'correct' etiquette is in this situation. My good friend of 20 years just had her first baby. Before she delivered, I told her I would be respectful and wait for her to invite me over to visit when she is ready. I bought a bag full of expensive baby gifts and tucked it away in my closet. She had the baby and she sent a few pics. I checked in every so often to see how she was feeling. Waited. Waited. Nothing. Several weeks went by and I had not heard from her, other than "we're doing good." So I started asking friends how long do new moms usually keep visitors away? I was told it can be up to two weeks. Friends suggested maybe she was waiting for me to ask to come by. Even though we discussed it, maybe she had baby brain and forgot our conversation. I started to get worried, I didn't want her to think just because I don't have kids, I am not interested or supportive of hers. After a month, it happened to also be Christmas time. So I texted her and said I had some gifts for the baby, would it be okay to come by and drop them off sometime in the next few weeks? She said it was fine. We made plans for me to stop by one day after work. She mentioned it had to be a specific day because she was taking the baby out of town that weekend to her mother-in-law's. I thought nothing of it. I got to her house (an hour and a half drive) and she was sitting on the sofa with the baby on a big pillow on her lap. I come in and sit down, we start chatting... She does not acknowledge the GIANT gift bag, nor does she offer to let me hold the baby (who is now six weeks old). I ended up sitting with the cat on my lap instead. An hour goes by, I say I need to get going, and ask her if she wants to open her gift. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD. She says, "I have the baby, so why don't you open it for me?" I said, "Why don't you trade me and I'll hold the baby for a few minutes?" She says, "Well, I know you don't like kids... Maybe I'll just put him on the sofa." I said, "Obviously I will love YOUR kid! I've been dying to hold him since I got here!" She says, "Okay, maybe just for a minute." And places the baby — pillow and all — on my lap. She opens the gift bag, looks over the little outfits I had selected with love and care, and mentions they may be too small. I wanted to point out that they were purchased before Snowflake was born and perhaps had I been able to come by sooner, it would not have been a wasted gift. Also, they were not Newborn size, they were 3-6mo. I did my best. She then proceeds to tell me all about the very expensive and extravagant gifts her other friends gave her, making my little outfits and stuffed animals look like Walmart clearance bin items. I asked her what she had been up to and she started complaining about how she just wanted time alone with her baby and all these people keep dropping by. She said, "Don't people understand, if I want you to come over, I'll call you and invite you over?!" She said she had not invited anyone over to see the baby yet, and the only people who had seen him were people who'd invited themselves. I asked her how long she felt she wanted to have with the baby before having company, and she said she wanted him to be on a set schedule, and sleeping through the night before people started coming over. I asked how long that takes, and she said (without blinking) "up to 6 months." So, I guess if I had not asked to come over, I was not going to hear from her for 6 months?? I drove home feeling like my best friend had been taken over by aliens. I guess we're not friends anymore. She made it pretty clear that our 20 years of sleepovers, vacations, proms, spa days, and movie nights have been forgotten in the wake of this 7lb. meatloaf. But really, is this normal? Will it pass, or is she just out of my life now? Is there really not enough room for both of us in her world? I don't understand how having a baby is a get-out-of-jail-free card for turning your back on the people who have stood by you and loved you your whole life. And I'm sure if I say anything, I'll get the ol' 'You need to understand I'm a MOTHER now.' Or, 'I have a BABY.' I'm trying to be a supportive friend during this new chapter in her life, like I have been through everything else. Why would a baby be any different?? And WHY IS SHE ACTING SO CRAZY??" — A. Answer: When a couple has a baby, they tend to fall into one of two camps: Either they're eager to introduce their little one to friends and family (and neighbors and coworkers too) within the first few weeks or they're a bit standoffish for the first few months. There's no magic formula, and the reasons for being standoffish can range from feeling paranoid about germs to being drained of energy and not knowing when to request that people come over. I have a feeling, based on your email, A., that your friend might be going through a bit of the latter. She doesn't sound depressed or even especially overwhelmed, but her mentioning that she'd rather have her baby on a sleep schedule before having guests over suggests to me that she might be a type A personality, and having a baby has thrown her into a world of accelerated chaos. She can't yet anticipate when the baby will cry, sleep, poop or eat (the four things babies are capable of doing), and it might be making her kind of nuts. Or maybe she's enjoying figuring out this whole parenting thing, but she'd rather do it without anyone hovering around her. For parents of preemies, having friends over is a huge deal because it means the baby is healthy enough to be around people, which can take some time. In the case of your friend, A., it sounds like she's the one getting used to the new adjustment. The baby is perfectly healthy, but your friend might be on edge and in need of some extended solo time. It's ironic, because within a year, she'll probably be posting things like this online: Image: STFU Parents That said, you're a great friend for being so supportive and wanting to be there for her. You've shown an interest in meeting the baby, holding the baby and giving the baby gifts, and you were willing to drive over an hour each way just to do so. She and the baby are lucky to have you in their lives. But no matter how much you want to show her you're interested, the way things will play out from here is (somewhat irritatingly) based more on her than it is on you. Here is my advice — pure and simple #RealTalk — based on my personal experiences with friends with babies, in the form of a handy list. How to deal with old friends who have new babies (especially if you don't have kids yourself): 1. Get the baby a gift. Do not expect the parent(s) to notice or take extra appreciation of the fact that you bought the baby the expensive shit. Unfortunately, parents only notice when you get the baby cheap shit (because the baby's skin is sensitive or the toy is made of cheap plastic, etc.). I'm not saying parents won't notice that the super-trendy socks you got their infant cost as much as a week's worth of groceries, but they will likely not say anything about it. I, too, buy pricey baby gifts for my friends and have learned that it's not worth asking myself if I should've just bought a single onesie from Target versus the 900 other items I purchased. I can only assume the gift will be appreciated, even if I'm never made aware of it. Some parents will handwrite thank you cards. Some will take pictures of their baby wearing the expensive socks you bought. Others will never mention your gifts again and you just have to live with that. Regarding when to give the gift: Always try to pass along the gift before the baby is born. After that, things get hectic, as you've learned, A., when trying to negotiate a time to come by. Pre-baby gifts are cherished and cause excitement. Post-baby gifts are cherished and cause some excitement, but not nearly as much excitement as parents feel when staring into the eyes of their young, perfect progeny. (Barf.) So try to get your gift in early. Also, when in doubt, size up. Newborn onesies last, like, 48 hours according to most new parents, so starting at 3 to 6 months for clothing size is smart. I have no idea why your friend said your 3- to 6-month options might be too big. In my mind, there's no way they're too big, so maybe she was just throwing a defensive remark your way out of resentment for having a visitor. That's pretty uncool, but since she's a hormonal new mom, you're supposed to forgive her. (Barf x 2) [P.S.: You don't have to forgive her if you don't feel like it.] 2. Speaking of hormones, postpartum depression can be harder for new moms to discuss than they let on. I have a large handful of friends who occasionally comment on the first year of parenthood as being shockingly depressing or hormonally difficult, but they certainly weren't acting that way (in person or online) during that first year because they weren't ready to admit it. If your friend experiences emotional ups and downs or seems to be pushing you away or ignoring you, it's always a possibility that she's feeling blue. It's also possible that you're feeling blue for your own reasons and need her for emotional support too. If that happens, just tell her so. You'll feel better. If she seems sad or irrationally angry, ask her about it. 3. Be prepared for your friend to find new-mom friends with whom she can take classes, schedule playdates and commiserate. You and your friend have shared history, including prom, sleepovers, first boyfriends, etc., and no one can take that away from you, but this baby stuff isn't the same. You can still be best friends, but your friend will inevitably form a posse of parents on whom she can rely for parenting-specific issues and/or babysitting trade-offs. It doesn't mean you're any less important to her; try to think of it more like someone who's in law school and now spends most of her time with classmates studying. Parents are only up their own asses and the asses of their children for the first few years or so. If your friendship has sustained 20 years already, you still have many more years of friendship to come down the line. 4. We should probably all accept that some parents are willing to have friends over to meet the baby sooner than others. Our expectations should be reduced to essentially nothing. Is this annoying? Hell, yes, it's annoying. You can't rely on people with newborn babies as much as you can rely people who don't have newborn babies — this is a fact, and it can be frustrating. But it's also reality, so try not to take a friend's disappearing act too personally. She might even be jealous of you getting regular eight-hour intervals of sleep and not dealing with milk-filled boobs or wiping a baby's ass half a dozen times a day. Of course, she'd never say this. She'd rather talk about how much she loves being a mom or imply that motherhood is superior to being childless. But the truth is, the amount of love that's gained by having a baby is in direct proportion to the amount of sleep that's lost. That inverse relationship is one you don't have to contend with, A., and I say savor and enjoy it. Besides, it might be worth celebrating that your friend isn't the type to post those obnoxious "visitation rules" signs on Facebook. Those people are the worst, and you can rest easier knowing your friend registers several notches above that. Image: STFU Parents 5. Finally, to address the real heart of your question — "Why do some parents act so CRAZY after the baby is born??" — all I can say is that some people pop out a kid and think the world should suddenly revolve around them, and some people don't. None of us can fully prepare for the changes our friends will go through when they become parents because it's hard to predict. I've had some friends turn into near-strangers. Others morphed into uptight, preachy jerks seemingly overnight, and now all they do is whine on Facebook about daylight savings time. I've also watched as some friends become more relaxed, more able to enjoy life and maybe even make more room in their lives for friends and family (kids or not!), which has been a delightful surprise. Hopefully, your friend will tell you how much she appreciates your gifts and the time it took for you to get them to her, A. If she doesn't, it'll be disappointing, but it doesn't have to be the end of your friendship. Some people just need time to adjust to parenthood and get back to their old selves again, while others keep changing until they're practically unrecognizable... and you won't want to be friends with them anymore anyway.

East Oregonian Published on December 30, 2016 4:58PM Last changed on December 30, 2016 8:55PM Hermiston’s new bus system is ready to pick up its first passengers on Tuesday. The HART — short for Hermiston Area Regional Transit — will run around the city from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is free and open to anyone. The route has 33 stops and is scheduled to stop at each four times during the day. Stops include the Stafford Hansell Government Building, Good Shepherd Medical Center, Wal-Mart, Safeway and downtown. Passengers can also connect to the Hermiston Hopper, which runs between Hermiston, Pendleton, Umatilla, Stanfield and Irrigon. The full schedule can be found on the city of Hermiston’s website at hermiston.or.us. The system is run by Kayak Public Transit in partnership with the city of Hermiston. It will be paid for by a combination of city general fund dollars and grants. The HART will not replace the senior and disabled taxi ticket program that the city also runs. Assistant city manager Mark Morgan said the city views the schedule and route as a “starting point.” The public transit committee will meet with Kayak Public Transit quarterly to make adjustments based on customer feedback. “Frankly, public transit is expensive, and this new service represents a major commitment of additional annual funding toward public transit by the city council,” Morgan said in a news release. “So please understand that we view these operating hours as a starting point for a public transit system that we hope will grow in to a long-term sustainable service for the community well in to the future.” Share and Discuss Guidelines User Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The caller claimed that he was now charged with drunk driving and that the other car involved had a pregnant woman inside. The victim was then put through to someone claiming to be the woman's attorney, who negotiated a $2,500 payment that was made in the form of a Moneygram obtained at the Mayfield Walmart and sent to a woman in Boston for processing. The $2,500 Moneygram was picked up within 10 minutes in Massachusetts, and police are now looking for leads in the scam. Identity theft, fraud; Shaker Boulevard: A resident, 66, reported Dec. 27 that someone had been making fraudulent charges on his Discover Card in recent months, all of which were negated after investigation. This was followed by bogus charges on his United Airlines credit card, which were also cleared by the company's frauds investigation unit. The latest notification came from Bank of America, which informed him that they still had a few questions about his Small Business Credit line recently opened for a landscaping firm in Florida. He told them that he had a few questions too, since he knew nothing about it. The man believes that the problems date back to security breaches of his personal information through the Veterans' Affairs Department, as well as his security clearance with the federal government. Identity theft, fraud; Gates Mills Boulevard: A resident, 64, reported Dec. 28 that fraudulent accounts had been opened in her name at The Gap, Home Depot and Amazon.com. She said that when she received a copy of her credit report, she found two telephone numbers that were not hers. Mutual aid, Fairmount Boulevard: Responding to a call for assistance from Beachwood police following a hit-skip accident at Richmond Road and Fairmount about 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 28, an officer pursued a light blue Honda Odyssey eastbound on Fairmount and attempted to make a traffic stop. But as the van was driving erratically while fleeing, the officer made note of the correct license plate number and abandoned pursuit when the suspect doubled back onto westbound Cedar Road and into heavier traffic. Runaways, Chagrin Boulevard: Staff at the New Directions drug treatment facility reported that two boys in treatment -- ages 15 and 16, from Avon Lake and Cleveland, respectively -- had left the facility around 10 a.m. on Dec. 29. Police learned they were returned by one of their mothers about four hours later. -- The same Cleveland boy, 16, had walked off from New Directions on Dec. 26 and was returned the next day by his mother. Found property, Lombardy and North Deer Creek lanes: Someone turned in a prescription bottle of Adderall found in the snow on or around Dec. 23. It was placed in the evidence room for safekeeping. Warrant served, South Woodland Road: A Cleveland woman, 45, was stopped Dec. 23 on a warrant for failure to pay fines. She was taken to the Beachwood Jail and released on personal recognizance with a Payment Ability Hearing to be scheduled in court.

These dividend giants have fallen on tough times, and that could spell opportunity for patient investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Dec 30, 2016 at 5:54PM Image source: Getty Images. Income investors have a strong preference for stocks that consistently hike their dividends. Since predictable cash flow is a priority, they pass over companies that can't show rising returns during the inevitable industry downturn. That's why many investors shop among the short list of Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that boast an unbroken streak of at least 25 years of consecutive payout raises. A few members of that elite group have fallen out of favor recently and could represent solid long-term buys. Below, we'll look at the prospects for market-beating returns from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). Coca-Cola Coca-Cola is about as close as you can get to a recession-proof business. Through the world's largest distribution system, it slings nearly 2 billion servings of beverages around the globe each day. Its portfolio spans 500 brands, including four of the top five sparkling drink franchises on earth: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. That unique market position has powered impressive income growth for investors as Coke raised its dividend in each of the last 54 fiscal years. However, the rate of growth is slowing: Coke's latest hike was just 6%, compared to 8% in 2015 and 9% in 2014. The beverage titan is struggling with weak volume growth due to consumers rejecting many of the core ingredients, including sugar, upon which it built its empire. It has responded by revamping its portfolio with products like Zero Sugar Coca-Cola, yet shares declined in 2016 even as the market surged higher. The recent installation of James Quincey as Coke's new CEO suggests the company aims to aggressively alter its cherished formulas so that all the industry's biggest growth isn't confined to rivals. Target Target's stock fell 2% in 2016, a year that saw the retailer hike its dividend by 7% to mark its 45th consecutive payout raise. Target is struggling even more than rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to find growth in a weak shopping industry: Customer traffic is down 1% over the last nine months while Wal-Mart has enjoyed a slight increase. Image source: Getty Images. The retailer has navigated through rough times like these before, though, thanks to a powerful pairing of price leadership in some product segments and premium offerings in others. That approach, which leans heavily on what management calls its signature categories (including beauty and apparel) leads to significantly higher profitability than peers. Its gross margin is 30% of sales, compared to Wal-Mart's 26%. Like most major retailers, Target's growth prospects are at least partially hobbled by the trend toward online shopping. Yet that's no reason for investors to ignore what, at 3.3%, amounts to one of the most generous dividend yields in the industry. Lowe's No matter what it does, Lowe's can't seem to break out of Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) long shadow. Despite a fast-growing store footprint, it trails its larger home-improvement rival in the key metrics of sales growth, profitability, and return on invested capital. It's no surprise, then, that shares fell by 6% in 2016, compared to a 2% gain for Home Depot and a 10% jump for the broader market. Image source: Getty Images. However, Lowe's dominates in the metric of dividend longevity. Its payout has ticked higher each year since 1961, and that streak includes the brutal three-year period around the housing market crises that forced Home Depot to pause its dividend raises. That makes Lowe's the only Dividend Aristocrat to represent the home-improvement industry, in part thanks to its more conservative capital allocation approach. The company allocates 35% of annual profits to dividends, compared to Home Depot's 50% target. Between the three choices, though, I'd bet on Coca-Cola at today's prices. Sure, it will take time for beverage portfolio changes to spark faster sales growth, but patient investors can collect a 3.3% dividend yield while they wait for those improved industry conditions. Its long business history, meanwhile, demonstrates that the drink giant has a knack for adjusting to shifting consumer demands. That challenge is made much easier by assets like a massive marketing budget and unmatched global distribution network. Short-term bumps aside, a decade from now Coke is likely to be selling well over 2 billion beverage servings each day and sending much of the profit back to shareholders.   Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory A Virginia woman says her son — who police believe spray-painted “white power” graffiti at a little league ballpark — couldn’t possibly be racist because his girlfriend is black. Taylor Ferrell was arrested Friday afternoon at a Richmond hotel and charged with three counts of intentionally damaging a property or monument, reported WTVR-TV. Police said the 18-year-old Ferrell admitted to damaging the Tuckahoe Little League complex, but he claims he didn’t paint the racist messages or swastikas. Vandals smashed a urinal and painted the misspelled message, “oopps,” above the broken pieces, and they spray-painted “white power” and graphic insults against the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants and President-elect Donald Trump. Ferrells’ mother, Sarah Maxey, said her son told her he was with two other people Thursday night, including a man who bought paint at Walmart and supplied the underage man with alcohol. “He did admit to breaking the sink and drawing pictures of genitalia,” Maxey said. “But he did not write the racist words or none of that. His girlfriend is actually black, so he’s far from being racist.” Damage to the athletic facility was estimated at $6,000, park supervisors said. Maxey said her son had a troubled upbringing but wasn’t a mean person, and she was fearful of threats posted against him on social media. “One person says they should take a baseball bat to his hands and feet — that’s pretty harsh,” she said. Police are still investigating the case, and other arrests are possible.

Written by Pratik Kanjilal | Published:January 2, 2017 12:11 am Every nation now needs its own alphabet, appropriate to its peculiar predicament. Illustrations: C R Sasikumar For the Phoenicians, who are credited with the world’s oldest alphabet, which flourished on their huge trading network, A was for aleph and B for beth, which meant ‘ox’ and ‘house’ respectively. Simple, earthy things rich with promise for the day’s political acronyms and ‘roti, kapda aur makan’ slogans — pita, robe and beth, say. Having inherited the alphabet from Phoenicia via the Greeks and Romans, the English adapted it to their insular tastes and pushed it out on their even huger trading network, and the world learned that A was for ‘apple’, B was for ‘boy’, and so on. But now, as half the world turns insular, with voters and leaders so unnerved by immigration, underemployment and culture shock that they dream of walling off neighbours and making war on them, every nation needs its own alphabet, appropriate to its peculiar predicament. Here is the alphabet for the lexicon of change in India in 2016-17, words that carry within them entire narratives — from the troubled to the trivial. Pratik Kanjilal spells it out A was for achhe din, the millennial days which have remained just out of reach of the bhakt (see B) for so long that they now enjoy mythical status. A is also for ‘anthem’, and for ‘anti-national’. Out of sheer cussedness, the latter does not stand up for the former. A foolish practice which makes it easy to detect them in enclosed spaces, like cinema halls, using the anthem as a touchstone. B is for bhakt, an organism actuated by the need to believe. The bhakt is baffled and unsettled by the idea of rational thought and becomes irritable when presented with facts, but there is hope yet — evolution can improve any living thing. B is also for ‘black money’, the only election plank of the BJP for a decade. It used to mean untaxed money, but is now identical with ‘cash’ (see C) in the popular imagination. And cash is trash. B is also for beef, reluctant product of cows who were taken off before their time. Found in abundance in all lands but India, where its discovery — or the most muddled suspicion of such discovery — has led to humans being taken off before their time. However, take good cheer. In the new year, beef vigilantes are expected to be thrown off the stage by vigilant taxmen (see T). And, in the middle distance, B is for Brexit, Britain’s final retreat into the comfort of insularity. It need not bother us. C is for cash, legal tender traditionally appreciated by all, most emphatically by Gujaratis. Now a controlled substance. C is also for ‘cashless’, earlier a positive term suggesting lightning-fast hospitalisation. It now denotes enforced temporary poverty as a feature of national service. D is for demonetisation, a financial Houdini act which sucks cash from pockets and funnels it into banks in order to dematerialise it into a cloud of electrons, which will someday, by mystifying means, find its way back into your mobile wallet. E is for the economy, stupid, which means that India has matured. As in the Western democracies, it appears that future elections will now be decided by economic questions. This will detract somewhat from the carnival splendour of the traditional election, which used to be the Big E, but will it mean that there will be no more mandirs? That would be a welcome change. F is for farmer, whom the prime minister applauds for planting on schedule by brute persistence, despite being beggared by the freeze on cooperative banks which support farming. This is serious change — farming is clearly no longer the bedrock of the economy (see E). F is for FCRA, a fiscal tap which the government can turn on and off at will, or twiddle moodily when it is bored and upset. The result is the dismantling of non-governmental activity, an activity which governments enjoy. No change here. G is for growth, the holy grail which assumed purely mythic status post-demonetisation (see D). G is for goalposts, unreliable things which flit drunkenly across a hallucinatory landscape of governmental assurances and rules. On November 12, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley urged people not to rush to queue up to deposit their old notes, since there was time until December 30. On December 19, bankers were required to ask depositors why they didn’t get off their butts earlier. G is for Arnab Goswami, who took TV news to its highest, shreekiest pitch, and who will be back with his own channel, Republic, later this month. It will not transmit below 20 kilohertz, the upper limit of human hearing. H is for Hyderabad University, which overtook JNU (see J) as the seat of energetic anti-nationalism (see A). The suicide of Rohith Vemula on January 16 provided a new seed for political mobilisation among the youth. I is for Indian, misunderstood genius who invented plastic surgery and flying machines in ancient times, and is now in reduced circumstances allegedly due to the the machinations of Marxists, Maoists, Nehrus and Gandhis. J is for jumla, laughing gas loosed upon the credulous in the election season. Also for JNU, a stronghold of anti-nationals (see A) in the heart of the national capital. And J is for jawan, a heroic figure standing tirelessly on guard at the border, a stirring role model for the teeming millions back home who only have depressing bank queues (see Q) to stand in. Sometimes, former jawans are discovered in distress in bank queues, too. Watch what else is making news K is for Kashmir, as always. No change here. See under P for the only other constant in our rapidly changing polity. It believes itself to be strongly related to Kashmir. L is for laundering, the chameleon-like skill of changing the colour of money. L is also for liberalisation, a relic which is best forgotten since, unavoidably, it happened under Congress leadership. Now, we must seek to recapture the prelapsarian past, before liberalisation, which was the only big bang reform which ever actually happened. Witness the return of big, muscular, arbitrary, heavy-breathing government. Also, the return of strictures on thought and action, and the fuzzy conviction that money is innately vile. M is for mobile, which is also your bank. Actually, since you cannot get into your brick and mortar bank without survivalist gear any more, your mobile is the only bank you have. N is for nationalism, the only approved ideology. This is not a constraint, since Indian nationalism is actually internationalist, harking back to Akhand Bharat and Arctic homelands, and attracting ethnic Indians who have embraced other nationalities. N is also for Nehru, who is to blame for everything except demonetisation. O is the cry of the sick, the aged, the halt and the lame as they collapse all of a heap in queues outside the doors of banks. Call it culling by collateral damage. O is also for the Olympics and Paralympics, which brought much-needed cheer. And for Odd-Even, the numbers game promoted by the Delhi government, which it cannot play this year for legal reasons. P is for Pakistan and Putin, the only constants in the rapidly changing geopolitics of Asia. But in a sharp reversal, Pakistani actors in India have been declared anti-nationals (see A), though they are merely non-nationals. P is also for pellet gun, whose use on civilian populations was cleared by some unsung bureaucrat whose head should be subjected to ballistic testing. The big P is PayTM, alert beneficiary of demonetisation (see D). P is for the promise signed off by the RBI governor on every rupee note, which is now revealed to be a jumla (see J). P is also for Patanjali, the shuddh desi Walmart which may one day do battle in the marketplace with the real thing. And P is for prohibition, which is back, via Patna, at the heart of politics. Q stands for queue, in which the sick, the aged, the halt and the lame are wont to collapse (see O). This happens so often that it looks suspiciously like an anti-national (see A) habit. R is for Reserve Bank of India, once an august organisation guarded by a yaksha and a yakshini, now a symbol of institutional collapse and popularly known as the Reverse Bank of India. The last RBI governor was a rock star economist. The present incumbent, soundly ignored at the Centre, must travel to a state capital even to be heckled. R is also for rail budget and RIP — this year, special fiscal status for the railways will be history. S is for surgical strike, which is a euphemism for state-funded event management. They are rapidly forgotten the moment that bigger surgical strikes are launched. After the announcement of demonetisation on November 8, no one remembered the headline-grabbing retaliatory attacks against Pakistani assets. T is for the taxman, whose heavy and dolorous tread will usher in the new year. The daily flip-flops over demonetisation have created a new rule book, which fairly bristles with discretionary powers which could be such fun to play with. T is also for Trump, a phenomenon which has deeply divided America, and for Tata, a house divided. U is for Urjit Patel, current governor of the RBI, whose office is urgently in need of some urja. U is for the USA, with whom India is aligning precisely when it is in turmoil. U is also for USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), which allows dumbphones to access financial services. The user has to be pretty smart to use it. V is for Venezuela, whose people resort to direct action when its government tries to part them from their cash (see C). The country has been forced to defer its demonetisation exercise following physically energetic public responses. Unlike India, there is a real need for demonetisation over there, to contain hyperinflation. W was for the big fat Indian wedding, which took a beating from demonetisation, whose furies coincided with the Hindu nuptial season. The real fat cats are marrying unimpeded, though. W is also for water, whether as an ingredient in the water wars down south, or spewing from the mouths of water cannons. X is for Planet X, the Neptune-sized planet of the solar system beyond the orbit of Pluto which CalTech researchers claim to have identified this year. This has nothing to do with the fictitious (and therefore fascinating) Nibiru cataclysm, in which a planet-sized object from deep space is supposed to sweep through the inner solar system. The sweep-by was expected by fans in 2003, but has been postponed to 2017. But it may be overtaken by other disasters. Y is for yesterday, when all our troubles seemed so far away. Yesteryear, actually. Just think of the past, of change, and it’s almost poetry. Y is also for the ‘Yadav clan’, which has turned into a soap opera. Most significantly, Y is for ‘you’. Yes, you. All change finally depends on you, and your willingness to think, speak and act. Z is for zip, the procedure officially recommended for the lips of the adventurously garrulous. Zipping it is the finest sign of nationalism (see N), and clinching evidence that you are not an anti-national (go back to A).

Updated: January 6, 2017 @ 7:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell Close AP California's Gigantic Medical-Marijuana Industry Could Be Devastated by an Unlikely Source newsfeedback@fool.com (Sean Williams) Updated Jan 1, 2017 0 Image source: Getty Images. If you support the legalization of marijuana, 2016 didn't give you much to complain about. Last year, residents in four states approved recreational-marijuana ballot initiatives, doubling the total from the end of 2015, while five new states put medical-cannabis laws on their books. By year's end, 28 states and Washington, D.C., had legalized medical pot. And there's more where that came from. We saw two battleground states -- Pennsylvania and Ohio -- introduce and pass medical-marijuana legislation without sending it to a public vote. We also saw a continued softening in the public's opinion toward marijuana, which remains an illegal drug at the federal level. Gallup's 2016 poll found that 60% of Americans now want to see the substance legalized nationwide, up from just 25% when California passed the first compassionate-use law in 1996. Legal weed sales have also soared. Cannabis research firm ArcView sees sales reaching nearly $22 billion by the end of the decade, while investment firm Cowen & Co. projects a better-than-23% annualized growth rate leading to $50 billion in legal sales by 2026. California is a medical-marijuana juggernaut Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, wound up generating $996.2 million in legal sales during 2015, leading to $135 million in tax and licensing revenue. Yet that's peanuts compared with legal pot sales in California, the eighth-largest economy in the world by GDP. Image source: Getty Images. Since passing medical-cannabis legislation in 1996, California has amassed more than 720,000 current patients, at least according to a September 2016 estimate from the Marijuana Policy Project. That's about 1.8% of California's total population as of 2015, and it represents half of all legal medical-marijuana patients in the entire United States. According to Troy Dayton, the CEO of ArcView, California generated $2.7 billion in medical-cannabis sales in 2015, which amounts to 62% of all medical-cannabis sales in the U.S. in 2015, as well as more than half of all cannabis sales, medical and recreational combined, in 2015. California's medical-marijuana industry is simply enormous. But it may not stay that way for long. The cannibalization of medical cannabis In November, California's residents went to the polls and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 64, which will legalize recreational, adult-use weed for the state's more than 39 million residents. In 2018 alone, California's legal pot sales are expected to climb to $6.6 billion, based on estimates by New Frontier and ArcView. Image source: Cannabis Culture, Flickr. However, legalizing recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and up creates a potentially big problem for the United States' largest medical-marijuana industry: Once recreational-marijuana sales are allowed (they'll be rolled out over the next year), the incentive to head to the doctor to get a prescription for medical pot will no longer be there. Not to mention that getting a physician referral takes time and costs money. From physicians to medical dispensaries, there's the possibility that the medical-cannabis industry could be ravaged by the recreational-pot industry. Medical dispensaries will still be needed for patients younger than age 21, so it's not as if they'd entirely disappear. But it's probable that the medical-marijuana industry in California today will look very different a year or two from now. The Sacramento Bee points out that some medical-pot clinics are planning to rebrand to broader holistic services in order to keep their clientele. Those services may include acupuncture, chiropractic care, and hypnosis, for example. Medical-marijuana shops are also counting on new consumers who want the guidance of a physician before purchasing pot, even if they're just recreational consumers and not medical-marijuana patients. Marijuana consultations from an experienced pot clinic physician could still translate into profits.  But, admittedly, the future of medical marijuana in California is very uncertain. Marijuana's clouded future Beyond just California, the future of marijuana in the U.S. remains somewhat clouded, too. For instance, the appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be the next attorney general of the United States is a potentially damaging blow to the marijuana industry. Sessions is an ardent opponent of the legalization movement, and even though President-elect Trump has thrown his full support behind medical marijuana, and has suggested that states should retain their right to regulate their pot industry without federal interference, Sessions could roll back some of the leniency instilled during the Obama presidency. While this isn't to say 20 years of progress could be wiped out, it's unlikely that the sledding will get easier with Sessions as attorney general. Image source: Getty Images.

We also can't forget that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency declined to reschedule marijuana when given the opportunity this past August. The DEA noted a lack of safety and clinical data, as well as a lack of understanding the chemical properties of marijuana, in its decision to leave the drug classified as Schedule 1. This means pot companies are still primarily forced to deal in cash, as most banks want nothing to do with them, and they continue to face higher corporate income tax rates since they are unable to take normal business deductions. These persistent disadvantages are what make investing in this space so incredibly dangerous. Even if the incoming administration or the DEA does decide to reschedule marijuana, it doesn't mean things would necessarily get easier. Schedule 2 through Schedule 5 drugs fall under the tight regulation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA would likely implement strict marketing and packaging regulations, oversee all medical grow operations, and require that approved clinical trials be run to prove that medical cannabis treats certain ailments This all translates into big expenses for the medical-pot industry. While marijuana's state-level expansion has been something to marvel, this remains an industry best watched from the sidelines. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Supermarkets, third-party food delivery, open and shut restaurants? Write in and let us know at nluna@scng.com The Great Avocado Crisis, the invasion of extreme supermarket discounter Aldi, a bankrupt salad bar, poke fever and the sale of a popular Southern California burger brand dominated restaurant news in 2016. It was also a year where we saw another big gain in the number of restaurants operating in the county compared with last year: 233. Still, some big brands – Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour, Knowlwood and Daphne’s California Greek – struggled. How did it all shake out? Here are the 10 biggest restaurant and food stories of 2016: Trouble at Souplantation When the San Diego parent company of Souplantation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, readers went bonkers. Most were worried about the demise of their all-you-can-eat salad bar. Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp. ended up closing 20 restaurants, but it left untouched some 28 Souplantations in the greater Los Angeles area, Orange County and Inland Empire. The company said its Southern California locations perform well, so no need to worry. Still, we’ll be on the lookout for any changes to the salad bar in 2017. Sale of burger phenom Slater’s 50/50 Scott Slater, the owner of Orange County’s famed bacon-infused burger brand Slater’s 50/50, dropped a bombshell earlier this month when he announced plans to sell the chain’s six Southern California restaurants, including locations in Anaheim Hills and Huntington Beach. He said the new owner, Elite Restaurant Group, would infuse the fresh capital needed for remodels and expansion. Slater, who founded the first restaurant seven years ago in Anaheim Hills, is stepping down as president. He declined to disclose more details about the sale, including what prompted him to unload the company. He only discussed the sale after the Register inquired about notices filed to the state for each of his six restaurants. The public filings typically indicate a 60-day notice of layoffs at business locations. The notices said more than 700 employees would be impacted. Slater, who plans to stick with the brand as the “baron of bacon,” insisted the restaurants are not closing. Though he will no longer be a majority stakeholder, he said no layoffs will occur after the sale. “We’re going through a recapitalization process,” he said. “We terminate, and we rehire with a new organization.” Nation’s Restaurant News, an industry trade magazine, said the new owner behind Elite is Michael Nakhleh, a former Fatburger and Sizzler operator. He plans to expand Slater’s through franchising. “Slater’s food is amazing. They have the total package. It just felt right for us to take on this brand and really expand with it,” he told NRN. The sale is expected to close early next year. Hot restaurant concepts Orange County once again experienced another net gain in restaurants with 8,872 operating as of Dec. 1, according to data from the county’s Health Care Agency. That’s up 233 restaurants from last year, and a jump of 830 more restaurants since 2009. Ten years ago, I would have attributed much of the gain to growth in restaurant chains – from California Pizza Kitchen to Cheesecake Factory. But over the last five years, Orange County has seen a large number of indie restaurants and food halls open at retail centers and historic downtown communities. Restaurants have become the new anchors as consumers seek experiences they can’t get buy over the internet. Some openings earning buzz this year: the $12 million Water Grill seafood restaurant in Costa Mesa; brunch sensation Snooze in Tustin; “restaurant within a restaurant” LSXO at Pacific City; and numerous poke bowl restaurants that debuted across the county. Note: Tasting rooms are also on the rise with several new craft brew beer hubs and a distillery opening in 2016, including Chapman Crafted in Orange, Unsung Brewing Co. in Anaheim, Karl Strauss Brewing Co. in Anaheim, Beachwood Brewing in Huntington Beach, Bruery Terreux in Anaheim, Gunwhale Ales in Costa Mesa, Stereo in Placentia and Blinking Owl Distillery in Santa Ana. Spate of Closures Orange County is a much sought after market, but the restaurant industry is facing tough times with flat foot traffic amid rising labor costs. The Register’s “Open and Shut” column, which appears every Sunday in the Business section, tracks closures throughout the year. Though we closed the year with a big gain of new restaurants, dozens more shutdown. We don’t catch them all, but we spotlighted about 70 closures in 2016, including notable brands such as critically acclaimed Little Sparrow in downtown Santa Ana, Holsteins Shakes and Buns at South Coast Plaza, Casey’s Cucpakes and several Round Table Pizzas. We also bid goodbye to some nostalgic concepts including Marie Callender’s original Orange restaurant, Farrell’s in Mission Viejo, and two longtime Knowlwood restaurants. 2017 prediction: The bubble will burst for build-your-own pizza and poke bowl concepts, fast-growing food categories that have saturated the market. Veggie bashing of In-N-Out After a startup food sustainability group picked on In-N-Out Burger for not offering a vegetarian option, the online story went viral. “A meat-free option is a no-brainer” for a brand like In-N-Out, the Good Food Institute said. And, grilled cheese doesn’t count, the Washington D.C.-based group said. Well, fans of the Irvine-based burger institution fought back, chiding the fledgling organization for taking a stab at their beloved burger brand. Superfans told Good Food to go elsewhere for a meatless burger, and leave In-N-Out alone. With fans coming to your defense like this, it’s clear why In-N-Out never bothers with publicity. Their fans speak loud and clear, so they don’t have to. Great Avocado Crisis It was a costly year for avocado lovers. Prices of the popular green fruit skyrocketed twice this year with the latest fall surge tied to a shortage of avocados from Mexico. At the time, prices hovered at $76 a case, a 30-year record for Santa Ana produce company, Ingardia Bros. The crisis triggered widespread panic – from produce suppliers to Mexican restaurants. Subway, in some stores, stopped serving avocado temporarily during the shortfall. Mexico supplies are now back to normal. In 2017, supplies will shift back to Hass avocados grown in California. The question: Will the lingering drought impact the quality of locally grown Hass? We’ll have to wait and see. Aldi Invasion Aldi, the great supermarket disruptor, entered the hyper-competitive Southern California grocery scene in March to throngs of bargain hunting shoppers. The German-born chain, which has family ties to Trader Joe’s, sells knockoffs of top-selling labels such as Heineken beer, cereals from General Mills and Heinz ketchup. Aldi guarantees the quality of its low-price store brands, maintaining shoppers can save up to 50 percent on their grocery bills. Analysts say Aldi, which operates nearly 1,600 stores in 34 U.S. states, impacts rivals from dollar stores to Walmart to traditional supermarkets. Aldi closed the year with 34 stores in Southern California, including locations in Anaheim, Buena Park and Fountain Valley. “Our plan for aggressive growth in the Southern California market remains unchanged, and we are looking to open approximately 20 stores throughout the region in 2017,” the company told the Register a few weeks ago. The next locations to open in Orange County are in Garden Grove and Laguna Woods. Amar Santana’s amazing ‘Top Chef’ run The Register chronicled the four-month run of Amar Santana on “Top Chef,” the award-winning cooking competition on Bravo. Throughout the December-to-March season, Santana dazzled the judges with his charm and unforgettable dishes. So, when he got eliminated over toast, fans cried foul. But he fought his way back to the finale through “Last Chance Kitchen,” the show’s secondary competition which allows eliminated contestants to re-join the main event. At the Las Vegas showdown, Santana was unstoppable. Not even his old mentor Charlie Palmer, who showed up at the end to assist Santana in the kitchen, could hurt him. Or did he? The two had a falling out, which was emphasized for ratings on the show. Did Palmer nudge the judges to ultimately choose self-taught Florida chef Jeremy Ford? We will never know. Santana would later say his food was better. His fans thought so too. But he has no regrets. Santana got what he wanted: worldwide recognition for his talents and priceless publicity for his two restaurants, Vaca in Costa Mesa and Broadway by Amar Santana in Laguna Beach. Both are among the hottest seats in town. Organizers of local charity and social events are now after Santana to be a guest chef at their fundraisers and private parties. He’s grateful. “I knew Top Chef was going to change my life. I just didn’t know it was going to change my life this much. I didn’t think it was going to be this good.” Self-checkout implosion at Albertsons, Vons Though convenience and speed of service are important to shoppers, Albertsons and Vons announced plans in November to scrap self-checkout lanes at 96 of 352 stores in Southern California. The sister chains, instead, plan to give better one-on-one service to shoppers “which includes a friendly checker to serve them,” a spokesman said. Well, most of you were not too happy about this change, with some saying they no longer plan to shop at either store. Mini Targets coming to Irvine, Orange Target announced plans this year to open two “flexible-format” stores in Orange County. The stores in Irvine and Orange, about one-third the size of a standard Target, will offer merchandise and groceries. Stores will emphasize produce and grab-and-go foods such as sandwiches, salads and beverages. The Orange and Irvine stores are part of 28 flexible-format stores opening in the U.S. over the next three years. The Irvine store, at Bridge Road and Campus Drive, will go into the 20,000-square-foot space formerly occupied by 24 Hour Fitness. The Orange store will be in the Rusty Leaf Plaza at Yorba Street and Chapman Avenue. Both will open in 2017.

Mower County Chief Deputy Mark May reports his office took a report Dec. 29, 2016, of an 84-year-old sending money to scammers who’d claimed she won a variety of prizes. The scammers targeted her multiple times in late November and December until the woman’s daughter and son-in-law became aware of the incidents. On Dec. 5, 2016, the woman sent $9,500 to a “Mr. Bob Clark” in New York. On Dec. 20, 2016, the scammers asked for more money and she withdrew $2,000 from a rural bank; however, a bank worker pulled her into an office and warned her she was likely being scammed. But then on Dec. 27, she went to another rural bank and withdrew $2,500. Law enforcement officials aren’t sure if she sent the $2,000 and $2,500 to scammers. Additional incidents may have occurred earlier in 2016 because family members suspected an issue in November, according to May; however, the victim had a hard time remembering the incidents. The scammers told the woman she’d won various prizes, such as $6.5 million, a $10,000 Wal-Mart gift card, $2.5 million, a year of free gas and more; they then asked her to send money to secure the prize, according to May. May, whose own mother was perviously targeted by scammers, urged family members to be watchful of their elderly relatives, especially if memory issues may come into play. He said the older generation is often more trusting of people in such situations. “People don’t want to believe that they’ve been scammed,” May said. May warned scammers will even go to residences to pick up cash, and incidents aren’t often reported until family members find out. May recommended people with concerns consider looking into power of attorney or changing a victim’s phone number, because scammers will keep calling someone once they find a target. People can also go to their bank and ask them to contact a family member if an elderly relative tries to take out large sums of money or make large purchases. Law enforcement found many of the calls received by the victim traced to New York, but such calls are often rerouted and rarely lead to suspects.

Taylor Allen Ferrell, 18, was arrested Friday afternoon at a hotel on Broad Street and charged with three counts of intentionally damaging a property or monument. Ferrell's mother, Sarah Maxey, spoke exclusively to CBS 6 from her Henrico County home. "I can’t understand for the life of me why he would’ve gone there or done that," she said. Offensive, vulgar, and racist messages in black spray paint were discovered on the outside walls of several buildings Thursday morning. The vandalism included spray painted words insulting those with the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants and a message of “White Power." Maxey said her son was with two other people that night, including a man who bought the paint at Walmart and supplied Ferrell with alcohol before traveling to the complex. She said her son confessed to police and herself to committing the crime, but not to writing the more hateful language. Photo Gallery View Gallery (3 images) "He did admit to breaking the sink and drawing pictures of genitalia," explained Maxey. "But, he did not write the racist words or none of that. His girlfriend is actually Black so he’s far from being racist." The destruction of the complex, located off John Rolfe Parkway in the West End, also included smashed urinal, toilets, and broken mirrors. The park supervisor told CBS 6 the damage will cost them $5,500. Maxey revealed her son has had a troubled upbringing, but said her son isn't a mean person that deserves the threats written on social media. "One person says they should take a baseball bat to his hands and feet. That’s pretty harsh," she said. Maxey said detectives told her they continue to investigate the others who may be involved, while her son remains in jail without bond. "I expect my son to suffer the consequences of his own actions," she said.

If you enjoy realism — "a kind of realism rarely found in recent American movies, which often seem to think that audiences will be confused or offended when the silly and the serious collide on screen," as A.O Scott put it, by all means, see it. A friend called it "beautifully bleak" after we saw it Wednesday at the Art Theater Co-op. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, the characters, chief among them Lee Chandler (an effective Casey Affleck) deal with serious family trauma. Obsessed with coloring book Over the Christmas weekend, I became obsessed for a bit with my adult mandala coloring book I'd picked up for $2.99 at Aldi. Using the great Prismacolor colored pencils, I filled in three mandalas in three days. It's relaxing to work with color, but I want to move onto making art, as I once did. The trend of adult coloring books — seems to be one for every subject — continues unabated, with 12 million sold in 2015, up from 1 million in 2014. They made Walmart $100 million in 2016. Michael's alone has a selection of more than 150 books. Wow. Picking up poetry Having interviewed Julie Price Pinkerton about her $10,000-prize-winning poem "Veins" and attending a reading by her at an Urbana home, I was inspired to pick up the book — complete and unabridged — of Robert Frost poems I'd bought somewhere for 25 cents — the label remains on the cover. I turned to his most famous, "The Road Not Taken," and then read others with winter settings. Tis the season! Like Pinkerton's, his poems are accessible but not as humorous as hers. Did you know Frost (1874-1963) won four Pulitzer prizes for poetry?

Tonto Village looked like a picture postcard. The ponderosa pine trees were all dressed up in their winter whites and the cabins could have been featured on a greeting card. The total amount of snow varied, anywhere from 4 to 6 inches in some locations. The temperatures were very low, in the teens, and they continue to stay low, so the snow has been sticking around. According to the weather reports, the temperatures are going to go up about 15 degrees, so the snow will be gone. There were not too many visitors in the Village who would normally be attracted to the snow, but it was Christmas, they will be back when the next good amount of snow again comes to the Village. A special thank you to our Gila County maintenance crew for a great job in clearing the streets in the Village. They were right on top of it with their plows — and this was on Christmas Day! Thank you from the residents of Tonto Village. One reminder ... there are still a few residents who are parking on the streets during a snowstorm. An ordinance is posted as you enter the Village, that there should be no parking on the streets from November to April in order to allow the snowplows to do their job and clear the streets. Please observe this ordinance. New resident Chuck and Aimee Olinger are proud to announce the birth of their daughter, Callie Reagan Olinger on Nov. 7, 2016. Callie weighed in at 8 pounds, 4 ounces. Welcome Callie, and congratulations to Chuck and Aimee. Birthdays, etc. In the second week of January, Tonto Village I resident, Steven Kamp will add another candle to his birthday cake on Jan. 10. On Jan. 11, Laura Bierwirth of Colcord Estates and Payson will celebrate her birthday. Since her day falls on a Wednesday, the Domino Divas will help her celebrate her big day with her favorite dessert. On Jan. 16, Garah Monic of Star Valley will be adding another candle to her birthday cake. Garah is the clerk of the Hellsgate Fire Board and she can be seen almost every day at Walmart. Happy birthday to each of you, and remember, another birthday is another year of memories. Then on Jan. 12, another Domino Diva, Dara Sutton and her husband Phon will be celebrating their 37th wedding anniversary. May you know more years of joy and love. Hellsgate Fire Department The Hellsgate Fire Board will hold its monthly meeting Wednesday, Jan. 11 at the fire station in Star Valley. The meeting begins at 5:30 p.m. The fire board meetings are always held on the second Wednesday of each month. If there is a change, Angie Lecher, business manager, will email members of the change. Here comes 2017 New Year’s Eve is on Saturday and I would guess that there will be many parties to help bring in the new year. So you most likely need a good recipe for an appetizer or munchie. The “Fireflies Can Cook” cookbook has a munchie called “TRASH” and the recipe was submitted by former Domino Diva and Christopher Creek resident, Penny Wells. Penny moved last year to South Carolina to be closer to her family — our loss! Penny is a great cook. TRASH 1 box Cheezit 3 packages Pepperidge Farm fish pretzels 1 package oyster crackers 1/2 cup oil 2 packages Hidden Valley buttermilk dressing mix 1/4 cup dill weed (or to your taste) Optional: peanuts and Cheetos Mix together, bake on shallow pan at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Double D Doings Speaking of parties, the Double D will be having a New Year’s Eve party starting at about 8 p.m. with live music by Carl Anthony. Naturally there will be plenty of noisemakers and snacks to munch on while you wait for the New Year 2017. To my readers ... May the new year find you happy and surrounded by the love of family and friends. Happy New Year!

BUSINESS What to buy (and skip) in January January sales Sam Hodgson / Bloomberg With Christmas in the rearview mirror, retailers are anxious to get rid of holiday merchandise and other old inventory. With Christmas in the rearview mirror, retailers are anxious to get rid of holiday merchandise and other old inventory. (Sam Hodgson / Bloomberg) Courtney Jespersen If finding deals is your New Year’s resolution, January is a great time to start. For those who want to make saving money a priority in 2017, here are recommendations for what to buy (and skip) this month based on NerdWallet’s analysis of historical sales cycles. Buy: Christmas decorations The period after Christmas has long been the best time to buy Christmas decorations. You may scoop up some post-Christmas deals on Dec. 26, but come Jan. 1, there will still be a handful of artificial trees, red ornaments and shiny wrapping paper spilling over in store clearance aisles. Stock up on holiday closeouts if you have space to hang onto extra tinsel until December. Skip: Smartphones You can’t always time your smartphone purchase. If your trusty iPhone has seen better days, it may be time for something new. But if you’re planning an upgrade in the not-so-imminent future, consider waiting a while longer. Prices on existing phone models tend to go down whenever a new phone is released. For Apple phones, the sweet spot is usually September after the company’s annual keynote product announcement. As for Samsung, tech enthusiasts speculate the Galaxy S8 could arrive around April. Buy: Televisions The end of football season marks the beginning of television deals as retailers help shoppers prepare for viewing parties. The Super Bowl will air Feb. 5, but retailers probably will kick off sales at the end of January — making it an excellent time to score a bargain. In 2016, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Amazon and others discounted a wide variety of TVs in assorted brands and sizes ahead of the big game. Look for similar savings again in 2017. Skip: Toys Toys were hot during the holidays; if you haven’t heard of a Hatchimal, you’ve probably been living under a rock. But with Christmas over, January isn’t likely to see many worthwhile toy deals. The good news is that your little ones may be set for a while after all of their December gifts. Buy: Fitness gear January is a solid time to sign up for a gym because many chains offer special New Year’s rates. But don’t spend that money unless you’re sure you’ll use the membership. All too often, new members lock themselves in for a full year, then stop showing up after a month or two. Skip: Mattresses Great deals on mattresses will come in February, when Presidents Day sales bring discounts. Presidents Day is Feb. 20, so hold off for a month if you’re in the market for a new mattress. Or if February is too soon for your budget, mattress deals will be back again in May over Memorial Day weekend and in September over Labor Day weekend. Buy: Bedding You might not want to buy a new mattress, but you can save on the sheets and blankets that go on your existing mattress. January is the month when department stores host “white sales” to clear out their existing inventory of sheets, towels, blankets and more. Expect savings to be especially deep on clearance items. Last year, several stores offered 60% to 70% off bedding basics.

Robert C. Cesanek, 30, entered one of the homes uninvited, scaring the victim, who was at home with a 6-year-old, court papers state. When police arrested him they said they found five heroin packets and syringes in his possession and charged him with criminal trespass, defiant trespass, simple assault, possession of a controlled substance and use or possession of drug paraphernalia. He was also charged with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct and arraigned that day by Magisterial District Judge Edward Lewis, who set bail at 10 percent of $20,000. Unable to post the money, he was taken to jail. According to arrest papers, police were alerted at 10:43 a.m. of a man who appeared intoxicated banging on doors in the borough. One of the victims on West Catawissa Street answered the door and Cesanek let himself in unwanted, court papers state, staggering around in the living room. The victim called her neighbor and 911 for help and told Cesanek to leave. Court papers state Cesanek did leave and was taken into custody by police shortly after. He admitted to using heroin that day, police wrote. Man accused of theft by deception A Tamaqua man deceived a Rush Township store, police say. James E. Bloss, 61, was charged with theft by deception and retail theft by township police. The charges were filed Dec. 13 and issued via summons, which he accepted Dec. 21. Arrest papers state he attempted to return $33.08 worth of merchandise he didn’t pay for Dec. 12 at Wal-Mart, Hometown. Charges, citations Charges or citations have been filed against the following, according to court documents. Violations for older offenses appear now because they have only recently been filed or served. ■ Andrew T. Schlegel, 30, Tamaqua, disorderly conduct for hazardous or physical offense by Rush Township police after a Sept. 21 offense. ■ Eric Berger, 32, Tamaqua, disorderly conduct by borough police after a Dec. 14 offense. ■ Tayna Hernandez, 26, Hazleton, disorderly conduct by West Hazleton police after a Dec. 21 offense. ■ Pedro A. Castillo, 25, Hazleton, disorderly conduct by state police at Hazleton after a Dec. 12 offense.

Sun 9:30 AM 18,375 Views 1 Comment Share Tweet Email7 THROUGHOUT 2016, WE’VE brought you seen longreads a week, in Sitdown Sunday – but you might not have caught them all. So sit back with a cuppa and enjoy two of our favourite longreads from each month of last year. If you want even more to read, you can check out all of the year’s longreads here. January Daisy Ridley's new wax figure, as Rey in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is revealed at Madame Tussauds in London. Source: EMPICS Entertainment Girls explain Star Wars to You Irish writer Sarah Maria Griffin writes about the transformative experience of watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and seeing a character like Rey – a strong woman in a movie that celebrates the diversity of its cast. (Scannain, approx 16 mins reading time) It dawned on me extremely slowly that Rey was, in fact, not a love interest, or a B-Plot. I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for a gold-bikini scene. Waiting for her to have been written as all feist, no capability. Waiting for her to give up, already having given up on characters like her written by men a long, long time ago. Bowie and Me It was a sad month. First Bowie, then Alan Rickman, both gone. Back in 2013, the Guardian interviewed people who were involved with Bowie’s career, and it’s a fascinating look at how he worked with people. (The Guardian, approx 23 mins reading time) He’s an emotional, passionate person who put everything into the music. I’ve seen him in the studio burst out crying after finishing a song – Life On Mars springs to mind. After some gigs, he’d say, “The audience were a bit quiet.” I’d say, “David, they’re staring at you with their mouths open.” He had created this fierce storm, but he was the only one in it. He felt as if everyone was feeding off him, like leeches. February They adopted her – but did they kill her?  Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra adopted a baby girl, Asunta Fong Yang, from China. She was a gifted child, who spent her weekends attending classes in everything from French to ballet. But then, at the age of 12, she was found dead. (The Guardian, approx 30 mins reading time) By the time she turned 12 in September 2012, Asunta might have been expected to be getting fed up with being, to all appearances, a project child – someone who was determinedly being shaped into a prodigy. Once, when her mother was going through a list of after-school activities in front of acquaintances, the girl snapped: “That’s one that I’m doing because you like it!” But mostly Asunta seemed happy. She was talented, disciplined and enjoyed what she did. She never came home In 2005, Pamela Colloff wrote about beauty queen Irene Garza, whose body was pulled from an irrigation canal. The suspect? A priest. Earlier this year, the priest was arrested. (Texas Monthly, approx 42 mins reading time) One parishioner noticed Irene make the sign of the cross as she entered the sanctuary. Another parishioner saw her kneeling by herself in a pew on the fifth row. A third remembered Irene asking if she might edge in front of her in the long confession line because she was running late. Some recalled her draping a white lace veil over her head, while others said she had stepped out of line, as if turning to go. Yet no one ever saw her leave the church that night. The next morning, Easter Sunday, her car was still parked down the street from Sacred Heart. Irene never came home. March Source: Shutterstock/Photographee.eu Is sex work just another job? There is an ongoing debate in many countries – including Ireland – about the decriminalisation of sex work. Here, sex workers in the US talk about their work, detailing how they got into the industry, and the debate on the issue is seen from all sides. (NY Mag, approx 32 mins reading time) The debate has highlighted a rift among feminists, pitting two deeply held beliefs against each other. One side argues that women should be free economic agents, capable of making choices in their own self-interest, empowered to own their sexuality and use their bodies however they choose. If Chelsea Lane wants to become a sex worker, why shouldn’t she be allowed to do it legally? Those on the other side believe that the Chelsea Lanes of the world are a tiny fraction of sex workers and that many who “choose” this life are not choosing freely or choosing at all. Isis’s sex slaves This much-shared story is about how Isis keeps sex slaves – and keeps them from getting pregnant by forcing them to take birth control pills. (New York Times, approx 15 mins reading time) In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion in order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do so. Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were driven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone, whose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with apprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser’s child; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping them. April The day my partner drowned Decca Aitkenhead writes with strength, grace and honesty about the death of her partner – the father of her two sons – in a drowning accident in Jamaica. After he died, she had even more tough times to deal with. (The Guardian, approx 23 mins reading time) Only then did I register the power of the riptide that had swept Jake off his feet. Beneath an apparently benign surface, an undertow had gathered, like a gigantic magnet on the horizon sucking us out to sea. The force of the current took my breath away. But I am a strong swimmer, and sensed no cause for great alarm as we inched our way to safety. On my back, in the soundless calm, all I could see was blue sky. It didn’t even cross my mind to panic.  Kevin Barry on Cork Are we allowed to call Kevin Barry a genius yet? The Irish writer has talent in spades, and this essay about Cork is full of incredible lines. (Granta, approx 24 mins reading time) At the very least, the last of this is true: the city of Cork is besotted with itself, and it talks of little else. Quite right, too – it’s a gorgeous place, it’s enormous fun, and it has an operatic atmosphere. By operatic, I mean that its passions are fervently held and fervently debated, and there is a native tendency to melodrama: the hand gestures are near-Italianate. I lived in the city from my early twenties until my early thirties – it is in many ways responsible for the creature that I have become, and I hold no rancour against it for this. May Source: Patrick Semansky Who is Melania Trump? Donald Trump got engaged to Slovenian model Melania Knauss back in 2002. You’ve probably seen a lot of photographs of her, but this profile delves deeper into who Melania is. (The New Yorker, approx 20 mins reading time) She has been largely absent from the campaign trail, preferring, she says, to stay at home with Barron, her ten-year-old son with Donald. Lately, she has been appearing more frequently, in the hope of appealing to female voters, who view Trump unfavorably by a ratio of more than three to one. She sticks to a repertoire of stock answers: “He is an amazing negotiator,” “We are both very independent.” She has a jewelry line, a skin-care line (the prize ingredient is French sturgeon eggs), and a thing for the phrase “from A to Z” (“I follow from A to Z,” “I’m from A to Z hands on,” “I’m involved from A to Z with every piece I design”). Hips and Makers Irish journalist and editor Sinéad Gleeson writes about childhood illness, religion, Lourdes and inhabiting your body. (Granta, approx 22 mins reading time) The body is an afterthought. We don’t stop to think of how the heart is beating its steady rhythm; or watch our metatarsals fan out with every step. Unless it’s involved in pleasure or pain, we pay this moving mass of vessel, blood and bone no mind. The lungs inflate, muscles contract and we have no reason to assume it won’t keep on doing what it does. One day, something changes; a corporeal blip. For me, it happened in the months after turning thirteen: the synovial fluid in my left hip began to evaporate like rain. June  What Happened to ‘The Most Liberated Woman in America’? Barbara Williamson and her husband John set up a free-love commune in the 1970s. Sandstone, situated in the Topanga Canyon, California, offered men and women “a radical, nudist, group-sex commune”.  Journalist Alex Mar speaks to Barbara, 78, about her experiences. (Atlas Obscura, approx 33 minutes reading time) No low-slung, hip-riding bell bottoms and tie-dyed T-shirts proclaimed your disdain of the establishment. No military or law-enforcement uniforms declared your allegiance. No thousand-dollar Armani suits or five-hundred-dollar calfskin attaché cases advertised your status as a high-powered banker or attorney. When you shed your public persona and stand naked with a group of other naked people, incredible lightness washes over you. All pretense and game-playing are gone. The Body on the Moor Why did a man travel 200 miles to die in the Peak District National Park in Manchester, England? There were no wallet, keys or any clues to his identity when his body was discovered. BBC News examined the investigation. (BBC News, approx 18 mins reading time) “I told him there’s not enough daylight for him to get there and back today. He just thanked me and asked me again for the directions, which I repeated to him. And he just set off.” July Source: Daniel Leal-Olivas Europhobia You’ve probably wondered about the history of euroscepticism in the UK, and how it led to Brexit. Wonder no more, and give this a read. (The Guardian, approx 22 mins reading time) As Robert Tombs, the Cambridge historian and author of The English and Their History, recently put it: “The campaign seems hardly about Europe at all, but it’s all about us and the English identity.” Both of the first two British attempts to join the Common Market were vetoed by Charles de Gaulle, and it was he who also said that all his life he had been inspired by “une certaine idée de la France”. Behind our present turmoil lurks a certain idea of Britain, or of England. We are trying to find our identity. A town named Snowflake Kathleen Hale goes to Snowflake, a place in the Arizona desert which offers respite to people who are allergic to – basically – modern life. Hale reflects on the people she meets there, and their wary response to her. (The Guardian, approx 24 mins reading time, words) For weeks, Mae and I avoided makeup, lotion, perfume, hair products, scented detergent, fabric softener, dryer sheets. We used fragrance-free soap and shampoo, as well as a natural deodorant, which, according to the description on the box, was basically a rock picked off the ground with a cap on it. Despite our best efforts, Deb’s sensitive nose picked up our body odors. For her, we reeked like a Bath and Body Works store flooded with vodka – or as she put it, “floral, with chemical solvents. You’re fragrant.” August Dying pine trees, part of the windbreak forest severely damaged by March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, stand near the Arahama beach in Sendai, northeastern Japan Source: AP/Press Association Images “I have to keep looking” In what is surely one of the saddest stories you’ll read all year, this explores the impact of the 2011 tsunami in Japan on families who are still searching for their loved ones. We meet the man who became a diver so he could find his wife, and a mum who sends a lunch into the ocean every day for her daughter. (New York Times Magazine, approx 32 mins reading time) On weekends, Hiromi prepared special lunchboxes for Emi that she would deliver into the sea on Sunday. They were packed with Emi’s favorite meals, things like pork soup, Salisbury steak, deep-fried shrimp, all in special boxes that decomposed. She tossed the boxes off boat ramps, piers or rock ledges or set them gently adrift on the water. Always someplace hidden, where no one would see her. She had done this for five years. The super-recognisers New Scotland Yard has a small room that’s home to the super-recognisers – people who all “have a preternatural ability to recognise human faces”. (New Yorker, approx 37 mins reading time) When the transit police brought the groper case to the super-recognizers, Eliot Porritt, a detective sergeant in the unit, took up the investigation. Porritt, who is thirty-six, is rumpled and cerebral, with a mop of curly black hair. As a boy, he loved watching movies with his father, and found that he could identify actors who had been in other films they’d seen, even in tiny parts. As a police officer—first as a beat cop in Islington, and then working plainclothes on a robbery squad—he discovered that while walking the streets he could spot faces and know, in a flash, who they were, where he had met them, and whether they were criminal suspects. September A man with a head transplant plan  Will it eventually be possible to transplant a person’s head onto a new body? That’s what these audacious scientists believe – and there’s a young man counting on them. (The Atlantic, approx 38 mins reading time) More troubling are the rash, unfounded claims he makes about the likelihood of the surgery succeeding, and his habit of promoting his work largely through the media—a practice that most scientists consider unseemly, if not unethical. His critics describe him, on blogs and tech websites, as a “corrupt” and “delusional” liar “with a knife and a mad glitter in his eye.” He “glibly glides past major problems,” they say, with his “Human Centipede–level medical horrorshow.” His plan is insane, “like James Bond villain insane,” and will amount to “an elaborate act of slow torture and murder.” How to trace a gun These police officers have one of the toughest jobs in the force. Why is it so tough? Well, they have to trace guns, but they can’t use computers. Good thing that they’re ‘geniuses’… (GQ, approx 34 mins reading time) Anytime a cop in any jurisdiction in America wants to connect a gun to its owner, the request for help ends up here, at the National Tracing Center, in a low, flat, boring building that belies its past as an IRS facility, just off state highway 9 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in the eastern panhandle of the state, a town of some 17,000 people, a Walmart, a JCPenney, and various dollar stores sucking the life out of a quaint redbrick downtown. On any given day, agents here are running about 1,500 traces; they do about 370,000 a year. October Source: Markus Schreiber The new star of Germany’s Far Right Frauke Petry is the leader of the far-right party Alternative fur Deutschland, and she’s a phenomenon. This profile explores who she is and what her popularity means. (The New Yorker, approx 60 mins reading time) In April, the Party said that head scarves should be banned in schools and universities, and minarets prohibited. Party members called for a referendum on whether to leave the euro; for the expulsion of Allied troops, who have been stationed in Germany since 1945; and for school curriculums that focus more on “positive, identity-uplifting” episodes in German history and less on Nazi crimes. Most contentious of all was the declaration “Islam does not belong in Germany.” White nationalist no more Derek Black was supposed to follow in his Stormfront-creating father’s footsteps and become a white nationalist leader. But then he went to college, and started mixing with the very people he was supposed to hate. (The Washington Post, approx 33 mins reading time) Matthew decided his best chance to affect Derek’s thinking was not to ignore him or confront him, but simply to include him. “Maybe he’d never spent time with a Jewish person before,” Matthew remembered thinking. It was the only social invitation Derek had received since returning to campus, so he agreed to go. The Shabbat meals had sometimes included eight or 10 students, but this time only a few showed up. “Let’s try to treat him like anyone else,” Matthew remembered instructing them. November What Beyoncé taught me Zadie Smith writes about dance, writing, high art and popular culture as only she can. (The Guardian, approx 21 mins reading time) When I write I feel there’s usually a choice to be made between the grounded and the floating. The ground I am thinking of in this case is language as we meet it in its “commonsense” mode. The language of the television, of the supermarket, of the advert, the newspaper, the government, the daily “public” conversation. Some writers like to walk this ground, recreate it, break bits of it off and use it to their advantage, where others barely recognise its existence. Nabokov – a literal aristocrat as well as an aesthetic one – barely ever put a toe upon it. His language is “literary”, far from what we think of as our shared linguistic home. Watching the World Rot at Europe’s Largest Tech Conference When the Web Summit moved from Dublin to Lisbon, some wondered how it would go. Sam Kriss from The Atlantic called this year “where humanity rushes towards its extinction”. For all the usual guff about dynamism and entrepreneurship, it’s clear that Web Summit isn’t really about showcasing new ideas or changing the way anyone does anything. The point is to attract buyouts or investment; this is how so much of the tech industry functions. December Source: Ariana Cubillos This essay on the economic crisis in Venezuela is an incredibly difficult read, showing the huge impact it has had on ordinary people, particularly those who are in hospital. (The New Yorker, approx 53 mins reading time) I was introduced to a surgeon, who took me outside to speak. We stood under a tin roof, near piles of garbage and a deserted loading dock. The surgeon was bearded, heavyset, nervous. He looked exhausted. He did not want me to know his name, let alone use it. “We have no basic trauma tools,” he said. “Sutures, gloves, pins, plates.” He ran down a list of unavailable medications, including ciprofloxacin, an all-purpose antibiotic, and clindamycin, a cheap antibiotic. The doctors lost surgical patients because they had no adrenaline. The story of where hair extensions come from The hair on real hair extensions has to come from somewhere – so Olivia Carville and photographer Mike Scott went to China and tracked how hair goes from the head of a young girl to the head of a woman in New Zealand. It’s a fascinating read. (NZ Herald, approx 17 mins reading time) Consumers don’t want to think about the women who grew their hair or the chains of labour that led to it landing on their scalp because, hair trade academics argue, the thought of wearing someone else’s body part is grotesque. We contacted 22 salons across New Zealand that specialise in hair extensions and found demand has almost tripled in the past five years. But not even the hairdressers who work with these products know where they’re coming from. Want to read more?

Pot and more pot For the second year in a row, marijuana reigned supreme in top local stories. Notable developments this year: Recreational sales became legal Oct. 1; the state began issuing licenses to commercial producers and processors; voters in Medford banned outdoor grows but allowed recreational sales; recreational pot producers, processors, wholesalers and retailers were banned in Shady Cove, Jacksonville, Central Point and Eagle Point; medical pot producers and dispensaries were banned in Jacksonville and Central Point; and Ashland, Phoenix, Rogue River, Gold Hill and Jackson County passed 3 percent taxes on recreational sales. At last count, Jackson County had 75 licensed recreational marijuana grow sites, or about 29 percent of the state total, not to mention more than 3,000 medical pot grow sites. You can't hardly throw a rock anymore without hitting an 8-foot-tall fence and some Visqueen.  2. Lead pipes The Medford Water Commission long has touted its water as some of the purest in the country, and from its source, Big Butte Springs, that's true. But last spring, lead pigtails were unearthed in the system — and they weren't the first. What's worse, Manager Larry Rains initially denied their presence, prompting his ouster by the board in October. Crews have looked at 4,770 meters in older Medford neighborhoods, identified 305 suspect locations that predate 1946, dug 281 test holes and unearthed 24 lead pigtails, which were replaced with copper connectors. How many more pigtails could there be?  "Unfortunately we do not have Superman X-ray vision," notes interim Manager Eric Johnson. Schools began testing their water after high levels of lead were found in Portland, leading to replacement of fixtures at Jackson, Roosevelt and McLoughlin in Medford and the Education-Psychology Building at Southern Oregon University, among others. 3. Pipeline to nowhere Last March, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied a Canadian company's proposal to build a pipeline through Oregon to export natural gas to Asian markets, saying negative impacts to landowners outweighed the benefits. The 232-mile Pacific Connector pipeline would've traversed 56 miles of Jackson County, including underneath the Rogue River, and drew strong opposition from local landowners. The company asked for a rehearing, which FERC denied in early December. Pipeline backers vow to reapply for the project. 4. Death of a senator Southern Oregon mourned the death of Democratic state Sen. Alan Bates Aug. 5 from an apparent heart attack while on a fishing trip with his son. The Medford physician was a tireless leader of health care reform and instrumental in shaping the Oregon Health Plan. Democrats chose Kevin Talbert, a retired Southern Oregon University administrator, to serve the rest of the year, and Tonia Moro, a Medford lawyer, to run for Bates' seat in November. But after a campaign that included attack ads against her opponent, Moro lost to Republican Alan DeBoer, former Ashland mayor.   5. Medford mayor's first veto Gary Wheeler threw down his first veto in 12 years in office to block the hiring of Rob Patridge, Klamath County district attorney and a former Medford councilman and state legislator, as city manager. A divided council was unable to overturn the veto. After a $24,500, yearlong-plus search, the council ended up choosing from within for the city's top spot: Parks Director Brian Sjothun. One of Sjothun's first acts in the job was to fire Deputy City Manager Bill Hoke, who received a nearly $75,000 severance package. Hoke got a call from Sjothun that he'd been placed on administrative leave the day after he turned 66, an approach Sjothun later admitted "was probably a mistake." 6. Commissioner under investigation Outgoing Commissioner Doug Breidenthal remains under investigation by the Oregon Department of Justice and the Oregon Government Ethics Commission for activities related to a campaign account set up under the Association of Oregon Counties that Breidenthal used to seek office with the Western Interstate Region. The Ethics Commission suspended its inquiries in March pending the outcome of the Department of Justice's criminal investigation. The investigation likely contributed to Breidenthal's trouncing in the Republican primary by Bob Strosser, who takes office this week. 7. Sheriff's resignation Jackson County Sheriff Corey Falls stunned supporters when he announced last month he was taking a job with the city of Gresham after serving only two years of his term. Falls has been praised for changing the department's culture from a "warrior" to a "guardian" mentality, working well with the union and reaching out to the Hispanic community. But Falls had a parting shot for the county: He held a press conference Tuesday saying he was treated in a demeaning way by county administrators and felt his voice wasn't being heard. The county responded by releasing a report of an investigation into claims of discrimination and harassment Falls made against the county in December 2015 that concluded Falls wasn't subjected to a hostile work environment and should have welcomed the advice and mentoring of county officials. 8. Horseback hero Robert Borba, 28, an Eagle Point rancher, claimed hearts across America when word spread that he'd lassoed a would-be bicycle thief in the Walmart parking lot June 10. Borba had been loading supplies in his truck as he prepared to head out to brand cattle when he heard a woman calling out that a bicycle had been stolen. Borba quickly brought out his trusty steed Long John, which he'd brought to help him with the cattle, from the back of his trailer. The cowboy and his horse then chased after the thief as he struggled with the gears, ditched the bike and started running on foot. Borba grabbed his rope and let it fly, lassoing the man around his legs and dragging him like a roped cow to the end of the parking lot where he was held until police arrived. Borba's heroism landed him a trip to Chicago, where he demonstrated his lassoing skills on "The Steve Harvey Show" Aug. 31. 9. Runner's death The death of ultramarathon runner Todd Ragsdale last January sent shock waves through the running community. Ragsdale was 46 when he went missing the morning of Jan. 28, after driving from his Talent home to the Ashland watershed for a run. Ragsdale, who was nursing a hamstring injury at the time, was dressed in a light jacket and running shorts. After a search involving dozens of personnel from eight counties and volunteers with Southern Oregon Runners, Ragsdale's body was found Jan. 30 along the edge of Ashland Creek upstream from the Granite Street reservoir. Authorities were unable to determine the cause of death, though there was no trauma to his body, and toxicology reports returned negative.  10. Missing doctor Seven months after Ragsdale's death, another ultra-distance runner went missing: Ashley Laird, a Jacksonville physician. Laird did not return after a morning run Aug. 26, prompting a search-and-rescue effort involving hundreds of volunteers. But this story ended happily: Laird was found by searchers — including her father — on a trail in Forest Park two days later. She was lost, dehydrated, disoriented, scraped up and with a bump on her head, rescuers said. Laird's medical license was placed in inactive status the following Monday pending the outcome of an investigation by the Oregon Medical Board, which is ongoing; Laird's husband, Dan Arnold, said the investigation was not related to Laird being lost in the woods.

The AHA has created an online recipe hub where you can find more than 350 heart-healthy recipes, along with nutritional information and more than 100 short videos that highlight cooking techniques, hacks and tips. Chef Hamlet Garcia, AHA’s Go Red For Women spokesperson, said the recipes keep meal preparation simple, quick and affordable. “With just a simple click of a button, consumers will have heart-healthy meal suggestions and cooking tips ready at their fingertips,” Garcia said. A customizable recipe "box" The recipe hub, which is hosted nationally by Fresh Avocados – Love One Today®, is available in both English and Spanish. It allows users to create personal profiles where they can build customized recipe boxes, find, sort and rate recipes, as well as share tips and recipes via social media. It also offers a sophisticated search capability to find recipes with one’s favorite ingredients or exclude recipes with ingredients that one may be sensitive to or simply dislikes. The hub supports the AHA’s Simple Cooking with Heart Program, funded nationally by Walmart Foundation, which focuses on improving nutrition by equipping consumers with cooking skills to cook more often at home. The color initiative It also ties in with AHA’s newest campaign, +color, and provides consumers with another tool to help make smarter, healthier eating choices. The +color initiative emphasizes the focusing on the positive health impact of fruits and vegetables.  Heart disease is the number one killer for all Americans and stroke is the fifth leading cause of death. Hispanics and Latinos, however, face even higher risks of cardiovascular disease because of high blood pressure , obesity and diabetes. There is good news in the fact that a few simple lifestyle changes can reduce the chances of getting these diseases, and one of those changes can be as simple as cooking heart healthy recipes. The hub is located on the American Heart Association’s website, heart.org/recipes. Did you enjoy this article? Click here to subscribe to ISHN.

A Full List Of Restaurant And Store Hours For January 1 BuzzWorthy 14 0 0 December 31, 2016 New Year’s Day 2017: What’s Open Or Closed Today? A Full List Of Restaurant And Store Hours For January 1 Nathan Francis New Year’s Day 2017 can be a bit tricky for anyone trying to find out what’s open or looking to figure out store or restaurant hours, but you can find all the help you need right here. The first day of 2017 also happens to fall on the end of the weekend, so some stores that are normally open full hours may be a bit limited and others that are normally closed will be open a bit longer to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of post-holiday shoppers before they head back to work and into the winter grind. So if you’re planning to run a few errands on New Year’s Day 2017, it might be a bit of a mystery to figure out what’s open and what’s closed. To help out the planning, below you can find a full list of what’s open or closed plus store and restaurant hours for January 1. What’s closed on New Year’s Day 2017? This is where the tricky part comes in. This year, New Year’s Day happens to fall on a Sunday, so government offices will be closed down including the U.S. Post Office and local offices. Banks will also be closed on New Year’s Day, but because the federal holiday falls on a Sunday, many will be closed on Monday as well and not re-open until Tuesday. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] There will be some various other locations closed on New Year’s Day, including liquor stores in certain states, like Massachusetts. A full list of state-by-state liquor store restrictions on New Year’s Day (as well as New Year’s Eve) can be found here. Some grocery stores and supermarkets are also closed on New Year’s Day, including Aldi, Trader Joe’s, and Costco. And there are at least two fast-food restaurants closed on January 1 — Chick Fil-A, which is closed on Sundays anyway, and Chipotle. What’s open on New Year’s Day 2017? Aside from the locations listed above, there aren’t many other locations that are actually closed on New Year’s Day. Many people look to start the new year with some shopping or a trip to the restaurant, so these locations are open to accommodate for the crowds. But there are still some that operate on limited hours. Below are a list of store hours for New Year’s Day. Best Buy — Open noon to 6 p.m. Dollar General — Open regular hours Fresh Market — Open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Home Depot — Open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Kmart — Open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Kohl’s — Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Lowe’s — Open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Publix — Some stores close at 7 p.m., others open regular hours Starbucks — Open 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Target — Open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Walgreens — Some locations open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., 24-hour locations open regular schedule Walmart — Regular store hours Most restaurants are also open on New Year’s Day, including Applebee’s, Denny’s, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s, IHOP, and Red Lobster. [Image by Tim Boyle/Getty Images] There will be plenty of other destinations open on New Year’s Day for those looking for a chance to get out of the house and enjoy the last day off before going back to work. This includes movie theaters, which are geared up for a busy day with moviegoers headed out to the holiday-season blockbusters as well as the Oscar favorites that always seem to come out around the end of the year. Many museums are open as well, looking to take advantage of end-of-holiday traffic, but this is not universal so it’s best to plan ahead and check on the hours. There will be many other smaller and locally owned stores and restaurants open on New Year’s Day, but again for locations like this it’s best to check their website or call ahead to make sure they’re on regular hours.

SEE: Vernon County company helps individuals develop job skills "When I had my interview they were willing to try different things with me," said Andrew White, a familiar face at Sam's Club in Onalaska. White began working at the Onalaska store a few months ago and said the soft skill sets he learned through VARC's Employment and Training Program helped prepare him for his current position.  Elizabeth Filter, Executive Vice President of VARC said it can be difficult and intimidating for some people to find employment. "We've developed life skills, services for example that help teach soft skills related to learning about employment, learning about what someone's goals and objectives may be in their employment path, how to start searching in an employment realm," said Filter. Since 2014, VARC and Insite have helped develop more than 350 employment opportunities for individuals with varying disabilities, according to Filter.  "When Insight came on and said hey, we're going to try you at a new location. I'm all for it.," added White. His supervisor, Scott Gran the Member Services Manager at Sam's Club said he's the perfect guy to have on their team. "He's got a lot of energy. He's willing to learn. He's very personable and friendly with the members," said Gran. Walmart Stores Incorporated is the leading company in the country for employing individuals with disabilities. Providing the opportunity for work, relationships, and growth. Somethings that are sometimes overlooked by other businesses. "When we hire what we look at is what they can bring to the club and what they bring for people. Andrew has a great personality and he loves to interact with other people as you can see so that's really what we focus in on," added Gran. White's story is just one example of the countless people who have gained job skills, "It was kind of fun working at VARC and learning new capabilities," said White. A true testament to the power of an idea and a small group of people in action. VARC now has six different locations throughout Wisconsin, customizing their services and training techniques for those involved with the program, like White.

(Reuters) NEW YORK: In 2016, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index jumped 9.5 percent and bounced back from a flat result the year before, and energy companies and banks made some of the largest gains as investors bet on a stronger economy that will lead to more lending and spending. Healthcare companies slumped as drug prices came under intense scrutiny. Here is a look at how the 11 industry sectors in the S&P 500 fared for the year: ENERGY: Up 23.7 percent At the beginning of the year it looked like 2016 would be another painful one for energy companies. In February oil traded at $26 a barrel, down from more than $100 in mid-2014. But over the next few months oil prices rose gradually rose above $50, which reduced the scope of their losses. Late in the year, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil producers agreed to cut their production in 2017. FINANCIALS: Up 20.1 percent Banks and other financial companies sank early in 2016 as investors worried about slowing global economic growth. After that they struggled as the Federal Reserve continually held off on raising interest rates. But the sector caught fire leading up to the election and afterward, as investors felt banks will be major beneficiaries of a Donald Trump administration. Banks stand to benefit from increased government spending and borrowing connected to greater spending on infrastructure, as well as faster economic growth, looser regulations and rising interest rates. Huge gains in the weeks after the election took bank stocks to their highest levels since 2008. INDUSTRIALS: Up 17.8 percent Companies that make construction equipment, engines and aircraft also made large gains as the US economy picked up steam. Investors bet that the election of Trump, and a Republican Congress that could approve his spending proposals, will lead to more spending on construction, manufacturing, and transportation. TELECOM: Up 16.1 percent Phone company stocks surged early in 2016 as the market got off to a historically bad start. Investors bought those stocks, which are often compared to bonds because of their large dividend yields and relative stability. Low bond yields have helped make the small sector attractive as well, drawing in investors who sought income. Later the stocks gradually lost steam as investors saw signs the economy was picking up and hoped for faster growth. Thanks to AT&T’s biggest gain since 2006, the stocks ultimately bounced back from two years of declines. MATERIALS: Up 14.1 percent Companies that make materials like packaging, specialty chemicals and mine for metals also rebounded, partly because precious metals prices bounced back in 2016 after several years of losses. Copper, which is linked to expectations for economic growth because of its uses in construction, climbed 17 percent. Higher metals prices led to big gains for gold and copper producer Freeport-McMoran, gold miner Newmont Mining and steel maker Nucor. Building materials companies like Martin Marietta also climbed. UTILITIES: Up 12.2 percent With government bond yields at their lowest levels in many years and investors nervous about the state of the economy, utility companies were in the unusual position of leading the market in early 2016. Electric and gas utilities were a safe harbor for worried investors. But as confidence in the economy picked up, they lost that leadership position. Overall they recovered the previous year’s losses and rose a bit more than the S&P 500. TECHNOLOGY: Up 12 percent Technology companies rose for the eighth year in a row. The stocks surged this summer as the US economy appeared to gain strength, while critical overseas markets also looked healthier. The technology sector did not do as well following the election, however, as investors wondered if Trump’s trade and immigration policies and his inflammatory rhetoric would hurt their sales overseas. Graphics processor company Nvidia more than tripled in value and performed better than any other S&P 500 stock, while Hewlett-Packard’s breakup left two stocks that both did well. CONSUMER STAPLES: Up 2.6 percent Companies that make and sell common household goods are generally considered a safe investment. But in 2016, investors preferred stocks that will benefit more from faster economic growth. The stocks did rise for the 8th consecutive year, however. Food distributor Sysco climbed 35 percent after it acquired European competitor Brakes, and Wal-Mart made a partial recovery after a 27-percent drop last year. REAL ESTATE: Up less than 0.1 percent Real estate has been one of the strongest-performing asset classes in recent years. That has been good news for real estate investment trusts, which were split off as a separate sector this year. Investors poured money into REITs starting in February, when the market reached its recent lows. But starting in the summer, faster growth in the US economy made other types of investments more appealing. HEALTHCARE: Down 4.4 percent Drug makers were pummeled in 2016 as their pricing strategies came under repeated criticism and Congressional scrutiny. Investors wondered if the government would intervene to reduce those hikes. Biotechnology companies like Vertex and Alexion were hit especially hard. Endo slumped thanks to legal costs and weak earnings and Mylan fell during a controversy over the rising price of its EpiPen allergy shot. Some insurance companies, including UnitedHealth and Aetna, traded higher. One reason is that Wall Street thinks the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act will strengthen their profits. Overall, health care stocks fell for the first time since 2008. Facebook STAY CONNECTED Follow @Arab_News Tweets by @Arab_News Download The App!

Perhaps the most worrisome for booksellers and publishers is that the worst sales week was the most recent, with sales decreasing 11% in the last two weeks leading up to Christmas. Walmart and other big box retailers saw their book sales fall 24% last week and sales through the retail and club channel were down 8%. One of the reasons why sales are down is due to no big blockbuster titles in the juvenile nonfiction category, which declined 8% compared to a year ago, while sales of adult fiction were off 12% in the week. It looks like the publishing industry desperately needs a new Hunger Games or a new Harry Potter novel, that is not a screenplay.

Instead of investing in new authors producing quality works, they just threw together a bunch of Junior College level black & white art (even the art in the Star Trek books is flat-out terrible) and called it a book. It cost them, because they weren’t out chasing after new talent, now they have no new Harry Potter, no new Hunger Games and they certainly can’t rely on George RR Martin to ever finish another book. (He’s busy driving his rascal around every Sci Fi convention in the country.) The quality fiction is out there, the next Harry Potter is out there, but you will never find it hiding behind a stack of coloring books. Michael Kozlowski Yeah, I think heavily promoting the harry potter screenplays was a bad idea. I mean they are screenplays and not a real book, although Scholastic had a huge quarter due to those books. Robbie Lowe I guess someone thought it worked for shakespear’s plays it could work now days even though today’s generation doesn’t get something wrote as a script. Though I think another part is there is a major decline of the number of book stores to market too the public Michael Kozlowski I think what Amazon is doing with their bookstores is a glimpse into the future of bookselling. If only B&N would wise up and use their e-com platform to drive more books that actually sell into their physical bookstores.

The charges were filed after an investigation into a $599 theft from the Target store on Dec. 10. An arrest warrant was obtained for Davern after it was discovered that she had two prior retail theft convictions. Davern’s whereabouts are unknown and anyone with information is asked to call 610-363-0200. The following police reports were released by state and local police departments. WEST CHESTER Gerald D. Myers, 41, of Exton, was charged with DUI after an alleged crash in the 50 block of North High Street at about 8:30 p.m. Dec. 23. WEST WHITELAND Adam Kannah, 19, Melvin Togba, 20, and Vakaba William, 19, all of Philadelphia, were arrested on Dec. 19. They were each charged with forgery, possession of an instrument of crime, theft by unlawful taking, retail theft, receiving stolen property, criminal conspiracy and corruption of minors. The charges were filed after officers were dispatched to the H&M store for subjects allegedly passing or attempting to pass counterfeit bills in the store to purchase merchandise. Advertisement The three subjects, and a 17-year-old juvenile, were arrested at the store. The juvenile was released to his parents. Kannah, Togba and William were arraigned by Magisterial District Judge John Bailey and remanded to Chester County Prison after being unable to post bail. Theodore Beckham, 55, of Philadelphia, was arrested on Dec. 19. He was charged with identity theft, access device fraud, forgery and theft by deception. The charges were filed after officers were dispatched to the Benari Jewelers on Main Street for a report of a subject possibly using another person’s personal information to buy jewelry. Investigators responded to the scene and made contact with Beckham. The investigators were able to determine that Beckham had attempted to purchase $6,193 in jewelry using a counterfeit driver’s license and the personal information of a New Jersey resident. Beckham was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge John Bailey. He was remanded to Chester County Prison after failing to post $25,000 cash bail. Edward Everett, 47, of Coatesville, was charged with possession of a suspected controlled substance and drug paraphernalia on Dec. 19. The charges were filed after officers responded to the Longhorn Steakhouse to assist Pennsylvania State Constables who had Everett in custody after serving an arrest warrant. The constables reportedly found the contraband on Everett’s person, which led to the charges. Javaughn Campbell, 23, of Coatesville, was charged with possession of suspected marijuana and drug paraphernalia on Dec. 20. The charges were filed after an officer investigated a suspicious vehicle in a parking garage at the Exton Square Mall. The officer made contact with Campbell who was in the vehicle. The contraband was recovered from Campbell during the interaction. Campbell was charged by criminal summons. Jamie DiAntonio, 24, of West Chester, was charged with public drunkenness on Dec. 21. The charges were filed after officers responded to the Wal-Mart store for a report of a female kicking the front doors of the store. The officers made contact with DiAntonio who appeared intoxicated. She was cited and released to a relative. Deborah Butler, 58, of Coatesville, was charged with retail theft, receiving stolen property and theft by deception on Dec. 22. The charges were filed after officers responded to the Boscov’s store for a reported $292 theft. Butler was released on a criminal summons. Two juveniles from Coatesville were charged with retail theft on Dec. 24. The juveniles were charged after officers responded to the Boscov’s store for a reported $76 theft. Each juvenile was issued a retail theft citation and released to relatives.

ON AIR NOW6:00 PM - 7:00 PMGlobal News Hour at 6 Iconic discount store Honest Ed's closes Saturday after 68 years Neil Kumar December 31, 2016 10:41 am West Annex News / CC Saturday was the final day of existence for perhaps what was the most popular store in Toronto since its inception. Honest Ed’s has closed its doors for good after they shut down shop at the corner of Bathurst and Bloor Streets Saturday evening. Customers have known for the past three years that the iconic store was getting set to close down with all kinds of memorabilia being sold since. Previously, items like store signs and shelves were auctioned off to those interested in collecting parts of the historic discount store, which was in business for 68 years and setting a trend that stores like Walmart have learned to adapt over the years. The historic building was always known for its famous signs and affordable prices and it was sold by the Mirvish family in 2013 to a developer, which plans to build a housing complex with stores and restaurants. Theatre mogul Ed Mirvish founded Honest Ed’s in 1948 and ran it for almost 60 years until he died in 2007.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com A 'pretty good' year for the St. Louis economy likely to be followed by more of the same By Jim Gallagher • St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jim Gallagher Dec 31, 2016 (…) Shelby Kardell A view of the Gateway Arch and the St. Louis skyline. Photo by Shelby Kardell, skardell@post-dispatch.com The St. Louis area had a pretty good year in 2016, economically speaking — with pay and jobs both headed up. Unless something big and nasty happens — which is hard to predict — some local forecasters expect more modest improvement this year. First, let’s look at what we know so far about 2016. • The region’s unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent as of October. That’s low by historical standards, and it has been hovering around that level since mid-2015. • Lots of people got a raise. As of October, the last figures available, income per person was up 2.3 percent in Missouri and 2.6 percent in Illinois. That kept spending power ahead of inflation. “We’re seeing pretty steady wage growth,” said Charles Gascon, regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. • Parts of the metro area are experiencing a mini-boom in building. Residential building permits were up 10 percent for the year, as of October. Cranes were sprouting as apartment and condo projects rose around the region, especially in the central corridor. World Wide Technologies is building a new headquarters in Maryland Heights, which is also seeing a hotel boom. Centene was planning to expand its Clayton domain by another block with a new high-rise office, retail space and parking, and the second phase of Ballpark Village is finally close to breaking ground next to Busch Stadium. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay was hoping voters will help finance a new stadium to land a major league soccer team, although prospects dimmed considerably after Gov.-elect Eric Greitens said he was opposed to public subsidies for such a project. The coming year should be good for builders, as well, says Gascon, although the pace of growth may slow. “The crane count will be up a little bit.” On the downside, St. Louis continued its slow slide from headquarters city status to branch-plant town, as Monsanto Co. planned to sell itself to Germany’s Bayer AG, and a competitor bought discount broker Scottrade, planning to move the bulk of its business to Omaha, Neb. So what will 2017 bring? “More of the same, assuming the country produces more of the same,” said Howard Wall, an economics professor who tracks the regional economy from Lindenwood University in St. Charles. That gets to a truth about the St. Louis economy. From the outside, St. Louis looks like a big-business town — home to the likes of Monsanto and Edward Jones, hosting big operations that include Wells Fargo Advisors, Boeing and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It’s a regional medical hub and base for hospital giants such as BJC HealthCare and SSM Health. But the region’s economy is actually extremely diverse — we make steel and brass and chocolate bars, ship corn by the barge-full and sell insurance to Germans and Japanese. We do a lot of other stuff, too. A few businesses — stock brokering and aerospace, for instance — have an outsize footprint here. But mainly, the regional economy looks like America in miniature. As a result, the St. Louis regional economy tends to move in the same direction as the nation. “What happens to the U.S. hits us, usually harder,” Wall said. There is no doubt that St. Louis has been adding jobs, but there’s uncertainty about how many. As of October, the official monthly figures from the Labor Department say we’ve added 35,200 jobs over the past year, a 2.6 percent gain. Wall doesn’t believe it. “Last year was pretty strong, but not as strong as the data indicate,” he said. Gascon, the Fed economist, agrees. As more accurate numbers arrive, he expects the job gain to be revised down to 1.3 percent for the year. “That’s pretty good for St. Louis, when you look at the long-term trend,” he says. After all, St. Louis population is slow-growing, and lots of boomers are retiring. As long as the region adds more jobs than it has willing workers, unemployment will decline and wages should go up. “Anecdotal evidence suggests a lack of skilled labor will continue to put upward pressure on wages,” said the St. Louis Fed in its latest report on the regional economy. The big marquee business names of St. Louis draw lots of attention, obscuring the region’s reliance on thousands of small and mid-sized employers. That’s where most of the job growth comes from. The good news is that small and mid-ranked companies are growing in St. Louis. “We’ve seen pretty good traction in those key metrics,” Gascon said. However, St. Louis does seem to lag in terms of new businesses starting from scratch. The Kauffman Index of Startup Activity ranks St. Louis 36 out of 40 metro areas this year. The region was ranked 38 in 2015. If the St. Louis economy follows the nation, then its fate will be influenced by President-elect Donald Trump. Wall thinks Trump may improve the economy, if he doesn’t start a trade war first. Trump promises less regulation. For instance, he’s likely to ditch President Barack Obama’s decision to broaden the number of workers eligible to earn overtime. Trump has threatened higher tariffs against goods made in China and Mexico, and pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. A tit-for-tat trade war would have repercussions on St. Louis businesses. Some factories, for instance, may find it more expensive to import parts and raw materials, which can slow their sales and hiring. “There are all these interconnected ways that trade affects everybody,” Wall says. The Republican-controlled Missouri Legislature is expected to quickly enact a “right-to-work” law — and Greitens has promised to sign it. The law would make it illegal to require payment of union dues as a condition of employment, as some union labor contracts do. The effect would be to weaken union finances. The change should have little immediate impact, but the effect could grow over the longer term if the state is seen as more business-friendly. In 2016, West Virginia became the 26th state to adopt a right-to-work law. Among major stories of 2016 that will continue making headlines in 2017: Big deals The corporate deal fever that swept the nation in 2016 claimed at least two big corporate names in the St. Louis area, but the effect on local jobs and decision-making won’t be felt right away. Monsanto, the Creve Coeur seed and biotech behemoth, has been a St. Louis mainstay since it started making a sugar substitute in 1901. But Bayer AG won over Monsanto’s board in September with a $66 billion offer — the largest all-cash offer on record — and the Monsanto corporate name likely will disappear after the German drug, pesticide and agriculture conglomerate wins regulatory approval for the deal, something the companies expect in 2017. +5  Buy Now Robb Fraley, (right), Monsanto's chief technology officer, and Liam Condon, with Bayer, speak to business reporters on Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016, at Monsanto's headquarters in Creve Coeur. Bayer and Monsanto announced a $66 billion deal to merge Wednesday. Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com Christian Gooden Bayer has promised it will invest in the area’s research capabilities and said that St. Louis will remain North American commercial headquarters and global headquarters for the seed and genetic trait business. With 4,000 corporate and research jobs in the region, many of them cutting-edge scientific jobs in an industry regional leaders see as a growth opportunity, there’s a lot riding on those promises. More certain to deal a blow to St. Louis jobs and its status as a financial services hub is the loss of Scottrade to rival TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade reached a $4 billion deal to acquire the Town and Country-based discount brokerage in October amid an industry struggling to stay competitive with the ever cheapening cost of online trading. TD Ameritrade has already indicated St. Louis is likely to lose at least 800 jobs and as many as 1,300 by the time it finishes swallowing up Scottrade and its 1,800-person workforce here. The deal is expected to close in September. Other local companies acquired in 2016 include: +5  Buy Now Scottrade offices are seen at 12800 Corporate Hill Drive in unincorporated St. Louis County on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016.

The Isle corporate headquarters, which employs about 100 in Creve Coeur, will move to Reno, Nev., when the deal is completed this year. • SunEdison Semiconductor, the O’Fallon, Mo.-based maker of silicon wafers to the electronics industry, which was sold to Taiwanese firm GlobalWafers Co. for $683 million. The deal was completed in December. • Save-A-Lot, which was sold in October by parent Supervalu Inc. to Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp. for $1.37 billion. The discount chain, which has about 800 local employees, is expected to keep its headquarters in Earth City. • Wehrenberg Theatres, the family-owned movie theater chain based in Des Peres, which was sold in November to Milwaukee-based Marcus Theatres, a division of Marcus Corp., for an undisclosed amount. Retail pain The trend toward online shopping continued unabated in 2016 — and that’s having a dramatic effect on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Merchants are rethinking their real estate strategy and expanding their pickup and delivery options. Wal-Mart, now the No. 1 grocer in the St. Louis metro area, introduced online grocery ordering with curbside pickup at several of its local stores in 2016. Expect other retailers to follow suit. E-commerce giant Amazon continues to build its distribution network — it added two big fulfillment centers in the Metro East in 2016 — and it’s pushing hard with other innovations that could eventually make their way to St. Louis, including deliveries by drone and brick-and-mortar stores with automated checkout.

Chesterfield Mall, one of the largest malls in the region, went into foreclosure in 2016, and several of its key tenants — including Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma and The Limited — recently announced they were closing. Whether anchor tenant Dillard’s, which was damaged in September when a water main ruptured, will reopen is unclear. +5  Buy Now A third floor water leak pools in the lower entrance to Dillard's at the Chesterfield Mall after it was closed Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016.

The property’s new owner is seeking to add new uses such as office space, to fill storefronts formerly occupied by retailers. Coal revival? Two hometown coal giants and a solar energy company ended up in bankruptcy court in early 2016 — for different reasons. How they rebound will have a lot to do with the Trump administration’s energy policy, which is expected to be friendlier to fossil fuels than renewables. Creve Coeur-based Arch Coal emerged from bankruptcy in October; Peabody Energy recently submitted a plan of reorganization and expects to exit bankruptcy this spring. Peabody recently redoubled its commitment to St. Louis, extending the lease on its downtown headquarters. Trump’s victory signals a new attitude in Washington toward the industry, with the incoming administration expected to loosen regulations and scuttle the Clean Power Plan, which could prop up demand for the carbon-intensive fuel. +5  This Jan. 27, 2009, file photo shows Peabody Energy headquarters in St. Louis.  (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) The Associated Press Meanwhile, though the solar industry overall continues to make gains in generation capacity and cost competitiveness, the shadows closed in on locally founded solar company, SunEdison, which has been in bankruptcy since April and announced sweeping rounds of layoffs in the following months. The Maryland Heights-based company had once been the country’s fastest-growing renewable energy developer but attained a crippling debt of $12 billion after a period of acquisitions. North side redevelopment Many St. Louisans may remember 2016 as the year the city lost the Rams NFL franchise, but 2016 also marked one of the city’s biggest economic development wins in years. A $1.75 billion campus to house the western headquarters of a federal mapping and surveillance agency will be built in north St. Louis, hopefully extending some redevelopment momentum beyond the region’s central corridor. For years, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s 3,000 employees have worked out of offices on the historic armory site near the Anheuser-Busch brewery. When it announced in 2014 that it would need a new home, the risk that the NGA would leave St. Louis was real. After weighing several offers, including a free site next to Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, NGA Director Robert Cardillo picked St. Louis on March 31. Now comes the daunting task of preparing 100 acres of urban land that until recently had 88 occupied structures. By the end of 2017, the city is supposed to hand over the 100-acre site, ready for construction, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. That means buildings will be demolished, streets torn up, old infrastructure removed and the land graded. Lots contaminated with the remnants of 20th century habitation — asbestos, heating oils, household chemicals — will require remediation. +5  The proposed NGA site in St. Louis, as seen looking southeast towards the St. Louis skyline on Thursday, March 17, 2016. Jefferson Avenue can be seen on the right side of the photo. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com David Carson The area should begin to change markedly in the coming months. The first noticeable change will be the demolition of the few remaining houses on the land just north of downtown. A $30 million federal grant to rebuild the nearby Preservation Square housing complex and redo 14th Street may also begin to shape the area. With the NGA heading north, watch for developer Paul McKee to finally show some progress in the area. He has touted his NorthSide Regeneration plan for years, with little to show for it despite large public subsidies pledged for the project. Years of lawsuits tying up the project are behind McKee, and the uncertainty over the NGA’s new location is past. He appears to have cleared up some of his recent financial issues after selling some land for the NGA site back to the city, and over the summer he exercised a long-held option to buy the former Pruitt-Igoe public housing site. With those obstacles out of the way, expect McKee to break ground on at least some aspect of the NorthSide development, even if it’s only symbolic. Missing links? The future of MetroLink expansion remains uncertain, and 2017 will be a key year in determining whether — and where, and maybe even when — a new route gets built. The proposed Northside-Southside route has seen much more momentum than other expansions primarily in St. Louis County. Mayor Francis Slay, whose tenure ends in April, is pushing a half-cent sales tax hike that could appear on the April ballot to fund the north-south route, which already has been chosen to get federal funding to take a look at transit-oriented development, and a $2 million in city parking funds will be used to study to evaluate that route. The 2.2-mile Loop Trolley is set to open this spring and will link the Delmar Loop to Forest Park with a turnaround at the Missouri History Museum. Testing is underway.

Picture: Supplied Durban – 2016 hasn’t all been doom and gloom. Amid the shock of Brexit, Trump and the various #MustFall campaigns, there was some light relief. Here are some of the more unusual, bizarre or downright stupid stories that made it across the world this year *** ‘Surprise! I’m still alive!” These are the words Noela Rukundo uttered to her husband when she gatecrashed her own funeral in Melbourne. In February the BBC broke the story of how Rukundo had been visiting her native Burundi from Australia when she was kidnapped by a group of masked men, who said her husband had ordered her death. Tied to a chair in a warehouse, Rukundo recalls hearing her husband’s voice echoing from one of the men’s cellphones: “Kill her”. Rukundo spoke of her ordeal at the trial and sentencing of her husband, Belenga Kalala, 39, to nine years for his part in trying to have her killed. She was freed by her captives after two days. But they told her husband she was dead. She returned to confront her husband and heard he had organised a memorial service. She stormed into her sham funeral to deliver revenge. Spotting her husband among the crowd of mourners, Rukundo bravely walked towards him. *** Also in February, a former Russian child actor won the prize of a lifetime – the chance to live with a porn star for a month. Ruslan Schedrin, 16, was the 100000th visitor to a games website and was offered the prize of shacking up with adult actress Ekaterina Makarova in Moscow. “I didn’t believe it at first,” Schedrin told Life News. “But when it turned out to be true, I was so happy. I saw her and I liked everything. She has got good sizes and so on. I am looking forward to our meeting, everything is boiling inside me. “I have told my mother and she has taken it badly, but I think we’ll sort it out.” “I am absolutely against it,” Vera Schedrina said. “He has got exams. They should give us 100000 roubles instead. How could they get such an idea for a 16-year-old boy? I am shocked.” Makarova is in favour of the meeting, saying 16 is “a good age to be independent”. She also refused to rule out the idea of having sex with Schedrin. *** After a burglary at a taxidermy warehouse in London on March 1, police launched an appeal to help locate a stuffed chimpanzee dressed in a tie and top hat, and a number of its furry friends. The Huffington Post reported that thieves broke into a warehouse in Wandsworth, south-west London, and used angle grinders to force their way into the premises. The chimp was among 18 animals stolen. A penguin, giraffe, lion and sloth are among the missing items. *** Soon after Britain voted for Brexit in June, one internet jokester put Prime Minister David Cameron (who quit after the result was finalised) up for sale, but the killjoys at eBay deleted the listing. The description read: “Used Prime Minister. No longer needed. Needs a bit of TLC. No box or instructions. Buyer must collect. Seller not prepared to touch item. Pick up from central London, address will be supplied on completion of sale. Buyer must arrange own transport.” The condition was described as: “For parts, not working”. The auction had 153 bids with one buyer offering £65900 (R1.1 million). *** A Hungarian weatherman was fired after pretending to fart on television. Szilard Horvath used sound effects to make it look like he was breaking wind to illustrate gusty conditions in the landlocked European nation. He was fired when bosses failed to see the funny side. *** In April a resident in Belhaven, Mississippi, managed to get the city council to attend to a damaged road after two years – by throwing a birthday party for a pothole. Eddie Prosser was tired of the inaction after 14 phone calls had failed to make a difference. After the tongue-in-cheek protest was featured on the local news, city workers came and filled the huge hole. *** In June a Washington, DC, restaurant became locked in a war of words after a woman allegedly defecated in their dining room then left a bad review online. The Huffington Post reported that the woman, named only as Emma C, used Yelp to leave a one-star rating for Nick’s Riverside Grill, accusing the bartender of overcharging her for a drink. Manager Liz S replied, accusing Emma C of losing control of her bowels in the middle of the restaurant and sitting in it for the rest of the evening. “We had to remove our patrons so they didn’t walk through your mess. You then proceeded to throw your underwear in our trash can and our poor manager was left to clean up your faeces,” read her reply. *** One unlucky reveller used the internet when he begged strangers to help him find the trousers he was wearing when he went out on the town. Canadian Andy Gaudry was visiting Halifax for his grandmother’s 80th birthday in early June when he got so inebriated he managed to lose his charcoal Calvin Klein chinos, and woke up with no memory of where he left them. Posting on Reddit, he asked people for help locating his pants. “I blacked out and don’t know where I would have taken my pants off,” he wrote. His pants were handed in at his hotel on the same day. *** Police officers were called into action over an “illegal” rubber duck race disrupting the peace in a Gloucestershire village on June 19. Bourton-on-the-water in the Cotswolds, UK, was hosting the event in an effort to raise money for a blood bank charity. Soon after 100 bright yellow rubber birds were let loose on the River Windrush, a disgruntled local called the police to invoke an ancient law that says the river may not be used for fundraising on a Sunday. Officers swept into action and threatened to arrest the organisers if the event wasn’t shut down. *** The Huffington Post also reported in July that Britons had been warned to stay alert because an unusually high number of seagulls were “tripping on acid” after eating flying ants. Experts said the hot weather had caused a mass emergence of the insects, which seagulls like to eat despite it affecting their cognitive behaviour. Dr Rebecca Nesbit of the Society of Biology said the ants contain formic acid, which can cause gulls to appear “drunk” and lose their inhibitions. *** A woman from Wayne, West Virginia, left her two beloved dogs in her car while she popped into Walmart, leaving the air conditioning on to ensure they didn’t get too hot. The Huffington Post reported she left the keys in her car, but somehow the dogs disengaged the hand brake. A witness saw the car rolling slowly towards her before jumping out of the way – when she noticed a dog was behind the wheel. The owner was able to drive her vehicle home. *** In one of the strangest and most amusing stories to come out of the Rio Olympic games, Paul Kelso, a journalist for Sky Sports, reported on August 5 that an Olympic kayaker had capsized after hitting a submerged couch. The report was not corroborated but organisers took it seriously enough to investigate. *** In August, a small Swedish town was rocked by a bizarre crime involving pig masks, sex, Pokémon and lasers. Two teenagers playing Pokémon Go were attacked with lasers by a pair wearing pig masks in Insjö* , which has just 2000 inhabitants. The attackers were later caught holding up traffic as they had sex at the town’s historic waterwheel. A Sheffield man cut off his toe in a hardware store with bolt cutters and then stood in the aisle and ate the toe, AP reported on October 30. South Yorkshire Police said: “The man was taken to hospital with injuries to his foot, where he remains. There are no other parties involved and the incident is not being investigated as a crime.” *** The Telegraph reported in November that a British adrenalin junkie had given new meaning to the phrase “high tea” – writing his name into Guinness World Records after completing the highest bungee dunk. Simon Berry, 24, of Sheffield, armed with a chocolate Hobnob, leapt from a platform about 75m above the ground to plant his biscuit into a tea-filled mug below. *** In December, African football chiefs were forced to outlaw witchcraft over fears players were using it to gain advantage. In a game between Rwandan Premier League teams Mukura Victory and Rayon Sports, a player apparently performed a ritual mid-game, and within seconds scored a goal. It was decided any player seen to take part in witchcraft would face a 100000 Rwandan francs (R1639) fine. *** Last week, The Independent on Saturday reported online that a bakkie stolen in Durban had been intercepted by the police while being towed across the Limpopo River by donkeys, on December 23. The image of the grey Toyota Hilux van, in the middle of the brown river, with the donkeys and the suspects wading in front of the vehicle, has been widely shared on social media. Limpopo SAPS spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said police had intercepted the smuggling of the vehicle from South Africa to Zimbabwe. “The vehicle was semi-submerged and the suspects were about to make use of five donkeys to pull it out towards the Zimbabwe side.” The suspects fled into Zimbabwe.

Businessman Benedict Kusay and his seven best friends have given an open invite for 'gorgeous women' to join them for a night of champagne, dance music and 'fireworks' aboard their rented yacht off the coast in Normandy.  Party time: In typical fashion, the Rich Kids of Instagram are seeing of 2016 in a flurry of champagne, multi-million villas, lavish ski-trips and VIP tables in the world's hottest clubs.

But their nights of wild partying and luxury are not worlds apart from any other weekend because, as Mr Ierna explained: 'Luxury is not a trend, it's a way of life.'   A YACHT, £6,000 WORTH OF ALCOHOL AND AN OPEN INVITATION TO 'BEAUTIFUL WOMEN' On board a luxury yacht somewhere off the coast of France, eight wealthy young men will be seeing in the New Year with 32 women. German entrepreneur Benedict Kusay, 21, and his close friends all chipped in to hire out the 121ft-long boat before putting out an open invitation for 'beautiful women' on their social media accounts. 'We are still looking for 22 beautiful woman who want to attend the party for free,' Bavaria-born Benedict wrote on Instagram four weeks ago. Much to the excitement of his friends in the comment section, he went on: 'We are offering free alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks (two barkeepers will be present), free food, free hookah.  'We are also planning to film an amazing mannequin challenge video so if you are willing to participate, this event is perfect for you.  Lap of luxury: Entrepreneur Benedict Kusay, pictured at the Le Bar cocktail bar in Frankfurt, is spending New Year's Eve on a rented yacht on the French coast Party prep: His Instagram followers were shown what he packed for his trip to France, where he and seven of his friends will party the night away. The items included two passports, two bottles of Belvedere vodka, a Louis Vuitton bag and wads of €50 notes The businessman promises 'great music, free boarding, free accommodation on the yacht and a lot of fireworks'. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a kitchen, living room, bar and three sun decks.  He told MailOnline how he and his friends, who he connected with over their mutual interests and wealth on Instagram, thought of the idea after a hunting party. Benedict added: 'We wanted to celebrate NYE together. We felt it would not be convenient to us to go to a club.  'Eight of us financed it, however my company paid for most of the positions. We invited women to come through an advertisement on the official RKOI page.' The group spent more than £6,000 stocking the yacht with 'masses' of Moet, Armand, Louis Roederer, Veuve, Dom Perignon, Belvedere vodka and whisky for the epic party - on top of the undisclosed fee it cost to rent the luxury boat. A Sunseeker yacht of the same length costs around £95,000 a week to rent.  Fast lane: Benedict promised the girls who attend their party 'great music, free boarding, free accommodation on the yacht and a lot of fireworks'.

Because the people who can afford them don't sit around and watch TV all day' 'All my favourite things': This photo of a bottle of Dom Perignon, designer shopping bags, a £300 Hermes belt and a wad of €50 notes shows what businessman Benedict is packing 'It's about having fun and meeting new people, making each one's network grow,' he said. In one of his newest Instagram post he showed off his packing for the road trip to France. The items included: Two bottles of Belvedere vodka, a £300 black leather Hermes belt, keys to his Audi, a £500 Louis Vuitton travel bag, wads of €50 notes and two passports.  Benedict - whose Instagram account is replete with garish Lamborghinis, Versace shopping bags and high end vodka bottles - is studying for a Bachelors degree in commerce at the University of Melbourne. Alongside a photo of him behind the wheel of a Ferrari, he wrote: 'Who of you are already missing summer?' 'Unfortunately you can't go shopping with this car, the boot is so small,' the young businessman wrote next to another photo of himself standing by a yellow Lamorghini parked outside a Chanel store in Frankfurt. No expense spared: Benedict and his friends spent more than £6,000 stocking the yacht with 'masses' of Moet, Armand, Louis Roederer, Veuve, Dom Perignon, Belvedere vodka and whisky for the epic party The caption with another image featuring a wad of €50 notes, a bottle of Dom Perignon and a fluffy cat read: 'All my favourite things.' To those who criticise him for flaunting his lavish lifestyle, Tom says: 'I understand that some people like to waste their time complaining about others. 'I encourage these people to bring more positivity into their lives and focus on their dreams and goals.'   THE GLOBE TROTTING SPANIARD DANCING INTO 2017 IN THE 'IBIZA OF WINTER' Travel blogger Mon Rovi is swapping the five-star luxury of the Four Seasons in Bali for the ski slopes of Baqueira-Beret, in the heart of the Spanish Pyrenees. With the champagne flowing under the winter sun from 2pm, the Barcelona-born beauty says it won't be long before she and her stunning friends are the centre of attention at the swanky Moet Winter Lounge. 'What starts as an innocent glass of champagne ends up with everyone dancing on the tables!' she told MailOnline before jetting off to the 'Ibiza of Winter', whose exclusivity has made it a must-visit skiing hotspot for the rich and famous including the Spanish royal family. Glowing: Travel blogger Mon Rovi, pictured, 25, is leaving the Four Seasons hotel in Bali for the equally luxurious Spanish Pyrnees where she will be staying at her family's villa overlooking the picturesque valley of Baqueira-Beret Life of luxury: Mon and her friends - who are flying in from as far as Mexico - will start their celebrations at the very exclusive Moet Winter Lounge. 'What starts as an innocent glass of champagne ends up with everyone dancing on the tables!' she excitedly told MailOnline Wanderlust: Mon, who has travelled to eight countries in 2016, says she will start the day on her favourite champagne - the £100-a-bottle Ruinart which is aged in 200-year-old cellars She went on: 'The day time parties take place in the middle of the slopes. When people arrive to have a ski-break and then the DJ starts to put the music louder and the champagne keeps flowing.  MON'S 2016 TRAVEL LIST  The sensational cities, beaches and resorts visited by Mon in 2016 could easily populate one person's life-long bucket list. Excluding Baqueira, she has travelled to 17 cities across eight countries. They are: French Alps (Courchevel) United Arab Emirates (Dubai and Abu Dhabi) Spain (Sevilla, Madrid, Costa Brava, Ibiza, Formentera, Menorca) Poland (Warsaw) Greece (Mykonos for four-day birthday celebration) London for fashion week Mexico (Mexico City, San Luis Potosi, Cancun and Tulum)  Indonesian island of Bali  Now travelling to Baqueira, Spanish Pyrenees, for New Year's Eve 'We are definitely the life of the party! Wherever we go, you will notice us. I love dancing and having fun with my friends.  'It's [Baqueira] a very well kept secret. The ski resort is not as well known as Gstaad or St Mortiz and that's what makes it special.  Once they have had enough champagne (her drink of choice is the £100-a-bottle Ruinart which is aged in 200-year-old cellars) they will make the six-mile journey to the rustic town of Arties for a spot of lunch. A New Year's tasting menu at one of Mon's favourite restaurants, Biniaran, costs around £115.  From there they will see in the New Year at one of the village's low-key nightclubs where, as Spanish tradition dictates, they will eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight, although Mon says 'taking 12 sips of champagne does the trick'. Mon, whose father is a Spanish businessman and trade union leader, is staying at her family's sprawling home which overlooks the snow topped Val d'Aran valley. The nomadic Spaniard, who attended the £60,000-a-year Brillantmont boarding school in Switzerland, has previously spent New Year's with her family in the Seychelles, Puerto Rico, Bali, Mauritius, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.

She's also pictured partying with hotel heiress Paris Hilton at the Amnesia nightclub in Ibiza - where she was staying at the Ibiza Luxury Apartments - but she insists she does not use her social media to show off. Mon told MailOnline: 'I never flaunt my wealth, I take pictures of the places I travel to. 'I never intend to make anyone jealous, I intend to show my followers the beautiful places in the world I go to and inspire people to travel and explore the world around us.' Sun kissed: The nomadic Spaniard, pictured, has previously spent New Year's with her family in the Seychelles, Puerto Rico, Bali, Mauritius, the Dominican Republic and Mexico Humble: Despite her enviable snaps, including this one of her relaxing an infinity pool in Bali, Mon insists she does not flaunt her wealth: 'I never intend to make anyone jealous, I intend to show my followers the beautiful places in the world I go to and inspire people'   THE CZECH BEAUTY ENJOYING A ROMANTIC BREAK IN ABU DHABI  From her extravagant holiday destinations to her expensive clothing, fashion blogger Barbora Ondrackova is used to the finest things in life.

(Bill Wagner/The Daily News via AP) Posted: Saturday, December 31, 2016 1:02 am Disabled face challenges on road to employment Associated Press | LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) — It is just before noon on a Tuesday. Curtis Everman and Chelsea Klayum have half an hour to make their rounds to local businesses to find Everman a job. Everman's job folder listing his qualifications and past employment experience slides around on the back seat as Klayum winds her way through the Kelso-Longview area. Everman, 59, has developmental disabilities and gets help finding employment from Life Works, a Longview-based social services organization that supports people with mental and physical disabilities. Klayum, a Life Works employee, has been Everman's job coach for two months. But, Everman has been searching for a part-time job almost two years. He has applied to more than 40 employers. Klayum's time to help him search is sharply limited by regulations. And he has been frustrated at every turn, reported The Daily News (http://bit.ly/2hx8PBt). "I like to work fast and work my skills, (but) it takes a while," Everman said. Like Everman, the vast majority of people with mental and physical disabilities face chronic unemployment or underemployment, despite special state assistance aimed at helping them find work. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 17.5 percent of people with disabilities were employed in 2015, while 65 percent of the non-disabled population had jobs. Unemployment among disabled adults was double that of the non-disabled population. Over the last five years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, disabled people have made up about 15 percent of Cowlitz County's unemployed population. It takes the average disabled person 17 months to find some kind of job once he or she leaves high school in Cowlitz County, a period of time that includes applying for state-supported job search assistance, according to Life Works. Advocates for the disabled say the value of employing disabled people goes far beyond supplementing their bare-bones state disability income. It is good for them and the community. "So many of the folks have been told when they were younger, 'Oh, you'll never read. You'll never do this, you'll never do that.' They're reading. They live in the community. They have jobs," said Wendy Keegan, director of development at Life Works. "It's that sense of pride that they get with a little bit of support, that they can achieve their goals when they want to achieve their goals." Life Works executive director Dave Hill adds the disabled take the same satisfaction in a job well-done as does the rest of the work force. "I don't have any employees who are more proud to wear their work gear than the folks who have a disability. They are very proud." Roots of the problem The reasons for the employment difficulties are many. Some are obvious, others not readily apparent. The process to determine eligibility for state job assistance, for example, is lengthy and complex. And many employers are reluctant to hire a disabled person because jobs often have to be tailored to work around their disabilities. And over the last decade, the federal government has discouraged "closed shops" that employ people only with developmental disabilities. The focus has been on integrating disabled people into the regular workplace. In smaller communities, such as Cowlitz County, this requires social service organizations to make stronger ties with businesses to help disabled clients get jobs. "I think we've found niches to get into and find employment, but (this community) is not as big as Portland or Seattle, where there's a lot more opportunities. So you have to get very creative and you have to find those mom-and-pop shops that are willing to work with you a little bit. So that makes it a little bit harder," said Angie Whitcraft, director of client services at Life Works. Life Works itself runs three enterprises — Life Works Linen, ADC Janitorial and the Farm Dog Bakery. But, it also employs other people so the enterprises are fully integrated into the community, Hill said. They employ 17 disabled people in total who work six to 20 hours a week at minimum wage. At Linen Works, located in Longview, sheets of red, blue, gray, black and white are stacked neatly on a metal stand in the corner. A draft from the heater above ripples the gold fabric Cory Rogers is steaming. The smell of Pine Sol and other cleaning products envelops the small room. For 15 hours a week, Rogers, 46, steams, folds and launders linens at Linen Works, which rents out linens throughout the community. Rogers, who has a developmental disability, has had his job for almost four years. He likes to listen to heavy metal while he works. Although he struggles with folding the fitted sheets, he is meticulous, lining up the edges just so. Laminated signs hang on the back wall, reminding Rogers of his duties. His boss and co-workers say he has never had a bad day. "Cory does a variety of jobs, and he's pretty good at what he does," said Marie Caine, Linen Works manager. "He's succeeded here really well." Rogers works alongside those without disabilities as part of Linen Works' inclusionary model. Rogers said his favorite part is folding the sheets, and that he "really likes (his) job." Importance of the private sector Making a real dent in disability unemployment means getting private employers involved. Toward that effort, Life Works has eight job coaches, such as Klayum, who seek work opportunities and provide on-the-job assistance for clients with disabilities. Depending on the client's independence level, verbal abilities and physical abilities, how much they work, and how much time is needed, job coaches will get a set amount of hours from the government they can spend job hunting with their clients. Klayum only gets to help Curtis Everman once a month, twice if they're lucky. During these times, she likes to take him into the community to check on submitted job applications so employers can meet him and they can begin building relationships. Governmental restrictions on how many hours a coach can spend on a client can be tight, and that leads to many job coaches working unpaid hours to find clients jobs. "Seven hours a month is not enough time to find a job for someone with multiple barriers, so we do whatever it takes. We're always over-serving," said Debra Westerby, vocational coordinator at Life Works. "We want to get them jobs, that's just what we do. Sometimes that takes extra time." Other challenges to employment are that many disabled people depend on public transportation, limiting the hours they can be available to work. In addition, employers often find it hard to justify crafting jobs, tailoring them for a specific person's disabilities. "It's not easy sometimes for them (employers) to open that door. . Sometimes they're a little scared, a little apprehensive, they're just unsure. . You're looking at a whole bunch of people and you're trying to find jobs to fit them each individually," said Whitcraft, with Life Works. "This isn't scary. This is just an individual, just like you and I. . We have a great time here working with people with disabilities and with non-disabilities, and we want everyone to have a chance to do that." The Walmart Supercenter employs two or three employees with disabilities at its Seventh Avenue store in Longview, which has nearly 250 employees. Several years ago, the store created positions specifically for people with disabilities. For example, they involved greeting or placing inventory on shelves if that employee couldn't do some of the other tasks associated with a job, such as heavy lifting or lots of walking, said Patti Carroll, personnel manager at the store. Due to budgetary restraints, though, Walmart is no longer able to create those special positions. The store has to make sure the employee can do all the tasks associated with the job, Carroll said. "Not every opportunity is for everyone. . We have to hire them in an actual position," Carroll said. "It is a rewarding feeling to be able to help out someone with a disability, and I enjoy it. They're friendly with everyone, and it's very rewarding. . I wish I could do more." Disabled workers often are the most enthusiastic employees, and that's good for the community to see, say their advocates. "Once you see a person come to work and they come in and they're ready to go and they're happy . when people hire those individuals and they see that, it's infectious," said Whitcraft, with Life Works. "It's just kind of another reminder of that's really what life's about. Not taking things so seriously, just being happy with what you have, and they really give back that to people that employ them. And I think people are pleasantly surprised." ___ Information from: The Daily News, http://www.tdn.com © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Michael Noble Jr./The Washington Post From left, Annan Chamdin, Brian Mumpower, Hiba Kattih and Stephanie Mumpower chat while preparing meals for a Thanksgiving Day Murfreesboro Muslim Youth event. By Abigail Hauslohner / The Washington Post MUFREESBORO, Tenn. — It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a right-wing effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman co-sponsored a plan to “defund Muslim ‘refugees’ ” and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court. The town’s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people’s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126,000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal in 2015 when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn., 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump — a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims — is the president-elect, and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has called Islam a “cancer.” And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1,500. There has been a smattering of post-election harassment and insults — at schools, in parking lots, on the road — but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. “Right now, we’re hoping that it’s going to be calm,” said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. “But we don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm.” Murfreesboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing “melting pot,” a suburb of “little blue dot” Nashville and the “buckle on the Bible Belt.” Its downtown with the old courthouse and Confederate-soldiers memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20,000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail “for having the guts to kill an Islamo-fascist.” Among the town’s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque’s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends. There are people such as the self-described “right-wing Southern Baptist” shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right “to kill you and take your wife as a sex slave.” The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his health-sector company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said. On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr., a pastor at First Baptist Church, “we’re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims.” The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque’s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Wal-Mart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab’s family — three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy’s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Mr. Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their 12-year-old daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy’s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles — the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays — a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy’s parents eat pork, go to church and keep “a whole cabinet of Jesus statues” in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. “But at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she’ll say, ‘Oh, he only said that one time,’ ” Tammy said of her mother. “They don’t believe he’s going to do the things he said.” Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider “the things we might face” under Mr. Trump. “And she says, ‘Well, that’s your choice.’ ” Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows “a lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back.” But, she added, “even a lot of Muslims want people vetted. ... He’s not going to send any back that aren’t causing any trouble, I don’t think.” Mr. Kattih, who emigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. “I didn’t know you were one of them,” he remembered her saying the next time she came in. “I just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me.” The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don’t know enough about each other. Last year, Mr. Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. “What people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they’re afraid, they retract,” Mr. Kattih said. “And I think that’s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you’ll be surprised what hands reach out back.” A week after the election, the group’s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a meet-a-Muslim event on the university campus earlier this year, “most people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,” said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, W.Va., when her father became a genetics professor at the university. “We don’t have to change their views,” said Ms. Basant’s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, “but just make them aware that we aren’t what they think we are.” What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Mr. Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Mr. Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Mr. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Mr. Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need.

Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images President Barack Obama talks with the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation, David Archambault II, in June during the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration in North Dakota. By Chris Potter/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Even as Pennsylvania’s political landscape was being redrawn this past fall, some western Pennsylvanians took part in a struggle over a place that less than two years ago was barely on the map. They traveled some 1,300 miles to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where Native Americans hoped to stave off construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is meant to carry roughly 500,000 barrels of oil a day from North Dakota oil fields to a terminal in Illinois. For some, like Squirrel Hill native Madeline Whitehill, the journey was a chance to recover from Donald Trump’s election victory two days before. “I went feeling a loss of faith in humanity, a feeling of being powerless,” she said. What she found, she said, was “a culture we all need to learn from, one built on strength and love.” Homewood artist Vanessa German saw a way of life that respected the earth instead of exploiting it. “These were people who still know the medicine of the land when there’s an urgent scientific sense of how the climate is changing,” she said. In December, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would not allow the pipeline to cross beneath a dammed portion of the Missouri River. The Corps said it hoped to find an alternate route for that section of the $3.7 billion pipeline. That victory may not last: A spokesman for President Elect Trump said it was “something that we support construction of.” (Mr. Trump has held stock in the pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer Partners, though he has said he sold the stock during his campaign.) But Pittsburghers who took part — and who lived in 19th century conditions under 21st-century surveillance — say the fight offers hope for the future. “For the next four years, there are going to be a lot of battles that we lose, but we're not going to win any if we don't fight,” said John Creasy, an associate pastor at Highland Park’s Open Door Church. “Standing Rock is going to happen all over this country.” They were among thousands of people who came to live, often in tents or huts, on the windswept Dakota prairie. The Rev. Dr. Lauren Stanley, the superintending presbyter of an Episcopal mission on the reservation, called it “amazing to see people come here from all over the world” and as far away as New Zealand. “If people came with an open mind, they were welcomed with open arms.” They were drawn by a confluence of issues: global climate change, the threat to water supplies, wariness of corporate power, a concern for Native American rights. ‘It doesn’t kill the lie’ The 1,172-mile pipeline route skirts the reservation: The Sioux say it will disturb ancestral lands and fear a leak could contaminate water supplies, in their community and those down the Missouri River. “These are people we’ve screwed over for a couple hundred years,” said Beth Roxby of Ligonier, a former Army helicopter mechanic who joined thousands of other veterans at the site last month. “I’m typically not the kind of person who goes Downtown and holds signs,” she said, but “I think our presence made people think about it not just as another environmental protest.” Ms. German spent a week in the camp in August, seeking not so much to make a statement as to live one. “You can kill liars every day of the week, but it doesn’t kill the lie. So you don’t just say something is wrong: You also have to live the rightness,” she said. She went with the hope that “If I could show up with my love, then my presence would be an act of protest.” Ms. German discovered that Steelers Nation encompassed indigenous people: “I’d come 2,000 miles, and there was this guy with Steelers Native American garb living on a reservation.” But she was taken aback at the animus she saw directed at Native Americans. “It stunned me to see white women at Walmart curdle their faces and drop money on the counter instead of handing it to [a Native American. It was safer for me as a black woman than for the people whose land it actually was.” Meanwhile, Caleb Gamble found it “difficult unpacking my feelings about being of European descent,” given the historic mistreatment of Native Americans. “There was a large influx of Europeans around Thanksgiving, and it was like, ‘Oh no, it’s happening again.’ ” But had police tried to overrun the camp, he would have “put my body in front of those of indigenous people, because the police have a harder time brutalizing white people.” A contractor in Pittsburgh, Mr. Gamble helped winterize the camp, building windbreaks and platforms “to get tents off the ground. Sometimes we’d just pick up trash, or wash dishes.” With temperatures dropping below freezing, “The only way to stay warm was to keep working.” “There was this feeling of everybody helping everybody else: People wouldn’t hesitate to give their gloves if they saw somebody without them,” said Ms. Roxby. “It was hard for veterans to adjust to the lack of a command structure: Decisions were made by the elders when they got a spiritual message. But I was always impressed with how much organization there was.” Participants describe prayer, often held around sacred fires, as a constant presence. “It isn’t just this thing we did in our head,” said Mr. Creasy. “Everything is connected with something physical: There's always herbs burned.” But God wasn’t the only one watching: Floodlights blazed from nearby hilltops all night, helicopters flew overhead. And then there were the drones. “They’d be going 24 hours a day,” recalled Ms. Whitehill. “They would hover, and swoop in not too far from you,” presumably to photograph protesters. But cellphone and internet service was spotty, making connections hard to maintain at home. And residual distrust — due to racial gaps, or suspicion that someone in the next tent might be an undercover officer — had to be overcome. Tensions boiled over during a violent Nov. 20 confrontation with police at a barricade on a highway bridge. Police claim protesters tried to deploy explosives made from propane tanks, while protesters decry police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and high-pressure water hoses, which doused protesters in 20-degree weather. One protester nearly lost her arm in an explosion whose cause is unclear. Ms. Whitehill recalled another demonstrator, motionless in prayer and covered in ice water. “His hair was frozen up. It was like he was a statue, except that he was crying.” “I can’t look at firefighters the same way now,” she said. A police spokesman told a local broadcaster that while “there are probably people there [who] were nonviolent … those right up front [were] violent agitators,” a claim protesters reject. "From what I experienced, there is no possibility that anyone had weapons,” said Mr. Creasy. “We were told if you have a pocketknife in the camp, you have to get rid of it before going to the bridge.” As for the police, “they say they weren't using lethal force, but in freezing temperatures, water can be lethal.” Shelving the project Two weeks after that confrontation, the Army Corps of Engineers shelved the project. “The general reaction was hope mixed with suspicion,” Ms. Roxby said. Even without an incoming Trump administration, “You can’t trust the government.” The United States has broken promises to Native Americans before, after all, though currently it’s Energy Transfer Partners complaining of betrayal. The company called the decision “the latest in a series of ... transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law.” It said it was “fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion.” “We’re putting our faith in the legal system,” said Rev. Stanley. “If Trump issues an executive order [reversing the Corps], he’ll be in court before the ink is dry. And now we have a court of public opinion, because people came.” Keith J. Coyle, a Babst Calland attorney who heads a Pennsylvania industry workgroup for pipeline safety, said a pipeline may ultimately be in everyone’s interest. “Pipelines are the safest means of transporting energy products,” he said. “If you don’t move forward with new pipeline transportation, there will be increased risk” from relying on accident-prone trains or aging pipelines. But Mr. Gamble said such concerns were “a distraction” from the need to transition away from fossil fuels entirely. Pennsylvania too, he said, “has an intense environmental history with coal, the dumping of fracking waste,” he said. “What’s happening out there can happen here. It already has.” Chris Potter: cpotter@post-gazette.com or 412-263-2533.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Charges: Iraqi refugee killed in Millcreek was stabbed, cut 40 times By McKenzie RomeroDeseret News@McKenzieRomero Published: Dec. 30, 2016 6:35 p.m. Updated: Dec. 30, 2016 6:38 p.m. 2 Comments MILLCREEK — Murder charges were filed Friday in the death of an Iraqi refugee, who prosecutors say was stabbed and cut 40 times in his Millcreek home. Alaa "Ali" Alkhatawi, 46, was found dead on Dec. 9 when friends who had been unable to reach him contacted police. Alkhatawi's body had 40 stab and cut wounds on his neck, back, face and hands, according to charging documents filed in 3rd District Court. Nine stab wounds were located on the back of Alkhatawi's neck, including one that severed his carotid artery and nicked his jugular artery. Alkhatawi's body was in a pool of blood in the kitchen, and officers noted "an obvious struggle from the living room to the kitchen," charges state. In the home was a bloody print from an athletic shoe. Karrar Suhail, 25, is charged with murder, aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, first-degree felonies, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He is currently in custody in the Salt Lake County Jail. Alkhatawi had been selling prescription drugs from his home, including oxycodone, methadone and alpraxolam, according to charging documents. Police said Suhail is "addicted to pain pills" and had purchased drugs from Alkhatawi in the past. Police said Alkhatawi's cellphone, money and pills were missing from the home. A friend of Alkhatawi told police he was at the Millcreek home on the evening of Dec. 8, as was Suhail, charges state. Alkhatawi and Suhail spoke privately in the kitchen, the man said, and Suhail left. When the man said he, too, needed to leave, Alkhatawi asked him to stay. The man told police that Alkhatawi "appeared to be nervous and didn't want to be left alone," charges state. Another man told police he received a text from Alkhatawi's phone about 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 8 asking him to come over. When he arrived almost an hour later, the man said he received another text saying Alkhatawi had left and would return in 30 minutes. When the man said he was already at the house, he received a message asking him instead to meet at a convenience store. The man went to the store, but Alkhatawi never arrived, charges state. He returned to Alkhatawi's home, where he saw Suhail leaving, the man told police. He didn't locate Alkhatawi. The man also told police that the text messages he received were "different" than what Alkhatawi usually sent. Because Alkhatawi often used voice commands to text, the messages were usually in perfect English, the man said. However, the messages he received that night were in broken English and had multiple spelling errors. Sources also told police that Suhail was unemployed, rarely had money and was known to wear athletic shoes, charges state. A third man told police that on Dec. 9 he went shopping with Suhail, who had "a large amount of cash, which is unusual." Suhail purchased a knife from Sportsman's Warehouse, a coat from Burlington Coat Factory, and had his normally frizzy hair styled in braids at a Wal-Mart salon, the man said. The next day, while having breakfast with Suhail and his family, the man told police Suhail said Alkhatawi had been stabbed nine times in the neck and on his left side, charges state, information that had not been publicly released at the time. Suhail also said police were looking for Alkhatawi's phone, and asked about the best way to leave the country, the man said. A woman who saw Suhail on Dec. 9 told police she noticed a wound on the side of his neck, which Suhail said was the result of a fight the night before. Suhail asked her if she would visit him if he were incarcerated for 25 years, the woman said, and noted that Suhail freely gave her money even though he usually didn't have any. 2 comments on this story At the time of his arrest, Suhail was wearing new clothes and boots and had $1,300 cash, according to the charges. Suhail told police he was under the influence of "oxy." "Suhail admitted that he 'goes crazy' if he doesn't get his pills and that he constantly has to borrow money from people to buy pills," charges state. Friends said Alkhatawi was a refugee who was among the estimated 3 million people who fled Iraq in 1991 during Desert Storm and sought shelter in Saudi Arabia. He was eventually resettled in the United States. Alkhatawi's family remains in Iraq, according to friends. They are now trying to raise enough money to have his body sent back to Iraq so he can be buried next to his father. 2 Comments Like that? Read this.

The main fixed-rate mortgage rates are lower on the last working day of 2016. The average 30-year mortgage rate is down seven basis points, at 4.09%, which equates to a $482.62 monthly payment per $100,000 borrowed (one basis point equals one hundredth of a percentage point). A month ago, the equivalent payment would have been lower by $6.36. The average 15-year mortgage is eight basis points lower, at 3.26%, equating to a $703.15 monthly payment per $100,000 borrowed. A month ago, the equivalent payment would have been lower by $6.30. Rate (national average) Today One Month Ago 30-year fixed jumbo 4.58% 4.44% 30-year fixed 4.09% 3.98% 15-year fixed 3.26% 3.13% 30-year fixed refi 4.12% 4.02% 15-year fixed refi 3.28% 3.15% 5/1 ARM 3.41% 3.37% 5/1 ARM refi 3.60% 3.55% 5/1 ARM: ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE WITH AN INITIAL FIXED FIVE-YEAR INTEREST RATE. DATA SOURCE: BLOOMBERG. RATES MAY INCLUDE POINTS. Capping a roller-coaster year, the "Trump reflation" saw mortgage rates end 2016 near five-year highs It's been a roller-coaster year for interest rates, and consequently, for mortgage rates, too. In July, in the wake of the United Kingdom's surprise rejection of membership in the European Union ("Brexit"), mortgage rates fell to within spitting distance of their all-time lows. However, at the beginning of November, an even greater political earthquake, Donald Trump's electoral victory, set mortgage rates on a reverse course in double time. As the following graph shows, the 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgage rates shot up, passing their highs for the year, and ending 2016 near their five-year highs. (The broken horizontal lines represent the most recent levels.) The "Trump reflation" has had a stunning effect on mortgage rates, abetted by the Federal Reserve's December rate hike, with expectations of three more to come next year. While there are reasons to believe rates could continue to rise next year, it's by no means a certainty. Potential homebuyers may have "non-buyer's remorse" when they look back at the rates they could have obtained in July, but timing the bottom is impossible, whether in stocks or rates. Even after their recent run-up, mortgage rates remain very affordable by historical standards. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next LAFAYETTE, Tenn. - A home feature meant to help protect a house in Lafayette ended up burning it down just before Thanksgiving. Family members say a security light caught fire. There were people inside, including small children at the time. "They made it out safe, they had just woke up before the fire started," said Lori, a family member.  Shirley Moore was renting the home from her sister, it'd been in their family for decades. Unfortunately, Shirley lost nearly everything in the fire and without renters insurance she'll never get it back. However, her luck went from bad to worse. While working at Walmart on Christmas eve someone stole her car from the parking lot.  "What she had left from the house fire was in the car, pictures of her brother were in the car and he passed a few years ago," said Lori. Lori is Shirley's daughter and hopes someone in middle Tennessee can help find her mother's 2005 white Ford Taurus with Macon County tags. "They caught it on camera but they've still not found the car or the suspects," she said.  As the year comes to an end Shirley is struggling to keep her head above water. "She's trying to be strong but she's really a wreck and one step from falling apart," said Lori.  A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Shirley. Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Logan County, Sterling see improvements in 2016 Enhancements include shooting range, sculptures, new humane society facility By Callie Jones Journal-Advocate staff writer Posted:   12/30/2016 09:18:04 AM MST Shooters take aim at targets during the first night of a fall trap shooting league at the Logan County Shooting Sports Complex. The opening of the new shooting range was among the top enhancements in Logan County and Sterling in 2016. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate file photo) This past year has brought many improvements to enhance the city of Sterling and Logan County, from new artwork to the opening of a public shooting range. One of the top enhancements that occurred in 2016, which will likely provide an economic benefit for the county and city, was the late October opening of the Logan County Shooting Sports Complex. Located at 12515 Highway 61, the facility is on about 400 continuous acres of land. The shooting range, which took several years to develop to this point, is a collaborative effort between the city; county; Colorado Parks and Wildlife, which provided grant money for the infrastructure; Colorado Department of Transportation, which helped with road access; and Colorado State Land Board, which provided some of the property. Logan County Humane Society saw the completion of a new building in 2016. Here cats can be seen looking out into the reception area from their two-level cages. (Sara Waite / Sterling Journal-Advocate file photo) Thought it's now open, the facility is still a work in progress. It includes a trap range, archery, long range rile, center rifle and pistol shooting. While the public has been able to use the shooting range free of cost this year, there will be an admission fee starting in January. Daily fees are $10 for adults and free for children 18 and under; memberships are $100 for adults 18 year of age and older and $140 for a family, which includes up to two adults and dependent children. For more information, visit https://colorado.gov/lcssc, like Logan County Shooting Sports Complex on Facebook, or call Dennis Vierow, advisory board president, at 970-520-2341. Advertisement Just down the road from the shooting range is another improvement, Logan County Humane Society's new animal shelter, which opened in the spring. "We have gone from a facility that was old and decrepit and very difficult to keep up to standards, to this new building, with the appropriate equipment involved," Dr. Bill Fredregill told the Rotary Club when they toured the new facility in April. A sculpture depicting Logan County's first settler, William Hadfield; his wife, "Aunt" Charity Sanders Hadfield; and a prairie Indian, along with other western themed bronze sculptures installed this year, helped to enhance east and West Main Street. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate file photo) Located at 2250 Leisure Ln., the new facility, designed by Animal Arts Institute of Boulder, cost about $850,000 to build and includes 24 dog kennels — before they could only house 12 dogs — and room for 33 cats. For more information on the dogs and cats available for adoption at the humane society, call 970-520-2804, or visit www.loganhumane.org. Local Girl Scouts, Parks, Library and Recreation crews and other volunteers helped with a landscaping improvement project around Pawnee Lodge this year. (Sara Waite / Journal-Advocate file photo) One of the more noticeable enhancements to the city of Sterling this year was the western touch that was added to West Main Street in March, April and May, as bronze sculptures donated by local cattlemen were installed at various places along the road. Among the five sculptures that were installed are a frontier man on horseback, located next to the new Sterling welcome sign by Sterling Municipal Airport; a cowboy on a bucking bronco, placed adjacent to Banner Health Center; a longhorn bull, installed next to Kim's Fashion Eyewear; and a cowboy on a bucking horse and a Native American horseback rider, both placed in the new raised island medians installed in front of Wal-Mart and Home Depot. The sculptures were donated by Andrew Timmerman, Allen Mitchek, Brett McEndaffer, Chris Dinsdale and Brent Erickson, as a tribute to Sterling's Western and agricultural heritage. The east end of Main Street also saw some enhancement. In September, a celebration was held to unveil a bronze at the intersection of Main and Front Street. The sculpture, which was created by Pat Kennedy and honors Logan County's first settler, depicts William "Uncle Billy" Hadfield, his wife, "Aunt" Charity Sanders Hadfield, and a contemporary of the Hadfield's — a prairie Indian. The project was funded by the Sterling Rotary and Reviewers Clubs, who together raised around $190,000. In addition to the Hadfield sculpture, funds were also used to retain the services of wildlife artist Christopher Schiller, who created several wildlife bronzes, including an antelope, a prairie chicken roosting on a buffalo skull, and a young fox catching hold of a pheasant, which were placed next to the Hadfield sculpture. Among the other improvements in Sterling this year was a water tank rehabilitation project that brought a fresh coat of paint to the city's water towers. Additionally, the city's Parks, Library and Recreation was involved in a number of enhancements in 2016, including continued work on a 10-mile multi-use trail, which when finished will encompass the city of Sterling. In December 2015, the city purchased nearly 61 acres of land along the South Platte River south of U.S. Highway 6. Since then, much work has been done on that area of the trail, including putting crushed asphalt on top of the berm, so people can walk or bike on it; cutting weeds; taking down fences; and putting in a culvert across the ditch. Work on that area and other areas of the trail will continue in 2017, as the PLR Department continues to seek more grant funding. Along with continuing work on the multi-use trail, the PLR Department was also able to help launch a new bicycle safety education program in RE-1 Valley schools. In April, it was announced that Sterling was one of the recipients of Colorado Department of Transportation's Safe Routes to School grants, which is aimed at increasing the number of students who walk or bike to school. As part of the grant, in October, following training for school teachers and PLR staff, the PLR Department in conjunction with Bicycle Colorado hosted a bike rodeo, drawing around 50 children to Prairie Park for a lesson in bicycle safety. A month later, Ayres Elementary, Campbell Elementary and Sterling Middle School each received eight bikes, funded by the grant, to be used in PE classes to teach bicycle safety. The PLR Department was also involved in a Girl Scout project to make some improvements to Pawnee Lodge at Pioneer Park. Girl Scouts from Troops 80340 and 82586 and other volunteers spent several months improving the landscaping around the building by adding a curved sidewalk that encircles the building, benches and a perimeter fence, as well as a planter box with a sign in it. Each Girl Scout involved in the project received a Silver Award on behalf of the Girl Scouts of Colorado, the highest award a Girl Scout Cadette can earn.

The amount of money that flowed into U.S. startups fell in 2016 for the first time in four years as the number of deals struck tumbled to their lowest levels since 2011. But the technology world has high hopes that 2017 will prove to be brighter, as the parent company of Snapchat and other high-fliers prepare to go public and venture capitalists amass huge new war chests. About $67.8 billion was invested in startups in 2016, according to PitchBook, down 15 percent from last year. And just 7,841 deals were struck, down 25 percent from the period a year ago. Much of 2016 proved to be a less ebullient time for the once red-hot startup market. In years past, investors and media alike delighted in anointing new unicorns, the once-ballyhooed term for a startup valued at more than $1 billion. Last year brought a healthy skepticism — while the apocalypse hasn’t arrived, leaner times are ahead. Startups have tightened their belts, laying off staff and focusing more on reaching profitability rather than skyrocketing user growth. Just 12 companies joined the unicorn club, according to data provider CB Insights, a 70 percent drop from 2015. And initial public offerings — one of the primary ways that investors in startups can harvest their gains — tumbled sharply during 2016 amid uncertainty and tumult in the stock market. Just 105 offerings priced during the year, according to Renaissance Capital, down 38 percent from 2015. Those deals raised $18.8 billion, also a 38 percent drop from last year. Both hedge funds and big mutual funds, which have been among the most enthusiastic new backers of new private companies, continued to largely show reluctance in venture investing, according to CB Insights. Moreover, a few of Silicon Valley’s most prominent startups suffered significant blows in the past year. Theranos, the once highly lauded blood-testing company, laid off about 40 percent of its workers and closed its laboratory operations amid heightened skepticism about its technology. Zenefits, a San Francisco business software startup, replaced its CEO after it was found to be using unlicensed health insurance brokers and software that allowed them to cheat on state tests. Zenefits has since settled investigations with a number of states, and the company has sought to turn itself around. Of course, heavyweight startups had little trouble raising money. Uber got $3.5 billion from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, putting its cash hoard from outside investors at more than $11 billion. Lyft, Palantir and Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, all raised enormous sums as well, as did big non-American startups like Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. And some startups sold out to bigger companies at multibillion-dollar valuations. Jet.com, an e-commerce company that began selling goods only within the last two years, was bought by Walmart for $3.3 billion. Investors are betting that 2017 will be better. Renaissance Capital pointed out that the average total return of IPOs in 2016 reached 23 percent, a sharp reversal from the negative 2.1 percent return of 2015 offerings and surpassing the 21 percent return of two years ago. And some big names are expected to begin trading in the public markets this year, potentially providing ballast for a bigger wave of startups. Leading the way could be Snap, expected to have issue shares in March with a valuation that could exceed $30 billion. Others, like Spotify, the music-streaming darling, are also expected to hold IPOs in 2017. And there is a healthy amount of money waiting to be invested. Venture capitalists raised about $40.6 billion in 2016, according to PitchBook, the biggest amount in at least a decade. That includes new funds created by venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund. Perhaps the biggest of all is a $100 billion investment fund being raised by SoftBank, a Japanese technology conglomerate (it owns most of Sprint) in partnership with the likes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. More money pouring in will not necessarily save the most troubled startups, however. In April, investor Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital warned that the sheer amount of money sloshing around Silicon Valley and other tech hubs was propping up weaker firms and potentially harming returns. “More money will not solve any of these problems,” he wrote in a blog post. “It will only contribute to them.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 1, 2017 at 2:03PM What do Hercules, Thor, centaurs, and marijuana stocks have in common? They're all the subjects of myths. Most myths have at least a little bit of truth interspersed with a lot that is false. That's the case with these three myths about marijuana stocks that some might mistakenly believe. Image source: Getty Images. Myth No. 1: All marijuana stocks are hot. Marijuana stocks in general are hot right now. It's wrong, though, to think that all marijuana stocks are performing well. They're not. One of the marijuana stocks with the biggest valuations is Insys Therapeutics (NASDAQ:INSY). Insys trades at a market cap of roughly $650 million and won U.S. regulatory approval for its first cannabinoid drug, Syndros. You might think the biotech would be a big winner. Nope. Insys lost around two-thirds of its value in 2016. Although approval of Syndros was a big positive for Insys, the drug still awaits scheduling by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In the meantime, Insys' revenue is falling due to plummeting sales of Subsys, the company's sublingual fentanyl spray for breakthrough cancer pain.  A corollary of this particular myth is that marijuana stocks that are hot right now will automatically stay hot. Just look at Insys' track record to debunk this proposition. The stock more than doubled by mid-2015. That's pretty hot. By the end of the year, though, Insys had given up most of those gains and then experienced its real pain in 2016. Myth No. 2: Increased acceptance of marijuana is the main driver of all marijuana stocks' success. It's certainly true that use of medical marijuana and recreational use of the drug is becoming more accepted in North America. This increased acceptance has been a major factor in the success of several marijuana stocks. The share price of Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQOTH:ACBFF), for example, quadrupled in 2016 thanks in part to increased acceptance of medical marijuana in Canada. Aurora began selling medical marijuana in Jan. 2016 and had registered 10,800 active patients by late November.  Aurora's success, though, didn't come about just because Canadians were more accepting of medical marijuana. The company took the right steps to reach out to patients and expanded its infrastructure quickly to keep up with demand. Others weren't so smart and didn't perform as well as Aurora did. Some marijuana stocks have achieved success for reasons other than increased public acceptance of marijuana. This is particularly true for biotechs developing cannabinoid drugs. For instance, GW Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:GWPH) stock soared in 2016 based on its pipeline success. In March 2016, GW Pharmaceuticals announced positive results from a late-stage clinical study evaluating its lead cannabinoid product candidate Epidiolex in treating Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy. The biotech announced more positive results in June from a late-stage study of the drug in treating another rare form of epilepsy known as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). GW followed up with additional positive results from another LGS study of Epidiolex in September.  Myth No. 3: All marijuana stocks are extremely risky. Many marijuana stocks are extremely risky. That's especially the case with penny stocks. These stocks aren't available for trading on a public exchange and instead must be bought and sold over the counter. Public exchanges require that companies make audited financial information available to investors. That isn't the case with over-the-counter stocks. This relative lack of information about the stocks, combined with low trading volumes for many of these stocks, results in added risk for investors seeking to invest in many of the marijuana stocks available. But not every marijuana stock is super-risky. GW Pharmaceuticals is a good example. It's not a penny stock. The company appears to have a potential winner on its hands with Epidiolex. GW isn't a fly by-night venture that recently sprang into existence. The biotech was founded in 1998. Of course, there's still a level of risk associated with investing in GW Pharmaceuticals. It's possible that Epidiolex won't win regulatory approval. Even if the drug does, it might not perform as well as some expect. However, those are the kinds of risks that any biopharmaceutical stock has.    Avoid the "myth-stakes" Investors might be tempted to believe the hype about marijuana stocks without doing their homework. They could buy shares without understanding a company's business model and its path to success. Some might overlook the risks. Avoid these mistakes (or maybe I should say "myth-stakes") -- and you can potentially be successful by investing in solid marijuana stocks. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Jan 1, 2017 at 9:14AM Image source: Getty Images. If you support the legalization of marijuana, 2016 didn't give you much to complain about. Last year, residents in four states approved recreational-marijuana ballot initiatives, doubling the total from the end of 2015, while five new states put medical-cannabis laws on their books. By year's end, 28 states and Washington, D.C., had legalized medical pot. And there's more where that came from. We saw two battleground states -- Pennsylvania and Ohio -- introduce and pass medical-marijuana legislation without sending it to a public vote. We also saw a continued softening in the public's opinion toward marijuana, which remains an illegal drug at the federal level. Gallup's 2016 poll found that 60% of Americans now want to see the substance legalized nationwide, up from just 25% when California passed the first compassionate-use law in 1996. Legal weed sales have also soared. Cannabis research firm ArcView sees sales reaching nearly $22 billion by the end of the decade, while investment firm Cowen & Co. projects a better-than-23% annualized growth rate leading to $50 billion in legal sales by 2026. California is a medical-marijuana juggernaut Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, wound up generating $996.2 million in legal sales during 2015, leading to $135 million in tax and licensing revenue. Yet that's peanuts compared with legal pot sales in California, the eighth-largest economy in the world by GDP. Image source: Getty Images. Since passing medical-cannabis legislation in 1996, California has amassed more than 720,000 current patients, at least according to a September 2016 estimate from the Marijuana Policy Project. That's about 1.8% of California's total population as of 2015, and it represents half of all legal medical-marijuana patients in the entire United States. According to Troy Dayton, the CEO of ArcView, California generated $2.7 billion in medical-cannabis sales in 2015, which amounts to 62% of all medical-cannabis sales in the U.S. in 2015, as well as more than half of all cannabis sales, medical and recreational combined, in 2015. California's medical-marijuana industry is simply enormous. But it may not stay that way for long. The cannibalization of medical cannabis In November, California's residents went to the polls and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 64, which will legalize recreational, adult-use weed for the state's more than 39 million residents. In 2018 alone, California's legal pot sales are expected to climb to $6.6 billion, based on estimates by New Frontier and ArcView. Image source: Cannabis Culture, Flickr. However, legalizing recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and up creates a potentially big problem for the United States' largest medical-marijuana industry: Once recreational-marijuana sales are allowed (they'll be rolled out over the next year), the incentive to head to the doctor to get a prescription for medical pot will no longer be there. Not to mention that getting a physician referral takes time and costs money. From physicians to medical dispensaries, there's the possibility that the medical-cannabis industry could be ravaged by the recreational-pot industry. Medical dispensaries will still be needed for patients younger than age 21, so it's not as if they'd entirely disappear. But it's probable that the medical-marijuana industry in California today will look very different a year or two from now. The Sacramento Bee points out that some medical-pot clinics are planning to rebrand to broader holistic services in order to keep their clientele. Those services may include acupuncture, chiropractic care, and hypnosis, for example. Medical-marijuana shops are also counting on new consumers who want the guidance of a physician before purchasing pot, even if they're just recreational consumers and not medical-marijuana patients. Marijuana consultations from an experienced pot clinic physician could still translate into profits.  But, admittedly, the future of medical marijuana in California is very uncertain. Marijuana's clouded future Beyond just California, the future of marijuana in the U.S. remains somewhat clouded, too. For instance, the appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be the next attorney general of the United States is a potentially damaging blow to the marijuana industry. Sessions is an ardent opponent of the legalization movement, and even though President-elect Trump has thrown his full support behind medical marijuana, and has suggested that states should retain their right to regulate their pot industry without federal interference, Sessions could roll back some of the leniency instilled during the Obama presidency. While this isn't to say 20 years of progress could be wiped out, it's unlikely that the sledding will get easier with Sessions as attorney general. Image source: Getty Images. We also can't forget that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency declined to reschedule marijuana when given the opportunity this past August. The DEA noted a lack of safety and clinical data, as well as a lack of understanding the chemical properties of marijuana, in its decision to leave the drug classified as Schedule 1. This means pot companies are still primarily forced to deal in cash, as most banks want nothing to do with them, and they continue to face higher corporate income tax rates since they are unable to take normal business deductions. These persistent disadvantages are what make investing in this space so incredibly dangerous. Even if the incoming administration or the DEA does decide to reschedule marijuana, it doesn't mean things would necessarily get easier. Schedule 2 through Schedule 5 drugs fall under the tight regulation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA would likely implement strict marketing and packaging regulations, oversee all medical grow operations, and require that approved clinical trials be run to prove that medical cannabis treats certain ailments This all translates into big expenses for the medical-pot industry. While marijuana's state-level expansion has been something to marvel, this remains an industry best watched from the sidelines.

You’ll definitely want to check out real estate investment trusts (REITs) that specialize in the healthcare sector. Here’s why Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW) , Ventas (NYSE: VTR) , and Welltower (NYSE: HCN) are three healthcare REITs that should be good buys for 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Medical Properties Trust: Nothing but hospitals Unlike most other healthcare REITs, Medical Properties Trust focuses exclusively on investing in and owning hospitals. Its dividend yield of 7.62% stands among the highest of any healthcare REIT on the market. At the end of the third quarter, Medical Properties Trust’s portfolio included 209 properties, 11 of which were under development. Over 60% of its revenue stems from general acute care hospitals, with just under 30% coming from rehabilitation hospitals and roughly 9% from long-term acute care hospitals. Four out of five of the company’s properties are located in the U.S., with the rest primarily in Germany. The good thing about hospitals is that they typically don’t move. Medical Properties Trust benefits from having long-term leases on its properties. Only a relatively small number of its property leases expire prior to 2025. Medical Properties Trust’s debt totals $2.7 billion. The company shouldn’t have problems servicing this debt. Even better, most of this amount — $2.5 billion — is fixed-rate debt that won’t be negatively affected by interest rate hikes. Ventas: A focus on seniors housing While Medical Properties Trust deals only with hospitals, Ventas focuses largely on seniors housing. The company’s dividend yield currently stands at an attractive 5.09%. As of Sept. 30, 2016, Ventas owned 1,300 properties in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom. Over 60% of these were seniors housing communities. Nearly 21% were medical office buildings. Ventas also owned several life science and innovation centers, skilled nursing facilities, and hospital properties. Ventas boasts a strong track record that investors should like. The company’s compounded annual total shareholder return from 2000 through 2015 was an impressive 26%. Ventas has also increased its dividend by an average annual rate of 10% since 2001. The company’s debt totaled over $11.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016. Less than 16% of that amount is variable-rate debt that could be impacted by potential interest rate increases. Welltower: The Granddaddy of Healthcare REITs Welltower was founded in 1970, making the company the oldest of all REITs exclusively investing in healthcare properties. This granddaddy of healthcare REITs currently sports a dividend yield of 5.25%. The company owns interest in 1,464 properties across the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom. Like Ventas, Welltower focuses primarily on seniors housing. In November, the company announced a significant portfolio repositioning to reduce its exposure to long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) and increase its focus on premium private-pay healthcare real estate properties. This appears to be a good move for Welltower over the long run. The increased focus on private-pay healthcare properties should increase profits. Selling some of its LTPAC properties also improves Welltower’s financial shape. Just a few days after the company announced its strategic changes, Standard & Poor’s raised Welltower’s credit rating, citing among other things the portfolio repositioning efforts. What about Welltower’s debt? The company reported around $13.4 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter. Roughly $2.8 billion of that amount was variable-rate debt. Positive trends Healthcare REITs should benefit from several positive trends in the coming years. Aging baby boomers will likely spur an increase in demand for seniors housing, which should help Ventas and Welltower. As Americans age, they will also likely incur more health problems, making hospitals more money and thereby helping Medical Properties Trust’s investments pay off. Also, even though interest rates are likely to go up, they’re still at low levels historically. This allows healthcare REITs to continue to borrow relatively inexpensively. With these positive tailwinds, I expect Medical Properties Trust, Ventas, and Welltower will continue to richly reward dividend-seeking investors in 2017 and beyond. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tennessee House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick laughs... Photo by Angela Lewis Foster /Times Free Press. POLL: Would you buy wine on Sundays? Yes No Submit Results Yes: 63.64% (112) No: 36.36% (64) Total Responses: 176 NASHVILLE — Two years ago after persuading Tennessee lawmakers to let them sell wine, state grocery and convenience stores are now setting an ambitious new goal: repealing the long-standing ban on Sunday sales of wine. Rob Ikard, president and CEO of the Tennessee Grocers & Convenience Store Association, said the grocers group is joining with Tennessee wineries and the Distilled Spirits Council to push for what he calls "seven-day sales." "We think if there's ever a time to try it, it's right now, because we know our customers are really perplexed they can't buy wine in our food stores on Sunday when they can buy beer across the aisle," Ikard said. He noted customers went "nuts" with delight when grocery stores began offering wine July 1. "But then on Sunday, customers were told to put it [wine bottle] back on the shelf" because of the ban, he said. "We think there's strong consumer interest in this," Ikard added, citing dozens of local referendums across the state where voters approved wine sales in food stores. Because package liquor stores also sell wine, the proposal would allow them to open and they would be able to sell liquor too, Ikard and others said. Both Rep. Gerald McCormick, R-Chattanooga, and Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Bill Ketron of Murfreesboro said they're strongly looking at sponsoring the legislation. "I have talked to them about that and I probably will do it," said McCormick, who chose not to seek a fourth term as House majority leader for the legislative session beginning Jan. 10. "I think it's just to make it consistent leave it up to the local operators and not the state," McCormick added. "I think most [Tennesseans] will go along with it." He noted that Tennesseans already can buy wine or spirits by the drink on Sundays at restaurants with an alcohol license. Ketron said that as part of the 2014 agreement on grocery store wine sales, he agreed not to take up the issue of Sunday sales for two years. "I said we need to give those [small] retailers time to adjust their business plan," Ketron said. Now, he said, some liquor store owners are seeing slower wine sales and want an extra sales day. Others don't, Ketron added, noting the Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Association is split on the issue. He believes the retailers as well as the distributors' organization, the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of Tennessee, will be neutral on a bill. Ketron said he isn't sure whether the idea of allowing liquor stores to sell distilled spirits on Sunday will cause some lawmakers who supported grocery store wine sales law to back off. "That may complicate it a little, but I won't be sure until I actually introduce the bill," Ketron said. David McMahan, who lobbies for liquor store owners, acknowledged that group is split on Sunday sales. Some of the state's 600 liquor stores are seeing a fall-off in wine sales and want to shore up business with Sunday sales, while others are not having problems and don't like the idea of having staff work seven days a week, he said. It also makes no sense for many stores to open on Sundays if they can't sell distilled spirits too, McMahan said. Until an actual bill is filed and his board can read it, sort through the implications and decide, it's difficult know how the group will respond. And liquor store owners will have to prioritize among issues, he said. The retailers will oppose efforts by grocery and convenience store chains to tinker with a provision that requires food stores to charge customers a 20 percent markup over their own costs, as well as one that bans wholesalers from physically stocking shelves in food stores. Such restrictions are "critical" for small businesses competing with huge national retailers, he said. "Wal-Mart and Costco have not been good for most communities in Tennessee," McMahan said. "If you notice, they come to town and all of a sudden your hardware store goes out of business, the bicycle shop goes out of business, your sporting goods store goes out of business. "You can look at some of these town squares and they're sort of ghostlike," McMahan added. "So [there's an interest in] protecting the negotiated tools that were in that bill that would allow the 600 small businesses across the state to continue to operate their business and hire employees and pay taxes. So that will be a big part of my job, making sure that those elements stay in the law and don't get reversed." With only six months of sales in food stores to date, "we really don't know what the true effect of wine in the grocery stores is yet." Contact Andy Sher at asher@timesfreepress.com or 615-255-0550.

Curtis Everman and Chelsea Klayum have half an hour to make their rounds to local businesses to find Everman a job. Everman’s job folder listing his qualifications and employment experience slides around on the back seat as Klayum winds her way through the Kelso-Longview area. Everman, 59, has developmental disabilities and gets help finding employment from Life Works, a Longview-based social-services organization that supports people with mental and physical disabilities. Klayum, a Life Works employee, has been Everman’s job coach for two months. But Everman has been searching for a part-time job almost two years. He has applied to more than 40 employers. Klayum’s time to help him search is sharply limited by regulations. And he has been frustrated at every turn, The Daily News reported.

Like Everman, the vast majority of people with mental and physical disabilities face chronic unemployment or underemployment, despite special state assistance aimed at helping them find work. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 17.5 percent of people with disabilities were employed in 2015, while 65 percent of the nondisabled population had jobs. Unemployment among disabled adults was double that of the nondisabled population. Over the last five years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, disabled people have made up about 15 percent of Cowlitz County’s unemployed population. It takes the average disabled person 17 months to find a job once he or she leaves high school in Cowlitz County, a period of time that includes applying for state-supported job-search assistance, according to Life Works. Advocates for the disabled say the value of employing disabled people goes far beyond supplementing their bare-bones state disability income. It is good for them and the community. “So many of the folks have been told when they were younger, ‘Oh, you’ll never read. You’ll never do this, you’ll never do that.’ They’re reading. They live in the community. They have jobs,” said Wendy Keegan, director of development at Life Works. “It’s that sense of pride that they get with a little bit of support, that they can achieve their goals when they want to achieve their goals.” Life Works Executive Director Dave Hill adds that people with disabilities take the same satisfaction in a job well-done as does the rest of the workforce. “I don’t have any employees who are more proud to wear their work gear than the folks who have a disability. They are very proud.” Roots of the problem The reasons for the employment difficulties are many. Some are obvious, others not readily apparent. The process to determine eligibility for state job assistance, for example, is lengthy and complex. And many employers are reluctant to hire a disabled person because jobs often have to be tailored around their disabilities. And over the last decade, the federal government has discouraged “closed shops” that employ people only with developmental disabilities. The focus has been on integrating disabled people into the regular workplace. In smaller communities, such as Cowlitz County, this requires social-service organizations to make stronger ties with businesses to help disabled clients get jobs. “I think we’ve found niches to get into and find employment, but (this community) is not as big as Portland or Seattle, where there’s a lot more opportunities. So you have to get very creative and you have to find those mom-and-pop shops that are willing to work with you a little bit. So that makes it a little bit harder,” said Angie Whitcraft, director of client services at Life Works. Life Works itself runs three enterprises — Life Works Linen, ADC Janitorial and the Farm Dog Bakery. But it also employs other people so the enterprises are fully integrated into the community, Hill said. They employ 17 disabled people in total who work six to 20 hours a week at minimum wage. At Linen Works, located in Longview, sheets of red, blue, gray, black and white are stacked neatly on a metal stand in the corner. A draft from the heater above ripples the gold fabric Cory Rogers is steaming. The smell of Pine Sol and other cleaning products envelops the small room. For 15 hours a week, Rogers, 46, steams, folds and launders linens at Linen Works, which rents out linens throughout the community. Rogers has had his job for almost four years. He likes to listen to heavy metal while he works. Although he struggles with folding the fitted sheets, he is meticulous, lining up the edges just so. Laminated signs hang on the back wall, reminding Rogers of his duties. His boss and co-workers say he has never had a bad day. “He’s succeeded here really well,” said Marie Caine, Linen Works manager. Rogers works alongside those without disabilities as part of Linen Works’ inclusionary model. Rogers said his favorite part is folding the sheets, and “really likes” his job. Rules hinder job hunt Life Works has eight job coaches, such as Klayum, who seek work opportunities and provide on-the-job assistance for clients with disabilities. Depending on the client’s independence level, verbal and physical abilities, how much they work, and how much time is needed, job coaches will get a set amount of hours from the government to spend job hunting with their clients. Klayum only gets to help Curtis Everman once a month, twice if they’re lucky. During these times, she likes to take him into the community to check on submitted job applications so employers can meet him and they can begin building relationships. Governmental restrictions on how many hours a coach can spend on a client can be tight, and that leads to many job coaches working unpaid hours to find clients jobs. “Seven hours a month is not enough time to find a job for someone with multiple barriers, so we do whatever it takes. We’re always over-serving,” said Debra Westerby, vocational coordinator at Life Works. “We want to get them jobs, that’s just what we do. Sometimes that takes extra time.” Other challenges to employment are that many disabled people depend on public transportation, limiting the hours they can be available to work. In addition, employers often find it hard to justify crafting jobs, tailoring them for a specific person’s disabilities. “It’s not easy sometimes for them (employers) to open that door. Sometimes they’re a little scared, a little apprehensive, they’re just unsure,” said Whitcraft, with Life Works. The Wal-Mart Supercenter employs two or three people with disabilities at its Seventh Avenue store in Longview, which has nearly 250 employees. Several years ago, the store created positions specifically for people with disabilities. For example, they involved greeting or placing inventory on shelves if that employee couldn’t do some of the other tasks associated with a job, such as heavy lifting or lots of walking, said Patti Carroll, personnel manager at the store. Because of budget constraints, Wal-Mart no longer creates those special positions. The store has to make sure the employee can do all the tasks associated with the job, Carroll said. “It is a rewarding feeling to be able to help out someone with a disability, and I enjoy it,” Caroll said.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Dec 31, 2016 at 9:12AM Image source: Getty Images. As we look back at 2016, pro-legalization enthusiasts, as well as hopeful investors, have every reason to smile at the progress that's been made with marijuana. While still an illegal substance at the federal level, five new states approved cannabis for medicinal use in 2016 (two of which did so entirely through the legislative process), and residents in four states voted to legalize recreational pot. The year ends with medical marijuana legal in 28 states, and eight states having legalized adult-use recreational weed. Not bad at all considering that two decades ago just one state, California, had legalized medical cannabis, and the thought of recreational marijuana in 1996 was almost laughable, with three-quarters of all respondents in Gallup's national poll not favoring its legalization. Today, 60% of polled respondents favor legalizing pot nationally. With the shifting trends in opinion there's also been a surge of green -- dollars, that is! Investment firm Cowen & Co.'s recent forecast suggests that legal marijuana sales could grow from $6 billion in 2016 to $50 billion by 2026, which represents a decade-long compound annual growth rate of more than 23%. Furthermore, the number of legal pot jobs is expected to double or triple in the years to come, which is equivalent to as many as 300,000 new jobs being added.

This DEA decision took center stage Yet, what may wind up being marijuana's most memorable moment in 2016 was the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's decision in August to deny two petitions requesting that marijuana be rescheduled or removed from the scheduling status entirely. The DEA, which sought and considered the opinion of the Department of Health and Human Services, offered three particular reasons for declining to change marijuana's schedule 1 status. First, the DEA and HHS evaluation both agreed that pot demonstrated a high potential for abuse. Secondly, the DEA and HHS found that medical cannabis has no acceptable medical use, at least as of now. Finally, there was a lack of safety evidence to suggest that marijuana could be used as a medical treatment, even if under medical supervision. Considering that petitions to reschedule marijuana often take years to work their way up to the DEA, it could be a while before the regulatory agency even considers pot's medical fate once again. However, should that time come around sooner rather than later, three factors could sway the DEA's mind about marijuana. Three factors that could change the DEA's mind about marijuana The first thing the DEA would need to see is clear clinical evidence that marijuana provides medical benefits. Of course, this is probably the trickiest piece of evidence to provide, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn't exactly been forthcoming with requests for FDA-designed clinical trials involving pot. We've been witnessing a trend toward research leniency when it comes to cannabis, but you should also remember that clinical trials can take quite a bit of time to run and analyze. Image source: Getty Images. Another component that the DEA would need, which goes hand-in-hand with the first point, is clear evidence that cannabis is safe for medical patients. For both of the first two points many pro-legalization advocates will point to the millions of long-term marijuana users, as well as published clinical studies in various journals, as more than enough evidence to suggest pot is safe and effective in treating certain ailments. But the DEA and HHS would only consider the well-crafted trials of the FDA, essentially negating all other previously published studies that the FDA didn't oversee. Finally, the DEA would need evidence that the chemistry of marijuana is better understood by the FDA and researchers. In other words, the components of cannabis aren't considered reproducible at the moment, so researchers would need to further dissect the chemistry behind the plant to understand how it positively or negative impacts the body. If all three factors were met, it's possible the DEA could change its tune. There's a downside, too But it's important that potential investors and marijuana enthusiasts also understand that even if the DEA reschedules cannabis, things won't necessarily get any easier for the industry. Image source: Getty Images. If the DEA determines that the aforementioned factors are met in a later rescheduling analysis of pot, and the agency chooses to reschedule cannabis, the drug would then fall under the tight regulatory authority of the FDA. The FDA would have the power to approve the marketing and packaging of medical marijuana companies, and it would likely oversee the growing and processing of cannabis used for medicinal purposes. More importantly, the FDA could require additional clinical trials be run for the specific ailments that marijuana is targeting. Long story short, FDA oversight would probably mean a huge increase in expenses for the medical marijuana industry up and down the supply chain. It's this sort of Catch-22 (patients lose out if cannabis remains a schedule 1 drug, while pot businesses could be crushed if regulated by the FDA) that makes the future of marijuana very cloudy, and which should give prospective investors reason to pause.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 31, 2016 at 9:26AM Image source: Getty Images. When you make a living by finding and investing in the world's most promising start-ups, you probably know a thing or two about business. Leading venture capital firms have minted fortunes for themselves and their limited partners by investing in current tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Oracle, Facebook, and many more when they were just nascent start-ups. However, after considering the business wisdom of visionary business leaders, it recently occurred to me that examining some quotes from leading VCs could also prove tremendously useful for tech investors. So, banking off of this same logic, let's examine a series of quotes from some of the world's leading venture capitalists on subjects including the business of venture capital, business in general, and technology. About the business of venture capital Many readers may not be particularly familiar with the venture capital world: how it works, how it's financed, and how VC firms make money. As such, this quote from Union Squares Ventures partner Fred Wilson serves as a nice way to frame what exactly venture capitalists do. Venture capital is about capturing the value between the start-up phase and the public company phase. -- Fred Wilson  In general, venture capital firms can invest in private companies at any stage in their development. Though not always as strictly codified, these stages range from the initial seed round of financing used to get a nascent company off the ground to the later stages, series C or later, that often take place in the years preceding an IPO. What's more, the results can be astounding. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the average annual return of VC investments is an astounding 57%.   Especially in moments when tech investing is particularly en vogue, the number of VC firms and the amount of money chasing start-ups can create some unintended consequences, as a number of established venture capitalists have also noted. There are lots of ways to make money in venture capital, and there are even more ways to be mediocre. The industry has too much money and too many smart people chasing too few great entrepreneurs. -- Dan Levitan  All markets have boom and bust cycles, and I think venture capital market has even more exaggerated boom and bust cycles. -- Fred Wilson Both issues might sound eerily similar to the issues many investors encounter when investing in the stock market. However, much like our ethos here at The Motley Fool, investors can overcome, or even benefit from the cyclical nature of the market by maintaining a focus on the long term. The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a 13-year lockup on our money. And so enterprise can go in and out of fashion four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these companies, and it's OK, because we can stay the course. -- Marc Andreessen   Business in general Investing in high-growth private companies involves many of the same skill sets public market investors need to cultivate in order to succeed. The best venture capitalists think about business models, market economics, and competitive dynamics at a high level. Especially in the tech sector, where newly minted public companies often remain unprofitable, it's important for investors to remember that a path toward eventual profitability is an essential piece of any investing thesis, as Bill Gurley succinctly states in the two following quote: If one asserts that buying customers below what they charge them is a corporate strategy, this is in essence an arbitrage game, and arbitrage games rarely last. -- Bill Gurley  You can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't charging enough for the service level. -- Bill Gurley  A litany of examples come to mind, here. Companies like Zynga, Gluu Mobile, Skull Candy, and even Twitter have generated tremendous losses for their investors as the overly optimistic stories around which they came public predictably failed to materialize. If the company's economics don't make sense or don't seem achievable, that should be a major red flag, but it's one investors have consistently overlooked -- to their detriment. Also similar to investing in public companies, the leaders of the best start-ups resemble the entrepreneurs running the world's most successful public companies. Individuals like Tesla's Elon Musk or Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg have taken huge personal risks to bring their visions into the world. Further affirming this idea, leading venture capitalists also seek this visionary quality in the companies in which they invest. The very best entrepreneurs are relatively advantaged in times of scarce capital. They can raise money in any environment. Loose capital allows the less qualified to participate in each market. -- Bill Gurley  Innovation and technology Rounding out these quotes, venture capitalists live and die by identifying the companies that will define coming waves of disruption. As such, they spend a disproportionate amount of time thinking about the current and future state of technology. One of the key themes is that software will continue to automate and upend sections of the economy as Marc Andreessen candidly observes: Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not. -- Marc Andreessen   However, software isn't necessarily the only way we should understand technology either, as early Facebook investor Peter Thiel notes: The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of information technology in recent decades has made Silicon Valley the capital of "technology" in general. But there is no reason why technology should be limited to computers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology. -- Peter Thiel from Zero to One  Furthering this idea, famed VC John Doerr sees a truly game-changing investing opportunity in one largely undisrupted area of the economy: Green-tech could be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st Century. -- John Doerr  Spotting the next big thing is indeed hard work. However, as the world's most successful venture capitalists have demonstrated time and again, doing so is indeed possible. Similarly, investors in public market companies that follow this same line of reasoning can also do extremely well over the long term. Integrating these above ideas to your research process should certainly help increase your odds of successful investing.

He’s expanded the line to include adult sizes. By Anya Sostek / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Cameron Jones grew up loving cars, so he built a career selling them and eventually owning dealerships. He did not grow up loving incredibly-plush animal sleeping bags. But he’s now the inventor, proprietor and only full-time employee of a business selling them by the thousands. “We started out on… I don’t want to say a goof, but I had the time,” he said. “I wanted to see what would happen.” Four years ago, Mr. Jones found himself looking for a business opportunity. He had received an offer from Baierl for his Northland Ford dealership in Cranberry and decided to sell. The year before, he had closed his other dealership, Northland Lincoln. Shortly afterward, he visited a friend whose 10-year-old daughter was playing with a pink sleeping bag with a kitten head at the top. The 53-year-old Mr. Jones, who is married with no children, had just seen a television commercial for a product called a Stuffie — a stuffed animal with a multiple pockets for holding toys or other treasures. What if, he thought, he could make something like a giant Stuffie — so big that “kids could be able to stuff themselves in there” and use it as sleeping bag? “I was always an idea person — I always had ideas,” he said. “But I was always too busy working to be able to do it.” Through money, perseverance and luck, he was able to create and sell what he called a SnooZzoo — a child-size animal sleeping bag that can be also be worn as a backpack, with a coordinating pillow. But even he didn’t come up with the idea for what came next.  Once he started selling the kid version, he began getting numerous inquiries for larger sizes: “I’m not even a kid and I want this,” commented a Facebook reader. “Would a 69-inch person be too snug?” asked one Instagrammer. In one sense, the concept of a $170 adult-sized animal sleeping bag is strange. But in a time when gummy vitamins are advertised on network television, Lego sets are designed for ages 16-plus and Children’s Museums hold adult nights — it fits right in.  “Adults are sharing their life and their life stage with their kids,” said Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at the NPD Group, referencing products such as adult coloring books and footed pajamas. “They go to concerts together, they shop in the same stores — the generation gap that we grew up to think of is gone. Fifty-year-olds think of themselves as 15 and 18-year-olds think they’re 25.” An adult-sized SnooZzoo weighs 10 pounds, fits people up to 6-feet-tall and takes up most of a couch. It is soft on the outside, breathable and cool on the inside. Mr. Jones sold out of the adult black bear SnooZzoo within 30 days of it going on sale in October. The brown bear and panda are now sold out as well, with limited quantities left of the polar bear. He initially ordered 600 adult costumes and plans to add another animal and order more. He has also sold more than 2,000 of the children’s sized sleeping bags, which cost between $90 and $120. He does the packaging and shipping himself, with occasional help from his wife, who is an attorney. After housing all the materials in his Cranberry home, he recently bought a warehouse in Evans City. “It was a nightmare,” he laughed. “I couldn’t use my basement for two years.” From design to execution Mr. Jones wasn’t quite sure how to proceed when he initially came up with the sleeping bag idea. He ended up contacting a company called Laser Lab Shop, based in Point Breeze, which was able to design and manufacture a prototype. The company had never worked with “soft goods,” said owner Adam Murray, but he and designer Katie Schaible were able to come up with a prototype — part Snuggli, part stuffed animal, part mascot costume. “At the end of the day, design is for the most part design,” he said. “It’s just about the execution.” Mr. Jones then found a factory in China to manufacture the product (he’d hoped to have them made in America but the price point was too high) and decided on the name SnooZzoo as a combination of Snooze and Zoo. He credits the idea in part to his childhood love of animals — until he was 11 he lived in Australia, where his grandfather founded the country’s largest koala sanctuary. He grew up after that in Greensburg, getting a job selling Porshes and Toyotas in Monroeville after graduating from Duquesne University in 1985 with a business degree. By the fall of 2015, the SnooZzoos were ready for market and Mr. Jones had his sights on selling the product in the granddaddy of toy stores — Toys R Us. By cold calling and leaving countless answering machines messages, he was able to set up a meeting with a Toys R Us buyer in New Jersey. He stuffed two hockey bags full of SnooZzoos and drove to New Jersey, where he had hired two children who would meet him at Toys R Us to demonstrate the costumes. Two minutes into the meeting, the Toys R Us representative informed him that the sleeping bags were too big for store shelves. Mr. Jones asked if she could just see the costumes on the hired children. “I told her, ‘I just drove seven hours — give me a couple minutes.’” It worked — seeing the kids walk in wearing the sleeping bags as backpacks and then try them on bought him enough time to changed her mind. She decided to allow him sell them through Toys R Us online only. That connected him with a distributor for another retailers as well, such as Sears, Target and Walmart, which now sell SnooZzoos online.  Some of the market for SnooZzoos is among those who identify as furries, in part because they are much cheaper than custom-made fursuits that can run into the thousands of dollars. Mr. Jones has secured a spot to sell them at Anthrocon, an annual convention for cartoon animal enthusiasts. Mr. Jones markets his product almost exclusively through social media, including cheeky Facebook and Instagram captions such as “Happy ‘Fur’th of July” for polar bears holding American flags and “Purple Mane” for a bear in a purple lion wig to commemorate Prince’s death. Scott Zhivago of Airdrie, Canada, outside of Calgary, saw one of those Facebook posts — a picture of an adult-sized black bear SnooZzoo in a leather club chair holding a beer. Almost immediately, he clicked to buy it. “It looked like it would be awesome to snuggle up in and have some beer and it’s worked out exactly like that,” said Mr. Zhivago, 36, who owns his own electrical engineering consulting company. “I’m the envy of my friends, that’s for sure. It just gets funnier and funnier.” Anya Sostek: asostek@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1308.
